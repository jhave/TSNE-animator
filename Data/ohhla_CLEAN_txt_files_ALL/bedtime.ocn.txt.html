Song:   Bedtime Story
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Frank Ocean]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowin way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Chorus 1]
Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

[Frank Ocean]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left, I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

[Frank Ocean]
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I, love, youuuuuuuuuu {*2X*}</pre>
