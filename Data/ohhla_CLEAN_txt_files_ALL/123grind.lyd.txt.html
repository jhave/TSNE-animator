[Lloyd Banks]
Wordplay in the worst way
Earthquake, niggaz is shook, ash in my purp tray
20's on Benz day, Lincoln on Thursday
Highday, full fever leaving off the driveway
Cheeba got my mind grey, diva bottle entree
Cooler then a cooler, armed like a padre
Your baby momma dream about the God
I let her hit the button, fingers startin up the car
Style when I sleep, snicker when I hit the street
Graves pilin up, bodybuilder when I lift the beat
My weed sour, my bitches sweet
Marine style but my shit discrete, watch me make the flip repeat
I don't trick or treat, but so Halloween
+Michael Myers+ with the fire, trip holla scream
I gotta lotta cream, and a solid team
It's like I'm playin solitare, I don't see a challenge here
Yeah~!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Money movin on the dime; ready 1, 2, 3, grind
Uhh, niggaz better give me mine; about my funds, top down ready for the shine
Uhh, hettin to it so inline; I'm influenced by the gold, I can do it if I try
Uhh, I'ma get 'em every time; baby 1, 2, 3, grind

[Prodigy]
You know there's rules that you followin and tools get the hollow point
Poppin at these fools yeah these dudes get their narrow ass deceased
I terminate, unleash the pearly gate
Put that work in, then I spin like a 38
All around the world, back around the world twice
Fucking with the internat'sh, Infamous paradigm
Catch yo' bitch on the line at the concert, I'm
gon' take advantage of this opportune time
I'm the worst of the worst vultures - c'mon slime~!
You ain't never in yo' life livin life like mine
This is Grand Theft Audio, you just a petty crime
In my parade of hits, get confetti on my shine
You short like spaghetti, I'm harder than a whale dick
Clap a nigga real quick, fallin outta line like
One, two, three, they be droppin like dominoes
Vamanos, I'll show you how to die
It's career suicide, must be on that crack high
Coming at me diagonally, the fuck be on your mind
Fuck be on you niggaz brains, it seems you wish death
Yo Blue, these niggaz playin games with a profes'sh

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Big chain photo, still beamin when you see me
H.F.M. in 3D, hood beemin up off my CD
I'ma creep, do some foul shit every week
Fuck my shorty sister, left her lipstick all in my sheets
Stay low, I'm on that number shit, hit and bounce
Geah I'm lookin for a menage, they lookin for a sponsor
Opposite of bubblegum rap, I chew the track
All four of my pockets fat, Lincoln New York city rap
Brighter than my jewelery I'm in line with the stars
I'm from Mars, I'm back stackin Domino broads
Living large, you gon' need 500 bars
When we drive, make bougie bitches climb in the cars
Uhh~! Wheels peel the street off, Porsche came with the feet off
The haters still hatin, "It Ain't Hard to Tell" like he Nas
In need of defrost, brick cold and your shit old
Play with me get hospitaled and a wife widowed

[Chorus]</pre>
