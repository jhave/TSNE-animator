[Daz Dillinger] (Soopafly)
(A Soopafly/Daz production) Suckas!
How many real homeboys y'all got out there?
Can y'all count on one hand?... I can
Straight up, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Funky fresh in the flesh
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' bout
Yo Kurupt, kick that

[Kurupt]
I ain't shit without my homeboys, although at times it seems
Tryin' to make it to different stages, lifes and dreams
Different mistakes that was made during the time of the struggle
Two pits unleashed but held by one muzzle
It's complicated like a puzzle, puzzle pieces and money double
The royal rumble, fools really in trouble
I'ma hit the spot and snatch all the knots and pots
Then get ghost while the most of y'all get gots
to get the fuck outta here, ain't nobody else I can call
(Who that?) Besides my motherfuckin' doggs
I ain't shit without my homeboys

[Daz Dillinger]
When there's trouble who the fuck can you rely on
to die on onsite, me and niggaz do it wrong or right
I ignite the fire, marijuana gets me higher
All this drinkin' and smokin' really gettin' a nigga wired
Gettin' paid, that's my only desire
Big Style, Lil' Floss, Tray Deee and me
K-U-R-U-P-T, Soopafly and Crooked I
Until then, I hope God don't pass me by
Everyday I work harder to try
Never to fall but I hope to rise
Everyday before I open my eyes
To my cousin Big Flip locked down in the pen
To my other homeboys I won't ever see again
Life gone in the wind, like a lottery spin
When it comes down to it nigga who's ya foe and ya friend?
And I ain't shit without my homeboys

[Crooked I]
So what could make a crook stay down for his troop?
Could it be the gunshots we ducked as a youth, huh?
What about the cops we hid from on the roof
or the shootouts we survived without wearin' a bulletproof
We fruits from a tree that was rotten to the root
We wasn't 'posed to make it, our survival don't compute
I had to chase the paper 'cause the loot would run from me
We had Navigator dreams and only bus money
We rise and we fall together, all together
We crawl and we ball together, doggs forever
Like uh (and ya don't stop!)
Fuck around with one of the homies, watch the glock pop
One love and keep hollerin' back
We can split my last dollar in fact, pop your collar to that
Crooked I need the whole click
And like frozen chitlins, that's some cold shit
My nigga, some cold shit

[Soopafly]
Cold shit when you elevate and get into some more shit
When we ride together niggaz be like "Oh shit!"
Dogg Pound in the house rockin' the party, all night long
Gettin' high to the break of dawn
Chipped up like a cellular phone
Back up, watch it shine like chrome
Individually we the shit
But together we can't be fucked with, we crush shit
Never settle for less than the plush shit
But still don't forget when we was broke
About 9 or 10 locs with only one joint to smoke
Man, I can count on both hands the different stands
and plans niggaz took to make it better for the fam'
We made our first five grand, was like "god damn"
New khakis and Cortez
We learned the essential meaning of what a whore is
Still clockin' more biz
Always lookin' up 'cause if you look down you're fucked
Soopafly, Taylor'd up like Chuck's
But I ain't shit without my homeboys
And that's real shit

[Baby S]
I ain't shit without my homeboys... 
True thuggish Capone's, real niggaz I knew before I was grown
A lot of motherfuckers died, but I'ma still ride
And represent the evil motherfuckin' Westside
It ain't nothin' but trues, real niggaz who paid they dues
Picture me rollin' with gay dudes
Nigga please, we G's and dress like we serve ki's
On the block where we chop rock, re-cop and make G's
Down to die for each other, it's you and I for each other
In a gangsta matrimony we brothers
Can't nothin' seperate game, we game from initiation
Marks fuck around and catch heat sparks
Casino Gang's the gang that a motherfucker claim
Rump Segal, Lonnie Mack, E-Mack, it's you mayne
I ain't shit without my homeboys
