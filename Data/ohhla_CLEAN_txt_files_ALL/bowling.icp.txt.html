[Verse - Violent J]
Friends don't come easily and this I know
And every time I make one they always say they gotta go
I wanna talk with people and look 'em in the face
I wanna take 'em home and they can stay at my place
All the talking I could do, I would never lie to you
We take a quick ride, homicide, then I confide in you
And I can love you and technically even though you're dead
You'll always be around me because I'm keeping your head
I keep heads on shelves everywhere in my cellar
I even the melon of a dead fortune teller
The rotted ones I keep 'em up in fat pickle jars
And the new ones we lay on the lawn and look at the stars
It's illegal, I know, but so is smoking weed
And who the fuck give a fuck when you have a need?
I collect human heads fresh up off the neck
Face, lips, hair, nose, ears, gimme dat

Faces people know more than names
The hair is there and all the brains
Your head would mean so much to me..
Your head would mean so much to me..
(I won't dis you, you wanna wear a hat? what?
How you want your eyelids, open or shut?)
Your head would mean so much to me..
Your head would mean so much to me..

[Verse - Violent J]
Sometimes I put 'em in my bowling bag and bring 'em to work
Play with their hair under my desk, with my bare foot
They're like, stuffed animals all over the bed
Human heads: Pam, Jennifer, Hubert and Ted
I even put one in the shower water comes out the mouth
I kick a few around the yard when I feel like going out
I blow air in the mouth piece and duct tape it shut
Bring 'em in the pool, and the heads will float up
I'm not a sicko, yo, though I've had girlfriends
I even put their makeup on and take 'em for a spin
I'm ain't a murderer like that, not really
Only every Halloween the house do look kind of silly
You know the homeless people that be botherin' you for change?
Almost all of my collection, from them is where they came
I'm not insane about it, it's just the world is too crowded
And maybe I'ma do something a motherfuckin' 'bout it

I need some therapy to help me deal with this shit
Dr. Wigglefarmer, I need to make a visit
He told me heads are normal but I gotta brush their teeth
So now I'm brushing four mouths at a time using my feet
He also told me to keep them from the dog
But I already knew that, she chew their faces off
And then Dr. Wigglefarmer asked me for a couple
I went into my bag and gave him two like "no trouble"
Now I got some therapy I'm feeling much better
I'm happy forever, me and my cranium's together
They all over the house and they roll around the floor
And if it's got an afro, I use it for a pillow
I'm ill though, I never should've worried anyway
I shoot head hoops and don't care what people say
You can ask Dr. Wigglefarmer for yourself
He's the 3rd head down, top row, 3rd shelf
