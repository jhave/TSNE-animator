Intro] [Joe Budden talking]
They call it Slaughterhouse for a reason nigga
I hope this nigga can fight better than he can diss
Joey? Hahaha. Nigga fell for the trap
Whoa! I told y'all! Uh, Joey!
Nigga fell for the mouse trap
Nigga put cheese right on the mouse trap
You came right to it. Dick

La-la-Look
It's like a lose/lose already my rep ruined
How I beat dude we know will accept losing?
Me? Underachiever was an underachiever
Almost thought that you would come with the +Ether+
I know he got niggas in his camp like Spaz on him., gassin' him, bafflin' him
Real talk, some don't wanna see ya
Scram shoulda put both hands around ya neck
Said you better get ya head fucked from under the cleaver
I'm the one that'll beast ya
You got a gut feeling you hot, I think you can't stomach a fever
Can't think of why a wack nigga want it with me for
I leave my mark on you like it's one of ya features
Then ask how it feel to have Maino face
I'm way ahead man, this ain't no race
Stop playing, I'm the bomb with the pen
I'm more like a bomb with no pin
How the fuck is Saigon gonna win?
He a loss of interest
Talking bout my son is senseless
So I make sure the dude can't see, smell or hear
Can't touch, can't taste, now he defenseless
Cause ain't a bullet in this world he can bench press
Speak Tahiri, I'ma speak Austin
The one that'll suck ya dick if you flossin'
Game old bitch that everybody was tossin'
The one that you literally begged for that abortion
So we both gone wild
See we both love hoes and that's just our style
But Sai if you think it's different my nigga you goin senile
I just kiss mine and yours is the mother of ya child
BLAOW! Shots peel at ya entourage
Nigga couldn't get a deal on Entourage
So like, how is it harder to be me?
If I lose in real life? But you can't even win on TV
Me I'm probably iller
Polly with gorillas in ya lobby with the shottie and chinchillas
You a rapper or bodybuilder?
I'll have him in the E.R. 
With Doc tryin' to put him back together like a body builder
Please tell me why dude Just Blaze signed
Can't even get a bass line outta Baseline
Look at the new kid, soundin' stupid
Nigga I made Just more money than you did
The nerve of the loser
Keep trying to hide weak ass bars behind a working producer
In the word of computers, is he M.I.A.
Cause he been fell off like Yung Berg on the scooter
So him and his base flow need to lay low
Couple red lights will ruin his whole stage show
And put him on my payroll
How he's a Yardfather when I'm dictating where the grave go?
Been years, he's taking L's still
Turtle couldn't help him, maybe a shell will
Don't look like a winner to me
Small meal to a pitchfork, you lookin like a dinner to me
Plus ya diss track sound like a beginner to me
Ya whole shine's like a dimmer to me
Fight who nigga?
You better know how we get it in Jerz
Velcro his tongue, hope dude stick to his word
Nigga you'll be in an ally covered
And you don't love the kids
You just wanna make us think that you Sally Struthers
I'll pit you with the worse kind of men
Dudes who become everything they condemn
You'd think that jail learned him a lesson
Until he bragged bout everything he learned in jail
Nah, I don't think his struggle is lackin'
He did a long bid, came home and had trouble adapting
Afraid of adulthood, has trouble relaxin'
No choices, had to try his hustle with rappin'
Here's a jewel
Maybe you should put your first disc out on Amazon
Before you go frontin' when the camera on
And the poor fans kept the hope
But prison was the only place he was next to blow
So he calls me a fag like he homophobic
Cause they had him on his knees like Homo, hold it!
Run around, he screamin Oh don't poke it
It's a small world, how you think Joe don't know it?
Guess there's where the lies get deeper
Cause he went in a tight end and came out a wide receiver
There's bones in your closet that you can't hide
Your fans know you went to jail, me I know why
Sai, you ain't brolic enough
Somebody better play third wheel and try to stop the fuck
Cause I'll put it in 5th gear, like who he gonna threaten next?
Fill his whole body with metal, now he Weapon X
Had the upper hand from go
Shirt always off, How Does It Feel, D'Angelo 
To get naked like a down hooker?
My dudes outta town will book ya
Your whole gangsta's +Brown Sugar+
With no point to his vlog, had the world waiting
Flexing for ten minutes like he had a girl tape him
Just co-signed for you said you had a classic
Now he got no time for you, wrote you off on taxes
Now he lonely, vulnerable lookin' soft
Tried to help him, I been in his shoes, I just took em off
To put it simply, how could he offend me?
I can teach em how to live real major on an indie
So picture dude upsettin' me
Stop complaining and take control of your own fuckin' destiny
He blames radio, blames Atlantic
Craig Kallman, but I can't blame em they panicked
Nobody scared he's like hockey
Retired for a minute, came back and nobody cared
So for me to take this serious homes
Get Mook, Loaded Lux, Jin maybe Serius Jones
To help write your shit, make it brand anew
If not look for the Nation to Abandon you
Be mad at yourself and ask yourself
You know I'm a rap giant, why Plax yourself?
Dude went ahead, axed himself
He cut off his nose to spite his face, Mike Jacked himself
Bryan, how the fuck you think less of me?
When you easily the less MC
Thought it'd be fun but that's deaded to me
This point I'm battling my own perception 
Trying to beat what's expected of me
Nino Bless said you was a bull too
But I'm in wide screen, I ain't see that full view
I know how ya hoe ass felt
Make it so you can't eat, put an extra hole in that belt
Ain't a gain in site
Cocoa Chanel ain't the only nigga that'll put a +Pain In his Life+
Dead weight, get ya head straight
Cut the track off, listen to ya thoughts, checkmate</pre>
