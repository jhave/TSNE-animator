[Jay-Z]
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga who
Uh-huh uh-huh, jigga what
You gon' need a vocalin right?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers wanna act loco, hit 'em up, numerous
shots with the fo'-fo'
Faggots wanna talk to Po-Po's, smoke 'em like cocoa
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshittin, glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin shocked when the bullet hit
Hey ma, how you, know niggaz wanna buy you
But see me I wanna "Fuck for Free" like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight get the K-Y Jelly
All night get you wide up inside the telly
Side to side, til you say Jay-Z you're too much for me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am, a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everybody can see these scars
I am, what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Vese 3: Jay-Z]
Got a condo with nothin but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin a Tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Niggaz hatin the shit cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're, actin raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your hoe
Now she's mad at me, causer Your Majesty, just happened to be
A pimp, what a tragedy
She wanted, us to end, cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in, I said, "Shit.
there's a draft, shut the door bitch and come on in!"

[Verse 4: Mike Shinoda]
I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
Cuz you don't understand I do what I can
Sometimes I don't make sense
I am, what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I, let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
You face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here cause you're all that I've got

[Chester Bennington]
I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal, this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel, the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal, this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't tell
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored</pre>
