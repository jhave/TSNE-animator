[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
'Ey to you it don't matter cause you still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride wit' me
I say you're still gon' ride wit' me
I know you're still gon' ride wit' me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a, nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a right brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that couldn't ever worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorised her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Yah, y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be a parr man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do they make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
'Ey Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
'Ey to you it don't matter cause you still gon' ride wit' me
You're still gon' ride wit' me
I say you're still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real World filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the World on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this World got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had to break on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me

[Chorus]

'Ey baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
'Ey to you it don't matter cause you still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you're still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live

Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an Angel on my pain
You have appeared to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, Ugh, still I wanna worry
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man

[Chorus]

'Ey baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if te money been slow
'Ey to you it don't matter cause you still gon' ride wit' me
You're still gon' ride wit' me
I say you're still gon' ride wit' me
I know you're still gon' ride wit' me, hey
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star</pre>
