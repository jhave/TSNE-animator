[Intro]
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream
I'm high maintenance and so is my team
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream

[Chorus]
A hundred-thousand in these Red Monkey Jeans
So fresh, I'm so clean
I'm high maintenance and so is my team
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream

[Verse 1]
Mary Jane use to be my main
'til I met the white girl: cocaine
Every little thang that she done fucked with came
'caine was that thang, she brought me my fame
In '96, she gave me my name: "L-O, L-O!"
Yeah, I got it for the L-O
It ain't hard to find, still posted in the ghetto
Holla at your boy, save your money like Geico

[Chorus (2x)]
A hundred-thousand in these Red Monkey Jeans
So fresh, I'm so clean
I'm high maintenance and so is my team
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream

[Verse 2]
My rap now got the trap on hold
Unless you want to hold, you can see my fold
What I get for a hold, I make more for a show
So I'm out on the road travelin', livin' the globe
Yah know!
Yeah!
I stay connected like a magnet
So holler at me, you know what's happenin'
I get 'em wrapped, duct taped, and plastic
Give 'em to my partners let 'em work they magic
Call 'em in the Arch, whip game I mastered
I'm a boss, got D-boy habits
Black, red, and white way before this rap shit
So fuck a deal I'm addicted to trappin'

[Chorus (2x)]
A hundred-thousand in these Red Monkey Jeans
So fresh, I'm so clean
I'm high maintenance and so is my team
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream

[Verse 3]
Gettin' money man it's nothing to me
Bankhead boy, how I love this street
Play if you want, this is how we eat
Keep one eye open we don't get no sleep
To all them dead homies: "R.I.P."
To all them homies locked up: "Wish you were free."
And I'ma keep reppin' 'til they get in to me
One-hundred... I am a G

[Chorus (2x)]
A hundred-thousand in these Red Monkey Jeans
So fresh, I'm so clean
I'm high maintenance and so is my team
I'm a broke hoe's dream, rich hoe's cream</pre>
