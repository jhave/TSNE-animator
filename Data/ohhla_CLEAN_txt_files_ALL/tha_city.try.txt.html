[Pastor Troy]
Venom, all I spit is venom, a cobra
Flinch my teeth and I'ma ride till its over
I'm never sober, I'm fucked up now
Say you want pistol play, well then its Blah! Blah!
Cause I'm the Pastor leader of a wicked church
Get ta busting out in public, gives a fuck who I hurt
Them hits was weak for the 2 triple O
Bitch ask me if I got your CD, ah naw hoe
Cause I am not from the city of bullshitting
As soon as we come its time for wig splitting
Your debt is bitten, I want undivided attention
You say you pimping, I send my niggaz for the lynching
Drenching your blood, God forgive 'em but we have sinned
Them Georgia boys, when we come we come like men
Fresh out of pen, I'm standing dead off in da' blaze
With a fifth of remy pulling the pin out my grenade
(Get paid!)

[Chorus]

{2X} I come from tha city that deh' don't play by rules
I come from the city tha deh' ride on fucking fools

{4X} A this tha city, this tha city, this tha city (Well Uh-huh)

[Pastor Troy]
Okay I come from the city, if you lame its going to be ugly
A bunch of niggaz biting my game but they can't touch me
I don't drink bubbly, I'm drinking remy out the bottle
Bout 5 Benz follow, my city is off the throttle
I heard you hard, heard you the one that crunk the style
Don't drop your card, I got the lowest in the pile
You cracking smiles, we cracking mugs selling drugs
We what hoes love, ATL fucking thugs
Its real boy, you know the his-tory
Mac 10's popping high ca-pa-city
My whole team praying that you make some noise
So we can introduce you to them big boys, yeah
I got killers doing time as I speak to you
Then some mo' in the streets right next to you
And fore you can say Troy it wasn't me cuz
I'ma hit you wit the whole 63 cuz
You see a bitch slap a bitch oh' really
See you a fucking joker and I'm not fucking tickled
When blood trickle, that's me up out the F-350
Ya feet best of be kicking ya ass a damn skippy
In my city ain't no games, we learn your name
And where you went to school at, and where you used to hang
And when I run across ya is where I'm going to drop ya
Breaking your punk ass off something proper

[Chorus]

{2X} I come from tha city that deh' don't play by rules
I come from the city tha deh' ride a fucking fool

{13X to fade} Well this tha city, this tha city, this tha city</pre>
