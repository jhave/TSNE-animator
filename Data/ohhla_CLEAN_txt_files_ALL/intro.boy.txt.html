[Frayser Boy]
(*Bay Area*) I'm purple kush smoker (smoker), an x-pill popper (popper)
A big whip driver (driver), a bad bitch knocker (yeeeah)
Let me show 'em what it is (look)
Let me show 'em how I live
I'm from the streets
And nigga, I don't accept defeat (naw)
(*Bay Area*) Hey let me talk to 'em nigga, with this voice of mine
Frayser Boy (Boy), stick a nigga like a porcupine
Hey, what's happening nigga?, want some action nigga? (*Bay Area*)
If you with it then I'm with it, make it happen nigga
Memphis rappers don't like it cause I'm with the Six
I'm a brain-bright nigga and I'm with the shit
Yeah, you know who I am, yeah, you know what I'm about
We Acadamy Award niggaz running the south  (fades running the south until end)</pre>
