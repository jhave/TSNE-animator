(talking)
Yeah, it's Lil' Flip, Seville
KnowI'msaying, we gone do
This for the girls though huh

[Seville]
You wanna F-L-I-P with S-E
L-I-F-E, Flip with Seville tonight - 2x

[Lil' Flip]
You ain't got to stereotype me because I'm a rapper
Cause after every show I be on another chapter
Not running to them hoes, but I'm running to my do'
Cause when I make money I don't shine, I just glow
If I don't work, then I don't eat
So I'm not tricking cause I'm looking for the treats
And if you play it right girl we could take it far
How bout walking in the park, rolling in my Jaguar

(Chorus: Seville)
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight

[Lil' Flip]
I wonder if I broke both arms would you right a flow for me
If a girl scratched my car would, you fight a hoe for me
Go out of town and go get the dough for me
If I can't buy weed, would you grow for me
If I go to jail will you come and get me out
If a nigga got tickets, would you go and set it off
I don't know but I'ma find out, that's what I wanna know
Cause I'm looking for a girl, I'm not looking for a hoe
Everyday I got a show, but I don't fuck around
And a nigga making money as soon as I touch the town
I'm a million dollar star, with a million dollar car
We could get in the jacuzzi and blow a cigar
With some hash in it, six car garage with some Jags in it
Nigga got a trunk, and I got ten bags in it
Went to buy some Gucci and some Prada
And niggas know I'm a leader Lil' Flip will never follow, holla

(Chorus)

[Lil' Flip]
I was lying, about taking a walk in the park
But girl I got some weed, where's the lighter let's spark
I'll tell you bout me, you tell me about you
And if you play it right I might start calling you boo
Got to cook for a nigga, write a hook for a nigga
If you say the law's coming, then look for a nigga
Cause a nigga need a gal, who's a ride or die chick
Excuse my french, I need a ride or die bitch

[Seville]
All I want to do is come, inside 
Girl tonight I wanna make you feel alright
Ooh baby girl you feel so tight tonight
I like, I like, I like
All I want to do is come, inside 
Girl tonight I wanna make you feel alright
Ooh baby girl you feel so tight tonight

I liiiike, the waaaaaay you feel, tonight - 2x</pre>
