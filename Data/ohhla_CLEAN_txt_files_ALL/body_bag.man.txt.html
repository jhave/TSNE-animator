And let the, and let the games begin DAYTON FAMILY 2004
From the motherfuckin Dayton Family
And that nigga Prozak

(Shoestring)
Murder is my hobby aint never murdered sloppy
You fuckin with us then we'll be baggin up your body
The hand that rocked the cradle will stab a nigga fatal
I bust a shot and left a nigga in the table
Chase you through the castle I'll hang you like a lasso
Whip out the guage on his ass I don't wrestle
Bodies they be fallin killas they be brawlin
Niggas comin big I'm choppin em down til they crawlin
Put you in a body bag hit you with the .44 mag
I'll stretch you out and watch a motherfucker choke and gag
What the fuck you thought this was nigga I aint gotta lie
Whoever crossesv Shoestring and Prozak ,them bitches die
Niggas know we gutted out all them hoes we runnin out
They tried to hide but them bitches they get hunted out
Aint nobody runnin up bodies steady turnin up
And those snitches from your hood they was burnin up

Body bag fuck all you bitches you all die
For fuckin with that gangsta when he high
You'll be leavin in a body bag, Dayton Ave Gorillas
Murder for skrilla fuck any nigga
Bring that bitch a Body bag when I come I bring terror
Runny mascara fuck em all it's our era
Get a body bag don't cross us or die slow
I'll put those niggas from your hood in a body bag

(Prozak)
You better believe that shit is wicked and self inflicted
.45 automatic to your dome and now you uplifted
I got the glocks cocked and Bootleg got the buckshot
And Shoestring with the 12 guage put your ass in the grave plot
With blood clots and gun shots the church bells be ringin
I'm out of my mind I'm out of control and my head just keeps spinning and uh
I know I'll pay someday but fuck it anyway
I'm homicidal and my thoughts be full of disaray
I'm takin it to another level of midwest style
We drinkin the redruM while ya'll be sippin crystal
Pathetic how motherfuckers out there be dissin
I stare at my reflection in a pool of blood glisten
So listen close to the words that I prophesize
A victim of genocide, get lost in a killas eyes
It's Prozak and The TDF bitch you mad at me?
Whats on my mind is a motherfuckin Shootin spree

Body bag fuck all you bitches you all die
For fuckin with that gangsta when he high
You'll be leavin in a body bag Dayton Ave Gorillas
Murder for skrilla fuck any nigga
Bring that bitch a Body bag when I come I bring terror
Runny mascara fuck em all it's our era
Get a body bag don't cross us or die slow
I'll put those niggas from your hood in a body bag

(Bootleg)
Motherfuck the gimmick I get mine how I live it
Rushin to get it I cut through the middle like Emmit
I'm in it to win it never drop the ball in the scrimage
Local Denis the menace set the world on fire when I finish
Too late for repentance facin this natural life sentance
Murder 1, for bustin at bitches with my handgun
Prozak, told me bust back, and ask questions later
Thats why I'm screaming fuck em' leaning out the Navigator
Since I was 14 years old I been out of control
The rental smash them bitches into telephone polls
And I'm a natural born ghetto boy refusin to perp
Fuck school, fuck curfew, fuck homework
I'm out my mind and I stay high until the sun go down
Homicide to suicide they make the world go round
So ask your motherfuckin Mammy did I hurt her
What's on my mind it's a motherfuckin murder nigga

Body bag fuck all you bitches you all die
For fuckin with that gangsta when he high
You'll be leavin in a body bag Dayton Ave Gorillas
Murder for skrilla fuck any nigga
Bring that bitch a Body bag when I come I bring terror
Runny mascara fuck em all it's our era
Get a body bag don't cross us or die slow
I'll put those niggas from your hood in a body bag</pre>
