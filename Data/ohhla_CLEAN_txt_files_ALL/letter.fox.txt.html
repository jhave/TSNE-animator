  *shimmering memories.. up in the studio gettin low*
  *listening... it's the realest shit I've ever wrote*
This is a letter
From Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby

[Foxy Brown]
Dear Mommy, I apologize  
I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized (and)
it's cause of me that at times you wanna die
But you was always there when your little Na Na cried (and)
When the media said Foxy's ill  
You was there when this fame almost got me killed
When I was in the hospital, could not be still
Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills
And to my friends I love them and I know they care
But, time after time, you was always there
When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch
I was wailin, while you prayed for me hopin I'll stop
Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth
And I'm sorry for the times when I yelled at you
I love you mommy, sorry that's happened
Please pass the letter to Gavin

This is a letter
From Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby
Ah yea oh oh oh yea..

[Foxy Brown]
Gavin, dang, where do I start
You knew it all, you was there from the start
My cold deed the ear to my heart
Just writing this tears me apart (see)
Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal
Brought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel
I wanted you to know that I did it for us
And I wanted you to know I was committed to us
And of course the long way, we had our disputes
You didn't care for some of the things that I would do
But you still watched my back, complete and the same
You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game (see)
Whether I'm here, or dead in a box
Keep my name alive, you know no bitch is better than Fox
I love you, tell ma I'll never forget her
Let Ant read the rest of the letter

This is a letter
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby
Ohhh I love you yeaaah

[Foxy Brown]
Anton, don't let this letter get you down
Dagg, I hope I didn't let you down
I made my mistakes
I was young in the mind
But you gotta admit, I was one of a kind
Remember Miami when you fought my man
Can't imagine how mentally lost I am (*memories*)
Never knew life could be so painful
Tell daddy I love him, and I'm still his little angel
I'm all cried out, I feel like I wanna go
Can't take this no more
I want my life like it was before
My life so raw
Love you Ant but I can't write no more

[Ron Isley]
Ohhh come on come back home
Memories, Memories..
Ohh I'm so sorry
I want my lover
Yeaaa this is my letter
To my mother,
and my brothers,
and my baby
My my my baby
Please, listen
Listen to me
Oh somebody listen
Listen to me
Come on home
Rarararararara
Memories...
Oh I love my mother
And my brother
But what about my baby
Oh my baby
Listen to me listen
Keep the family
Come back home to me
Oooohhhh... My letter
My letter..
Listen....</pre>
