SAY GAL!  You're lookin like you really want.. want..

Cause nowadays a most dem gal a dressin like a slut
SAY GAL!  A woman must, respect herself
SAY GAL!  So leave the see-through dress upon the shelf

Because you're creepin and you're sleepin with the stardom
First you do the nasty, then he raped me
You're sleepin and you're CREEPIN with the stardom
First you do the nasty, then he raped me

But if me rush up an' feel your body

You're creepin and you're SLEEPIN with the stardom
First you do the nasty, then he raped me
