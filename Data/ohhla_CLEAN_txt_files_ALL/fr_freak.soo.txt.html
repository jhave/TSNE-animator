It's soopafly yall, dunking quit with the rhymes yall
Everybody know I do it a long time yall
Im nice, im so nice I walk like christ
With my pimping so smooth thinking im skating on ice
Tell you one time come back and shoot you twice
Nigga name your price, I freak your wife
I walk away pimp strutting with the shit in you love it
Attitude don't give a fuck push and shoving
Turn you home baby because I act so crazy
Having tossed with a feud with my lady
Treat a bitch like a Whodini and make the freak come out
Got evicted for days what you talking about
You know im down for getting laid and I love your figure
You getting clothes, but it is paid by some other nigga
Its cool you know Soopafly got something bigga
You know I have you going off like a trigga
One bitch is all I need, But having two hoes is like having cash and weed
Don't be mad because a nigga wont speak
Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Yall, Yall)
I play a bitch like playing a dozen
If I cant freak the hoe I passed down to my cousin
Its the proper dime from making something to nothing
Fuck the other shit we get it to love it
Why do you think you the shit
Knowing you couldn't even pay my rent
Baby girl it's like a pimp thang
Soopafly quick to get in thangs
Aint in to nothing but slanging them thangs
Who could ever rock crowd no doubt
Its what Soopafly do when the day show out
Yea, I know I shine you like chrome
Armor all mother fuckers in my pimped out room
I say I do anything for you, Now you know that aint true
I pimping the bitch so hard,  I make her sleep in the yard
I aint playing one hoe with bomb

[Soopafly Hook] 
They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need
But having two hoes like ash and weed
Don't be mad because a nigga don't want to speak
Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Yall, Yall, Yall)
They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need
But having two hoes like ash and weed
Don't be mad because a nigga aint weak
Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Yall, Yall, Yall)

[Soopafly Chorus 3x]
Freak, Freak (Yall, Yall, Yall)  

[Soopafly]
Check it out im working down the shadrach
Me shack when been to go 
Baby you could come with ugly friend and go 
Im being blunt aint nobody going to hit that yo
Its like dead weight and I hate to roll
Plus its the freak, freak looking for something unique
Putting in pass and put her to sleep 
I been around to get down 
Cover ground on the way to your town
Still represent that would say I'll be back to tomorrow
Oh Yea, Took your man's watch you aint got to know
Put the money on the table baby we can make dough
Im coming out like Dianna Ross until my paper show, Silly Hoe

[Soopafly Hook] 
They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need
But having two hoes like ash and weed
Don't be mad because a nigga don't want to speak
Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Yall, Yall, Yall)
