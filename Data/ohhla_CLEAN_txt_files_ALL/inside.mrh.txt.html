[Prodigy]
First of all we the one and only
Infamous and Mary Blige
Coming straight, ghetto poetry
And ain't nothing changed but the size of the money
I'm still that same 'g'
Can you say the same thing?

[Havoc]
Must be blind to the fact Mary Queen on the wax
We the kings on the streets
Ain't know where your heart at, look inside 
And you'll find a entertainer, one of a kind
That's way ahead of her time
Take a look

[Mary]
Oh I need to know
If you can get into my mind
Stimulate it
Give me good love all the time
Or are you just another man
Who's after me for all my paper
Looking for a ride that's free

1 -	[Mary]
	Deep inside I wish you'd see
	That I'm just plain old Mary
	Deep inside I wish you'd see
	That I'm just plain old, plain old Mary J. Blige

[Mary]
Now you see for seven years I lived life openly
So it's hard to find someone who really knows me
So I say these things just so that you can know
That you can't be with me
If you're trying to change my flow

[Mary]
Now if you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

Repeat 1

[Prodigy]
Let's separate the bullshit from the truth
Straight up, I ain't got time for new friends, I need paper 
We came up from the trenches
It was like pulling teeth without sedation
From the benches to the Bentley seats
Nigga, we the M-O-B-B
What, you ain't heard? You can't see?
Ever since the cash they wanna hound P
Oh now you got L-O-V-E for me

[Havoc]
Doing this for about a decade Mobb and Mary
Troopers in the game with a heavy load to carry
After all the trials and tribulations
Rumors we faced, the media invading our space
That's the price you gotta pay
Take away by signs of whips
I'mma just plain old me at the end of the day
You can say what you choose
God gonna see me through
Criticize all you want 'till your face turn blue
I know you see

[Mary]
If you take away the house
And you take away the clothes I wear
And you take away the diamonds
I'mma still be standing here
And if you take away the voice and the money
I will always be my nigga's favorite honey
And if you take away the car I drive
I'mma still be Mary Blige

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
