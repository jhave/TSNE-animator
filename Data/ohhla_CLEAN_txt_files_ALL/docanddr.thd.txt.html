Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

Yo Dre let's kick it on the one, black, and we don't stop
Making records that people are cold checking and respecting and
It rocks, the sales won't stop, those of the Doctor...

And I'm the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all, pumping it yes y'all
D.O.C. on the set we're kicking fresh y'all
Letting the bass G-O and full with soul so I can wait
Leaving the rest to DJ Dr. Dre

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

When I hear a bass drum
I gotta get dumb, but some
Think it's a fable and label me not able to come
Correct, so I cold jet back to my room
And invent something to compliment the boom
Of a kick, cause I want it all like in Monopoly
The great make not a mistake, make sure it's properly done
Strictly for public satisfaction
So you're in awe when I'm in action
Cause all we do, from me to you, is a song
Strong, bump intention tumping system is born
I deliver, somthing to shiver you peak level
And if you want it deep, yo Dre go get a shovel
And you're bumping, your speakers rattle
This is all over the world, but without a saddle
Light the twice, I hype the mic, make it dumb
And Dre is the engineer, but I'm the drum

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

I want you to turn up the radio, listen to the lyrics
And I let the bass go so you can hear it
Bumping, your speakers are thumping, dig it, yeah you like it
You know the album?  Get it
And I'll keep producing and inducing
A rhythm with a style that makes you get loose and
Sweat, cause I'm as good as you've gotten yet
Some said they can handle, you wanna bet?
And I don't understand the misconseption
Think that if you make it, you go in one direction
When you're in flight, yo, you gotta fly high
So you were born, so you die
It's all evolution, here's the rule
Evolve, my meaning, enroll in a new school
Adn learn the tricks that makes the mix dumb
Then be certain to keep suckers hurting when it comes to a drum

It's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

Yo! And now your eardrums are cold full of the big beat
But you're attatched, like ankles are to feet
So you listen, and as it play you pump it louder
But to your speakers you're sparking some gunpowder
Check it for a second, listen and behold the
Great as I open your mind like a folder
Down with the science, I'm rocking like a musical
So when you're listening, you're seeing me and
Dre cold sweating cause you know we're like striving
For number 1, not number 4 and number 5 and
Nothing can mean more than to make it last a lifetime
In the middle of his mix and my rhyme
Never been in need now that Dre is on the cut
You may think I speak of music but I dream of coming up
Rolling to the homies in the city getting dumb
The sound of the D-O to the C and the drum

Yo, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all
Dre, drop it, it's the diggy diggy D.O.C. y'all

Is that a yes y'all? (Repeat 4x)

Fresh, for those that know, peace</pre>
