[P.O.S.]
I'm trying not to slip, been trying not to lose footing
Loose land keeps that pressure on my kicks
But when I fall I tend to land like a ton of bricks
Stand like a man made of concrete and sediment
Like fuck your skin, nobody needs it
There's bones, muscle and blood, what's realer than fat and tendons?
It's raw, no soft tissue to draw your eyes to it
So far flesh ain't the truest at all, let's rip into it
We all sick of the missed shots
Passed over like the last man picked, no team, so pissed off
That's not honesty, that's just soft curves
Got your world flipped, got you making mixtapes for girls
And that's the skin again, let's blame the skin again
Stretching itself so fluidly over these awkward ligaments
And I didn't shave today, I probably won't tomorrow
When it's safe to say I'm never gonna shed these extra... yeah so

[Chorus 1]
Fuck it, back to the wall
Crush it, laugh at 'em all
Hush, let 'em try to find the beauty in your face
Yeah, something more than a song
Hating? Aww come on
Dust, let 'em try to find the beauty in the bass line

[Chorus 2] {2X}
Aww, but when the words don't change
We don't sing with what will fade away
Yeah, we do our own damn thing
We don't blink at what tomorrow might bring at all

[P.O.S.]
In us we trust, no rush for bucks
No sweat, just enough, them words from love
No hits, I let the track stand
Like how it was written is how it hit me
or road cycle kids with the grip to skid fixies
A rogue wild kid with a stroll that let it roll like whatever
Huh... they kick that gingivitis, them rappers got the itis
Catch me bumping Isis in a crisis
Instead of watching y'all count and lead sheep at the same time
What's the science of that?
I know that [shit] is sweet, but where the movement is at?
We in that coma capital, spotless home team
with hands steadily purexed but never quite clean
Bloody as hell, rarely will I care... for that haha
I don't know man... me and Joe like real shit

[Chorus 1]
