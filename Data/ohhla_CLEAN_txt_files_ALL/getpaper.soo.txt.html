[Soopafly]
I'm sorry I left you
Without a real nigga to step to
Niggaz, I know it's been to long, I
was wrong, for leavin' y'all without somethin' fly
Yeah, and that's Soopafly
I'm on the mash tryin' to get money
I took a break 'cause the game got funny
In the Cut' wrapped tight like a chokehold
Pimp struttin', got hoes by the boat load
I'm like Cortez for the cholos
Huh, I'm too gangsta, with it
Niggaz can't fuck with me, stop it, quit it
God damnit I'm great
Left hip got the hammer, I'm straight
I don't think you want no problems
In the land of beasts, monsters, goblins
I'm a class act pimp
Hoes look at me and sing that's that shit
West Coast gangsta mack, that's that pimp
With that rat-a-tat hoe I got a crack back flow

[Chorus]
And I'm bangin' that West until I die
G'd up and I'm givin 'em somethin' fly
Cause some of y'all niggaz ain't keepin' it G
The rest of y'all keepin' it gangsta
(Smoke weed, get drunk, fuck one-time)
West Coast nigga (Throwin' up the dub sign)
And none of y'all niggaz ain't bumpin' with me
You might as well get your paper

[Soopafly]
Up, before you get laid down
With ya ass up, face down
I'm a triple threat, I got the world like Stevie
Y'all ain't seen nothin' yet
I shut a nigga up like strep throat
Dip 'em while I bump that West Coast
Now that's gangbang music
Strapped up with your thang-thang music
What you hear is not a test
You are now rockin' with the West
Check the files, the streets know
I'm always where my heat go
Infra' on your spot, I'm playin' non chalant
A fantasy game this is not
So don't move too fast, if you gotta shoot blast
Watch your aim and pick your shots (where you from?)
I'm a Long Beach nigga, where harm meets nigga
Back slappin' whoever's in arms reach nigga
Pimpin', baby, the boulevard all street nigga
Hot handed Taliban always in my palm heat nigga

[Chorus]
And I'm bangin' that West until I die
G'd up and I'm givin 'em somethin' fly
Cause some of y'all niggaz ain't keepin' it G
The rest of y'all keepin' it gangsta
(Smoke weed, get drunk, fuck one-time)
West Coast nigga (Throwin' up the dub sign)
And none of y'all niggaz ain't bumpin' with me
You might as well get your paper

[Daz Dillinger]
W-W-W-W-W-W-West Coast
Tell me y'all who rockin' the most
Let me here you say (hell yeah!)
I'm a professional
I'm freshly most from head to toe
On D.P., I let you and yours know
I ain't never left I ain't never goin' nowhere
They yellin' (oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
And I'm bangin' that West until I die
G'd up and I'm givin 'em somethin' fly
Cause some of y'all niggaz ain't keepin' it G
The rest of y'all keepin' it gangsta
(Smoke weed, get drunk, fuck one-time)
West Coast nigga (Throwin' up the dub sign)
And none of y'all niggaz ain't bumpin' with me
You might as well get your paper

[Outro: Daz Dillinger]
Yeah, Soopafly, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Yeah, better get ya paper
Get ya paper, get ya paper
Cause none of y'all out there keepin' it G</pre>
