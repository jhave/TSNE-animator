Song:   No I'm Not Dat Nigga
Typed by: Juicy666J@aol.com

(Chorus) x2
No I'm not that nigga that be hugged up with you, but 
I'm tha one walkin away 
With your mouth on my nuts

(Juicy J)
Let's take a trip to east high
And talk about a bitch
Who claims she's a model
But I think I heard she suckin dick
Always talkin bout what she can and gonna do
But I prefer the freaky bitch to lay me down and chill
If a nigga see you in a hallway they all say
Put the hoe out the house out the way 
Juicy J is the type a nigga that your hoes don't wanna dis
White Haven target bitch
Take a sip of my piss
And to that other stupid bitch that go to Ferly 
With the natural curly 
Who was and giving non of that burly
Come to my crib and maybe yet you can come to the hideout 
And let a nigga fuck it inside
(I gotta) Come in my shorts 
Dog with gold fangs in the strip 
Searching for a girl who works at Captain Dee's 
Talkin shit who said I did nothin for her mayn
You's a fuckin slut 
I'm not that nigga that be wit cha all hugged up
Bitch

(Chorus)

(Juicy J)
Freaky thing to these hoe's 
Think they cold
Gold diggers
Always on a niggaz nuts
Always try to juice a nigga 
(Buy me this, Buy me that)
Bitch I can't buy you jack
But I got these 
For a broom and some Jimmy hats
If you wanna play around and tease 
I don't want the cat
Dropped her off 
Called up another fuckin hood rat
This is the girl 
My nigga said had a deadly fight
Lights took them drunk 
As the skunk comes out at night
Creepin through Cherokee
Real slow low key
Standin in the driveway
Now its time for a nigga like me 
To get the bitch to do me up
Chew me up
Real sweet 
Slob on the knob
You niggaz know the master piece
Once again 
On the hoe stroll
Tryin to lay hoe
To a stupid dike lookin bitch
23 years old
Working at Sam's Type Casino
Maybe lady luck
But I'm not that nigga that be with you all huged up

(Chorus) Till Fade</pre>
