Typed by: travisw@bellsouth.net

Heat it up when this shit drop {*2X*}
Bubba Sparxxx, Collipark

[Chorus]
Heat it up when this shit drop
In them big spots
Where the players let them bottles pop
See the steam on her back when her hips pop
She get it real hot, so heat it up girl
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there {*4X*}

[Verse 1]
What it is, how are things
My phone was on silent for a minute now it rings
If you too cool, then I'm too cool
Let's not boo-who, let's just do what we do
Movin on, new song, new loan
Sometimes you can move right and still do wrong
Aint nothin' fancy, just line up and run it
By the time you've finished talkin' bout it, I'll be done done it
Collipark, Bubba Sparxxx
Do the Ying-Yang thang or anythang, I'm just a star
Ms. New Booty, thank you ma'am
Bottom broad brought me back, dawg this money changing hands
A lot this way, a little thattaway
Earn Sunday through Friday, spend on Saturday
Yeah that's the play, get it up and keep it up there
Heat it up slow, let him quickly beat it up, Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
What it is, tell me the good news
I got a tool in my draws that you should use
Give that thang a good bruise, beat it on up
Girl you've been misused, heat it on up
I'm gone show you, what it was made for
Actin' like you scared and unprepared, but you ain't though
Grab your ankles, yeah that's the angle
I'm gone make a stank hoe of daddy's little angel
I'm at the condo, with General Patton
Losers make excuses, winners make it happen
We can pull the rides out, give you somethin to cry about
Give you somethin to lie about, inspiration while you pout
We can pull the broads out, in a straight line
Yours ain't fine fuck it, here, take mines
Dude you way behind, get on Bubba K. time
I'm lightyears ahead, have a light beer instead, yeah

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
