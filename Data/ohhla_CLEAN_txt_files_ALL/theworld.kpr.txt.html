(Chorus) Priest
What we're living in
What we use to
The whole damn world
What we're living in
What we're living in
What we're living in
The whole damn world
What we're living in
What we're living in
What we're living in
The whole damn world
What we're living in
What we're living in
What we're living in
The whole damn world
What we're living in
What we're living in
What we're living in
The whole damn world
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in
Yes we're living in

[Killah Priest]
(So what we live by?)
The laws of the most high
(Moses?) Yes!
He received that on Mount Sinai
(For the Israelites right?)
Indeed, 'cause man once believed in other Gods
They received the sun, moon and stars
(From the Egyptians?)
Yeah they were enslaved over there
For over 400 years of hard labor and tears
What a coincidence (Almost the same time?)
Yep! Black people had spent over here
Which brings me to this important fact
The ancient Israelites were black!
(If we keep his laws and study his commandments
We can chase the devil right off of our planet
If we don't lie, hate or kill one another
Boys obey your fathers, girls obey your mother)
And this is law

Sing along children
Sing along
Priest!

(Now there's Cain)
Who killed Abel over jealousy
And this been going on for centuries
(So who is he?)
Your Condoleezza's, your Oprah Winfrey's
(And who is that?)
Michael Jordan, your Muhammad Ali's
(Tell us more about Esau)
And Jacob, sure
Want to hear more? (Yeah!)
Well they were twins in Rebekah's womb
And they were fighting
(Fighting for what?) For more room
I guess, so she suggest, she should ask the Lord
So she prayed, while her husband Jacob snored
And she was told: "These two kids should be two nations
From the womb they shall be separated
The one shall be stronger then the other
(But they were brothers)
And one loved by the father
The other by the mother"
And look deep in the story you will discover
(The mysteries)
The first kid was hairy and red; he was a hunter
Sold his birth right because of hunger
The second child was a cool peaceful brother
His skin resemble his father and mother
Nutting more to explain
Let's say later on in the chapters their names changed
And nothing ever stays the same
Good night!

(Priest talking)
Dedicated to one of the greatest emcees ever
Slick Rick; I love you brother
(Hosea 4, Verse 6)
I'm out, G-Sciples
Good night!
(Read Hosea 4, Verse 6)
