Feels better if I tell em my story

Yo, on November 24th, 1999
I was in L.A., and I was in the kitchen cookin
And I got this page right
And uh, I called back and I was informed that
My father had passed away from a herion overdose
About two hour's earlier
So this song is for him, and to him
And for all the fatherless children in the world
The mother's who raised us, the people who love us

[Verse 1]
It's a Monday, finally found the perfect beat
To speak my peace on how I came to be
The way I was raised, how I was born
Why I smile so sad, and have the eyes of a storm
Moms from Virginia, you from Rhode Island
Met up in the state where the sun's always smilin
Minds connected, physicals exchanged
Y'all both believin that the world can be changed
Time passed to 1973, and you begged my mom to create me
First she said no but she loved you too much
1974 had a child to touch
We was into other things, that ripped life scenes
Liqour, drugs, other women, destroyin dreams
But you know how women be, she tried to hold on
For the sake of your love and the beautiful bond

[Chorus]
I'ma fatherless child, it's all I ever been
It's all I ever be, since your gone from me
Still I hope you know, that I can never unlove you, love you

[Verse 2]
1974 was a year things changed
Too much alcholol makes people violent and strange
You broke the window's with a baseball bat
As my mother cried inside with me on her lap
The dream destroyed, it was time to leave
She didn't take much, just a few things of lovin me
That was the birth of this fatherless child
And a struggling mother with the world in her eyes
She did it though, put herself in college
Raisin me wit grace, givin me the knowledge
And pops you, you never came by
Never sent money never called to say hi
I use to lie to the other kids, on the block
Say I knew where you was at so the questions would stop
I fronted to my friends that you didn't mean much
But I use to cry alone, and lone for your touch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ninth grade I thought you were dead
Call my mom about a paper, and that's what you said
I was angry and confused, all because of you
Wanted to ask you why, and just say fuck you(fuck you!)
But the feelings passed, what was my options?
Studyin my face tryna find what was lost and
I decided that you didn't mean shit
That I was really worth lovin and you lossed a gift
Before that, I grew breast and things
Got raped in the bathroom, and the question sings
What it have, could it have, should it have
Been different if I had yo hand to grab?
Would I be easier to love, not so torn inside
If you would've beat that man, and stood by my side?
Would I write sad songs, and call pain daily?
How different would I be if you had raised me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
1997, you called my home
From Telegraph&amp;43, for the child you never owned
I told you come by, Adam came to help me
You were homeless and drunk, but not lookin uhealthly
We sat for hour's, I asked you every question
We sang on my porch and discussed life lession's
And I loved you, like you had always been they're
You said you'd never leave again, so I released my fears
1999, tryna to sign my deal
Ten years of hard work, finally becomin real
So I brush you off, writin songs for a movie
That was the last time I saw you, forgive me truly
The day my deal was done, you died
Wit the needle in your arm, and angels by your side
And I miss you, tattooed it on my back
Fatherless child, fade to black

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
