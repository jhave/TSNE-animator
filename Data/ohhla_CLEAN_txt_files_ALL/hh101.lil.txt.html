Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Niggas gotta get back to makin' classics if they wanna see a nigga
You know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas ain't even in my league, yah feel me?
Basedworld Paradise
I just keep it real and I let niggas speak on my name
Speak on Lil B's name
Yah feel me, just tell 'em I'm a real nigga
But niggas ain't in my league or on my level
Basedworld Paradise, nigga
It's Lil B

Holdin' down whips, man I got it for a good hundred
People say stop this rap, bitch I'm 'bout to move on 'em
Never touch cats for the rules, you a fool homie
Code of the streets, they stick with the pavement
Block money cute but real money make you handsome
Gotta grind fast, post up on tricks
Niggas from the Bay, ho'll die, you wanna pop a trick?
Make a bitch sell ass quick on the flat strip
Don't matter how you look, you can pimp a fat bitch
Break bread, no crumbs, pick up and shut up
I done moved more on this track, so a nigga gotta get up
Most niggas sad because their bitch gettin' fed up
Like Kanye West said, most hoes is hittin' sit ups
When they see how their scrapes in, they wanna get up
Wolfpack man, I make these hoes sit up
'Til a bitch slob on a dick and please don't spit up
Make the cash for me, she gon' be a good pin-up
I sleep with the pad, the pen's gotta sit up
Like they up on the watch, without time on the clock
I done passed most niggas, I got a boat with no dock
I sell hard dope, I got coke with no rocks
I'm bussin' out the knocks, man I'm posted on the block
Your boy too hot, man I said that from the pre-game
Nigga I don't give a fuck, man I spit this fuckin' game
Crook up in my neck, flows for hours
I ain't even took a shower
Woke up and started...
Like yesterday
My nigga, I was just hustlin'
Niggas started usin' guns, niggas just started clappin'
Man you a good actor, man you niggas ain't rappin'
I'm tired of these fake niggas dissin' while they rappin'
You better go to school and really learn about this action

And go take a class how to rap, nigga
You know what I'm sayin'?
Lil B, man, Basedworld Paradise nigga</pre>
