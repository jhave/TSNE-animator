Yeah

Yeah

Check this out: now I'm black
But black people trip
Cause white people like me
White people like me
But don't like them
What's the fuck up
Are you my friend?

Hell no, you're a racist
You say you got one black friend, so you're in
Sorry homie, no win
Check the facts
Mexicans are still gettin pushed to the back
Puerto-Ricans gettin dissed the same
Won't speak on the Indians, shit's insane
Fuck John Wayne
I don't hate whites
I just got a death wish for muthafuckas that ain't right
You got black skin
Still you gotta show and prove, friend
Back to the facts
What about Australia?
A fuckin failure
The Aboriginal people are black
So they got jacked
You ask  me about free speech and the Riots?
So what's in store?
I'm talkin bout a race war

(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)

Race war
People gettin killed in the street
Blood on your feet, the ends don't meet
And who they gonna blame it on, me?
Try the media
Try the P.D.
Try your TV
Try your quest for wealth
Anybody but yourself
But once the bullets start flyin
People start dyin
It's all because we're lyin
History books that teach hate
A kid has no escape
From the racist fate
And pretty soon South Africa
Will stop chillin
And start killin

Race war (8X)

Every night I pray
That people get this shit together one day
But this country ain't with it
America was founded on that racist shit
I judge the devil by his deeds
It's usually connected to the size of his greed
And keep the hope
Even though they'd love to give a nigga like me the rope
And when this shit hits
There's gonna be a lotta white kids rollin with the Africans
You can't sweat skin
Cause ??? a lot of blacks is down with the Republicans
This shit don't have to happen
That's why a brother like me's still rappin
Just treat each other right
Either that, or you're lookin for a sure fight
Fuck the police
We already know they ain't about no fuckin peace
You wanna know what I think's in store?
Justice or a race war

(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)

Korean people live down in the hood
A little mis-fuckin-understood
Orientals were slaves too
Word to this fuckin red white and blue
People from Iran ain't never did shit to us
So why the distrust?
The system wanna keep us at each other's throats
While we're payin the tax notes
Cause bein black ain't no fuckin minority
It's the fuckin majority
So they gotta make us hate each other
Word, check the brothers
Mexicans - black
Jamaicans - black
Iranians - black
Indians - black
Hawaiians - black
Puerto-Ricans - black
Eskimos - black
South-Americans - black
Orientals - black
Yeah, that's right
The Klan says everything's black that ain't white
So we gotta get our facts straight
Cause the shit they teach in school is pure hate
Sometimes I don't know for sure
If somebody want a race war

(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Race war
(Get yourself together)
(Upen your eyes
Get wise)
(Put your brain in gear)
Who wants a race war?
