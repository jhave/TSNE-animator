[Intro]
This is how we get it in over here, don't stop don't quit
We get it on some hip-hop shit, this is hip-hop kid
Let the strings blow, here to let you all know
Me and my dudes, we come equipped and we ready to get it in, uh
(Sing to 'em!) We get it in, uh (Sing to 'em!) 
We get it poppin from beginning to the end, uh (yeah!)
And this is rough rugged and raw, like throwin slugs to your jaw
We surpassin 'em all, the hardest you saw is...

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Who you know jump straight off a bus
fall back into the booth, who fuckin with us?
I adjust to any circumstance, handle my affairs
Shake the hatred off, show 'em I don't really care
No we don't compare, I'm on another stair
Case in point, you ain't fuckin with my last year
We raisin glass here, to toast the good times
Gettin money is the theme, here's the dope rhymes
To quote mine, you in tune to the world's greatest
I see a star up ahead, it eclipse the latest
Put me on ya playlist, yeah I said it twice
It sound better than the first, cause I'm that nice
We roll that dice, and watch it bounce back
If I bet it on the past, I'd prob'ly rolled craps
So I stack one chip at a time
All these other niggaz out ain't fuckin with mine

[Chorus]
We get it in, uh! We get it in, uh!
We get it poppin from beginning to the end, uh 
We get it in, uh! We get it in, uh!
We go hard, my nigga, no pretend, uh
We get it in, uh! We get it in, uh!
We get it poppin from beginning to the end, yea! 
(And this is rough rugged and raw, like throwin slugs to your jaw
 We surpassin 'em all, the hardest you saw is...)

[Rapper Big Pooh]
All Henny, no ice
No Coke chase so my throat sacrificed
No I'm not leanin on a vice, celebrate throw rice
When them numbers go UP, then there's the price
This is the life, call it what you will
I call it skill, I call it feel.. 
good, what the deal? Never missed a meal
20-plus years on this Earth, I'm still
tryna get a handle, gold on the mantel
Can I get a sample, chicken on the toothpick
Walkin thru the mall, patrons like, "Nigga, you sick"
Only if they said the same goin to the store
Goin on a tour, goin 'round the globe
It's not a na'an 'nother like me you been told
Soul never sold for the money and fame
If I had to again, I'd prob'ly do it the same

[Chorus]
I get it in, uh! I get it in, uh!
I get it poppin from beginning to the end, uh 
I get it in, uh! I get it in, uh!
I go hard, my nigga, no pretend, uh
I get it in, uh! I get it in, uh!
I get it poppin from beginning to the end, yea! 
(And this is rough rugged and raw, like throwin slugs to your jaw
 We surpassin 'em all, the hardest you saw is...)</pre>
