[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I said this love we got going, Girl
It's really mind blowin'
Cause we not doing what our hearts say babe
Just what our minds showin'
And even when we makin' love
Girl I won't stop 'til you surrender
Now shit ain't been the same
Since I done put that dick up in her (Ha)

It's like I found a winner with a
Little dilemmas, For instance asking bout old shit that I could hardly remember
Like uh
Did you twap her? Did you fuck her?
Back then in '09
Shit, I think one time, Babygirl around lunchtime
But what you trippin' for?
Yeah, that's old shit
Leave my past shit In the past, bitch
Didn't really mean to straight call you bitch
But really babe, I'm only sayin shit
I'm thinkin' future, yeah future wife
I'm grown baby, I live the life
That one kiss changed ya whole life
And that was all based off of one night

In Miami, in my condo
18 flow out the window
Y'all know me I'm a Wild Boy
First date screamers, be gentle
Then I reply I'm a gentleman
Baby relax and just hold this
And I swear to God it gets no better then Twist now..

[Chorus: Chris Richardson]
Stop askin' 'bout my past life
It's all about you, baby
I live my life in the fast lane
And it's only for you, baby
And if I say that I want you, then baby I want you
I'm calling you my baby (baby)
And if I said I'll call you, then baby I will call you, my baby

[Verse 2: Lil Twist]
Ain't that shit type crazy?
You used to be my friend-friend and now you're my baby
See what happens when a bitch play me?
Sometimes, you think that shit shady
But fuck her, she played me
Now we sittin' down talkin' bout how I should teach your ex how to treat a fuckin lady
Fuck him!
I don't care about him
Really thinkin' bout red-diamond
To sit back with this Rosé
With Lil Za kicked up with my red bottoms
Then call you
Take this money hit the mall too
P.J., M-Y to the Mercer recall you like fall-through
I got a lot of shit
And that's all for you
Cause that's just what real players do
You say you like girls?
Well shit, me too
So why have one, when I can have two?
Just jokin'
She said are you crazy? I said you know it!
So just chill, and blow it, slowly
Okay, I'm jokin' once again
You know we do this cause we friends
And I have no problems with it
I plan to do this to the end
And I swear on everything, you'll have the best nights of your life!
Just do me one favor
Quit askin' bout my past-life
Alright? Now..

[Chorus: Chris Richardson]
Stop askin' 'bout my past life
It's all about you, baby
I live my life in the fast lane
But it's only for you, baby
And if I say that I want you, then baby I want you
I'm calling you my baby (baby)
And if I said I'll call you, then baby I will call you, my baby</pre>
