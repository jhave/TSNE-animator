[Intro]
Hey bitch turn that music down bruh, we listening to that Bitchmob shit bruh
Hey, go into the other room and tell that little nigga to turn that music up, you feel me?

[Verse 1: Lil B]

Damn its drama, I'mma tell you what it be (What it be)
Nigga I sucked the ho's pussy and I licked that bitch for free (mmm damn)
Man that red haired girl, ask that girl about me (uugghhh)
I almost kissed her in the mouth, bitch don't talk about Lil B (Damn)
I'mma tell you like this I'm a sick ass ho
Fuck a ho in the ass and Im digging for the gold (mmm Damn)
And she asked about the flow, bitch you know you're too young (Damn)
I'mma tell you like this, your mind straight dumb
And the niggas in the hood swear they... they got bombs (mmhmmm)
Man I come from the streets, looking like Vietnam (Yea Vietnam)
I'm a young OG, got the money out the ass (out the ass)
Fuck what you heard bitch, I'mma spend straight cash
Think I'm no homo, only pay thirty stacks (BasedGod)
Fuck what you heard bitch, and I ate the ho ass (Damn)
And I came out the water like the Loch Ness Monster
Nigga chewing on pills, bitch you know who did it
And I'm down for the black, bitch you know who did it (Basedgod)
Ho you know its Lil B, bitch I flex the Honda Civic (uhhh)
Bitch you know I fuck the ho ass
You see me on a good day I might slide through the section

[Outro]
MMMM I'm in the hood. I'm sliding through the hood. Hey I'm in the hood today
I'm in the hood, come see me. I'm sliding through the hood bitch, you suck my dick
Im still in the hood you bitch. I'm in the hood, come see me. Basedgod. Swag.</pre>
