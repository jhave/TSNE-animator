[Verse 1]
Can I talk my shit again?... 
Even if I don't hit again?
Dog are you fuckin' kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat Louis Vuitton stitch
With Donatello Versace, that's Louis Vuitton bitch
I think...Hennesey I drink I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon &amp; Corona I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwayne Wade
And ay please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers... I'm the hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain instead a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romanced
Cameras flash so much that I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on award tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy the hood love to listen Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy... I did it for the glory

[Verse 2]
What I'm supposed to do now man 
the game all messed up
How I'm supposed to stand out 
when everybody get dressed up
So yea at the Grammy's I went ultra Travolta
Yea that tuxedo mighta been a little guido 
But with my ego I can stand here in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fuckin' hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind the empty bottles of no-doze
Tank on empty whippin' my mama Volvo
Spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard think I'm Hugo's Boss
Why I gotta ask what that 2-door cost
House on the hills two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking bout her girlfriends yea the dark skinnded one
She asking bout the speedboats I admit we rented them
When you meet me in person what do ya feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
Ya know BIG &amp; Pac ya know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone, Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'ma stop killing these niggas 
soon as the chorus hit</pre>
