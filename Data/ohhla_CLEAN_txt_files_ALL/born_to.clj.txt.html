Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

James Todd Smith, knowhatI'msayin?  Trackmasters
Fresh off the private jet from Europe - did four months out there
Extra paper, scoop that up
Back on the scene, crisp and clean
You know how we get down baby, let me tell you a lil' story

[LL Cool J]
You're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
Is it the.. invisible settings on the baguettes?
The Benzes, Beamers and Corvettes?
Or the.. wood-grain in the convertible Lex
Be ease, shoppin sprees, what designer is next?
Is it the.. Diablo, parked on Rodeo?
Half a mill' in the trunk and I ain't moved no llello
Could it be I'm.. anti-pimp, hundred-thousand a clip
Hat low, doin donuts when I pull up out the dealership
Is it the.. the Fortune 500 covers?
The family man that got one baby mother?
The way I brainwash y'all to love one another
And got the whole community bouncin in unity

[Chorus 2X: LL Cool J] + (girl)
(Born to love you baby) Why?
(You know I love you baby) Why?
(Kiss and hug you baby) Why?
(I'll always love you baby) Why?

[LL Cool J]
Hmm.. you're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
I can't figure out the reason you be hawkin me
Is it the.. twenty million I be grabbin a flick?
Or my four-hundred million dollar FUBU clique?
is it the.. "In the House" syndication chips
Poppin two bottles, shorty read my lips
They say Ladies, Love, Legend in Leather
Simple ain't it... uh, but quite clever
Is it the.. fact I melt in liquid ice?
Tapped it once, you felt it twice
Is it the.. multiple O's I'm known for those
Temptation Island, wildin cause my neck froze
Is it the.. bowlegged, hard-headed
little honey in my grill with her pinkies wetted?
Forget it

[Chorus] w/ variations

[LL Cool J]
Mmm.. you're not a chickenhead goin "hee-shey"
You're choosy in the bed like "hee-shey"
I know your man's in the feds but "hee-shey"
I can't figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
Is it the.. way I caress and hold you close?
The iller, villa in Barbados?
Is it the.. Countache rollin up to your door?  Yeah
Tell your roommate you ain't dancin no more, yeah
Tell 'em your new man is cooler than before, yeah
Tell 'em bout them twenty-thousand on tour, yeah
Is it the.. the way that I defend your honor?
Backhand your ex-man, tell him kill the drama?
Is it the.. way the Mazerrati hug her body
make you wanna be my next hottie, uh-huh
From the bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruuuuuuuise.. it don't stop

[Chorus]
