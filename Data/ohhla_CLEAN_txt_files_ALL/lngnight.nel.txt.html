[Intro: Usher]
It's gon' be a long niiiiight (drop)
Ur-sher baby (oh-ohh) yeah
Yeah man! (oh-ohh)
This is a, J.Lack, track, man
Yeah (oh-ohh, oh-ohh, oh-ohh)

[Nelly] + (Usher)
Ohhhhhh, girl you know how to find me (when you need a fix)
But you know when you call me (make sure time ain't a issue)
Listen, I keep a strategy for attackin yo' anatomy
And I hope you don't get mad at me  but I had to say it!
You know rushin ain't a option, baby stoppin's not a topic
You know daddy gon' be bringin it home (bringin it home)
You know girl once I'm in it girl I'm in it so forget it, I ain't quittin
'til I touch every square inch of your walls (inch of your walls)
Shorty here we go (go go go go)
Take your clothes off slow (slow slow slow slow)
Give your boy a little show (show show show show)
Girl, cause (you know what I) like
(Don't put up a) fight (ohh!)

[Chorus: Usher]
Just give it to me girl I promise I'ma keep it steady
Cause I been lookin at you baby and I know you ready
Cut off your phone, it's gon' be a long niiiiight
I can't hold it for long baby cause it's gettin heavy
Let me beat it out the frame, I'm tired of lookin at it
I'm just tellin you, it's gon' be a long niiiiight

[Nelly] + (Usher)
Uhh, yeah
You see girl I'm talkin hours, he just talkin minutes
He gon' put you in his black book, I'll put you in the Guinness
Book of World Records, shorty I'm already in it (me too!)
I already did it, in the bed of +Menace+ (in the bed of menace)
Some call me Dennis (yeah) cause my +Rod-man+ diggin in (diggin in)
Leave 'em all screamin out (screamin out daaaaamn)
Damn, a Scorpio so ma you know just how I (ammmmm)
Now girl you know who I am  quit playin! (so baby let's go)
Now shorty let's go (go go go go)
Take your clothes off slow (slow slow slow slow)
Give your boy a little show (show show show show)
Girl, cause (you know what I) like
(Show me where to) bite, you (ohh!)

[Chorus]

[Nelly] + (Usher)
Listen, by the time I'm done with you (done with you!)
Ain't gon' be nothin left to do (left to do)
I'ma take my time when I put it on you (put it on you)
I'ma make sure you touch every inch of this room (this room)
Startin from the bed (AYY) to the floor (OHH) to the couch
To the stairwell, kitchen counter, clear it out (clear it out!)
From there we goin straight to the balcony (balcony!)
Show you what you never seen (never seen!)
Who you know do better than that? (better than that ayyyy!)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Outro: Usher]
Oh-ohh (yeah)
Oh-ohh (yeah)
Yeah man! Oh-ohh
It's a long niiiiight
Oh-ohh, oh-ohh</pre>
