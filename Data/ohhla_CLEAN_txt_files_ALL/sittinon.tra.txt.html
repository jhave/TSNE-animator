Sitting on top of the world

[Trae]
I really wish that I was, sitting on top of the world
Cause lately I've been in my own zone, stressing so much I'm about to hurl
I don't wanna lose my focus, in case you ain't noticed it's hopeless
In the ghetto, cause niggaz'll hold you down and never let go
But I maintain, ducking and dodging the rain
Wishing one day I'll get away, and be on top of my game
Cause for Trae, everyday struggling is what I get to feel
If I feel anything else, I swear to God it wasn't real
So I mash on, and get my cash on
Fuck being broke, everyday I get my stash on
It ain't no telling, if I'ma get to see the better days
I would rather be living, so mama say I better pray
And forget what them niggaz say, I know they be hating mine
I've been stuck on bad luck, I don't think they want mine
So I remain, hoping God gon put me on top of his list
I'll probably never get to see it, so for now I sit and wish I was

[Trae]
My mentality of being broke, done got me trying to get it
But I don't rest, so everytime I touch the game I'll be the best and never less
I ain't got shit to lose, and I want the bottom to the top
So everyday I give it all I got, a hundred percent and never ever stop
I ain't gon quit for shit, even though my pain is forever
I lost a lot with paying dues, and tried to keep it together
It's like I'm zoning everyday, and then I'm lost in a daze
Since I'm addicted to reality, I'll be stuck in my ways
And I can't change it if I wanted to, with what I'm going through
It ain't nobody, trying to help me through
That's why my attitude be out of control, with all the time they gave my dog
I bet he losing it slow, but still I tell him not to fold
I'm gon ride for the team, and try to make it to the top
And if I never make it, least I'm still respected on the blocks
I know it ain't a lot, but in the hood I'll be a legend
Helping people make it through, they hard times for a blessing like I'm

[Hook - 4x]

[Trae]
I never knew, if I would end up being po'
And if folks but still I knew, that I would end up being realer than most
And maybe that explains, why I haven't made it yet
I can almost bet that you niggaz, don't get no respect
Selling your soul and playing dirty with the devil, I choose to be a rebel
Never teaming up with that sucker, cause I'm on another level
And it ain't too many on it, I promise I'm a loner
Ever since me and my brother separated, I've been goner
On the corner trying to get it, the best way I can
That's why I choose to get up and get out, and be a man
And it ain't no giving me respect, I'd rather take my own
And ain't no running from death, I'd rather be toting chrome
And I don't think that they wanna see me, on top of the world
Cause if they did then they would fear me, when I be stopping this world
From all the bullshit, these niggaz be filling it with
And if I can't, then I'ma never be calling it quits I wish I was
