[Lloyd - Intro]
I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rock (YOUNG MONEY~!)
I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rock, girl {Kane is in the buliding, nigga!}
I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rooooock
I-I-I, I can make yo' {BED ROCK}

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good good, she Michael Jackson +Bad+
I'm attracted to her, wit her attractive ass
And now we murders, because we kill time
I knock her lights out, and she still shine
I hate to see her go, but I love to watch her leave
but I keep her runnin back and fort' - soccer team
cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves, steal your love and leave

[Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walkin if you walkin my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's +fly+ away
Let's buy a place, wit all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put 'er under
I see me wit her - no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got 'er, nigga - grocery bag

[Chorus: Lloyd]
Ooh, baby 
I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby
My room is the G-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make yo' bed rock 
Ooooo-ooo-OOOO-ooh - I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rock (ey, ey, ey, ey)
Oooo-ooo-oooo-oooh - I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rock, girl (ey, ey, ey, ey)
Ooooo-ooo-OOOO-ooh - I-I-I, I can make yo' bed rooooock (ey, ey, ey, ey)
Oooo-ooo-oooo-oooh - I-I-I, I can make yo' {BED ROCK} (ey, ey, ey, ey)
(EYYYYY!)

[Nicki Minaj]
okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prol'ly right
He pressin me like button-downs on a Friday night, heh-heh-heh
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
He on my low scrunch! He on my Ecko whites
He say, "Nicki don't stop, you da bestest"
And I'd just be comin off the top as, bestest

[Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter then wasabi
I race for your love, +Shake'n Bake+ Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back. 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen 'em stand in line, just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston, and let the rest suprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was YO' girl? I thought I recognized her...

[Chorus]

[Tyga]
She like tannin, I like stayin in
she like romance and, I like rollin wit friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watchin dat Oxygen, I'm watchin ESPN
But when that show ends, she all o'er my skin, lotion 
Slo-mo motions, rollercoastin
like back, forth, hold it {*echoes*}
She poses like it's for posters, and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you fo' me, she said, "Don't you ever show this!"
I'm too loyal {*echoes*}, and too focused {*echoes*}
to be losin {*echoes*}, and be hopeless {*echoes*}
when I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said, "Your words get me open"
So I closed it, where your clothes is
I'm only lovin for the moment

[Jae Millz]
Uh, she ain't got a man, but she's not alone
+Miss Independent+, yeah "she got her own"
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless
Well, that's whatcha are, how I see it is how I call it
Yeah, look-look at how she walk, mmm-hmm she know she bad
Do-do ya thang baby, I ain't even mad
and I ain't even fast, I'ma stay awhile
+Hold Ya Head+ Chris, I-I'ma {TAKE IT DOWN}

[Chorus]
