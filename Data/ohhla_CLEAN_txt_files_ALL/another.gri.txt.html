Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My baby just cares for me [x2]
But he's never there for me [x2]
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go

A friend of mine once told me when I was out on the road
That you have an artist inside you and you cannot be controlled
And any way that you choose it, it's gonna show
And if anyone tries to limit you, you need to let them go
Now I'm having trouble trying to find an even medium
Between trying to chase my dreams and providing you with your needs
And yea there's a fine line between it
Love colliding in battle over the use of it's meaning
And now you label this as my fault, talk with your friends
Like you've been living with the ghost of the man you go to bed with
And I need you to understand that what I've been blessed with
Is more than an investment, and isn't here to test you please
I know this is not expected, at times you feel neglected
And our love is a death wish, but I know one way to say it
I love you and wish for you to stay, I heard you saying things like

My baby just cares for me
My baby just cares for me (I heard you saying things like)
But he's never there for me
But he's never there for me (I heard you talking like)
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go (heard you wanna)

There's nothing more painful than failing at love
Pack your whole life up and cover in dust
Baby I feel the tension in between us is growing stronger
And your faith in me is diminishing into nothing at all
And that's disappointing because I sacrificed a lot for you
Never did I lie to you and stray from the truth
Huh, and still you look at me and treat me as the bad guy
Giving me those sad eyes, every time I ask why
And if that's our past time, then why do you put up with it
And why are you in love with me if you can barely stomach it
It's fragile, and I know I'm distant and bashful
Hit the road for two months and didn't even ask you
On the real, I shouldn't really have to
I've dreamt of this for years, and I'm gonna take it by the handful
And now I gotta try and choose between the two of you
Seeing you hit that door is like watching you at my funeral saying

My baby just cares for me
My baby just cares for me (I heard you saying things like)
But he's never there for me
But he's never there for me (I heard you talking like)
Baby it's killing me, that I may have to leave, go (heard you wanna)

How would you expect
Close your eyes and make this better
Now for better
How would you attempt
To change the weather, when it's raining and our hearts still let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go</pre>
