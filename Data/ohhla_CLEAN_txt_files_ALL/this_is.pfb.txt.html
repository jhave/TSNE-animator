[repeat 8X]
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up!)

[Pudgee]
Oh no here I go one more time on the roll with the flow
You move and you'll get cancelled like the Cosby Show
You won't last you the fool that said it's cool to rap
I'm pinin the tail on you, you're nothin but a jackass
Send me the roughest, rappers ready to rip 'em
Rhymes so deep you'll need a, shovel to kick 'em
Precaution with caution and quickly you'll exit
Leave your head spinnin like the bitch from The Exorcist
Not a beginner, dope rhyme inventer
Blowin up the spot like the World Trade Center
On the real know the deal, no steal
Beat your ass have you thinkin bout home like Stephanie Mills
So if you're bigger I'm tellin you if I miss ya
I'm goin to your house and get your wife like I was Amy Fisher
Here's your chance nigga better respect me
Cause I'll be around even longer than Elvis Presley
I'll be doin my thing, listen to me sing shit
And you'll be gettin more hits than Rodney King
Before you think you're comin better toughen up
Cause you ain't rough enough, I'll show you rough'n'stuff
Come and watch me fuck it up

[Chorus]
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
FUCK IT UP!

[Kool G. Rap]
Niggaz catch slugs from the thug when I bug out
No doubt, your motherfuckin crew's gettin drug out quick
I put the click on a nigga with the stainless
Boom boom, your motherfuckin homeboy's brainless
So go and get the embalmin fluid
Cause no heads get put to bed, when I'm fed I put some lead to it
And give your faggot ass a sunroof top
With just one plot, cause you thought you was gunproof Hobbes
So I gotta fry niggaz 'til they die like the head cook
Fuck jheri curls, G. Rap'll give your ass the wet look
So ease up, I blow them naps and them peas up
Freeze up, or be the first bitch swiss cheesed up
Yeah kid, it ain't about talk when I stalk
niggaz on sidewalk, (?) force bring out the white chalk
So watch your ass from the van hoppers
Spittin off man stoppers, even at the damn coppers
I grab the four-fifth and tuck it up
And that ain't how I fuck it up kid; that's how I fucked it up

(Fuck it up.. fuck it up.. Fuck it up.. FUCK IT UP)

[Chorus]
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
FUCK IT UP!

This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up (fuck it up, fuck it up!)
This is how we fuck it up.. (fuck it up!)
FUCK IT UP!</pre>
