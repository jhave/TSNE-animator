[Mr. Serv-On]
Yo Mo B., you ever seen a fallen angel?
Well today I saw one.
It seems like the world's just not smiling on other days.
Bruised up.
To me, real men don't hit thier women.
I guess to each his own.
This girl I'm talkin bout.
Somebody I wanted so bad when I was young.
I just want to let her know.
But you know when she ready to come home.
She needs somebody to ease all her tears and her fears.
I'm a be there.
I'm here, I'm here.

Say boo it's kinda hard to see you with shades on and it's night time
You say he love you, buy you finer things in life
And all I think he love baby is fight time
Do you remember when we was young
I used to tell your moms, you know your daughter
She goin be my wife and have my son
So young and dumb still I'm dreamin
To make love to ya and make your body hush
And even back then you saw dollar signs
You know me, I wasn't workin with much
Tryin to survive this ghetto rush (fa sho)
You want a ghetto superstar with fast cars
And all day shop at the shopping malls
I just wanted to write, to write our name on the walls
Sho welcome to come and see me ball
Nowadays, I'm livin do or die for this tank
You come to me screamin in pain
Balled up, tryin to get up, but I know you can't
A real man don't bruise and bloody when he say he really love
That swollen face shouldn't be erased by diamonds, money and fake hugs
I show tears, come on

[Mo B. Dick]
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone

[Big Ed]
I'm sayin, hear me dawg.
I mean, you don't need her man, know what I'm sayin?
Just go ahead and leave man.

How many stitches and black eyes will it take for you to see
I know love hurts but that's just mentally, not physically
You won't find a judge in me
And I know right from wrong, call me on the phone
I know somethings wrong cause in the background I hear the same sad songs
Spoke to you both last night but now you fightin at breakfast
I guess the only time yall get along is when you sweaty and naked
A women's supposed to be protected, but fool don't lash at your man
I mean this world's hard for all of us, let's do as best as you can
Let a man be a man, girl do your thing
You gotta love each other through weather, storms and hardache and pain
Let's make it through down south terenche and rain
You gotta apologize for all the stress
And you gotta apologize for all the pain
I'm sorry

[Mo B. Dick]
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone

[Lil Gotti]
I see the tears fallin from your eyes
Black sister don't let this best of this ghetto get ya
Dry your eyes, pick your head up, let your man know you fed up
Deal with this scum, you lookin for bruises and bumps
Sister stop bein dumb, fallin for lies to a smooth cat with a nice ride
Hold on to your pride, open your eyes
You got to nourish the body and mind
And you'll see, you'll be free from all this crime
Nothin but hopes and dreams to my black queen 
Remember, life ain't all what it dreams
Mo B. D, tell em what I mean

[Mo B. Dick]
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone
If you gonna beat her then you really don't need her
So the thing you do is leave her, leave her alone

Woah nelly, lemme hollar at you for a little while.
Man can't yall see what happenin to us man over the years man?
I mean we been tore apart brother.
You know, it started from man and woman.
Ya know what I'm sayin?
It's like Jerry Springer doin his stuff ya know what I'm sayin?
In the latter days you know we don't need all that.
That domestic violence man.
I mean you know you got a sister or a momma or a neice.
Or some you know some close female loved one to you know.
It ain't no win situation when a man puttin his hands on a woman.
Man how, how can you consider yourself a man bro.
By puttin your hands on a woman bro.
You look at yourself in the mirror alright.
And see if you can live with yourself man.
Just, just think on that man.
Adrian Barley, Odessa Poole, rest in peace.</pre>
