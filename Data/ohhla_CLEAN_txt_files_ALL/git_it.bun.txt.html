Sight for sore eyes, these hoes be deliverin
Pussy poppin and shakin, bringin home the bacon
These hoes is for the takin, them clothes they mean to me
The hell you waitin on? Yo' ass betta get it
These thugs in the club, you betta come on with it
Drop it, pop it, shake it, chrome lit pole
Bitch gotta nigga dick sittin on swole
Losin control off the liquor
(damn I like the way she put that thang on a nigga!)
She playin with my mind, see the bitch is fine
I can't make her mine, but I could talk her down
You don't hardly dance, this yo' chance
Nigga leave the club with his print showin in his pants

[Chorus]

[Bun B]
Damn, look at that face, look at those eyes
Look at them hips, look at them thighs

Baby girl you a bad mother (boy stop!)
Girl I ain't trippin, and I ain't hatin
But I been watchin, and I been waitin
Like the way that you shake that thang
Lookin like you finna break that thang
You need to lemme take that thang with me back to the pad
'Cause when I put in on ya, I betcha won't be mad
You know I go hard, then I go deep
And it's all night long, we don't need no sleep
I have you doin things that your last man couldn't
Lick the lollipop while I play with the pudding
Yeah you said you wouldn't, I knew you would
Don't be scared, it's all good, go on get it!

[Chorus]

[D-Roc]
Drop it down low hoe, shake that shit
Get fucked for a little, get loose with it bitch
Stay dumb, if you really want some
Get your ass on the flo' and get crunk
Monte Compton go? Too expensive, get your ass on the floor
Carly poppin that pussy and gettin it low
I gotta 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 dollar bill
So yo' ass can get crunk, show me all yo' skills
Keep it real, even though I know you a lady
Keep it still in the booty, all naked, shake it
Hold back freak, no, show me what you got then
Then shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
shake it, shake it, shake it for a hot tip
Clit get fucked, lemme see ya head split
Bounce your ass up and down like you ridin' on a dick
I came to the club to put some money in your rump
So get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it girl

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
