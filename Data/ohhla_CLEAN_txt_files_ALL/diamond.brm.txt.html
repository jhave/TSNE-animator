[Intro]
Yeah
You know what I'm sayin', like
Got a lot of these ma'fuckin' sucka ass niggaz
Niggaz be havin' fallouts with they niggaz over these bitches
That ain't gangster, nigga
I don't give a fuck (that ain't gangter, nigga)
Right or wrong, I ain't never stop fuckin' with one of my niggaz over a bitch
Might not, never!
Might not, never!
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'll tell you my story, nigga
Listen...

[Verse 1]
We started out moving niddicks
Worked our way up to briddicks
On the block holdin' fiddiffs
Hustlin' 'til the sun show
Beef came, let the guns blow, movin' like bros, sharin' one soul
Nigga fuck around and messed up young hoe
Knew she was a slob, still gave the bitch a son, though
Stupid, dirt-bomb bitch tryin' to holler
Hittin' me on Facebook, creepin', tryin' to swallow
But don't let your homie know, keep it on the low, boo
Came to you like a real nigga, and I showed you
You went back and told a bitch right after I told you
So she flipped the shit around, now you lookin' funny
Stopped comin' 'round, now you actin' all funny
Don't even pick up the phone for a nigga unless it's money (wow)
Shittin' on your man got me feelin' like a dummy
Never thought you would play me for some bunny, fucked nigga
You know the real love come before the riches
You know the saying, nigga, money over bitches (MOB, nigga)
Even better, bros over hoes
Only sucka ass niggaz sell they souls over gold
(Type of nigga like you) can't put a price on integrity
Naw - flippin' over hoes, homie, never me
Naw - 'cause I'm what you call a real nigga
If you ain't that, we ain't even tryin' to deal with ya
Pussy...

[Verse 2]
Yeuh
Watch me
Aye
Okay
I think about her every now and then
I think about the time we used to spend
I think about the trips we used to take
I think about the love we used to make
I think about, I think about our first and last date
I think about how we can never be
I think about how we never agreed
Unh, unh, unh, look, look
Why I'm thinking 'bout her crazy ass?
Cause she a diamond in the ruff and I can't let it pass
Still in college, still live with her mama
But she don't let a nigga pay when I say that I got it
When she goin' through hard times, I put dough in her pocket
She take it out, give it to me, then tell me to stop it
She say she got her own dreams and her own goals
And all I need is your support down the long road
I told her that she got that
That's why she never on the market 'cause I locked that
Yeuh  yeuh</pre>
