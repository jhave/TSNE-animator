[Otis]
Bullets fly just let me die
If I can't shoot and make your head go poof
On the loose, no juice, get used to the sound
Of the buckshot pound, bodies bleedin' on the ground
In attack mode, everyone around gets hit
When this heatseek shit locks on and spits
Got clips in every capitol in the whole nation
Blown the fuck up at the foundation
I'm hatin' you fucks, make no mistake
My missiles create aftershocks like earthquakes
In amazement fill the pavement with red
If you cover your chest, I just aim for your head
I let nobody live or leave, I bring fever
Judges, cops, I'm even gunnin' at the teachers
Nobody lives, please, I'm too eager to be O-T-I-S
Oh yes, the HEATSEEKER!

[Chorus - 2X]
Bullets fly at everybody (Otis)
And ain't nobody got a bulletproof face (Shaggy 2 Dope)
Missiles fly at everybody (Otis)
I'ma blow up the whole planet and watch 'em all vanish in dust (Violent J)

[Bonez Dubb]
I just blasted away at your hideout
Who destroyed your home? It's time to find out
Take cover and maybe you can ride out
And I'ma drop the whole bomb to turn the lights out
If you want it all, then watch the top fall
When the wall comes crumblin' down the long hall
Armageddon time's comin' better be runnin' from us
No trust in your fellow relatives and such
And much love and hate is takin' over your mind
Bonez Dubb and fate workin' over this time
Shots to the dome with the nickel-plated chrome
Leave a soul homeless and all alone
Nightscope, I'm doped up take out the long range
Shotguns to the face like Kurt Cobaine
Strange things about my ways, I turn the page
Of the book of the dead so I can splatter your brains
The Heatseeker!

[Chorus - 4X]
Bullets fly at everybody (Otis)
And ain't nobody got a bulletproof face (Shaggy 2 Dope)
Missiles fly at everybody (Otis)
I'ma blow up the whole planet and watch 'em all vanish in dust (Violent J)</pre>
