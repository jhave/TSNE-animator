Deuce: Hey mami, I wanna holla

Deuce: What, mami you lookin like my new baby mama
Trina: Ah, papichulo, I see you all you want is mami chulo
            So, I'm straight
Deuce: Hey mami

(Deuce)
I'm young, rich and I'm thuggin it
And girl, I don't give a fuck who your husband is
I gotta have you on my seat, five-six, thighs thick
A little ghetto queen, we'll get our freak on like Missy
Drink Cris-ty, be pissy, smoke Crip-ty, be wit me
Let's flee in the big body
Take it to the house, to the house party
That's right, I'mma holla mami
I'mma hop in the Benz, you follow, mami
I wanna play at the playground, mami
Shut up and lay down, mami

(Hook)
Deuce: Hey mami, I wanna holla
Trina: Uh uh, no way papi, I got my own dollars
Deuce: What, mami you lookin like my new baby mama
Trina: Ah, papichulo, I see you all you want is mami chulo
            So, I'm straight
Deuce: Hey mami

(Trina)
Oh, now wanna chase me
You wanna take me
To the diamond district and lace me
You wanna fly me to Hawaii
Anything I want, you'll buy me
You just met me, but you sweatin me
You wanna freeze my wrist and brigette me
You wanna fuck me, you wanna touch me
You wanna lock me down, handcuff me
That's cool but I got my own cash
You can keep your bread, I got long cash
Now that just sounds like game to me
You ain't half the player that you claim to be

(Hook)

(Deuce)
I wanna holla, lil mama
If it's bout a dollar, I'm break you off proper
I stay sittin on plenty B's
What you want? Ten, fifteen, twenty G's
That's nothing, we can shop for Prada shit
Ain't nothing to a player, but a scholarship
So leave the lights on and the camera on
Slim waist, lil thick lil Amazon
So let's those panties on, lay it down girlfriend
Once I get this on, I wanna take you home
And ride it, ride it, back it up and slip and slide it
