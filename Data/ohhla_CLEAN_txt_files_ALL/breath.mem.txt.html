[Chorus - Nelly Furtado]
I'm alive I can feel the blood rushing through my veins
And that's all I need to know because I'm not looking for a change
Cuz I got friends and enemies
But it just don't bother me
Cuz as long as I believe
I can breathe

[Prevail]
Metamorphasis Battle Axe fortress
Four hundred horsepower 
Full moon the sorceress
Swollen Members and my girl NF
The Predators and the Terminator
The track's called breath
Why hurt em later we can do so much damage now
Come track em when I hit em
So much garbage around
Yells, bells, and whistles like the carnival sounds
Phenomenal adrenaline from the words of my mouth

[Madchild]
How did Shane manage to rap with brain damage I'm fat
Remain famished and stacked
You're playing with a praying mantis
In fact you're gigantic
You sink like Titanic
Panic attack act up and I'mma masta
Crash is a disaster
Smash like Master Blaster 
Punka 
Rankle monster wants to stop ya
Crush em cuz I'm vain
Crush em none remains
Will tommorow be the same
Blood rushing through my veins?

[Chorus]

[Nelly Furtado]
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are at this point to do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do
I know this before I knew how to
Now we are this point do do
What a deeper subject to do
Better it be easy or not to do

[Moka Only]
I savour the mouth
I'm like the Krispy Kreme conveyer belt
With the synth notes swollen like a lympth node
We went from instro to intro to in-store
Coincidentally messin' up your mental state
We making pens blow 
As if I'm sent to pay
Me and my kinfolk pretend to 
Nobody can do it like your man Mok
My band's dope
The tracks flow
(I'm beautiful) That's for sho

[Prevail]
The harmony queen, the decibel kings
Never knew but we were born to do incredible things
I let a ring like freedom swings letters from my jaw
Twenty six in the mix
And we do it better than y'all

[Madchild]
I'm a neanderthal you're bound to fall
I'm born to brawl
We warned you all
And sworn to y'all
It's wonderful the underworld
Beautiful minds
Tryin' to keep it independant in recruitable times

[Chorus] x 2

[Moka Only]
We crashing through you
Feel the magnitude
Crashing through inside of you
It has to do with how you do your thing
Be true to only you
Moka always telling you
Just take your soul and talent to
The next plateau and balance who you try to think
No time to lose

[Chorus]</pre>
