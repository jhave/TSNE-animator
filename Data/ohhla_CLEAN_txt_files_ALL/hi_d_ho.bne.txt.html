Yo. I like that. Turn that up some. Oh yea. It's like
it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like
it's like, it's like, it's like

Who be the realest, the illest, most chillest nigga
that could ride any rhythm in here?
That gotta be Krayzie Jackson blazing at 'cha, doing
ya right in ya ear, so clear
Spitting verses that come thirsty for more, so I split
'em, serve 'em, twirl 'em right from the door
Now look who's back on the scene, the lyrical genius Krayzie
Style after style, I got down and get wild, like I'm
drowning a bottle of Gin, I got to
So a speech is slurring, and I see a blurry vision
nigga, you 'bout to get it, watch out
Where the gangstas at? Where the ballers at? Where the
brawlers at? Where my dogs is at?
where them niggaz that don't give a fuck about
nothing, motherfuck 'em, buck 'em and all of that
Keep it thuggish ruggish baby, baby, baby, put up the
dough if you think you can fade this, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone
I am what I am as a thug in the Land
Never run and I stand with a gun in my hand
If you want it, come get it, we got it, this beef
inside, we ready, come bring it, come on

Y'all better get outta my way, it's Kray, Leatherface
in the place, finna blow up just like a grenade
Give me pay nigga, don't try to play with my paper
this year cause I swear I'm gonna act like my name
Got a gauge and K that'll blaze in the same
Ya don't really wanna play with me man
But I'ma be ready on any day, y'all just be ready for plenty pay
I bet 'cha I fade any sucka as soon as it pop
Making 'em drop, shaking the spot
One simple shot and they feel the shit done with, plus
I got something for them niggaz that come with
Run quick when my gun spit, and I bust this out in
public, on some thug shit, who the thug bitch? That'll
be T-H-U-G-L-I-N-E and yes, we be
They wanna be like, they wanna roll like them
original, lyrical, miracle, critical killers for real for real

Chokie, chokie, choke, choke, Krayzie Jackson blazing
at 'cha, choke, choke, choke, choke..
Choke, choke, choke, choke, that gotta be Krayzie
Jackson blazing at 'cha, choke, choke, choke, choke..
[3X]

Yea, yea, yea, yea, choke, choke, choke, choke
chokie, chokie, choke, choke, choke..

Nothing you can say can help you get away from my
eyes, from my eyes, chokie, chokie, choke, choke
choke..
Nothing you can do can truly keep you from my eyes
from my eyes, chokie, chokie, choke, choke, choke..

Chokie, chokie, choke, choke, choke..</pre>
