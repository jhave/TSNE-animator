(Kweli)

We do not (under no circumstances) live for Hip-Hop (Hip-Hop)
It lives for us
we don't live for Hip-Hop (Hip-Hop), it lives for us (repeat 3x)

It's the eternalist, y'all burn to this, blaze da dro'
Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
we get eternal, this is what you waitin' for, 
you try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

(Chorus, Maseo)

De La is whatcha need, Reflection is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies, 
blessin' emcees lip professin' emcees
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D 
Let me hear you scream out loud if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body, 
when we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

(Posdnous)
Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came, 
made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain 
(don't sleep on a nigga)
I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane, 
matter a fact track is simple and Plain,
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain,
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game (and De La) oh fo' sho'
We be shinin' the same

(Chorus)

(Dave)
Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was yea old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal,
But they want to come spit your way so, 
so was I supposed to go and say no,
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal, 
you lose every rapper on a dept
Y'all need to pay ya dues

(Chorus)</pre>
