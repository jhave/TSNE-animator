[Cormega]
Everybody who shake your hand
Ain't your man
Its real, if you sleep you better wake up man
Don't be a fool, learn the rules
Put your faith in your hands
Or be stunned when you see your son
Hanging your ass
I mean you thought that nigga was real
He intended to squeal day one
DA's said he's willing to deal
Never let your friends know
How your pistol blow
How you get your dough
About the crib on the low
The code of silence expired long ago
Even in Queensbridge, you'll be surprised who's informing yo
Once the shit hit the fan, the horns will blow
The DA is the conductor for the chorus yo
The symphony ain't complete till the curtains close
And you upstate thinking you deserve parole
Now you vexed cause your man won't accept your calls
I speak valuable lessons so check this yo

[Hook]
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
Never sleep on any beef, or get worked to a smoke

[Cormega]
Loyalties worth more wealth, in world where people be all for self
I got friends who never call me till they want help
Then expect me to show love, I don't receive from them
It hurts me, cause I will bleed for them
Yet is it worth me risking, being free for them?
I got a lot more to lose in thought
A lot more secluded
Yours a lot more polluted
What should I do man?
Women, flocking my digits like the Blue Van
My boy Blue passed, it seems he was one of my true mans
Dudes smile in my face with there conspiring ways
Betrayal put Christ in the grave
Niggas, unrighteous ways
You up, they wanna stop you
Down, they talk about you
Even your friends will rob you
You think I'm lying? 
Ask Rich Porter mom duke
Shit is real
Gimmie a bit a favour, of a friend who won't snake you
Coke that don't lose grams, and I'm cool man
I was quarterback in the pack, despite D from the Blue Van
Just me and a few mans, setting screens, reppin Queens
Whoever thought that this will be Cory's destiny?

[Hook]
Keep your friends close, enemies closer
Never sleep on any beef, or get worked to a smoke
