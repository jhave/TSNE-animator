I see you in the club, I luv the way you twurk that thang

Bucking so hard you make a nigga wanna honk hoe

What will it take to move that g-string out the way?
Don't stunt girl, won't you work it how u want to
Here's 50 dollars show a nigga what'cha gone do
Lap dance, or we can take it to the back
Love strippin' in the club, let me put you on yo back

Earring in you fucking tongue make a nigga go girl

Come on pop that thang (no it won't stop, no we won't stop, no it won't

Verse 3: [Ms. Peaches]

You wanna get it, get it, get it my ass nigga
You got some fucking nerves coming wit them weak ass lines
Thinking you 'bout to get served, nigga please
I ain't about shaking my ass for no nigga
I'ma go getter, ghetto bitch
Clockin' my own scrilla
How the fuck you figure that you can pay for this ass?
You couldn't afford me even if you had a trunk load of cash
Couldn't last a damn minute if I was twurking my thang
I have you screaming (stop)!
NO!, now what's my fucking name
Fuck biggied bounce, bitch I'm trying to make some real money
So put them dollars in yo pocket cause I find that shit funny
Always be them cheap ass niggas won't you to work that string
But when it come down to fucking he ain't even got no thang
You holla working it twurking it, nigga you need ta start jurkin' it
Cause I'ma break it and take, fucking right I'm tryin' to make it
So how many dollars its gone take for you lick on this click?
Now get the fuck out my face
