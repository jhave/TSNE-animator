I got an idea...

I had a plan to grow indo' 
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom
So beautiful, but yet stinky 
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky 
And the brain
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation 
Discrete location
Ten by ten foot spot
Lit up by a thousand watt
Lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate
And ehm - I calculate
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion
With a little love and devotion
I can make the front cover of _High Times_
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines
For havin a 'secret garden' like Barry White
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow
Towards the light
Make sure the temperature's right
I was told by this one guy
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere 
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves
Watch out for thieves
People like to stash shit up their sleeves
It's not been three months
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk?
I see some purple stems and orange hairs
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid
Wow! Look what I did
I got the green thumb
Observe the superb herb
Bushy branches, loud smell
Like green pastel
I got it on deck for all seasons
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 		

It's been over four months, time to get high
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks
And I'ma be waitin right here with my loose leaf sheets
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb
Been waiting so long, make me wanna write a song
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my filet of chicken breast
Or some tea shot full of THC
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet
Then come off on weed
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down 
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound
It have me buzzin for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds
And be at it again, yes indeed
I got the grow room

	If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
	And if you're high already and can't take another toke
	Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope
