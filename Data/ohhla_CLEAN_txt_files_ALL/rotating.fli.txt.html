Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge: TeeFlii]
Body to body
Touching and feeling
You in this party getting naughty
And you about to take it all off

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Annie you rotating, rotating, rotating
Annie keep rotating, rotating, rotating
Annie you rotating, rotating, rotating
Annie keep rotating, rotating, rotating

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
You move your body like you're fornicating
And you know how to work in them stilletos
Annie, I got you working like a nine-to-five
Cause I got the kind of sex you like
Just move your body over this way
Move your body over this way

[Chorus: TeeFlii]

[Verse 2: TeeFlii]
You move your body like you're fornicating
And you got me on a different level
You bomb from head to toe
You ain't no rookie you a pro
Girl, just move your body
Annie, girl, just move your body over this way
Move your body over this way

[Bridge: TeeFlii]

[Chorus: TeeFlii]

[Verse 3: Fat Box]
Bumping and grinding, touching all on yourself
You do it good, do it good, yeah
Don't need no help
You're so thick girl
Put it all on me
I'll give you this dick girl
In the V.I.P

[Bridge: TeeFlii]

[Chorus: TeeFlii]</pre>
