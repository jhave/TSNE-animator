Intro:
It's going down around town what? Likwit Likwit. Uh.

"No doubt"
"Knock 'em out the box"-Slick Rick 'Children's Story'

Verse 1:
Don't underestimate the reach 
Here comes that city brother who lives by the beach
Defari, work for Likwit organize
Dodger hats and snowboard shades
Camouflage my eyes 
Hustle to survive
The Less mican man stands grand
And work with two twenty five
This here's the second smash
The album, the third
The trilogy will be heard from Toronto to Pittsburgh
Yo Ev do we got retail in Afghanistan 
(Man I don't know but I know we got Japan)
Uh ha, word up we all over the states man
Doin' this
For the MCs and the DJs
The vertebrae 
Without the B-boys 
Hip hop wouldn't be here to this very day
And that's my word we tryin' to blow like the Hiddenburg
Swerve legalize dope in the form of vinyl
This ain't the final or the last blast kid
I'm throwin' heat on the map (what?) for the underground massive

Hook:
"No doubt predicting far and ahead what will set the party off" -KRS-One 'The 
MC'
(x3)

Verse 2:
See lyrically shit is gettin' drastic 
A lot of niggas flock tryin' to be new instead of classic
Like an Aztec 
Praise the jaguar 
Like the fact that the sun shines at the biggest star 
Bigger than Mike Jackson or Michael Jordan 
So many Candyland MCs are boring 
See we be touring    ?   and   ?  (what?)
Creepin' up in the shower on bitches like Anthony Perkins (ha)
Defari
Lurkin' in the ranks
I'm tryin' to be like that brother Ant and stack mad Banks
Plus give thanks and praise 
For each day I'm able to raise 
And see that foggy haze 
Comin' off the coast of the Pacific 
We stretch to the Atlantic my crew is Likwit

Hook

Verse 3:
Yo fuck the pennies give me the silver dollars
The smooth scholar working hard straight blue collar
Appreciate wealth so I do for myself
First collaborate with live niggas and divide the purse
The well rehearsed MC
Defari Heru
I crack the glass blackboard MCs so I can see through I do my Dew
Do my thang 
Hip hop is my Love Supreme 
That's word to John Coletrane 
This cat Dwayne 
Rollin' down the diamond lane
Travel by train, bus, boat, car or airplane
To different venues with our names on the fliers
Likwit niggas known to get ship poppin' and get it on fire
I'm Extra Swift like my man Eric Brooks
I keep an eye out for crooks 
Who contemplate rapin' my notebooks
Some cut fast but they don't' cut faster 
Then the Kutmaster Kurt
When I work 
I'm climbin' ladders
