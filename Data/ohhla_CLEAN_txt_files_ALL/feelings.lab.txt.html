[Female Vocalist]
Rivers of memories baptize me
I can't deny the energy that drives me
In a space called reality is where you'll find me
My soul breaks the chains to set my mind free
Now I'll take the time to reveal
How I truly feel

Life is ill but I've been blessed to heal
And that's how I truly feel

I truly feel

[Labtekwon]
I had to elevate from section eight and self-hate
Life ain't great when your naps make the comb break
Before the age of eight I learned how to checkmate
But how many steps does it take to walk like a man
In second grade I learned to talk with my hands
I made jaws understand and I never got slammed
The ghetto's ill, I found joy on the football field
And the book mobile, I took those skills
To build my body and mind, but by junior high
Life was do or die, stepdad gettin' high
It hurt my pride when he used to cop rock
From the older guys on the block at fourteen
I couldn't make him stop, in Eighty-Six
Baby, kicks was the treasure, Fours and Airs was precious
Brothers got murdered for Dominoes, Lambskins and Furs
Word

Rivers of memories baptize me  (--I truly feel--)
I can't deny the energy that drives me  (--therefore it's real--)
In a space called reality is where you'll find me
My soul breaks the chains to set my mind free
Now I'll take the time to reveal
How I truly feel

Life is ill but I've been blessed to heal
And that's how I truly feel

I truly feel

The world we live in is determined by materialism
Girls be givin' up the womb for various positions
Folks wanna blow up like Branch Davidians
Chickens go to the clubs on finance missions
?Worse?, but then they got drugs to get love from the finest women
Such mindless minions, but that's just my opinion
When it's time for rhyme, I can rock any convention with precision
Givin' the blind vision, soon the moon and the sky be crimson
Y'all better try to find redemption, it ain't about religion
How you livin', Muslim or Christian, Buddhism or Taoism
Style isn't important, what's the true Substance?
I represent blood covenant, blessed with melanin
And I'm lovin' it... I truly feel
Therefore it's real

Rivers of memories baptize me
I can't deny the energy that drives me
In a space called reality is where you'll find me
My soul breaks the chains to set my mind free
Now I'll take the time to reveal
How I truly feel

Life is ill but I've been blessed to heal
And that's how I truly feel

I truly feel</pre>
