[Kool Keith]
Yeah
When I dunk across
When I show you the bowl
When I show you the floor
G-A-M-E, spells game

You know the bass is out, you ain't got game
I'm droppin words on beats, they come in thick game
The little flavor they use, they ain't got game
Long face or not, you be in the big game
Sweet on my feet, I float like Sugar Shane
You never get up the hill, on the Hall of Fame
E-40 my man, he did "Tha Hall of Game"
Players rock the stage, while the ballers bang
Pretty ladies they hang, while you droppin them thangs
Non-stop rocka rocka rocka
When I get up they spot me

[Chorus]
G-A-M-E, spells game (since it started, I've been in it)
N-A-M-E, spells name (yeah that's me, don't forget it)
F-A-M-E, spells fame (whatever it takes, I'ma get it)
G-A-M-E, spells game (just pass me the rock, and watch me hit it)

[Kool Keith]
Peter Piper picked pickles, and Keith rocked rhymes
Move around get away you need to get game
In the pay game, give it up game
Still I flip a brain, in a powerful lane
Like a powerful train, you can't handle my pain
I put a stain on your name, leave you out in the rain
Let my photos remain, like the key yo
stuck to a keychain
Nothin but the net from the 3, chang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang
Bobba-la-bang-bang
Shockin the ways, rockin them days
Sparkin 'em pays, yo!
Freeze, turn to 3's, on your knees
As free throws turn to bees

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
Break down the basslines, girls check your hangtime
Double dribble and fizzle, humble and fumble
If you go out, let it all hang
And sweat like a freebird on the 6th man
Don't get jealous, stop messin with my good name
I'm out here with sharp arts and a booty aim
Watchin the hall of game
The big show, got me insane
Threes to burn leave you in flame
Like chargin a freight train
Little game, or big game
Who's runnin the blitz game?
Triple double game
30 to 8 game, don't be late mayne

[Chorus]</pre>
