"They call me Superman..."

"They call me Superman..."	"Big Shaq, where you at?"
"They call me Superman..."	"Big Shaq, where you at?"

[Shaquille O'Neal]
You can't stop it or block it when I drop it
Anytime I go rhyme for rhyme on a topic
Ain't even fit to step in Shaq's arena
I look inside your mind and I seen your shook demeanor
in your eyes, why are you suprised
No matter how you try, not fly as ?ellequad?
The new edition, is this the end of your last night?
in the daytime, you couldn't see me with a flashlight
I crash flights on sights of my enemies
I'm comin through and then I bomb your whole vicinity
Why the act of fakin jacks, you're not a friend of me
I peeped your card, you're not as hard as you pretend to be
Who wanna spark it with the chocolate
Macadamia, hair clean to the cranium
You know the name, Shaq aim to maintain
Money on the brain, can't stop the reign

	"Big Shaq where you at?"

[Notorious B.I.G.]
What?  Uhh, what?
Uhh, uhh, what?  Uhh
Ninety-seven ?caddi lawn?
What, what, uhh

I creep deep with killers without million dollar figures
Blessing *niggaz* in Ac Legends and vigors
Cream lizards, cream coogi's, I do my duty
As long as they fly as me, get high as me
Success in my circle, try to break it, I hurt you 
Ain't no gettin out that, I doubt that
We want thee exotic, erotic ladies
Not them toxic ladies that burn a lot
I learned a lot, from junkies to ruffians
From bein tied up by Columbians, cause 80 grams was missin
Listen, had to change my position 
From wantin to be large to head *nigga* in charge
My garage, call it celo -- fours, fives, and sixes
Honies by the mixes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it
Smoked out with Leo, Biggie Tarantino
Size like a sumo, Frank White numero uno

	"Big Shaq where ya at?"

[Shaquille O'Neal]
7-0, ha, towerin inferno
Invincible, smooth individual
Who wanna test it, foreign or domestic
No matter where you from, I'm not the one you wanna mess wit
Origin-al Willie style, livin lavish
Private jets to let my shorty shop in Paris
I'm not the average, I'm far from the norm
Daddy long hittin em strong, keepin you warm

[Notorious B.I.G.]
A lime to a lemon, my CeCe women
bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in em
Vehicles with televisions in em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them, hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert ease street sweeper inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!</pre>
