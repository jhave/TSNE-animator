[Master P]
Inside the ghetto you see kids with no shirts or shoes
and no sweaters, and life is kinda cold, 
little kids withdirty pampers and a god damn runny nose
and moms never home, never really had a da
now what really going on?, now what should I do?
my little brothers stomach growling in the god damn rich do
searching in the box for something to eat
knowing there aint gon be a god damn thing in there G
in the middle of the night it get strange
sister baby keep crying they want milk man
but she dont give a damn
she's out tricking for a hit dont give a fuck bout little sam
and all night long the neighbors fussing my ear to the wall
he beats us up and 2 hours later come the police
instead of helping honey rather fuck with me
its truly on the wall, want my eyes deep
now whats really going on G?

[Big Ed]
Man this police fatality gotta stop ma
cause brother aint going out like Rodney King no more

[Master P]
Little Sammy grew up to be the neighborhood dope dealer,
big wheeler, cap peeler, never gave a damn bout another life
going to jail cause sam was just another night
money and dope was a trade
but not enough money to save this motherfuck's age
mama did sam like change
started ganking his own people like in the dope game
and I better run out to a quarter
that little sam wont live to see tomorrow
and the government really dont gives a damn
cause every neighborhood you find a fucking sam
its some little kid with no pride
but not enough education to survive
a lotta people in it to win
dont a damn about the lives they lose in the system
It's a shame, black politics and government
damn, uncle sam, so we retaliate,
so who are you going to judge when we all make mistakes
so I just move on
you cant stop a nigga from writting a bout it in a song
and I aint the one to get fucked
in other words you mess with P its like pressing your luck
and I'm getting paid,
and I aint gon let you treat every damn black man like a slave
and if you do your wrong, now what really going on</pre>
