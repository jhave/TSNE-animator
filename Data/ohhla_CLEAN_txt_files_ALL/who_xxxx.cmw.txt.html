Attention mutherfuckers geah attention.
The brother who don't quit is back with the gangsta shit.
Mike T, my mutherfucking right trigger
play the drums so I can buck this nigga.
It all started like a game so watch him spit.
When a fool tried to come up off a gimmick.
So if its tag, I guess its my turn.
I grab your bullshit cap and start to burn.
Fool, you picked the wrong place, at the wrong time.
So watch the driveby punk cause your ass's mine.
I set the fire to the fuse so now its too late.
Cause with your [wick wack] shit you can't touch the Eiht.
The Comptonator, the Compton cyco. Compton, Compton,
Punk, we stomping.
CMW shutting em down so start ducking.
No where to run so you know who's fucking who.
