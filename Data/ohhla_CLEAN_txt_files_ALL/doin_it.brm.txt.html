[Chorus: Channel Nicole] (Busta Rhymes &amp; Reek Da Villian) (*DJ Ted Smooth)
It's so hot, It's so hot baby
Everywhere we go we shuttin down the spot baby
Got them bottles in the air like yeah
Everybody put your, hands up wave 'em like they don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
We doin it again (*YOU REMEMBER!!!)
You know we doin it again

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Hmmm! Back at it
Open the door for me while I go into another tax bracket
Seats reclined like I'm layin up in a Craftmatic
And choke the streets 'til they diagnosed it was asthmatic
Hmmm! So cashmatic
I light the room up 'til I blind the blocks and I'm causin a gang of traffic
And yes I'm doin it again because you desire to ask it
Another heater to make the people wanna bang the classic
Hmmm! And swag 'em to death I tried to warn 'em
Until we got they back on the fence I got it for 'em
Considered makin no sense prepare nigga!
Witness in the greatest in the flesh WE RIGHT HERE NIGGA!

[Chorus: Channel Nicole] (Busta Rhymes &amp; Reek Da Villian) (*DJ Ted Smooth)
It's so hot, It's so hot baby
Everywhere we go we shuttin down the spot baby
Got them bottles in the air like yeah
Everybody put your, hands up wave 'em like they don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
We doin it again (*YOU REMEMBER!!!)
You know we doin it again

[Verse Two: Reek Da Villian]
Villian! Listen! Uh! These clown niggas run around with they foolish acts
Talkin that trap shit knowin they ain't movin packs (NOT AT ALL!!!)
Before I kill them bitches I got Freddy Krueger stats
I should be the mascot for +Cheetos+ I'm the coolest cat
Lil' fuck niggas that's the shit I don't like
If it ain't Ms. Gooden daughter I bet I won't wife
I just beat up the pussy and leave it on ice
One time it's for the money so I never bone twice
I was good in the hood with a glock boy (BOY!)
My kitchen was the studio with them rock boys (BOY!)
Was makin music in that booth was the pot boy
Now I tour with Bus and see fifty five a stock boy

[Chorus: Channel Nicole] (Busta Rhymes &amp; Reek Da Villian) (*DJ Ted Smooth)
It's so hot, It's so hot baby
Everywhere we go we shuttin down the spot baby
Got them bottles in the air like yeah
Everybody put your, hands up wave 'em like they don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
We doin it again (*YOU REMEMBER!!!)
You know we doin it again

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
Hmmm! Watch me do it
And display it in such a way rock +Unlimited+ over +Versace+ stupid
Steppin up in the spot, you know you must salute it
And I suggest that you humble yourself and watch me student
(Heh Heh!) The undisputed
(YMCMB!!!) Heavy makin a more dangerous movement
See now we hang our coats to that
Sit at the roundtable glasses of Rose and we makin a toast to that
Some of these niggas think they hot that's in the present nigga
The problem is that I'm HOT and I'm a legend nigga
The problem is that I only got, only a second nigga
See this alliance exposed a couple of frightenin niggas!!!!

[Chorus: Channel Nicole] (Busta Rhymes &amp; Reek Da Villian) (*DJ Ted Smooth)
It's so hot, It's so hot baby
Everywhere we go we shuttin down the spot baby
Got them bottles in the air like yeah
Everybody put your, hands up wave 'em like they don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
(HEY! HEY!) Wave 'em like you don't care
We doin it again (*YOU REMEMBER!!!)
You know we doin it again</pre>
