Song:   Hope We Meet Again
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We could be anywhere tonight
Could be right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I just, I hope we meet again

One thing's for certain, two things for sure
Iheartradio, I close show
My life's like broadway
No camera welcome to the show
One champ for them boys in dictment
Broadway, negro, I'm poser than posed
My boy I told ya, baby coming back one day
Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet
Australia or the uk jump the puddle straight to the US
Its okay let em hate, cause they'll be coming back one day, dale

We could be anywhere tonight
Could be right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I just, I hope we meet again

Now the world is my backyard
And I would like to thank yall
Cause I was at point, point blank
That I would point blank yall
I found myself intern I lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like an old school manny better lost in time
They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise, papo I don't know
But this mean I cant say, to my friend eddie, my father, guarilla
abuelo rudy, to my brother drama I'll be back for you one day

We could be anywhere tonight
Could be right here underneath the lights
I see the colours in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end
I just hope, I hope we meet again

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la

I hope we meet again
I hope we meet again
I hope we meet again</pre>
