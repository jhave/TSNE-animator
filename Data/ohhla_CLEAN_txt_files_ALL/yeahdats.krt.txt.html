[Chorus 2X]
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Who dat getting money? Aye, who dat getting money shawty?

[Big K.R.I.T.]
OK, I wake up fresh, get up fly, drape myself, pimp my ride
Hit that slab, throw some dough when making shawty get down on the floor
I'ma have to show my ass, ride on glass, pump my brakes, then I'm mad
Pop my trunk, then I flash, a nigga wanna try to act bad
We don't really play no games, fuck with lames, trick on hoes, that won't change
Caught my lane, swang and swerve, I gotta watch out for the curb
He don't really play that, play that, yeah! He ain't bout that, bout that, no!
Then don't come round, come round, here! Cause we'll let them, let them, go! Like

[Chorus 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.]
OK, I jump out fresh, shine all day, rep my hood, rep my state
Spot a little bad chick around my way and holler out let's get paid
Always been about my grind, bout my bread, don't like haters and I don't like Feds
Don't like shawties that tease all day like they won't give a real nigga head
Peep this game as I get this dough, throw it in the air when you hit this flo'
Yeah that's me sitting on chrome feet, made it when you couldn't see when I crept up slow
Watch yo' head when I open my do', grab yo' parachute, then let's go
Dark in the club with a pimp on glow, everybody saw me take yo' hoe, like

[Chorus 2X]

[Big K.R.I.T.] + (female)
Aye, balling, crawling, slamming doors, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Be a pimp tight player like I'm supposed, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Cause my trunk on slam and my wrist on glow, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Aye, who dat getting money? Aye, who dat getting money shawty?
(I'm like, show me where them dollars at, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
 Ski mask, leave with shopping bag, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
 You ain't spending? Then don't holler back, yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Who dat getting money? Aye, who dat getting money shawty?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
