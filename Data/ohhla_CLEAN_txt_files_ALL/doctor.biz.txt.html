[Bizarre]
(*Coughing*)
Maybe it's the weed..
It's more than the fucking weed

[Chorus: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
I've had a headache for the last three days
And the last couple days I been missing some pay
Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffing and coughing
And really this doesn't happen to often
Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I got the flu
Maybe I'm stressed out, something I'm going through
It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex
I'm usually a wild guy, I'll break her fucking neck
I'm sick and I'm starting to wimper
It's ninety degrees, it's like December
My temperature is hundred and six
I can't shit and I feel like shit

[Chorus 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till something leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
More trouble, here comes day two (Two)
I took a shit in my white underroos
My eyes look like I been smoking crack (Uh-huh)
Exlax got me throwing up Big Macs
Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, synus
Carrying my (?) around like I'm Linus
Maybe it's the pork I ate in New York
Or maybe my baby mama wanting child support (You bitch!)
Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick
Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick
Or maybe it's just the bottle of vodka
I don't care, I just need to see the doctor

[Chorus 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leaving till somethin' leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Obie Trice]
I'ma kill this bitch, the tip on my dick
Ain't got an itch but I couldn't resist the switch
She's the type of bitch made to flinch
Walk passed niggas, all in the ass
Or it's because I had a tall glass
I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped
Purhaps, I could catch the crabs
But, at that moment that's irrelevant
I knew what I know now, I practice celibace
And be hesitant from tappin' Evelyn
Heaven sent a message when I came back negative
"Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative"

[Chorus 2x: Dion]
Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me
You better send me home
Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me
Right now that's all I'm on

[Bizarre]
Yeah, just visiting Cincinnati
Me and my (?)
I'm with my boy, Hi-Tek, down the street
Yeah, can you take, do you take debit cards? (No, we don't sir)
Food stamps? (No, please, sir, get off the line)
? go get Hi-Tek out the car, man
tell that nigga I need some, money for the prescription
..Kweli! Ha-ha!</pre>
