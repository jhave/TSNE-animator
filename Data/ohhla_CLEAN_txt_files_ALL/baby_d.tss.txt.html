*(Too $hort talking)

Eh yo Baby D, get yo lil ass over here on tha mic man, an show these 
other lil niggaz, they can't fuck wit the Dangerous Crew man, spit that 
shit, fo' $hort Dog.

Verse 1- *(Baby D)*

This is out fo dogs, wit tha fake attack,
I put it out two times, now I'm bringin it back,
wit a whole lot of me,
the Baby D,
you slippin westsider,
but it don't mean shit to me,
I'm the youngest in the Crew from the Oak-Town,
an when I come through, 
I lay you niggaz down,
so what up,
get yo gloves an stuff,
it's the Dangerous Crew, ain't no love fo punks,
an if you dont know what to do, when I come through,
let this young mack show you,
grab the mic, an tighten up yo lyrics,
if it ain't real, I ain't really tryin to hear it,
see another MC's gettin mad as hell,
ain't nuthin mo funky than to be himself,
I gotta make a knot,
while I shake the spot,
cuz I can't be stopped.

*(Too $hort talking)*

Lil mutha fucka spittin that shit y'all, that's how we do it in East 
Oakland, you know what I'm sayin, Dangerous Crew representin, next 
generation step up baby.

Verse 2 *(Baby D)*

Baby D takin over like doja,
open ya up wit that north west explosion,
then I'm coastin,
(What ya doin nigga??),
runnin from the scene wit the ghost like Moses,
I gotta let em know, 
if they mess wit the Dangerous they always know,
so get on,
befo you get spit on,
I'm rollin in knee high, no lie,
finna get my grip on,
from mornin to night, I keep it tight,
aiight,
Dangerous Crew fo life.

*(Too $hort talking)*

Yeah that's juss a lil sample y'all, Baby D comin through, 1996, 
Dangerous Crew, my nigga ain't but 10 years old y'all, so, umm, before 
you start dissin, you betta try an listen, cuz, he got sumpthin fo the 
future that you lil 'ol niggaz can't fuck wit. So Baby D, I'm a tell em 
like this, since I know yo mama might get mad if you tell em....
