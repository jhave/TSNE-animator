	It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)

[Ced Gee]
Hey, I got a flow that is wicked, so sit back while I kick it
The incredible edible, change my pitch while I rip it
We can make it just happen, while I'm keepin you snappin
Now the style is correct, so I'ma keep gangsta rappin
Cause I'm back and I'm flowin, I'ma keep people knowin
that I'm just like the Energizer (STILL GOING!)
So get that and make that, somethin you think is real fat
It's a small thing I'm back, on the Delta Force track
As the figure get bigger, as the soul brother nigga
I don't plan to waste time black, I just pull the trigger
Now my mic is just smokin, like the 'R' I'm not jokin
Fuck around, step to me troop, your big toes is broken
Now I be the headbanger, releasin more anger
cause my fury is deep, so don't challengers scatter
When I'm ? the head, I make beats that just flip
So I write up a rhyme next, then flex
Back at the ranch with the 4-H Horsemen
The flavor is steady, move your head to the bass
So check the rhymes and check my stats
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back
I'm still the Delta

I go to battle with cattle head but I'm not takin prisoners
I'm playin whatever moves, like come through those prison doors
I'm fakin a bat, then slappin rappers to misery
I'm pickin them up, then droppin them in some deep fat grease
I'm burnin and turnin plus them I'm makin a barbecue
Like Hector Camancho with fancy shorts and I'll ridicule
You come and you challenge, but there isn't a guarantee
I'm scratchin that ass up like my rap name is Wolverine
I put you in critical, condition don't make a move
Then treat you like Barney -- you purple little dragon
Condensin the center, cause I rhyme like a ?
Cause when a freak try to base me that's when I become outstanding
Cause I'm riggedy wreckin it, micky miggedy shakin it
Put a rhyme on the table, then I'm strippedy stretchin it
Toss it up and erasin it, discombobulate violate
Your bladder is gone, get lost G, don't wait
So check the rhymes and check my stats
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back
I'm still the Delta

	It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)

Goin back to Boston..
(Going, going, GONE!)

[Ced Gee]
I ? mega with talent, and I'm loaded with skills black
It's been like that since records like "Ease Back"
and "MC Ultra", magnetic magnetic
We always had flavor, that's why we're the Horsemen
Now we rollin with Wild Pitch, that's as hard as the hard get
Moe Love make the fat beats, while Ced Gee got that chronic
Cause I'm here and I'm stable, ready willing and able
Makin moves like Clark Gable, dance like Fred Astaire
So come to the pedigree, bring plenty of verses too
It better have swingin flav, like Das EFX babalu
Mr. Gizer, once again you're dealin with the Energizer
I might surprise ya, take time to realize the
potential essential, residential credentials
I might take things for granted, but I'm still presidential
The outstanding commander, full of charm and demanding
In the mix like a hit, so like Star Trek I'm scanning
So check the rhymes and check my stats
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back
I'm still the Delta
