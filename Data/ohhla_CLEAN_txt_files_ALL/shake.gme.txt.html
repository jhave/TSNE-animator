[Verse 1]
Yo gimme some fries and an extra large (Shake)
Bitch hurry up, I'm late for this meeting I gotta (Shake)
I'm in the McDonalds drive through about to roll up this (Shake)
Gotta pee so bad nigga doing the Harlem (Shake)
I was rollin my blunt and seen my side mirror (Shake)
Thought it was my speakers then seen this nigga's body (Shake)
Man I'm on probation muthfucker I'm bout to (Shake)
Fuck them fires and that (Shake)
Niggaz thought that Earthquakes was the only thing that (Shake)
You can get your ass popped over the way that dice (Shake)
I bought Dre to the Hood the driver was ready to (Shake)
Guess he aint seen a real Blood hand (Shake)
Or a crack fiend walking down the block with that (Shake)
Everybody got a family member with that (Shake)
That I'll come through and steal your TV and then (Shake)
Man fuck that TV cause channel 9 used to (Shake)
Couldn't watch Magic Johnson give Isiah that (Shake)
Now i got a plasma on my wall that bitch don't (Shake)
But that bitch in my bed got them double D's that (Shake)
And an ass like Trina when I smack it it (Shake)
And thats why I like it doggy style cos you can see that shit (Shake)
Neighbors hitting on the ceiling cos I make that bed (Shake)
Landlord said I make too much noise I gotta (Shake)
Oh shit my baby mommy called and bitch you gotta (Shake)
We was about to get it on to that Kelis milk (Shake)
I gotta hit it one more time before a nigga (Shake)
I'mma fuck this bitch until her knees start to (Shake)
Face in the pillow ass up let me see you (Shake)

[Chorus]
What ya momma gave you like that bitch (Shake)
What ya momma gave you throw it back now (Shake)
What ya momma gave you let the World see it (Shake)

[Verse 2]
Me and fifty aint agree on shit so I had to (Shake)
Aint no telling what he putting in that protein (Shake)
Seen the candy shop video look at this nigga (Shake)
And thats the same shit that made the nigga Young Buck (Shake)
I'm surprised that Lloyd Banks and Yayo didn't (Shake)
Wasn't selling no records Jimmy Iovine said (Shake)
Only Black Eyed Pea's making the white folks (Shake)
I drop off my album and make the whole World (Shake)
Hit the Valet grab my Ferrari and then (Shake)
It's an automatic start my keys don't (Shake)
Unless they headed out of town when the Greyhound (Shake)
Going down to Miami where the Palm tree's (Shake)
She see the cops she know the drop that Louie bag (Shake)
Why you calling my phone you know the routine (Shake)
Bitch lost my bricks my Pimp hand bout to (Shake)
Make my money back bitch even if you gotta (Shake)

[Chorus]
What ya momma gave you like that bitch (Shake)
What ya momma gave you throw it back now (Shake)
What ya momma gave you let the World see it (Shake)</pre>
