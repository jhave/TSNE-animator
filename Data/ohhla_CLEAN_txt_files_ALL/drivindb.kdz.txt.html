[Intro: Masta Ace]
Driving down the block, like what else should a brother do?
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you

[Chorus: Masta Ace]
Driving down the block, Low End, Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape, bass, bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking

[Naledge overlapping chorus]
What up Double-O?
I'm just swerving maynnne
You know what it is, we back at it again
I'm just tipping maynnne
Uh-huh
I'm just swerving maynnne
I'm just tipping

[Verse 1: Naledge]
[Driving down the block] It's the flicker of the year
Flicker on my ear make a hater shed a tear
When I'm [driving down the block]
Got my seat on recline, turn up the Alpine with the
[Bass crazy kicking] [Driving down the block]
See my black lady gossip
Passenger side with my hand on her thigh, while I'm
[Driving down the block] chuck a deuce to the sky
For the boppers in the stands rubber necking on my ride
[Driving down the block] My Low End Theory tape in
Playing number six "Show Business" is my shit, when I'm
[Driving down the block] bass kicking man sorta like Fred A-do
And I'm looking blessed like I said A-choo
I'm so damn clean, polo rugby and Jordan 16s while I'm
[Driving down the block] wifey feeling intimate
Park up at the lake and turn the car into a cigarette

[Chorus: Masta Ace]
Driving down the block, Low End, Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape, bass, bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking

[Naledge overlapping chorus]
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round

[Verse 2: Naledge]
Polo on my back, Nike on my heels
D's on my Caddy, nigga I'm so trill
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Low End Theory tape cause I'm so hip-hop, when I'm
[Driving down the block] lights, camera, spotlight
Feel like the Howard marching band at the stop light
Yeeeaah, my car like a shop right?
Got cheese, got bread, yea yea I shop right
On stoney in the turning lane tipping
Down 87, my presence is a present
Pimp in my own mind, bumping my music
Brainiac dumb dumb, got a degree stupid!
[Driving down the block] I'm stunting like David Blaine
Oh look, it's Major Payne sorta like Damon Waynes
Girls fantasize bout having labor pains
Cuz they see my ride and they thinking that I make it rain
Got a Cadillac car and a dream girl
Merrily merrily, my life is a dream world
Two miles an hour so everybody see me
Belly on the TV, if only you could be me

[Chorus: Masta Ace]
Driving down the block, Low End, Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape, bass, bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking

[Naledge overlapping chorus]
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round

[Verse 3: Naledge]
How about me and youuu
Hit the store and get some brewww
Then we gonna go and cop some drooo
Call some hoes headed straight to the mo
I said me and youuu
You can go call ya homegirls too (bring ya friends)
Then we gonna go cop some drooo (bring my friends)
Then we headed out straight to the mo-mo-mo-mo (and we can be friends)

[Chorus: Masta Ace]
Driving down the block, Low End, Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape, bass, bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Open up the trunk, ba-bass crazy kicking
Driving down the block, Low-Low End Theory tape in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking

[Naledge overlapping chorus]
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my car go round and round (uh-huh)
See the wheels on my truck go round

[outro: Double-O]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
This goes out to all my people
Who love that freedom when they behind the wheel
Whether you doing it for fun, or whether you doing it for work, enjoy it
What I want you to do right now
I want you to push that seat a couple clicks back
And I want you to turn that radio up, play ya favorite joint

[Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking]
[Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking]
[Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking]
[Open up the trunk, op-open up the trunk]</pre>
