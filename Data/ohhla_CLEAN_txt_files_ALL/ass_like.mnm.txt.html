[Eminem] Oww ba-byy!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!
I don't believe it, it's almost to good to be true
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!

[Eminem]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying FREEZE - D-DOING DOING DOING
What do you mean freeze?  Please, I'm a human being
I have needs, I'm not done, not til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&amp;B
I sing song, it go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Psych I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed!
If I offend, I'm sorry, please please forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away anything I say and you will love it!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so tempting
Nick I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV my pee-pee goes
D-DOING DOING DOING!

[Eminem]
Mary Kate and Ashley used to be so handsome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying FREEZE - D-DOING DOING DOING
What do you mean, freeze?  GEEZ, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see, Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy? 
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh cause there's a puppet on my hand

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!
Hilary Duff is, not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen her - butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!

[Eminem]
The way she moves she dances like a go-go
In that video she sings get out your puzzle
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying FREEZE - D-DOING DOING DOING
What do you mean freeze?  My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet is that a breast?  I think I just saw a tit
Psych I joke, I joke, I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-DOING DOING DOING!

[Dr. Dre] THE FUCK IS WRONG WITCHU?
[Eminem] HA!!</pre>
