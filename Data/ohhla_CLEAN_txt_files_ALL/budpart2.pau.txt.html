(Lord Infamous)
The J the O the I-N-T
The, the, the J the O the I-N-T
The, the, the J the O the I-N-T
The B the, the, the U the, the, the D

{Verse 1: Lord Infamous}
I feel the need fa the biggidy Bud Man, Flick a flame
Then I take a puff
Life is kinda hazy when ya in the back of the Ithaca
Niggaz be thinkin the Scarecrow is gonna go crazy
The way I be cheifin that blink
Quarter ounce of Ink and a blink
Thats Banana lick
See I feel the urge fa the motha fuckin herb
The cure is to pure, takin niggaz to the curb
Word, top-crop why not? Motha fuckin chronic
The whole world is spinnin yo this shit is fuckin hypnotic
Bud smoke is like a killer, keepin that glass up in they chest
Killaz is rollin that blunt up with that motha fuckin budda bless
Grain, broccolli, tar sticks
Yo my nigga I cant forget the dutches, black clutches
Stashes of fuckin onion, and if ya want all ya brain cells dead
Get you a bag of the Cambodia Red
Since I keep most of the bless on the track I wanna know Blac...
Where the bud at?

[Chorus]
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? Where is the bud?
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud
Where is the bud? We lookin for the bud

{Verse 2: Lord Infamous}
Called up the hooker, wanna get a ounce of pine wheat
Hopin that the Narcotics dont creep up behind me
Cant have the one-timers takin down the killers
Those bitches be bustin a nigga
Because we be havin the paraphanilia
Went and got some bags, to stack up the stash
Blowin on a meg joint of that Cuban Hash
And when we hit that bitch we dont leave shit but ash
Now its time to hit the cut and make a little cash
All sold out I heard my hook-up just got busted
Cant find the bud and I'm gettin real disgusted
Callin up my homies tryna find a new connection
Lookin for the marijuana in every direction
And, most of the motha fuckaz dont wanna give a nigga a straight package
Otha motha fuckaz got the flake ass cabbage, babbage
Lookin fa tha niggaz with the fat pregnance
So, so, yo Blac, yo Blac...
Man, Where the bud at?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
