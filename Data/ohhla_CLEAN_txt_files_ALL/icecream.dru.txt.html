Man I'm outa cream 
Get your ice cream, ice cream
Not Ice-T not Ice Cube, ice cream
Thangs have thangs
Q P's, zippers what ever you need 
Hard, soft get your ice cream
Ice cream
Ice cream

Well its the ice cream bitch don't you hear the music
I got the shit fiends want, holla at me when they use it
I got shit sold, I pimp those broke ass nymphoes
Got them sukin dick in pintos
I guarantee its not a soda rock
You can bring cash money foo
Stamp so we can swap
Stolen goods for a fat ass dum dum
I sweep the things from they feet with a broom
I rush to the spot where schools of the dope fiends have seen
And they pass other fools up
Nigga jealous cause I got good crack cola
While their shit is packed with baking soda
I'm on the bandwagon why not
Niggaz sayin they got the same shit I got
Its because I'm takin the money
Cause I got my shit from bounty
With a little bit of cut in it
All you got is a couple of bucks
Go head and spend it
It's all good
But money aint all good
Cause a raw deal will get your ass at the Wackerweel
My niggaz don't have any bucks wit em 
Cause of that I don't fuck wit em
I don't fuck with them homies
Cause some of them don't know me 
When they tell me what the deally
For a sack of buddha
A got that motherfuckin thing
Niggaz jump to they feet 
When they hear the music in the street
Get your can get your can can get your can
Rush to the van so you can catch the ice cream man
Bitch don't you hear the music


Well it's the Coca Cola man bitch 
Can't beat the feelin
One the real thing yeah you know I got green
So come on huddle
Give me ten or twenty dollarz
So I can give you rocks or do you want powder
What ever you get I bet it's the shit
Niggaz know I ripped this shit 
Up to the fullest
It keep the dope fiends comin and comin 
Now they runnin 
Up to a niggaz spot
Its making me hot
I'm about to go sit
I'm goin crazy wit this shit
I'm grindin 
I'm sleeepin trough the night
I'm watching tricky treats
Cause they might beat me 
Ugh, I look out my window with my glock
God damn damn I see holes in my van
Checkin them niggaz on a corner
You ponk ass niggaz 
That's why I'm in the house with tha Cola
And some cash stacked to the top
I got more money fool that will make me plock plock
No hesitation and no fear
My observation is to make a milli year
Yeah, and them some daddy will let me his doughtier
I'm bothered by this square nigga
Well I'm a work a 25 and you can keep that
Hand me a half sack so I can fill that
Nigga I'm a ride long and super fat jack
Cause I'm a dope dealer motherfuckin cream seller
People ask who I am 
Tell them tha Cola Man

I need to chop up some cream
Cause the sunshine is bright as fuck
Knocks blowin up my shit 
Cause they missed the ice cream truck
Cut up a half and rushed the post
UUU shit, but they don't sweat me cause I look like a school kid
But still I'm watching my back 
Cause they will gaffle, pressin my lucks
Slangin right by the hill castle
I got that cream and niggaz get jealous
But I don't play that 
I got my gap hittin it in the cut
My bundle hittin of quick
Shit, I got glamour
Takin the glock from niggaz with arm and hammer
Come hear take this glock
I'm sure the nigga will love it 
Bring my money up
I'm on alert when I work
But they forever try to get me
Cause I got my kids posted up wit me
That's what I got, I run in the spot, because I advertise
Plus I got the humongous rocks, soda for blocks
Nigga I got more locks then Goldilocks
It's time to make my rounds black
The cops are getting hopeful
I sense they jacked so I get mobile
I got two pop cicles and a cookie left
Shucks, I got myself nine bucks
Cause I give no credit, and I mean that 
You wont see that nigga until next month
And when he come to spend
For himself, but he be claming that he comin for somebody else
I had to let him underdstand
It's soooo haaaard tooo saayyy gooood byyyee to the ice cream man</pre>
