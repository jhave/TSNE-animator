[Hook]
Uh, uh yeah, yeah, oh
Rap's new generation, N-n-next g-gen-gene-generation
Rap's new generation
Rap's new generation, N-n-next g-gen-gene-generation

[Jo Jo Pellegrino]
Well, say hello to the rap Al Capone, south with pone
Tommy gun duck fitted to my mouth is chrome
Don't get it backwards, Stuck Shore South is home
Pelle who, soon to be caked out and blown
Boss of the bosses, Pricehead, Soldier apparel
Read the paper in my bed robe like Tony Soprano
Throw em' all in the bottomless pit
For rockin' bowling shoes, talk about rocks and shit

[Cadillac Tah]
Yo, you bitch niggas is prey, time pay
I leave you shrumped in this five coupe [* Errr *]
Faggot nigga I slide through
Any hood representin' my set, generation is new
But I wear this tech like a vest
Spit and tear up ya vest
D-A double D for that dough
Hit em' where it hurt most
You niggas ain't comin' close
I run up, gun up, hit you and ya done up, playa you ghost
We killers, Violator, Murderer niggas

[Hook]

[R.C.]
It's the violator, clip changer, mix the mayor
Got trick eight to throw more kisses than Jada
And a bitch serve the guard properly
She give me blows under the belt like a dirty boxer
It's R. Cadillac's on twenty-twos
And jewels that give you cataracts, bitch who you foolin'
They gave me eight bars, no room to breathe
And eight darts nigga, no one to leave

[Fabolous]
I come out with fire
Stop, drop, roll out the booth
Th rims come out the tires
I stop, hop fall off the roof
Only thing you should know is that's them hoin'
This playa comin' back with the 4-5, like M. Jordan
It's spelled with a capital F
See everything from the sweater to the scarf to the capital F
Now with the hoodrats, I'm like the rappin' Hugh hef
Better known as F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

[Hook]

[Fortune]
It's time to seperate the oil from the cut and gotten the pot
So when the flame rise niggas gon' respect what's hot
Four chain glock on em' with no warning
Leave ya hood like a circle with no corners
Made dough with the pot, heatin' and raisin'
Been around more pies than sweet potatoes
Violators, big dogs respect the line
Niggas act, I'ma tear em' up in the club like Shyne

[Remy Martin]
Y'all know if I spill sixteen it's a massive commodity
[* Machine Gun Firing *]
So I'ma just lay eight and etch the bodies
Everybody knows who's the hottest bitch
And that's why I'm the only bitch on this shit
And any ho that chu' know love Rem and Nick
Cause I spit as if I had a dick
This rap shit I done mastered it, 8-ball assassin chick
Wanna give it to me but they know I'm not havin' it
