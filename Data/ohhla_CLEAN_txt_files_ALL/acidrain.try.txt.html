[Verse 1 - Pastor Troy]
(C'Mon!)
The pain enhances the misery swells (C'Mon!)
I'm screamin' ya name from a mountain in hell (C'Mon!)
I'm so low that the grounds above me (Yeah!)
It seems as if no one cares to love me (C'Mon!)
Maybe I'm crazy, addicted to pain (Yeah!)
Maybe the cocain destroyed my brain (Yeah!)
Private conversations with +Kurt Cobain+ (Yeah!)
I'm drownin' my fears in the acid rain (Oh, Yeah!)

[Hook - Sky]
Numonic intentions take ova your mind
Like leaping from a building for the 50th time
Stay away from drugs little boys and girls
Unless you wanna live in the under world
2x -- (The under world, the under world. Unless you wanna live in the
under world.) -- 2x

[Verse 2 - Pastor Troy]
(C'Mon!)
The sun goes down as the darkness prevails (C'Mon!)
Loss of conversation with Jezebel (C'Mon!)
Shes so high always treatin' her nose (Yeah!)
Her blood runs black when her cycle flows (C'Mon!)
Maybe I'm psyched-out for laying her down (Yeah!)
Knowin' she's been with every man in town (Yeah!)
Maybe I'm hellbound for living insane (C'Mon!)
I'm drowning my pain in the acid rain (C'Mon!)

[Hook - Sky]

[Verse 3 - Sky]
(C'Mon!)
All of the heartaches and all of the pain (Yeah!)
All of the tear drops from acid rain (Yeah!)
Theres one drop gone cuz they think I'm insane (C'Mon!)
It's all in my mind with the use of cocaine (C'Mon!)
Like drinkin prefusily and flying a plane (Yeah!)
So intoxicated I can't stay in my lane (Yeah!)
Private conversations with Kurt Cobain (Yeah!)
Drownin' my fears in the acid rain
