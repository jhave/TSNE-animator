(Check it)
To all my ladies (What?)
Who wants to ride my pony? (Ginuwine, what?)
To all my honeys (Uh)
Who wants to ride my pony? (Timbaland, uh what?)
To all my babies (Remix)
Who wants to ride my pony?
(Remix, what?)
To all my ladies
Who wants to?

[Timbaland]
Check it out baby
Let me tell you
Come on and ride this horse
You will see we gonna stay on course
Don't try to fight the force
I wanna hear your voice, girl
Come on and get with me
A real true O-G
Straight from the V-A-V
Yeah, here to set you free
Yeah baby call me perv
I wonder do you serve, uh
Check out your curves
Making our bodies merge
I'm just a real brother
My name is Timbaland
I wanna hold your hand
Want to be your man

[Ginuwine](Timbaland)
I'm just a bachelor
I'm looking for a partner (Uh, uh)
Someone who knows how to ride
Without even falling off (What?)
Gotta be compatible
Takes me to my limits (Word up)
Girl when I break you off (What?)
I promise that you won't want to get off
(No doubt)

1 - 	[Ginuwine]
        If you're horny lets do it
	Ride it my pony
	My saddle's waiting
	Come and jump on it
	If you're horny lets do it
	Ride it my pony
	My saddles waiting
	Come and jump on it

[Ginuwine](Timbaland)
(Freaky, freaky)
Sitting here flossing (What?)
Peepin' your steelo (Say what?)
Just once if I have the chance (Yeah)
The things I would do to you
You and your body
Every single portion
Send chills up and down your spine
Juices flowing down your thigh baby

Repeat 1

[Timbaland]
Breakdown
Yeah we're gonna ride
Uh, uh do you wanna ride?
Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Say what? Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Say what?
Do you wanna ride?
Ginuwine

[Ginuwine](Timbaland)
If we're gonna get nasty baby
First we'll show and tell
'Till I reach your pony tail, oh
(Say what? Say what? Say what?)
Lurk all over and through you baby
(Can you feel us?)
Until we reach the stream
(Can you feel us?)
You'll be on my jockey team, ooh (Uh)

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
