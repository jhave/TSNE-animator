[CHORUS]
I did it like this
I did it like that
I did it like this
I did it like that
I did it like this
I did it like that
Now Ugly Duckling's gonna take you back
I did it like this
I did it like that
I did it like this
I did it like that
I did it like this
I did it like that
Now Andy Cooper's gonna take you back

To the planet, rock
I used to produce hip-hop
Poundin' rhythms with my hands on my school desk top
'Till my teacher would make me stop
I'd wait for recess
Then I'd beat ? at a ?? contest
At home I'd slide across my kitchen floor
Doing moonwalks
All I needed was my windbreaker and some new socks
Not to mention the extension cord adapter
To attatch a little radio that was my ghetto blaster
I remember making my first songs, no sound board
Just messin with the tape deck pressin record
And Pause
There were flaws in the tape and hiss
But now I'm an Ugly Duckling and do it like this
We take a beat in a rap
And then delete it to track
Then keep repeating it back
'Till it's completed intact
So that the people react
Out of they seat and they clap
From the petite to the fat
On every street on the map
So when my brother laughed and my dad said it was a fad
I went into my room with a pen and a pad
And wrote a little rap about my fat cat
Now I'm the cat with the fat rap
And I did it like that

[CHORUS]

When I rapped with this cat named Jafette
Doin vocals through the headphones, live to casette
Low tech
I could get out a dodge to Tahiti
When I wrote grafiti in the garage
I hide like camoflauge in my cubicle
Workin' my fingers to the cuticle
To turn the ugly beautiful
And it was undisputable
The unknown,
So we always had to fight to get the microphone
And perform in the dorm
Backyard or Gym
We've rocked the coffe shop for a crowd of ten
Just plug the tables in to any PA
Long Beach, CA
Einstein's the DJ
My motto's been bravado since the ?
But now it's ugly duckling and there's no one else to follow
Me and Andy C tag team and hand slap
Yeah I did it like this
And I did it like that
