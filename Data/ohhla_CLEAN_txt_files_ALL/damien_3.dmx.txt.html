[Verse One]
  Hey yo D, it's your nigga D
Uh-huh
  What the fuck, you forgot about me?
  You've been eatin real good lately
  Didn't get a shout out on your last album, what you hate me?
Arrrf
  Said I was your dog
  Said I was your nigga that let you see it all through the fog
Arrrf
  Said I was your mans and them
  And any problem that you had I would handle them
Aiyyo dog it's like this, I fuck with you lightly (uh-huh)
Cause I knew if I fucked with you too deep you'd bite me (uhh)
Get mad at me, send niggaz wantin to fight me (uhh)
Whole time you fucked with me you didn't like me
  Oh where you hear that?
Pssh, niggaz talk
Plus you know how shit flow in New York
Walls have ears, buildings heard
Supposed to be shhhhhh but spill the word

[Chorus]
Everywhere that I go, everything that I see
Every place that I touch I feel him fuckin with me
I'm gonna fly.. arrrf
  Why you lie?  Told me it was Ryde or Die
I'm gonna fly.. arrrf
  Eye for an eye - what happened to my piece of the pie?

[Verse Two]
  Now dog, you know me better than that
  I could put you ahead of the pack, instead of the back
  I could have niggaz sellin tapes, instead of the crack
  Could have niggaz fallin down, with lead in they back
  Ain't much that I can't do when I want to
  I don't really need you, nigga fuck you
WHAT?!
  Nah I'm just playin, got a wife and kids
  Little Dame ain't come across dem triflin kid
Yo what you mean by that?
  Mean by what?
Youse a grimy nigga f'real, I see whassup
I don't even know why I fucked with you from the door
  Cause you know I can give you what you wanted and more
I coulda got it from him
  But you woulda hate to wait
But I wouldn't have the weight
  C'mon, don't hate
  What happened to the right hand, Light Man?
Nah that's Dark Man
  Well let's get it right then

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Now I see for who you are, it's like I know you (uh-huh)
So I can't trust you as far as I can throw you (uhh)
Oh you, don't know you are the reason
that I go through what I go through, let me show you
  Didn't I promise you a Benz, lots of friends
  Countless pairs of Timbs, these endless ends?
But what did it cost me? (c'mon)
My life to be taken softly, man BACK THE FUCK UP OFF ME
  Don't fuck with me like that when I fuck witchu like this
Don't come at me like that when you know that you might miss
Go on about your business
If any cat you send me way, ain't gon' be no witness
LORD JESUS
  C'mon dog, look who you're fuckin
PLEASE HELP ME
  Whassup dog?  Man you buggin
KEEP THE DEVIL
  Thug life, thought we were tight
OUT OF MY LIFE
  I'll be back aight?  Psych

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
