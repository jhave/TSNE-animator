[Intro: Fabolous]
You know it's funny? People on the outside don't really get what's goin on
But they always got somethin to say, ha ha! Yeah!

[Chorus: Fabolous]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting  (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse One: Fabolous]
South Beach spend time there, off shore is my time where
Whole crew got they own watch nigga we ain't buyin no time shares
The lifestyle, too fly, my new bitches get next flighted
I say I'm back to the old me but my old bitches will get excited
I ain't goin back I'm steppin forward don't test me, been preppin forward
Got no time for that hatin shit, my young niggas got weapons for it
Got Chief Keefs that ain't shopped that bang bang that blocka (Blocka)
And all you niggas is blockers, change your name to Ibaka
Shit real shit been real and shit just get realer
I'm showin bitches my car keys then ask 'em what's the dealer?
They sayin that's yo' girl ain't sayin shit like prank callers
'Cause this a small world and hoes make it even smaller

[Chorus: Fabolous]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting  (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse Two: Pusha T]
It's beach weather over here nigga, sky's clear nigga
That's flip flops that's Americana that's Hilfiger
Yacht masters at the yacht party, sittin at the dock is a dropped 'rarri
That's Pole Position with the joystick, that's push button that's like Atari
Rays in the bar no parallel, so many hostess carousel
How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow seat Carolyn
Maryland, tags on it, heroin, bags on it
Hermes, throw pillows with Sony couch and it clash on it
Take a look in my view find to see seven figures and two commas
See bad bitches see blue diamonds I see saws I two timer
Gigolo, juggle hoes, jigsaw I puzzle those
Crosswords, cross birds I cross country with a couple those

[Chorus: Fabolous]
It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting  (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
When the sun is out we runs about, let the world see what these hundreds 'bout 
Ain't seen this since the ones was out, with Jay, Pimp-C and Bun, we out there
Still pimpin that B.I.G. lookin at jig, somebody go call Hype Willie
We need slow mo', mo' rose mo', niggas is drunk and type silly
We dancin like Dame, holdin up chains
Look, got P.M.B'S on a big ass boat on molly rollin up jane
This life, is so exciting, that money be so invited
So fuck what their indicting tell my lawyers keep on fighting 

[Chorus: Fabolous]
For the life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting  (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting  (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting (WOO!)
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby</pre>
