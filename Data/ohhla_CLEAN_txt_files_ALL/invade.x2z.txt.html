[Intro: Jelly Roll]
This, cannot continue
We must go, our sep-arate waaaaays
Without youuuuu, I can do betterrrrr
But first these words, I have, to, saaaaay
It's nooooot, that I don't hear youuuuu
When you scream, and curse, my, naaaaame
It's juuuuust that I, don't feeeeeeel you
Nigga you, invade, my spaaaaaaace

[Xzibit]
YEAH!
Blacked out, tatted up, let's go, saddle up
I'm alge-ballin, dumb niggaz cain't add it up
Cock back, back 'em up, fuck what you throwin up (yeah)
All these rappers comin out, ain't nobody showin up
Man, where your talent at?  Show me where your balance at
You the king of the streets?  Well I ain't heard none of that
Just like the South say, watch what your mouth say
Frank Sinatra hustle, Rat Pack, +Did it My Way+
I know we don't see eye to eye, you ain't never lied
We should part ways 'fore somebody catch a homicide
Recognize, lost of a lot of love when my momma died
Did a gang of shhhhit, I'm surprised that I'm still alive
Fishburn yellin wake up, open up my eyes
Don't believe them lies from them guys that you idolize
Ridicule, try to downplay, try to minimize
And criticize when you on your grind so I realized

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
This cannot continue, we must go our separate waaaaays
Without you I'll do better, but first these words I have to saaaaay
It's not that I don't hear you, when you scream and curse my naaaaame
It's just that I don't feel you, nigga you invadin my spaaaaace

[Xzibit]
Go ahead spit it out, that's right, get it out
So I can respond, nigga FUCK what you talk about
Drop like a guillotine, money over everything
seems to be the theme in the land of the Philistine
Mentally you still shackled up on some lame shit
Side by side on the bottom of a slave ship
Came a long way from the place that I started from
Ever seen a man's last breath beaten out of him?
Hate manifest from the inside out
The shit starts in your heart then spill out your mouth
I'm the odd man out, watch it all pan out
I see you tryin to stand up but you don't stand out (ha ha ha!)
Now that I found that my path is original
Prepared, never scared, had to peak at my pinnacle (yeah)
I'm not like you, but you think we identical
It's pitiful, you can never bang with the criminal

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Three wheels lock it up, ammo stock it up
It's not for niggaz cause George Bush comin after us
That's why it's time to roll, get where I gotta go
All my people fightin for they soul, you are not alone
Never waste my pearls on the swine and the ignorant
Forever on my grind, you despise and belittle it
Here's a little tidbit, X rock that real shit
Dump like a L.A.P.D. cop, over kill shit
Hooked on a brand new high called monopolize
Put you on track where you just, you was out of line
And I ain't got the time to fuck around with the dumb shit
You know that young shit, the "Hey nigga where you from" shit
Even though the pistol in my hand, I'm a businessman
People grow apart, don't expect you to understand
Let's part ways and, then pray for better days
I realize somebody 'bout to die, so I came to SAY

[Chorus]

[Xzibit] + (Jelly Roll)
Yeah, knowhatI'msayin? (you invadin my spaaaaace)
Yeah, stop askin where the fuck I'm at
Yeah (nigga you invadin my spaaaaace)
Tryin to see where I'm at, tryin to be where I'm at all the fuckin time
C'mon (you invadin my spaaaaace)
Get a life nigga, heheheh
I got mines, know'mtalkinbout? (nigga you invadin my spaaaaace)
C'MON!</pre>
