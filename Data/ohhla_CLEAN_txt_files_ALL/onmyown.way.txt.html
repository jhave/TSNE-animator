Um uh um uh here we go now

(Hook) Repeat
It's because I'm all on my own, now
You can leave him out hear alone, now
Ya'll need to really watch ya'll tone
Now you see the chrome
Im a blast it for ya I'm a blast it for ya

(Verse 1)
It's Freeway all by myself
I'm in da place all on my own
In da club wit the chrome
While ya'll nigga's gotta leave it at home
Ya'll haters better leave it alone
Before you meet wit ya DEATH
Back up off me
Put ya keys in the ig-nition
Start the rolling gap, scrap, befoere I calp
Bang out like a western
Found out where you live at
Pay ya spot a visit
Listen
Free to frosty, back up off me
Before you get bury
Carry the mover
Extra rounds to get the clowns up of me
Ya'll act scary, You act like losers, check, check
State Prop in ya neighborhood
Roc in ya spot, spot roc when you let us in
Free got things locked in ya neighborhood
Roc's on ya block, Free servin they medicine

(Hook) Repeat

(Verse 2)
Roof less like a shot from a cannon
Free is in affect and will stayin datein
Yall, baby momas should have warned you	
Cause they seen it on the bed
when she came over the crib
Now they don't really wanna get the k involed
Cause we are gonna put this thang to ya head
The whole click pull chicks don't brag	
Tell em freeway sad if it ain't bout head
Go head, you think its bout change go change
Put on ya shit(uh-huh), hop in a cab (yeah)
Meanwhile free stuck in a lab
Earning my grip, youngin's huggin' the strip
Freeway move rhymes like dimes move hits like nicks
On ya mind like all the time
On ya station like heavy rotation
Used to be on my grind like on the line

(Hook) Repeat

(Verse 3)
Bee Bop at the Roc we don't stop
Boom Boom Tang my gang we move thangs
And I put up the Range, the hoopty flow through ya block
Ice cover my watch ya eyes stuck on the change
What you thought its the Roc
Wit my people from St. Lou
Jack Frost, Jack Frost
Up in the bang-o, the wrist froze
Grip O's
Roc-a-Fella pitbull snatch every bitch on ya block
Yall prick need to back up off me
Keep ya distance, cause my smithin on seveice
Whats ya order slugs on the menu
Shut the shop down on purpose, work this
Four-fifth like I'm runin' for prez
I peel lead have you runin' from shots
Go tell ya block ya block start wit the kid
Kid kidnap ya pops

(Hook) Repeat

Shit back up off me
Keep ya distance, cause my smithin on seveice
Whats ya order slugs on the menu
Shut the shop down on purpose, work this

Back up off me
Keep ya distance, cause my smithin on seveice
Whats ya order slugs on the menu
Shut the shop down on purpose, work this ho

(Repeat till fade)
Ho, and another one
ho and another one ho and another one</pre>
