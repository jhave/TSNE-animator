(Ludacris talking)
J.E. y'all (yeah), y'all know (uh huh)
Yeah, yeah, check this out, we gon' let y'all in on a little southern lingo
You know what I'm sayin, check it out
(Cut somethin, cut somethin, cut somethin, you cut somethin)
(Cut somethin on the low-low), check it out

(Ludacris)
Cut a nigga from the low-low
Or better, cut a nigga from the So So
I heard you cut a nigga from the D-T-P
Got DDT'd, I'm kinda sparked in the D-E-C
See we be sittin on Low Pro's, ship them fuckas in by the boatloads
Not too many people that could see this cheese, better run these g's
Ludacris and the pimp emcees, J.E.!

(Jagged Edge)
To all of y'all who don't know, let me explain
What cuttin is and how it go, gotta know the game
'Cause you can say the wrong thing, to the wrong girl
With the wrong man and, (let's just say it might be a long night)
So the first thing you should know, is do she get down
Now if she's even feelin you, is she worth your while?
Had this girl I met the other day, she was feelin me
I was feelin her and I couldn't believe what she said

(Chorus)
She said "cut somethin", she looked at me, I looked at her
I said "ain't nothin", couldn't believe what I just heard
She was hot for me, I like my women kinda bold
She was uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, uh, uh
She said "cut somethin", I'm peepin you, you peepin me
So let's stop playin, she said "you ain't never had a girl like me"
Make you feel like this, sneak into the door after the show
Baby cut somethin, we should cut somethin, don't be scurred (scared)

She usually I never mess, with a girl who steps
Up to me before I, uh, even get the chance
Let a woman be a woman let, a man be
A man see, and that's the way I like it babe
Now always there's exceptions to, to every rule
This one had to let on in, she was kinda cool
She liked to do the things that men would really want
This is, what she, said

(Chorus)

I know that things have changed a lot
'Cause now when women go out, they be on the prowl harder than men
Know when I figured it out
When this girl walked up, she said "cut somethin", somethin
Ain't like I'm trippin about it
I just remember when a man could be a man baby
I still can't believe what she said

(Ludacris)
She said needed me to beat it and beat it, beat it then skeet it
She greeted with an open tongue, the Coke and Rum got her so excited
She's screamin at the top of her lungs, she just can't hide it
I'm poppin her gums, cock my popular gun
Shoot, shoot, lick, lick, from the head to the toes
Head to the flo', head 'til it ain't no head no mo'
Cut 'til it ain't no bed no mo', cut 'til ya pussy don't beg no mo'
Jagged Edge, grabbin legs, women in the mornin scramblin eggs
Cookin meals, makin bills, and I gotta tell you what she said

(Chorus)</pre>
