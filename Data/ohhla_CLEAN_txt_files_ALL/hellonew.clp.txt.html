[Chorus - Pharrell Williams]
Hello new world, here we come
On them Twinkie tres, with the hood screaming
"We on our way!"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming
"I'm on my way!"
Yes I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming
"It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say "Lookout World
I'm on my way!"

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
I listen to the beat, and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the higher dough
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Ohhh!)
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fuckin plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, +Floetry+
"Say yes!" niggaz hear the "Eghck!" and they know its me
Make âem sick to their stomach how they s'posta be
Sippin on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where its s'posta be
Funny how my neighbors don't think its where I'm s'posta be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roofs on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams/(Malice)]
Hello new world, here we come
On them Twinkie tres, with the hood screaming
"We on our way!"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming
"I'm on my way!"
Yes I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming (Yeah!)
"It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say (From my hood to say) "Lookout World
I'm on my way!"

[Verse 2 - Malice]
This goes out to my Hyalites that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nike's, hustlers' way of life
In white T's, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumpin that D arm, readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin, stay lookin, over they shoulders
Holdin them boulders, tryin to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at âcha quote, unquote "Famous Rapper"
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine; I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign  cars, stick shift,6 gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
But the judge is saying "Life" like it ain't someone's life

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams]
Hello new world, here we come
On them Twinkie tres, with the hood screaming
"We on our way!"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming
"I'm on my way!"
Yes I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming
"It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say "Lookout World
I'm on my way!"

[Man talking]
Yo, what up? What up? This ya man Grinding, from downtown Norfolk.
Just want y'all to know its about time For us to come up and make a change man.
They keep tryin to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be man.
Its about time for us to get it together man.
Ery'body else get they shit together
Why the niggaz can't get they shit together, and get they money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers
Know what I'm sayin? This ain't just for the playas in VA...
This for playas all over the world!
This Grinding!

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
Times-a-wasting, niggaz doin so much hatin
Free ya heart, and show ya greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggaz rise up!
Get that money, put them 9s up
Piggy-back out the ghetto âfor times up!
Niggaz rush!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams]
Hello new world, here we come
On them Twinkie tres, with the hood screaming
"We on our way!"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming
"I'm on my way!"
Yes I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming
"It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say "Lookout World
I'm on my way!"</pre>
