[Timbaland]
Gotta meet somewhere baby, hey, hey

We fuss, we fight, yo' fault, my fault
We was on the same team at least that's what I thought
We both participated only I got caught
Now we hardly conversate and baby we don't talk
It was fun at first, you can't say I'm wrong
Now you wanna talk about it? Too late, I'm gone
You mad at me cause I don't wanna play yo' games
I ain't perfect but I'ma do my thing (we gotta meet in the middle)
Huh, you here I'm dere
Tell me what's the sense of me tryin if you don't care?
This relationship is headed to who knows where
That means one of us got to chose
Because you hurt me, and I hurt you
You complain about the things that I don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
Because we got too much to loose

[Chorus: Timbaland]
We gotta meet in the middle, meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, baby don't analyze
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle
We gotta meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
We gotta compromise, we gotta work it out this time
We need to see eye to eye, so let's meet in the middle

[Timbaland]
Hey, hey, we got somethin we can't enjoy
I'm sick of you tryin to play with me like I'm your toy
Mmm - you tried to run game, I saw
We got a lot of issues you got yours (we gotta meet in the middle)
Huh, you can't talk that shit
You can't travel to the future if you walk backwards
Once you walk out the door, you can't walk back in
We gotta find a way to solve it, think about our kids
Cause they in the middle - you wanna sing that song?
You won't need to cop a plea to say okay, I'm wrong
Thangs are gettin heavy but I still stay strong
I try to talk it over wit'chu when I coulda been gone
Because you hurt me, and I hurt you
You complain about the things that I don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
Because we got too much to loose

[Chorus]

[Bran'Nu]
I told you once, I told you twice
And now my shoulder's cold, like a block of ice
You playin games like you rollin dice
Hey what you know about a sacrifice? (Baby I've been in the middle)
I've been givin you more than a little
Had the ball then you double dribbled (I guess love is a riddle)
You never listen I don't ever get my point across
I washed your dirty drawers, you out with dirty broads
You did me dirty dog, cause youse a dirty dog
It's a curtain call, and I ain't mad at all
I gave you more than you deserve, I was worth it all
Bottom line hope you find what you searchin for
You hurt me so I hurt you
And I complain about the things that you don't do
And I don't wanna take the blame, neither do you
We got too much to loose

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bran'Nu]
Meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
And compromise, analyze
Eye to eye, meet in the middle
Meet in the middle
We gotta gotta meet in the middle
And compromise, gotta work it out this time
Gotta see eye to eye, meet in the middle</pre>
