Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

  Yo yo, what happened, how was it?
Pssh, it was incredible dawg, word up
  F'real, what happened?  What'd she do?
What she, what DIDN'T she do (f'real?)
Man I'ma tell you somethin man
They can talk about the bomb man

[girl]
I don't appreciate y'all talkin about me and I'm sittin right here

Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh.. uh-uh uh uh uh (okay)
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh uh-huh uh uh uh

[Heavy D]
Check me, see me, strictly, top shelf touch
Pushup, never, gator, pearl white
She looky looky at me all night
Up in Justin's, crushin them, feelin dead right
Watch Diggy, do it, just like Nike
Just like Mike, Soul Train or Sprite night
BET, MTV, dem CD
Pump me in yo' MPV, yo' Benz CD
Crooked eye, so what?  I'm still fly
Y'all wish y'all could be this, not 'til I die
Pardon me but the Carti' be, all over me
Chicks in Range Rovers, be beggin to come home with me
Y'all act like y'all can't recognize a player
When I come through throw yo' hands in the ay-ir
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And all the ladies say

[Chorus 2X: Heavy D]
Water, I like the way you do dat dhere
Cause when you do dat dhere, I wanna be right dhere (uh-huh)
(Heavy get down cause when you say like dat)
(I wanna play like dat, I hope it stay like dat)

[Heavy D]
For all the, true believers, you see that it's real
Exhale off yo' cheeba, I know how you feel
Ain't nuttin changed, I'm still the heat of the night
Bet you feelin it right, same Dwight, same mic
Still classic, only thing changed, new glasses
Oh, and new asses, can't forget dat now
How many many, not any any
Could ever touch D Daddy, got plenty pennies
And you can see D on yo' TV set
With somethin fabulous draped around his neck
I went from, nuttin to some'n, frontin to bluffin
To havin fancy vegetables like cabbage and carrots/karats
I went from Timex to Rolex, from no sex to mo' sex
Deep in the game like what? (Like what?)
And everybody know my name like what? (Like what?)
Like what? (Like what?) Like what? (Like what?)
And all the ladies say

[Chorus]

[Heavy D]
Imagine, Daddy baggy, shorties from beauty pageants
I had 'em braggin, like Heavy tried to talk to me
Whips exquisite, Benz wagon
Chicks do visit, I've been bangin pretty ones for free
Woo!  All up in you, like flu (what?)
And when I pass through you gon' shake yo' ass too
Back, it's the boss with the platinum cross
(Uh-huh uh-huh) Platinum Porsche, I'm goin platinum of course
Heavy keep you dance (you keep me dancin)
Do Heavy keep you movin (you keep me movin)
Ain't no, pretendin in me, shorty bring your fender to me
I'll have your face touchin your knees, now
Y'all act like y'all can't recognize a player
When I come through throw yo' hands in the ay-ir
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And all the ladies say

[Chorus]</pre>
