[Chorus: Krayzie Bone]
Indeed if I fall. Every time I'm fallin', fallin
Theres no doubt that god helps me rise
[That he do, that he do]
 
I said indeed if I fall. Every time I'm fallin', fallin
Theres no doubt god helps me rise
[That he do, that he do]
 
[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
With every day bullshit I'm goin' through 
I be hopin' to make it through another day
Lookin' for another day to live my life
And please get away
I stay high
With my gun paranoia so if they come
Then I dump, dump, dump
That really all I got for ya, this life is crazy 
I might go Krayzie if I'm down, don't let them break me
So I stop and I pray to god, O lord forgive my worthy life
And help me through this pain of mine 
 pray and I pray I pray
That I could just see the light a fly away, away, away, away
But I know I can call on when I'm all alone
When ever I fall, fall, fall
 
[Chorus] 2x
 
[Verse 2: Wish Bone]
Situation got me thinkin' was it worth this
And then it got me thinkin' cause I love this
Stay down and it'll work ya self at time don't be a slave by these choices in life
Everybody wants that miracle just so far from where I go and if its meant to be 
Then it comes fa show, fa show [ya know]
And I know, I know it gets hard some times 
But don't you give up its going to be better times if you believe just believe
 There's no tellin' what you receive 
If in proof just look at me, look at me, look at me
And you got to love this gift we been blessed with. I do
Number one and nobody can touch this you know
Gotta hit my knees and let them know I thank you wit out you
Where would I be 
Where would I go
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Ain't no tellin' what this life is bout' to bring
One day ya here the day next ya gone
That's way I try to live right
Don't want to live wrong
And no guarantee you gon' make it home
What go around come around
Everybody know its real when you speakin' tha carma
So do on to others like you want to be done like Mary J no more drama
Ima paper chaser believe that walkin' on the ground is where I plat my feet at
If it's not bout money don't need that
You can keep that gossip can't you see that
Stay locked on my mission 
Cuz most of these niggas in the world ain't thinkin' bout the future
Young black entrepreneur
And I'm out to get more
So baby open the door 
Nigga gotta let me in cuz I'm getting it again
And I said I was going to get dollars
And if it's not about cheese I holla
Fuckin' with a nigga that's way to pollish
And if the road get to rough imma stand my ground
Keep my faith and call on the lord
And I don't hafta worry no more
Even if I fall
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
Imma be a soldier 
Runnin' from gun shots for the day I see Jehovah
You think you know us
Even though you want to
Don't think I'm in it just because of crossroads
And grab a grammy and did nothing for my family
This artist is half ass and scared to tell the truth
And I'm heartless niggas and I think hes raising to you
To the fo who thought that someone was bullshitin
And admitin' you sayin' anything
Up lifting within' the distance that the kids that use to listen to the don 
Better prepare old English and essents of a mission never relied on county and prison
Messin' up my kitchen
Better be survive in you
Treated  these prisons 
Trinity is wating for you
Baby swallow and ride
And let me get a ride
 
[Chorus: Repeat until end of song]</pre>
