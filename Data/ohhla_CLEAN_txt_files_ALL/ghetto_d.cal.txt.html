[Hook:2x]
With this strength of ghetto dreamin'

[Verse 1 - Coo Coo Cal]
It's in the middle of the night of writing pages of this fool shit
I dreaming I got a mansion up in my pool lit
Drunk, which I'm cool wit
Bitches and techs on the deck
Hoes serving up champaigne not because of this game,
because I'm signin' their checks
We gettin' service underwater fag
Workers runnin' in-and-out,
buildin' up their clout, and I'm frontin' quarter slabs
Drop Jags in the driveway on hundred spokes
The workers like to floss me in front of hoes but they don't really though
Folks (?) at the front door wit uzis
Haters and coochies
Out to protect the flake and loochie
Fools be trippin' to see me climbin' up
Yeah nigga, clean as a bitch if you ain't trippin' about no dime and dust
Findin' us ain't hard, we ain't never ran
Niggaz gotta betta plan
Help that thang ain't bust fo the cheddar man
Who's got the betta hand, I do so I'm pullin' the trigga
My mouth is big, but my nuts are bigga

{Hook:4x} *in the background of chorus

[Chorus:2x - Mr. Lee]
You can high flyyyyy, when you ghetto dreamin'
You wanna another high, when you ghetto dreamin'
Niggaz walk the way you walk, when you ghetto dreamin'
You can have it if you don't, when you ghetto dreamin'

[Verse 2: - Coo Coo Cal]
It's in the middle of the day,
I'm gettin' drunk playin' the Play Station
Look at the time a playa's wastin'
Knowin' I need to be out paper chasin'
Wastin' time while my niggas do it
Caught up by the feds,
but in my head I break 'em out, and it ain't shit to it
Call up the real niggaz that'll hit the prisions and buck it up
Don't even attempt to tell the fake, cuz they'll just straight fuck it up
Straight through the front do' wit techs
Bringin' hella cops
Get back to mailin' rocks
and take us to his cellblock
We'll leave the warden in the dorm as a sittin' duck
So if the gay wanna go astray, then let them fags fuck
Me and my whodi often outtie up in a Lexus Coupe
Throwin' blows at eachother to grab a tech to see who's next to shoot
Floot the gas and lit the ass up on the tower guard
Drove the coupe thru the fence and got the paint scared
But hard-time we just ain't havin'
Me and my niggaz is coast-to-coast
For proposin' a toast, buckin' it back back

{Hook:4x} *in the background of chorus

[Chorus:2x - Mr. Lee]
You can high flyyyyy, when you ghetto dreamin'
You wanna another high, when you ghetto dreamin'
Niggaz walk the way you walk, when you ghetto dreamin'
You can have it if you don't, when you ghetto dreamin'

[Verse 3 - Coo Coo Cal]
It's bright and early in the mornin',
I'm sittin' down eatin' bacon and eggs
Thinkin' about fakin' the feds
Openin' up shop nigga, makin' the bread
Some like a top shop,
wit a drop-top and the whole bit
Imagine a broke nigga strugglin' wit some bawla shit
Now all them hoes that wouldn't give action and holdin' your jock tight
Just grip the switch and drop the ass at the stoplight
Just smash off on 'em, let 'em see you dip the corner
That'll tell that bitch you don' got rich and you don't really want 'em
Now I was payin' attention,
and eyes was squinchin' from the gold spokes
Not even the mention,
of the third demension, charmin' and gold to roll
See folks look, we don' came up but on the downlow
Somebodies accuse of clowin' hoes, fuck it "Blame Us!"
Cuz we don' been there and done that
Got gin, squares, and 1 strap
Shakin' the pussy till they come back
Like llello, hey hoe, you know the routine
Drop them draws, so all my folks can scoupe this dream....bitch

{Hook:4x} *in the background of chorus

[Chorus:2x - Mr. Lee]
You can high flyyyyy, when you ghetto dreamin'
You wanna another high, when you ghetto dreamin'
Niggaz walk the way you walk, when you ghetto dreamin'
You can have it if you don't, when you ghetto dreamin'
