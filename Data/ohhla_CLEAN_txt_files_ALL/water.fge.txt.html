[Verse 1]
Moving down the streams of my lifetime  
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve  
Cooling off the fire of my longing  
Boiling off my cold within his heat  
Melting down the walls of inhibition  
Evaporating all of my fears  
Baptizing me into complete submission  
Dissolving my condition with his tears  
  
[Chorus]
He's just like the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
He's just like the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
  
[Verse 2]
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing  
Floating through the space of my design  
Drowning me to find my inside sailing  
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind  
Filling up the cup of my emotions  
Spilling over into all I do  
If I only I could get lost in his ocean  
Surviving on the thought of loving you  
  
[Chorus]
He's just like the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
He's just like the water, the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
  
[Verse 3]
Bathing in the fountain of his essence  
He causes my expression to remain  
Humbled on a mountain by his presence  
Washing my intentions with his name  
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions  
Saving all his liquid for his own  
Moisturizing me to satisfaction  
In my imagination? No no!  
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours  
Drawing out my nature with his hands  
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power  
Burning to be worthy of his land  
  
[Chorus]
He's just like the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
He's just like the water  
I ain't felt this way in years  
  
[Ad Libs Remainder]
Cleaning me  
He's purging me  
And moving me around  
He's bathing me  
And he's claiming me  
And moving me around  
Around and around and around  
And around  
Watching me, claiming me  
Moving me around  
He's purging me  
He's been cleaning me  
And moving me around  
And around</pre>
