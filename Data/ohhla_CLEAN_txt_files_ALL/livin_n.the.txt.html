(Do you believe in God? '98 nigga)

[Sticky Fingaz]
I'm from New York nigga, the murder capital
Come in my hood wearin the wrong shit, they might cap you
I'm a sinner, I hope God forgive me
At the rate I'm goin now my moms'll probably out-live me
All my niggas is hardcore criminals
All I got left is my word and my genitals
I'm on some thug shit till I get cremated
Me and Larry Davis probably related
I hate the judge and can't stand the cops
Wanna dump on them pigs till my hands get hot
You wanna KILL ME? I ain't scared to get smoked
I'll probably die laughin, cuz y'all niggas is jokes WHAT!
I wanna wrap my hands around your throat WHAT!
I'll make Ted Bundy look like the pope
I show no love cuz I ain't got no feelings
You know the routine, reach for the ceiling
And if not for you, do it for your child's sake, nigga
I'll get you murdered then come to your wake
I speak in four-letter words, my rhymes is curse
Niggas ears gon' bleed when they hear this verse
Holdin court in the streets, I ain't doin a bid
I'd rather die, put that on my unborn kid
There's two ways out the game, death or jail
If there's a God, then WHY THE FUCK I'M LIVIN IN HELL?

Chorus
There's two ways out the game, death or jail
If there's a God, then why He got us livin in hell (4x)

[X-1]
X-1'll blast five (BLAOW!) through the back of your neck
Out your mouth, I'll bet that'll straighten you out
Live shit is the realest shit of all subjects
And I love wreck, put the pressure on any suspect
Life tactics is all I spit in my rap shit
Most y'all cats is wack and need practice
Get burned to ashes, spit on your casket
It's mad sick, drastic, it don't get no harder than this
Squeezin hard for the chips
More bricks, the larger the wrist but that's the fun of it
Every car hidden got a gun in it, I'm tryin to get mine
Get out and run wit it, kid extort your block
Unorthodox, this is all off the top
X-1'll throw you off the docks
And I done laid the best to rest over this music
Half y'all niggas is S-O-S WHAT
Stuck On Stupid

Chorus

[Blaze]
Slugs I send express, take it to your face and chest
Digest gun smoke, don't provoke finger in trigger
Been love sick, gat throw like ugly
Mister thug clip, biggest the slugs hit
One of you bugs better maintain
I claim you got game, drown you in a lake of octane
Never miss when I cock the four-fifth
Stain your garments, hit any target
&gt;From New York to Cali, I leave you fucked up in a back alley
Swell you up and bury your heart
Shells won't stop fallin, once they start blocks spark
It's trouble, rippin your parts, for your flesh bubble
Hell cuddles my life line in this trife time
Bust shots, live nines
Drive mines crazy like V-J Day
Live life the PJ way, it's D-Day
When A &amp; A sprays
Travelin, like a heat-seekin javelin 
Blaze slays rivals when battlin
