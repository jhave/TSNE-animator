[Intro]
Awww yeah. I'm with this. I think I'm gonna sit back
kick some smooth lyrics over this beat
Cause it's '88, it's time to set it straight
you know what I'm sayin'? No half steppin'. I'm ready

[Verse One]
Smokers steppin' to me
They wanna get some
But I'm the weed man so you know the outcome
Another dub sack, you know they love that
No seeds and stems to keep them comin' back
I'm the person you call to get your smoke on
For you to reach me, it's gonna take a phone call
And steppin' to me
You better have money
So what you want huh?
A dime or a twenty?
Clientele
I got the power
They be pagin' me every single hour
Cause when it comes to sellin' dope hot damn
I got it good
Now let me tell you who I am
B-L-U-E-P-R-I-N-T, Printmatic
Cinematic, I'm not like many
I'm different
So don't compare me to another
When I was five I got high with my mother
She taught me all about cannabis and it's pedigree
So when you roll up to smoke you better be
Ready
To get high long and steady
Cut the blunt with a butter knife like it's a machete
Don't you hate when you 
Try to smoke then new 
Friends roll up to try to smoke with you?
Oh don't tell you they do coke and they laced it
Have you runnin' down the street butt naked
Ain't no tellin' what you do when it hits you
I sell in all sizes from the big to the little
So buy it
Put it in your pocket and hide it
And take a walk
Before somebody calls the cops cause

[Chorus] [x4]
"Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it, knowhatimsayin'?" - Method Man
Cause I'm your neighborhood weed man

[Verse Two]
I sell so much dope and the cops be hopin'
To catch me in the act and catch
Watchin' me straight scopin'
My moves on the block
Now my spots hot
Plus every other ock wanna get what I got
But they have the dealers on my block actin' so similar
Causin' confusion, sellin' bad sensimillia 
To you playa
And boy do I hate a
Perpetrator
Cause my product's greater
There's no more stress
I got the best, buddha bless
I even bring it to your address
So if you call, I never stall I never rest
To ensure, your highness
Corner store pharmacist
I work hard at this
Cause every time I get a real job, man I wanna quit
Or the boss starts buggin' out throwin' fits
Just cause I smell like weed don't mean I'm smokin' it
But once I get fired
I start to get wired
So upset that I might even try it
At the table I sit
Rollin' up a spliff
And when the flame hits the paper
Awww shit
I start to pull rank over these guys
As a man with the weed that you need to buy
You can smell it through the bag ain't no need to deny
Wake up the next day and probably still be high
And no
That's not a lie
And if
You ever try to pull out
A gun and try to steal my supply
I show up 
In the night when you start to snore
With a hundred weed heads outside of your door
You can't play me
Not even ladies
Can get a free sample
Girl, you gotta pay me
So think about it if you got some dough
You wanna good time?
I think you should know how to....

[Chorus] [x4]
"Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it, knowhatimsayin'?" - Method Man
Cause I'm your neighborhood weed man</pre>
