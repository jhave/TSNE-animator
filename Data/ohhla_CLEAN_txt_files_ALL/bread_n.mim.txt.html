Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta (MIMS!!!)
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
(Y'all didn't know it was me right?!)
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
(Let me say my name again MIMS!!!)
For the bread n butta, for the bread n butta (One more time)
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta (MIMS!!!)
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta
(Y'all 'gon remember that shit man!)
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta
(Alright let's get with the verse)

[Verse One: MIMS]
Look, I said for that bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Fuck with me, die slow, like a chick with no rubber
All white no color albino with them birds be
Drop heads sittin on the back of Kobe's jersey
New York, Jersey, hits like a derby
Black Eyed Peas niggas know I got them Fergie's
That's why the fiends they prefer me
I don't gotta advertise all word of mouth they refer me
Try to out serve me you gotta get up early
For that bread n butta I leave niggas where the worms be
Money super straight like a perm be
Concrete, jungle fuck with me you need a army
Your shit go, pop pop, how you 'gon harm me!
My shit go rat tttttttttttttaaaaattttttttt like a tommy
I came at niggas calmly, now I'm on some nigga shit
Try to touch my scrilla get you lit like a cigarette
You couldn't get rid of me I'm sort of like the internet
World wide hustler, colder than the winter gets
I am what a spinner is, way past ballin
Don't gotta touch the rock I still eat like Jordan
Haters like oh shit, who is this recordin
M-I-M-S This is what you callin (MIMS!!!)
House so high, on the hill, this a problem
When the snow falls I bet you come run to ( ?)

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. Sample] (MIMS)
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
For the bread n butta,  for the bread n butta
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta (UH!)
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta (UH!)
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n (UH!)

[Verse Two: MIMS]
Look, I said for that bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Freeze it up, in the winter, throw it out, by the summer
Bank account, seven digits like a telephone number
BAH! BAH! Beat it up, you would think I was a drummer
I'm a boss of the bass with the treble cause trouble
Niggas say they make it rain, I don't even see a puddle
Not a drop, you would dry in the Kalahari desert
All that crack, you refer to, man you talkin 'bout the crevice of yo' ASS
Where the cash at? Dow Jones, NASDAQ
Pull up at the light, they like, "I didn't know he haaaad that"
Astounding, look at how I'm spittin
I got more, bread n butta than the motherfuckin kitchen
I can dish it, I can serve it, I can flip it, I can turn it
You could never bring it out, like a muh'fuckin hermit
I put one, show's earning up against ya whole life
Spend it all, make it back, and that's just in one night
You got one chain money, maybe somethin for a whip
I got big boat chips, take a shit on my ships (that's right)
Take a look at what I did, you ain't gotta say I'm rich
But when you talkin 'bout the next, you niggas gotta say I'm IT!!
THAT'S IT!!! - I killed it
More, bread n butta than a muh'fuckin pilgrim
Sorry hip-hop, I ain't mean to hurt ya feelings
Without, sayin nothin, watch me make another million! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Notorious B.I.G. Sample]
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
Huh, for the bread n butta I leave niggas in the gutta
For the bread n butta,  for the bread n butta
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n butta
For the bread n, for the bread n butta, for the bread n</pre>
