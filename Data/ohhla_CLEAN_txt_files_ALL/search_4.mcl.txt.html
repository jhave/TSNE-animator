    Within the depths, of this infinite community
    Emerges Lyte

[MC Lyte]
One by one they fall in the darkness
I'm glad, that I could take part in this
And I'm hoping, that you just might
get together and Search 4 the Lyte
Finding the Lyte means happiness
It's the best and nothing less
So I'm waiting, at the end of a tunnel
where happiness comes in bundles
But it takes time, to get to the Lyte
to get in the Lyte, to be with the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
get together and Search 4 the Lyte

How you get there is this question
Honesty is my suggestion
But first you must be awakened
If you say you are, you're faking
One who has seen the Lyte doesn't have to proof
that they've been moved
They just let it be, let it rest
For that is the mental test
Within this, there's so much happiness
Sort of like lasting moments of bliss
Everyone wants to be so happy
Let me explain my theory:
Some type of grief you MUST experience
in order to appreciate happiness
Cause if you are always satisfied
life will just pass by, you would've never tried
to get to the Lyte, to get in the Lyte
to be with the Lyte, to go see the Lyte
And I'm hoping, that you just might
get together and Search 4 the Lyte

If you are not ready the Lyte can be BLIND-ING
and not worth finding
So for this you must prepare:
stay awake, wake up, stay aware!
There are SO, many distractions
Those that see the Lyte, just a fraction
Those that don't, remain blinded
The Lyte is there, they can't find it
One by one they fall in the darkness
And it's sad, to take part in this
But I'm hoping, that you just might
get together and Search 4 the Lyte

Now finding the Lyte is what's so difficult
And you can bet, that the results are
splenderous, wonderful, yeah
What wouldn't you do?
Cause once you've seen the Lyte, been with the Lyte
Got to the Lyte, got in the Lyte
I know that you just might
never ever wanna leave the Lyte</pre>
