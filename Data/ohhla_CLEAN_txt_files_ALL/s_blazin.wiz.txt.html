[x2]

[Wiz Khalifa]
why can't everyone just smoke like me?
just gimme quiet place and lemme roll my weed
where ain't nobody in my business don't nobody gotta know
let all your conscious go and blow it by the O
I'm here but my minds gone

[Verse 1]
and its gettin hard to see you cause my eyes low
marijuana minutes, nigga time slow
on a kush clock, there's always time to smoke
say I look high? I say I'm high bro
still blazin on with me, just facin
I remember days when I could only smoke on occasion
I couldn't wait to go and cop from ray and them
rollin blunts of 50, stuck in my moms basement
had dro for sale but niggas was smokin haze then
blew a O a day then, don't know but somehow I made away
and nigga them bills need pay but I'm...

[Chorus]

why can't everyone just smoke like me?
just get up out my face and lemme roll my weed
where ain't nobody in my business, don't nobody gotta know
lets all learn how to roll and blow it by the O
I'm here but my minds gone,

[Verse 2]
400 a zip nigga that's what I'm on
and I'm gonna re-up as soon as the fires gone
smokin og kush from another time zone
as the smoke begins to pile on
wettin rags and puttin bags over the fire alarm
you niggas styrofoam, lightweight
I'm on my 13th oz, quite baked
you probably go to sleep, ya throat might ache
you off that good weed, you need a nice break
see I roll j's up all day and you wont have to put a 8th in
they sayin its amazin how I'm..

[Chorus]</pre>
