	We get open! (8X)

[Run]
I seen you hopin and scopin I'm copin as I get you wide open
Dyin and lyin while you're cryin and mopin
Flippin and rippin money-grippin be gropin
The baddest apparatus got the fad as I'm open
I never slip or fell, I raise up ?? well
I bash you in your bell, you got static in hell
And when you seen the fire you got jealous, you jeal'
So sucker just retire, you admire my skill
I'm never the type of guy to close the door in your face
I got you wide open, Run is runnin a race
Takin what's mine and what's left is a waste
Leavin them behind and all suckers on the chase
Got a dope track, comin real dope an'
I get legit, we get, I get..

	We get open! (14X)
	We get..

[Jam Master Jay]
Word up!
I freak the beat up, boom! Now bass up, pick the pace up
Jam Master blastin through the plaster cause I has ta
Hard rocks like to rock it, you can't stop it
?? Poll in ten years, I'ma walk away a prophet ??
You don't stop, I stop styles in the attic
Kick the fat flavor that you can't be mad at
?? what's the matter, more mix in granny's batter
Run-D.M.C.'s fatter, so kill the chit-chatter
Zigga zigga Jay, jigga jigga pump pump
Gettin bigger Babe Pah, figure nigga freak the funk
3 in the Head, ten yards to go
Blow up the spot for those that forgot
Stay stable as a navel, try an' rhyme rough and able
(With the Baldhead Kidz!) Word up, blow up the label
Boom boom boom, broke-in, got ya jok-in
Me, Run and D, we're gettin open!

	We get open! (16X)
	We get..

[D.M.C.]
Open the door, let me in
so my rhyme, can now begin
Forget the hit and all the (shit)
that you used to get with, because it's not legit
I rewrote the script, I flip the ship
I bust a lip, it's time to rip the mic I grip
Darryl McDan', use abuse
I bruise the crews, I refuse to lose
My composure, I will bulldoze ya
A froze enclosure, where no one knows ya
Who dat - who flew that head, well it's said
D put the head to bed and you're dead
Moms is cryin, MC's is dyin
I'm knockin down jaws with paws, like a lion
I wrote the dope quotes, now the punks is scopin
I knuckle up and punch and bust his fronts open

	We get open! (8X)

[Jam Master Jay and Onyx]
Word up, I'd like to thank G-O-D (man above)
Run-D.M.C. in the house (representin no question)
Onyx in the house (word up)
??Cha Skills?? on the wheels (word up)
Word up J-M-J ?? in the house
Randy D, get with me
We, we get, we, we get, we..

	We get open! (32X)</pre>
