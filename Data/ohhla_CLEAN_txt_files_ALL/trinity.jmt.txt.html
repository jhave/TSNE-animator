[Verse 1: L-Fudge]
I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longtitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When mines put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead ya serve thrash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show you how ominous
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have all right to feel myself to the point of genitalia fondlin'

[Hook]
We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pimpin' talk and jump and knock that shit
"Louis Logic, L-L-Fudge, Ikon the verbal hologram"

[Verse 2: Louis Logic]
I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
the effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Casted a curse to fashion emcees' Parisian fabrics
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
Epitome of half-bent, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self destructive explosive devices react before my mind is ever mastered
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' ya plasma until ya rhythm section hold the contorts
While snatchin' a arm in this sport
Draw more foolish query, than the Warren Report
and the Single Bullet Theory

[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 3: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
You fuck wid me you won't survive
Ikon been live since eighty five
Monosyllabic characters tragical crystallize
Hit them guys, in they eyes wid fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire unto they chapel
Wrap my lasso, 'round rappers who wanna battle
Hologram with two bare hands crush you to gravel
Evil raps'll reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, wid my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who's seated on a throne within a forcefield
You'll get tossed and feel lost like Holden Caufield
Raw deal, rappers decipher that skism
Followed Solomon and brought him in at ya baptism
