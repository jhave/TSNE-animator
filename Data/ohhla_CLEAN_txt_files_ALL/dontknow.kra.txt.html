Song:   I Don't Know
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm nothing fancy
I'm nothing special that's true
But I know what your thinkin'
Cuz I'm thinkin' that same thing too
Now you'd like everything to go your way
And I should probably say everything you'd like me to say
But that's not me and baby that just wouldn't be you
You better watch how long you wait
Cuz baby you might wait too long

[CHORUS]
I don't know if I could make you happy
And I don't know if I could make you cry
I don't know if the clock stops at midnight
I can't see past forever but together we can fly
Together we can fly

Now let's pretend for a while that we've got no place to be
You've been broken before but baby that wasn't me
Now I'm trying to ask you to come
To that same old place that you've been runnin' from
We've been down that road
You know there's nothing to see
You better watch how long you wait
Cuz baby you might wait too

[REPEAT CHORUS]

Bay there' no use in waiting
I can see that your hopes are fading
They tell me that time is precious baby
Why do you keep wastin' time?

[REPEAT CHORUS]</pre>
