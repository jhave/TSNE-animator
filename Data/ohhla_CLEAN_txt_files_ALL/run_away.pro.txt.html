[Big Krizz Kaliko]
Most definitely... Kaliko in the house fa sho
Most definitely... Prozak in the house fa sho

Hey, corrupted the crime boy
In since one nine nine nine now
Think that I'm bluffin try boy
You can sho nuff find out how
Cuz I keep one on me. You ain't got a meaner demeaner
but if you don't stand down to an angel when you see him
Get a hot one in between em, yeah
Out comes my gun, you bout to run
When I put it on
Ain't got no problem, knockin it problem
Niggas if you wanna get it on
I'll be the last man standin
Like you abandon yo mans and them
Got a two piece and a biscuit up in my hands for them
Dranks up, drip that, know what I'm talkin bout
If you creep up in Krizz house, yo ass ain't gon be walkin out
Talkin out the side of yo neck
and if it don't understand the words that you sayin
I'mma take it as disrespect, losin it
Slowly as them days go by
so if you got some beef wit me, better stroll on by
See we gentle and peaceful people
but mentally be some evil is supposed to provoke
Bad actions start to comin out of church folk

[Big Krizz Kaliko]
See you can run, but you can't hide
I see you shake, heart beatin inside
You can't help it cuz it's over
and they tried to run away
See you can hide, but you can't run
You ought to stop, when you see me comin
You tried to stop it, but it's over
I will make them run away

[Tech N9ne]
God gave me the gift to sooth the savage beast nigga
God made me to rip and rule the baddest peace spitta
But yous a bitch if you thinkin leakins gon hurt me
I'm purposely servin these twerps to the third degree verbally
Birth of these marksmen claimin to be dark men, hearts been hardened
Harshly sparks me to start the murlarky
Like Mizzarski, it's gon take a nation till death marks me
Yo parts will be scattered, battered, and partially
barred from the Nnutt Howze, give it to you
They pity the nigga that give us the negative
You better get ready to get ahead of it
If you rhetoric and let a bitch you better get
Wicked with the subjective and the predicate
And that's bitch niggas, cuz I'm a switch getta
And they jealous cuz bellas are funded
And they really hate the way Nina gunnin
Hella flow and they can't take nothin from it
Meet the reapa when I come to your speaka
I will damage, definitely defeat ya
You so soft and I am the creature feature
Poppin evil enemy spittin ether
Niggas is hella wrong and they know that
Wishin upon my dough sack
Make a nigga run away from Tech Nina, Kali, and Prozak

[Big Krizz Kaliko]
See you can run, but you can't hide
I see you shake, heart beatin inside
You can't help it cuz it's over
and they tried to run away
See you can hide, but you can't run
You ought to stop, when you see me comin
You tried to stop it, but it's over
I will make them run away

[Prozak]
Motherfuckers they wanna battle me
Bitches they wanna straddle me
Bitches with the strategy
Wanna stick it in your anatomy
They got a hand on me, finks they wanna rat on me
Snakes, they try to rattle me
but haters, why you mad at me?
But it really doesn't matter breathe badder, blood scatter
Climb to the top of Jacob's ladder
Bloody Mary three times and glass shatters
Hey batter batter batter, hey batter batter, swing
Take your head off like floss like the holocaust
Body toss first mark that I come across
Six from the toss, switch bitch, you just double crossed
Get hit with the quickness, get written off
I will take it to the level of angels and devils
So best to be runnin when all the dust settles
The demons will follow, there'll be no tomorrow
Your life will be somber, your time is now borrowed
See my face grinnin, the room will be spinnin
The blood will be spillin all over the floor
From the beginning, your flesh has been sinning
The pressure is building, you can't take no more.
So don't get cynical, every syllable
constant and critical to the bare minimal
Pitiful is what you've become to my visual
Sit back, relax, collectin my residuals

[Big Krizz Kaliko]
See you can run, but you can't hide
I see you shake, heart beatin inside
You can't help it cuz it's over
and they tried to run away
See you can hide, but you can't run
You ought to stop, when you see me comin
You tried to stop it, but it's over
I will make them run away</pre>
