You're never gonna forget about me
Your great-grandkids are gonna say
"Wow, wasn't that a bizarre individual?"

[Sean Price]
Word up, goodnight
The fuck, don't like none of y'all niggaz
Word up, goodnight
The fuck...
Word up, goodnight
The fuck, don't like none of y'all niggaz
I'ma holla on that nigga

Word up, goodnight
The fuck, don't like none of y'all niggaz
I'ma holla on that nigga
I don't like him either, yo
Shit on your hood, y'all niggaz ain't shit in the hood
Take a dump on your champion and shit on your hood
Leave my Boot Camp stamp in the hood, size 12
I beat bass out of your face, you Rahzel
I lift barbells, I stick bars well
Y'all niggaz got cream but soft like Carvel
Pah my cartel from Kingston kill shit
My Brownsville {*car tires squeal*} these niggaz they steal shit
Yeah the klepto con, you scared that I'm
hold it my hand to kill you duke so let go mine
Sean P bastard rhyme, past my prime
What's life without rap though? Pass the nine
Right or wrong, heh, I'm right and wrong
Best believe everything the God write is Sean - P!

Royce 5 Messiah, ridin to Sean, distance
Chrome lips sittin higher up on the rim than LeBron's
I touch weight, that nina got one in the head
I call them clips Jon and Katie, cause they plus 8
I got the booth poppin, don't ask about the album
Come with 'em, ask him, ask him when the next flu droppin
Sick~! I don't blog, I bury
More horsepower in the Murcielago carries
I got bitches that hit niggaz for me
And I'll send 'em to your crib like Chicago Larry
Ooooooh! The internet tryin to indict a man
The web changin the world like fuckin Spider-man
The pack's in back y'all buyin all 24 hours a day
I'm fryin 'em, but I ain't no diner
Y'all niggaz can be musclebound as you want, y'all pussies
I treat you niggaz like the vagina on Chyna!

[Sean Price]
I don't even..
I don't like nobody
Give a fuck...
I know you don't like me, don't got to
I don't like you neither, fuck you nigga!
I don't even like niggaz who act like me
I don't give a fuck though, knahmean?
That's just how I am
Fuck y'all niggaz, P, P!

[Mike Tyson]
Man listen right?
I don't know nothin about bein the heavyweight champion
Only thing I know is how to fight, right?
I'm a nigga, right?
No really really really, really
I'm not sayin like, I'm a black person
I'ma, I'ma street person
I don't even want to be a street person
I don't even like, I don't even like typical street people
But but that's just who I became and
what happened in my life and
the tragedies in life that made me that way
But, you know I'm Mike
You know I'm not malevolent or anything, I just am {*echoes*}</pre>
