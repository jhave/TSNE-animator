Greetings, earthlings. Take me to your leader(Ooh Shit!)

Chorus: repeat 2X

D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P.
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...

[Dre]
Deeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues
Deeper fish in the O(cean)
I got my gun on standby, like Coast Guard
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catchin plagues
Niggaz catchin AIDS, niggaz gettin sprayed, niggaz on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreadin no white thighs 
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claimin true
Aimin two at your muthafuckin spine
No, I make that three cuz I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wonderin when I'm gonna see the end
Andre 'gain slammin backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts 
So you know that it's D.E.E.P.

chorus: (2X)

[Big Boi]
Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aimin for your skull, yeah I'm flexin on you that a way
So if you pullin a tool, nigga you better use it
Cuz if you're threatenin my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody, I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, some I'mma hurt you
Breakin knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me 
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P.
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...

chorus: (2X)

[Dre]
No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be tryin to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cuz I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm zooted, bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be havin funds
The gold that I am wearin is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and makin my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissin me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's livin on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I get a little backup
Please don't let them pussy muthafuckas put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we need dough
whenever the fuck out record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back

chorus: (2X)

[Big Boi]
I'm gettin deeper than that prostiutes vagina
And pimpin way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggaz try to bite that shit, but their shit is inferior
We rollin thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy
And I don't give a damn, muthafucka cuz you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hairy bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would be acting if youse in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tight ass draws cause I got a short ass fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be cappin with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L
