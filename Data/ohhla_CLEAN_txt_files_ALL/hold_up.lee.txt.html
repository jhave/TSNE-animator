[Intro: Nelly]
Can I get a hey hey?
I get a ho ho
Can I get a hey hey?
I get a ho ho

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
(Verse One).. What's it gon be today? (Let's see)
The yellow Benz or the red Navi'
Iny, miny, ony, mo
That's the way I pick when I'm ready to roll
Murph Dert got the limos wit his vehicles
(Yeah that's the way it go when you got money to blow)
Ho! well then, say no mo'
Just think, I was on my way to the sto'
I got scratched but I don't got nails
Got my own truck but I wanna drive trails
Plus I won a house in ATL and that depends on my sales
And I'm tryin' to get a mil before my album hit the shelves
And I aint talkin' bout no signin' bonus (uh-uh)
'Tics went platinum to remind ya homey
I'm not a restroom so aint no need to stall
I don't run or walk now so I can give it to em all

[Hook: Nelly]
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I aint been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty wit it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you aint gotta leave by yoself)
Ooh.. Shiit, Taxi!

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
(Verse Two) I call her back from an earlier week
4 in the mornin' they be like (Mm-mm nah I aint asleep)
Career whore, stay on top of convenient stores
Get pictures of me in they Victoria Secret drawers
Keep summin hot on tour, couldn't keep anything hotter
Make sure they know before what is really in store
I adore the ones that call me Tohri, true story
I created hoodrats, so these new models bore me
See I load up the 7 wit 7's, for 8's I can't wait
9's be one time and Dimes we won't date
So now I got 11's and 12's
Wit at least 13 or 14 reasons why they fine as hell
I hit em up like Blu Cantrall
He-he-he-he-he-he-he-hell
I remember when you smashed the bail
I'm just a, derrty who can and you hatas stand out
I'm like the pie in the window, I'm just too damn hot

[Hook: Nelly]
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I aint been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty wit it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you aint gotta leave by yoself)
Ooh..Shiit, Taxi!

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
(Three) (Can I get a hey hey?
Can I get a ho ho?)
Not you the one behind ya girl
I done spit 2 verses tryin' to find ya girl
And if you need a sex deal, lemme sign ya girl
Just give me your information
And I'll keep you in heavy rotation
I wanna touch you wherre the sun don't shine
I got a watch but I don't got time
So if you wit it, then you wit that's good
Cuz if you not then I could simply take you back to the hood
...Cuz I love my hoes
Pimpin' aint easy but it's under control
I got a lot of shit in me but I'm a commode
Cell phone, arrea code overload
I called Mannie in Louisian-ny
Said the MO's is off the hook and make em move they fanny

[Hook: Nelly]
Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I aint been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty wit it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

Say hold up, wait a minute
Lemme put some pimpin' in it
Now, big booty I'm recommendin'
And I aint been in this spot for a minute

Say hold up, wait a minute
She wanna get derrty wit it
Now, baby girl wanna handle her business
So I guess we'll be back when we finish

I don't wanna leave by myself
(Boy, you aint gotta leave by yoself)
Ooh..Shiit, Taxi!</pre>
