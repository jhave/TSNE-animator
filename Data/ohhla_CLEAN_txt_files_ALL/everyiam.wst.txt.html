[Intro/Chorus]
Damn
Here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm  not, made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyonce
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from BLACKstreet, He was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the winter like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summer time like will.i.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am

[Chorus] (DJ Premier scratching in background)
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 2]
And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
Cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reebok's, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the In-di-a Arie award
They'd rather give me the ni-nigga-please award
But I'll just take the I-got-alotta-cheese award 

[Chorus] (DJ Premier scratching in background)
Damn
Here we go again
(Kanye humming)
But everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 3]
I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
Man, killin's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rapping
Do you know what it feel like when people is passing
He got changed over his chains, a block off Ashlin
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
The slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today 

[Chorus] (DJ Premier scratching in background)
Damn
Here we go again
Everybody saying what's not for him
But everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn
Here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am</pre>
