Typed by: AZ Lyrics

See low we know
I'm sitting on leather I'm a winner
If I crap out the strap out
Cause I snap right back to the beginning nigga

[Chorus]
You know I will let it pop front if you want bitch I will make it hot
You (rrr) know you think you ill but you not
You will need a tombstone you will need a plot (yeah)

I peep what niggas hate through my peripherals
Boy if I leave this club back to the car I got some shit for you
Want party? We can paint the town red
Them bottles ain't shit to me a nigga got bread
I'm big money big business I love it
For the bad bitches with big asses and the budgets I'm the boss
Until you know shit is going how it got to go
I don't want talk tonight I might just buy the hoes
My pleasure principle spender's expense
First I'm happy then she happy then she can pay the rent
It's nothing to a nigga when he up
But when they down I bet you he won't give up at your bump
Flipping will catch your attitude 'like bitch what the fuck you want from a nigga huh?, you fucking up nigga huh?'
Look girl you know you sitting on a gold mine
Fuck with them other niggas think you so fine

[Chorus x2]

My flow hotter than the gun after that clip done
Don't care about the sit you claim mother fuck the finger bang
I hang around with hustlers and hoodlums that party get the popping
Then we beefing and we shooting
Let's party like it's 1999 flat top [?]
Swag going back in time
I got it locked they can't ignore it
My nigga know some bullshit I'm all for it
[?] Don seven sixty leaning
Chrome clean spend a nigga scheming trying to hit a lick
Them victim niggas thinking damn why me
I'm thinking why these niggas never try me
Maybe they feel the vibe they know a nigga lie
I let it off inside and outside
The club rocking it's on tonight
Them bottle's popping we getting right

[Chorus]</pre>
