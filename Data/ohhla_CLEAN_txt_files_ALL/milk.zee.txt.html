[Young Zee]
Yeah, I'm not the one to try to test from the door
I start whoopin niggaz ass with extension cords, pow
It's Young Zee, I get high off iz
and Make the Music With My Motherfuckin Mouth like Biz
to rip apart all clicks that got heart
Make em talk into my boot like Maxwell Smart
And I send clicks that try to diss me
(To the motherfuckin East Blackwards) like X-Clan you SISSY!
Bust up the jam and feel no guilt
And that's why motherfuckers call me Milk

"People call me Milk.." -&gt; Audio Two {*cut and scratched*}

[Young Zee - over scratches]
Ye-yeah!
One time for your mind..
All aboard!
Yeah.. yeah..

You fuck with me, I set up your family
Start the car moms, a bomb's in the Camry
Who Zee?  Me I put the crews in the floozy
Do em like Jackson, sweep em up by the twozies
No brain Brings the Pain like Tical
when I get buckwild and move my dial on your style
You kick the Mafia "can't be hit" stories
While I get your main {*censored*} the {**} bores me
(Give me a ??) by anyone that tags a hit
I'ma beat the streets crossin out they shit like Spitz
Zee ?? rules this train, H-Town, this is my town
Booty-ass rappers like you bring my high down
So when I rock give me props and hugs
'less we throwin on the boxin gloves
Then watch a whole damn click get kilt
lyrically by the nigga they be callin Milk

"People call me Milk.." -&gt; Audio Two {*cut and scratched*}
