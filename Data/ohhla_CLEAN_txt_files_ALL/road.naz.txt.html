Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: sample]
When the road is gone, and you can't find no way
So don't you threaten my, my, my friend now
It'll be another day

[Bronze Nazareth]
Black male, jail cell, same hell, murderous prospects
Drain ale, same pale, buck shots, reign hail
Same meal, stepping like robot, pain kill
Trail stream from silk screen to nine mill
Crush my will, cook a meal like rosewoods
I'm coming for them gold goods, precision like dope head
My biscuit toasted, open fine hoes, acid for flat bread
Solicit, catch casket dripping, unbutton hostlers
Embroidered clips in, Chicago Bear puff, quick to snare off
Pick six to carry off his coffin
While I'm often pterodactyl off white widow with horsemen
Back to the Wall Street lawn, heaters and more shit
My literary literally drown your war ship
Send a shell now tear up your style to the corporate
First forty eight hours is never seen, no force could measure me
The hunts off when he endorse my treasury
Yellow apparition, smell a kush and incense
I dwell on benches where the Air Force is scared to going off course
Burn your after murder spree then I'm off to witness
Double dutch and I don't mean the ropes, I'm off the benches
Coughing endless, kill me and spends off a genius intention
Bring the nigga henchmen, spend shells on and on it was expensive

[Chorus]

[Masta Killa]
Now there's one thing I should mention, massive pounds of pressure
Nothing can hold me, watch as I levitate gravity
None could match me, cave chest cavity
Basic mathematical flow, like the max spray
Monumental word play, carefully construct the measurements
When you weighin' up, refining to it's higher science
A spill of carbon, one gun shot of diesel
A microphone touch of mission, plan an eruption
Underworld corruption, don't trust him it's sadly to say
You might have to bust him one day, I thought I told you

[Chorus]

[Inspectah Deck]
Broad day bullets over Broadway for more pay
Verbal assault, you bitches rep more then foreplay
All day, this is routine, not a facade
No mirage, no regard, no HBO Entourage
Bloodsport, caught with the force, Star Wars, Skywalker
Offin' your boss, tossin' your broad
And there's no shells, left in the drawer, spit them in raw
Nobodies leaving til we settle the score
Chose the high road, never look down, like if my eyes closed
Mine flows, trying to get mine, before the time goes
Ayatollah mind controller, free of the blindfolds
Survive with 50-47's, the nines blow
Dip don, boss underdog from the rip bomb
Click strong, Melo with the handle like the Knicks on
Clips drawn, ducking the blues, choose a fit form
Big arms, lay down your king, only six pawns

[kung fu sample]
My friend, he's an expert, in ninja
Give this letter to him, he will come
Mmm...
What is this ninja?
I'm not familiar
Is this from him?
Watch out!
This may contain poison, don't touch it</pre>
