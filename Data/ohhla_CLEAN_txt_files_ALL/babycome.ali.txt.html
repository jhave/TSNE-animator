[Chorus: 2X]
Baby come home we need you
To keep being strong and reach through
Just please do whatever you need to
We broke and it won't be complete till we see you

[Verse One]
Ain't no sunshine never
She's always gone too long, this house is not a home
Unties that bind, unturn turnacit
So this wife of mine is in turn turning tricks
I know why you put the devil in your vein
That's the only time you feel separate from your pain
I can't believe you never gonna change
So I'm trying to hold a paper house together in the rain
Baby girl came home with lice
Had to wash her hair
Almost lost her to foster care
Her dinner is Micky D's drive through
I'm in the streets till the wee hours tryin' to find you
I can't let you go
I've seen the treasure no
I know better had to go fetch you
I'm depressed and the problem is
Can't rest till you die or decide to live so...

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
When you were born I had a head full of vision
You in college, us with a family business
But as you grew I realized 
I had no clue exactly what it is a dad should do
And that being true I should have never been surprised when
Your friends in the streets had your ears more than I did
Every bit of dream I had was crushed
They put my little man in a bus, hands in cuffs
Hard to face it
You incarcerated
Just don't play cards, lift weights and waste it
Back against the wall, pissed off and angered
Pinpoint the point where you get lost and change it
Or one day you're gonna look up
Your life half over and you passed on the good stuff
If we ever get a second chance to hook up
We'll pass through the past and pick up where we should have son

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You a stranger in your old old neighborhood
Moved to the sun, forgot about the greater good
Act like nobody gave you a push
Now you're trying to get the history erased from your book
Look
You ain't rich your middle class
Lucky your family don't whup your stinkin' ass
While you in Paris, carelessly shoppin'
Your parents are starvin', tears in their apartment
No wonder you don't come home more often
So ashamed of what you are that you're an orphan
Don't you see that you would die?
If a tree don't feed it's roots it's suicide
No matter how far from home you reside
A little of the truth in you refuses to die
The world is a circle
So no matter how far you roam
You can't help but touch home girl

[Chorus]</pre>
