It must be the hormones they puttin' in the meat she eats
cause she's bad to the bone marrow make me so weak
Must be a bad dream cause it just don't seem
that a body so mean is on a chick of sixteen
I don't even understand how her ass is so phat
or the fact that she's allowed outta the house like that
Young girls dressin' like video hoes it kills me
then after I look I'm supposed to feel guilty?
She knows what she's doin' she can ruin me son
How looks stuck up and sexy when she's chewing that gum
Young girls twist curls in their hair
flip skirts in the air
make a stare and it's so unfair
If you wanna go with me I got a see ID
Say that nothin' but the number for shit Chi-Ali
Even if she's like "It's alright I'm in love"
say "Yeah right, try explainin' that one to the judge"

Girl: I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this

I got mothers that are handing me restraining orders
Cause I ain't the father but I'm spankin' daughters
The girls love attention and they havin' a feel day
With the sex appeal and conceilin' their real age
Most of them boast to these older men
And I can't front I want both of the Olsen Twins
I'm not saying that is right I know it's actually wrong
but if you're such a great mom why'd your daughter got a thong
exposed with tight clothes, quick reality check
Little chicken tryna put hickies on Apathy's neck
Where's your daughter at huh? It's half past twelve
Her and the best friend ain't pickin' up they cells

Girl: Yeah I can't pick up my cell right now
I'm kinda busy but if you leave a message I'll get back to you

I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this.
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this.

This is a lesson for everybody so listen pay attention
it's tempting the sexual tension is intense
and to top it off girls got dads and older brothers
that are bad mothafuckas
that'll grab us and cut us it's crazy
find you in they daughter's bed with no shirt
doin'  the homework and all you can say is "Don't hurt!!"
The girls lure you in the black widow's
then you'll probably never see the world again
get yourself together break the hypnotic spell
the body and the booty on this bad little bitch is exotic as hell
My advice before things jump off just dead it
They know what you want and you just might get it

Girl: I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this.
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
I know what you want, but you can't get it
Na na na naaa naaaaa You can't get this</pre>
