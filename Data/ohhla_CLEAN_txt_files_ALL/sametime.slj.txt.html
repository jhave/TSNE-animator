This a mothafuckin' hot record right here
Your about to witness some shit
ya never thought you'd witness before (fire)
Fin' to get ingorant up in this biatch (beats by the pound)
Y'all know what time it is (DPG)
What y'all thought?
I wasn't gonna be on? (get rowdy rowdy, rowdy rowdy)(what?)

Here we go again, my flow again, is dope enough
I tilt my brim for Soulja Slim its time to open up
I tuck my heater in my drawers, right next to my balls
I got some weed up in my jaw, stuck in shuckles breakin' laws, mayne
Mr. Magnolia, the high roller, knew I'd pull him over
And bless him with a fat sack of some dolja, told ya
See I'm a soldier represtin' West Coast, cuz
But South Side, rip ride, go on and give it up
I can't fake it, for all my niggaz moving weight
From state to state, get your mothafuckin' paper plates
And stack that shit nigga, go on and get your grip on
I'm in it to win it for No Limit (for life)
so nigga trip on (thats right)
And dip on , cause we gon' keep makin' hits (makin' hits)
And the kinda music, that makes you wanna bust a bitch (b-i-atch)
I used to make that shit (uh), that make you wanna drive by
Then P sat me down, hooked me up (uhh) and strapped me down
With the rowdy rowdy (rowdy rowdy) bout it bout it
Suicide, pull a ride, nutty buddy, with the cutty on the side
Sittin' on, 3's with D's, on top of dub
I'm down South in the club gettin' much love (nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now a thing about me and young cuz
We hit No Limit at the same time (nigga, what, what, what, what?)
Say what?
Doggy Dogg and Soulja Slim at the same time
Is in it to win it for No Limit at the same time
You got my back, I got your back at the same time
You blast for me, I'll blast for you at the same time

[Soulja Slim]
I'll blast for you, you blast for me at the same time
Blow up some dolja with a soldier at the same time
Niggaz stay real as the fuck at the same time
You ride for me, I'll ride for you at the same time
Me and Snoop hit No Limit at the same time (time)
Watch me put it down and shine
And make the whole world respect my mind (mind)
I'm the realest soldier you heard about (uh-huh)
represent the Dirty South
Magnolia projects got a nigga murdered out (murder murder)
But these niggaz acting like bitches at the same time (same time)
Its time to grab things time
bang bang time, bust a brain time (bang bang)
At the same time, my nigga Snoop D-O double G (G)
Way, from the L-B-C, ain't No L-I-M-I-T (T)
KLC makes the beats that makes the sound shake the streets (streets)
Ever since been in basements been doing raw shit for me
My cousin Will B got twelve years (uh, uh, uh)
Ain't that something?
I send you some money, some pictures nigga that ain't about nothin'
I proceed to do my thing
In this rap for the street
Makin' hits so when they mention Biggie and Pac
they gonna mention me (me)
At the same time, I'm gonna get mines
and I'm gonna take it (take it)
At the same time, I'm gonna get mines
without gettin' soldier hated (nigga what, what, what?)
Me and Snoop collaborated at the same time, y'all can't fade it
I done saved it, at the same time, we dedicated

[Snoop]
Straight Up
Soulja Slim and Doggy Dogg at the same time
Makin' figures, crazy niggaz at the same time
Be your gravediggaz at the same time
You got my back, I got your back at the same time
You ride for me I'll ride for you at the same time
You blast for me I'll blast for you at the same time</pre>
