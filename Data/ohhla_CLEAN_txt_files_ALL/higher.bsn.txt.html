My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I fulfill every yearn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting
So when you step inside my office, treat that beast like it's the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay
Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yea
Well this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
'Cause when you come from the bottom man it's so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say Ingles, no hablo, man unless it's eat me out though
Benihani, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'
'Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't say
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain't make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get our day
And damn (damn), tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain't what it seem no mo' (no mo')
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!

Shit, can't a young nigga live man
We done worked too hard
Yup, GOOD, Finally Famous nigga
We ain't never going broke nigga!</pre>
