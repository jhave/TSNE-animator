Yo, 313 D-E-T
Remember me
The one ya gotcha ideas from, oh my God
Look I gotta gun, so you better run

Fuck everybody in the industry, I be
Mr. Negativity sleepin with my uzi
Fuck the five mics you givin me
I'll take you on a journey journalist, insane's how I'm livin see
I'm livin like a nigga straight outta jail
Down on his luck, ain't got no money but I gotta gun and some shells
Oh hell, might as well pull the trigga
On every snake nigga, when he slither
Bitch I ain't happy I flow bitter
Take a Louisville bat to ya head, crack
But then again, should I just slit his throat?
For sayin my fuckin name in that rhyme he wrote
Should I kill yo wife and ya child
For tryin to assassinate me n my style?
Bitch please, hoe please
Catch these bullets when I squeeze
I shoot

(CHORUS)(2X)
Mr. Negativity
Negative, negative, negative
I squeeze

I ain't got shit positive to say
About any rapper on the mic today
Cause ain't no rap groups out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the hoe ass radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin ta make a comeback
With pop styles or 50 niggaz on a track
That shit is wack, ya need ta be smacked
With the grill of the Cadillac
Soldiers always tryin ta bite somethin
Cause they know deep down they bitch ass can't write nothin
Niggaz steal ya raps quicker than ya Dana's
So I'mma start murderin entertainers
Hole in ya head for bein famous
Everybody know you stupid, now you really brainless
Shameless and nameless, catch these missles when I am this

(CHORUS)

Everybody and they momma wanna busta fuckin rap
Step in the ring and get walked on like a doormat
Far as the radio goes fuck ya format
Cause Detroit city is where we war at
I don't giva fuck nigga
I squeeze triggas, my gun's bigger
I blast em, bucks 'em, motherfucks em
Don't let em hear no omi new shit you can't trust em
Cause niggaz be runnin outta ideas
And they'll still steal a niggaz shit still
How come ya new cd sound just like my last album?
Catch the dum dums
And come up

(CHORUS)

Negative, negative negative
Negative, negative, negative</pre>
