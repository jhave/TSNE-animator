Quick cash pimpin, swift ass kickins

Don't get quiet, niggas start a riot
Take off like hollies, young gangsta try it
In it for the highs, you can't deny it man

[Tray Deee]

Motherfuckers tryin to bang, niggas runnin game

[Snoop talking]
Yeah somebody thought the game was dead

Packed up cells, dirty-ass jails
Sneaky ass snails, hot like Hell
Funky shit that smell, clean your fingernails man

Banned X boxes and yoke gettin shopped
Stacks gettin clocked and 'Lacs gettin dropped

Gone off hennessey, bitches next to me
Takin some Ecstasy, want some sex from me
It's all G, nigga can't you see, cuz..

Cars full of sets, marks gettin checked (Eastside!)
Hard niggas vets, bulletscars on they chest
Start tryna test I hope the Lord got ya blessed nigga

[Snoop talking]
From Spain to Maine, we here to change the game
Ain't a motherfuckin thang changed, yaknah'msayin mayne

(Everywhere I go!!!)
Make this motherfucker jump, let the bitches get crunk
I got a room at the Trump, later on we can slump
Let the speakers thump, and watch these hoes thump

[Tray Deee]
(Everywhere I go!!!)
Niggas serve zones, niggas swerve chrome
Bitches turn wrong, get other bitches turned on (ooh)
Think it ain't sold then ya must have heard wrong

[Goldie Loc]

Bailin thru the streets, always catch me with some heat
On my way to buck a freak, back up we fuck the heat
In and out of sheets while yo' ass be asleep, cuz..

[Tray Deee]
(Everywhere I go!!!)
I stand on the set, demand my respect (for life)
My hand on the tech, or the magnum on deck (nigga)
You ain't gotta guess, I represent it to the death nigga
