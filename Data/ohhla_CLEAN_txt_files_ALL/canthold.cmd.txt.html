Say Magic, remember that nigga QB from uhh Life or Death
That commercial we did for a nigga
First appearence as a No Limit Soldier
But it's number two nigga check it out

Chorus 2X

You can't hold me back
Only real niggas feel this
Nigga feel this
Bitch niggas can't feel this
Feel this

[QB]
This for the niggas under estimated, mad style, mad created
Fuck all them niggas that playa haters
Send out dippin' spirit shit, what's wrong, I hearin' shit
When I jump on the song, it's straight lyrics bitch
My first appearence was on Life or Death
It's hard to mantain in this game but I still caught this much respect
I waiting a long line, no with no wit'
I didn't pick up no hands got me some ki's and I made a hit
Y'all niggas mad cause i'm nation wide
You besta realize I have a style
Nigga don't be surprised
There's not no party
I'm coming with dope shit regardless
Coming with a weak hit nigga hardly
And when you rich bitch niggas talk
And when you broke bitches yap
A automatic go off full track
A future pay nigga, a made nigga
Not a day nigga, a fair nigga, fair nigga

Chorus 2X

[C-Murder]

That shit comin' out soon
No Limit family, ??? motherfucker
