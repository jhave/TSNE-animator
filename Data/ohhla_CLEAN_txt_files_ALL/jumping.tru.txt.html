[Big Ed]
Here I come slidin, slippin past security
Tip to the toe, Big Ed is in the house and now you know that
I'm bout to get funky like halitosis
Can I get a hoe to keep this playa focused
Cause I'm a keep the party jumpin
Aint no need for funkin, why don't you grab a freak or somethin
So I can trip the honey bouncin like a pogo stick
Cause I'm on hit and cant no nigga get with this
Cause I'm two double zero LBS's ride
Six to the four, hit like dynamite
You wanna hop like a rabbit
Givin em like a rap
After the show I toss these hoes like a salad
I'm just chillin, checkin out the plot
Scopin the spot to see which freak be hot
For me, what do you know I got four of em
Give em all equal time cause I don't love em
I got this big fat trojan full of chocolate
Ready to fill you up so come and take a lick
Yeah, so let's keep it on the downlow
So catch me on the upstroke and keep it on the low pro

[Master P]
Ya don't know, now ya know
If you don't know now ya know
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
Ain't no players like them T-R-U players cause them T-R-U players is the 
shit

Fool I got more rhymes then freaknit got hoes
Fool I got more hoes then the O got vogues
You know I'm low like a Lac, funky like a sac
Cause I'm a mack, I know you can't fade me black
You think your old lady's coming home, whatever
Cause I got more dick then Clark and Van Dyke put together
And that'll keep a hoe forever
Big Ed short change a honey, naaah, never
And you can check my credents
Cause any time spent with me is time well spent
I hit the jackpot like a casino
Make you nut twice, goin deep like Dan Marino
I flow smooth like a drano
Explode like a volcano
I'll be hittin that ass on the floor and yo
Then the bitch be tryin to kiss me
Layin with they man, they reminisce and they miss me
See I'm a playa that be TRU
T-R-U be them real niggas, I thought ya knew
So let me freak this, kick this with my flow
Here we go, here we go, here we go

[Master P]
If ya don't know, now ya know
If you don't know now ya know
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
Ain't no players like them T-R-U players cause them T-R-U players is the 
shit

[Big Ed]
I rock from Richmond, California to Richmond, Virginia
Never ever scared of funk because I hop when I was in ya
Enter, hit your chest like a fender bender
So close your eyes fool, cause your the grand prize winner
And anywhere I go I got that nine
Got more straps then Pippen and Maxwell combined
So everything is all fine
You gotta have yours, I gotta have mine
So let's fly like a jet, are you with me?  Hell yeah
Now buckle up cause you gots to be prepared
Now I'm a take you on a funky TRU mission
You gots to pay attention so listen
I'm a keep it off on and keep your funk
You know Big Ed has just what you want
So conjunction junction, what's your function
Just like fire marshall Bill, let me show you somethin
Can't you see what you do to me
When your on your knees sucking me baby
You know it, I'm a G and you a G
So all other G's repeat after me

[Master P]
If ya don't know, now ya know
If you don't know now ya know
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
Ain't no party like a No Limit party cause a No Limit party is the shit
And ain't no hustlers like them Richmond hustlers
Cuase them Richmond hustlers don't take no shit
And ain't no hustlers like them New Orleans hustlers
Cause them New Orleans hustlers don't take no shit
And ain't no niggas like them T-R-U niggas 
cause them T-R-U niggas don't take no shit
If ya don't know, now ya know</pre>
