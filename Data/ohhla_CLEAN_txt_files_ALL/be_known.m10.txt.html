X to tha Z Xzibit

[Scarface}
I got trouble rhymes to a death the troubled times
A double nine incase niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I tried to change
But in the mist of trying to be a better man
Trouble is all I can seem to see
And the fact I know tomorrow isn't promised to me
So from this day forth I'll be all I can be
My brother turned his back on me
Got to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes is I'ma play my own hand
And I'm tired of being let down by my so-called friends
Regardless to the blood shed  no tears in the end
Father please forgive for I have sinned  forgive us all
But I ain't to blame  the lunatics wearing my heart
And I think I gotta build another wall
Cause I don't want the world to see me
Cause maybe these demons will try to end me
I'm exhausted and my body's sleepy
Never the less it's hard to rest  I'm a nervous wreck
I walk with the stress
I use to walk around with a vest
But now a days I be like "fuck it dog
You fuck with me I gots to fuck with ya'll"
And "make ends" is just another word for "pay back"
Paying you back today for this grudge that I had way back
You niggas I grew up with wouldn't play with that
I send you bitches to the morgue with holes in your head
No remorse  why you think my niggas taught me to ball?
Cause I be walking around in designer suits?
In fact these niggas know that I'm the truth
Always scandalous  eye before I shoot
For disrespect there is no excuse
Calling the choices

[Xzibit talking]
No respect, respect is respect

[Xzibit (chorus)]
X!
Want a war? Die on
Walk the line get it on
Here to today, then your gone  fucking with us
If you talk it up back it up
Paper start stacking up
Niggas start acting up
Let it be known
X!
You want a war? Die on
Walk the line get it on
Here to today, then your gone  fucking with us
If you talk it up back it up
Paper start stacking up
Niggas start acting up
Let it be known

[Mack 10]
I play with psychotic, lunatic, gang da rang shit
You know that walk up dome nigga close range shit
Mack 10  probably licked out so deep I dream on it
Locate my pray and (?) and put my red dot beam on it
Put the hammer lot squeeze on it with the dope kick in
Fuck a rage  feel the 44 shot deep with in
Bitch niggas can't fuck with true niggas by nature
And believe me dog you got a problem on your hands if I hate ya
I'll make (?) spit flames like a K nigga
Now close your eyes, pray nigga - I swear it's your day nigga
Got so much dope off its like a crack storm to me
And your heart is so gone but your ass belongs to me
Using my colors against me but this time stay true
Ain't no body to blame shoot, for you now being through
Plus and make one move to the game
When your scandalous living trife
That's when you fuck with a real nigga gotta pay with your life

[Xzibit (chorus)]
X!
Want a war? Die on
Walk the line get it on
Here to today, then your gone  fucking with us
If you talk it up back it up
Paper start stacking up
Niggas start acting up
Let it be known
X!
You want a war? Die on
Walk the line get it on
Here to today, then your gone  fucking with us
If you talk it up back it up
Paper start stacking up
Niggas start acting up
Let it be known

[Mack 10]
You say I can't hustle  well hell if I can't
I keep my nose to the grind
And go hard to the paint
With a ki of that white or a pound of that dank
And if it's dank it gotta be sticky and stank
It's the dope dealer 1-0 the powder pusher
You's a pussy so you's a dusher and blood gusher
I'ma Inglewood swangin'
I'ma rep Hoo-Bangin'
I'ma let my nuts hangin'
I'ma do tha damn thangin'
I fuck all bitch niggas and slap up hoes
And shatter windows with K's and chemicals
So when the funk kick is on
We don't need a show stopper
Get the rangin' east poppers
Squeeze and waving east choppers
Fuck around with this shit and get your wig split
Either do it myself or just pay for your hit
It's the chicken hard passion
And I'm never letting up
Anything in my way best believe I'm wetting up

[Xzibit (chorus)]
X!
Want a war? Die on

If you talk it up back it up
Paper start stacking up
