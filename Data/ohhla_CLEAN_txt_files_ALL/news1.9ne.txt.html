[Mark Alford]
I'm Mark Alford with breaking news this hour out of Pleasant Hill, Missouri, where we're getting reports of a meteorite hitting today in an open field there. Now the impact can be felt as far away as downtown Kansas City with tremors felt in high rise office buildings.

The eyewitness reports are just now coming into the news room. NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, does have an office there in Pleasant Hill. Residents of Pleasant Hill definitely heard and felt the strike and now they wanna know: how could this happen?

On what would normally be a bright and sunny day here in Kansas City, a fog of some sort is now starting to roll north from pleasant hill through Lee Summit, and now approaching the downtown loop. We're getting a good view of it now from our tower cam if you can check it out. In fact, I've never seen anything like this before, it's eerie. Something- something like you'd see in the dust bowl days. Except, it's not dust, it's a mist of some kind. The skies have turned burgundy</pre>
