[Intro: Lord Superb]
Aiyo, man, the president is back, man
Knowhatimsaying, Lord Superb, man
Far Rock America, stand up
Matter fact, ya'll niggas sit the fuck down
Like I told ya'll on that last volume, man
We done grind too much to have to stand up
Ya'll niggas stay in ya muthafucking seats and ride this thing out, man
Rest in peace to my man King Dutch, Stack Bundles
My brother Mooap Illiani, man
You know, no beat, no nothing, man, knowhatimsaying
Tribute to all my little dead niggas, knowhatimean
All my older dead niggas, youknowhatimsaying
And all my middle age niggas, man, it's like this man

[Lord Superb]
I heard niggas was hating, when Dutch copped a quarter to seven
So they killed him on the corner, around a quarter to seven
Moo sent me a sign, said he saw him in heaven
When he saw him, they did a few things
He took him to the holy store, bought him some Gucci wings
So if I die in my sleep, or they blast the kid
Bury me with money in my hand, and a flatscreen in my casket lid
Ya'll never be able to divide the team
Stack Bundles sent me his soul, he inside of me
He said, fuck it, Perb, let's colide the dream
I ain't mad that you president, I died the king
Plus I, got your letters from inside the bing
It's kind of weird how you warned me about my death inside that thing
And all them, hating niggas once you start to bling
And them R&amp;B gangstas that start to sing
See, Perb I asked God to leave, the pain was too much
Plus it was hard to breath, see
Just tell my G's, I never tried to scream
And that I, did my thing before they got my chain</pre>
