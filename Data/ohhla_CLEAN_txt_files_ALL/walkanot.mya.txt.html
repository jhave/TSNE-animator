I know I been gone for a minute y'all
I never should have left you
And everybody wanna know
What the hell is up with Mya
Well, you know

Yeah
And I'm back with a passion
Let's get it

(Verse 1)
No problem breaking myself
Off
If that's what keeps me focused
Mayne, yeah
Done have my share of silly
Heartbreaks, and now
Now I'm a bitch that got a

Chorus 1: Mya
If you a walker, not a talker
G's up (G's up)

Throw it up (Throw it up)
To all my ladies in the spot
If you workin', what you got
If you a walker, not a talker

(Verse 2)
I'm not the type from anywhere
Less I got somethin' good to say
Straight in the hills, straight in the hood, yeah
I'll take a G and flip 'em
Threeway

Hook 2: Mya
See, I'm not talk it, I'm a walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin'
Too much
Shake these haters off
Straight business, start taking charge
See, I'm not talk it, I'm a walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin'
Rule two
Put the beat on pause
Be a real boss bitch, start making calls

Chorus 2: Mya
If you a walker, not a talker
G's up (G's up)
If you a walker, not a talker
Throw it up (Throw it up)
To all my hustlers in the spot
Going harder, 'round the clock
If you a walker, not a talker
G's up (Throw it up)

My 9-to-5'er's to my C.E.O.'s, I see yas
Just raise 'em glasses if ya
Gon' go for broke

[Rap Verse: Snoop Dogg]
I'm smokin'
All up in the club
I'm gettin' what I want with the Landi in my cup
I'm wantin' more than one, I'm all by the bar
I'm in it for a second
The moment
The minute
Today and tomorrow
I'm in it for the ball
And she is, too, see, cause she all up on the Dogg
This is what I'm gon' do, ball til I fall
Me and Mya
In the back of the party
Gettin' love by everybody
Gettin' higher
The ladies just love, Snoop D-O-Doub'
They say I walk just like
And my talk is light
Matter fact, I live the boss' life

Repeat Chorus 1</pre>
