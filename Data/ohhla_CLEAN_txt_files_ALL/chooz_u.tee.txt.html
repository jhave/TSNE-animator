(Verse 1) [T.I.]
They say love blind, so why can't I picture this guhl mine?
Yea I dig her but I figure, I'm wastin this guhl time
I'm runnin from relationshipz, scared to commit
Mad at monogamy, sexually, I'm a misfit
But this shit's... way too much fo me
Usually I can take'em and make'em a cut buddy
Yo mama probably see me, and say that I'm no good
I was born in the burbs, I was raised in the hood
We from two seperate sides of life, two different backgrounds
Shawty been legit and I just started to rap now
I ain't tryina act now, I'm bein real witchu
Really, I just wanted to kick it and chill witchu
But the picture got bigger, 'fo I could even paint it
Thoughts got deeper befo' a nigga could think
A playa like me on this, strange ain't it?
One thang bout yo feelins is this, you can't change it
Yo preception on me, I don't think I can maintain
We flirtin with disaster, this game we playin iz dangerous
You the best thang that happened since I don became famous
But sometimes I think we shoulda remained strangers

(Chorus) [Jazze Pha]
I... I chose you baby
(Stay with me now, stay with me, sing it fo me shawty)
I, I, I, I... I chose you baby
(Ah, come on, uh, uh, uh c'mon)

(Verse 2) [T.I.]
I like you to persue, but still I respect it to let it go
Give it time, give it room to breathe and let it grow
I'll just tell her when I'm ready to change, I'll let her know
Hate to say it, but til then be friendz and nuthin mo
Evendoe anotha time, anotha life, anotha place
I swear I know we coulda been great
But rather than great, you lil heart take the smile of yo face
So I can treat you righ, I'm willin ta wait
And ain't shit fake, I know it sound funny comin from a felon
But I think I got a piece of whuz up in heaven
So to keep from, blockin mah blessings, think I better back up
Last thang a nigga need now is bad luck
But if my life was perfect shawty, I'da had her
I guess, I guess I don't deserve it, ballaz tell me you ain't worth it
So I gots to hit the surface, I'll holla when I holla
Act like I don't wanna see ya, and I'on wanna call'er

Repeat Chorus 2X</pre>
