[Chorus: Playa Fly]
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
[Playa Fly]
I wake and shake and love the way Fly throw these dirty dice of life
They keep me right and hype and super sharp just like a carver's knife
Out of sight, like a step I keep myself when ima see some mo
More than I been seeing and being in the sight of Mary Joe
Mob a lil bit father from ya , Bomb a little bit harder on ya
Kiss of death ya like I'm Sonya, hang ya like the Lisa Mona
Wanna be must wanted become a goner if he do rebel
Kiss the only son of bill c-h-i double L, cant you tell
Minnie Mae raised me well , I-B-N the real the realest
You can feel for life and still I let you know the deal 
The deal is done in fly and won, the wiz-un that made you run.
Run when flizy start to gun, gun you with my lyrics son
Unique like the chosen one. On tony I'm the frozen one.
Of children in I'm the golden one, on pictures I'm the posin' one
You need to backup wodie san, since i might come for you to see
I-B-N is M tha 3 fasho the realest feelin me, feelin me
FEEL ME!
 
[Chorus]
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
[Playa Fly]
From deep down in my heart I mount iz-up and start to mob again
Got mo inspiration than my occupation holds within
Entertain and toss campaign clean up thru the ceiling mane
Bustin all up out the wall cuz all this love we cant contain
Fly need love like Fly need blood, 
Fly need love like Fly need bud,
Fly need love that Fly can push and shove on each and every thug
This is aint no endin road I'll mob as far as far can go
Flizy cant just cant take no mo, and won't no hiz-o stop this show
More real than this life I live, but this here is my place in time.
So fly gone wine and dine and entertwine some music with my mind,
WATCH ME SHINE, like the sun , shine until thy kingdom come,
Shine till each and every hoping face come taste the realest one
One who's from the dirty M, Minnie Mae gone ride with him
I'm notifyin them, who Want to know the score 
I dont need no rim
IBM - naw - I B N - IBN is M the 3 
The one for you to come and see
fasho you gonna be feelin me feelin me
FEEL ME!
 
[Chorus]
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
[Playa Fly]
Ups and downs and turn-arounds surround me on this mortal ground
Pump it like a shotgun, holes in the back will quickly take you down
I break up out submission holds, with the bearings I control
The entire 70 minutes that you feelin from your stereo, HERE WE GO 
M's and Ones extend his arms ,
Cool and calm we cannot be, 
Buckin like a zulu tribe cause from inside like a LUV
off the hook like Fly streak be, R.I.P. big D.O.G 
Fly gone do it to 'em like ya told me make 'em feel me
Keep the kindness all up in me, keep the realest rollin' wit me
Tricklets are the realest in ya sight so dont you try to trick me 
Stick me with the family first, real so real so real it hurts
This game will get to much and start to lovin how this mafia works
With dirt fall from off the hurt
thats when I-B-N choose to give this up
And Flizy giz-on diz-ie tryin [gon die tryin]
to piz-ull miz-i ends on up
Strut my stuff and get it up in such ways you thought you wouldn't see
See me cause I am the real and know you gone be feelin me.
 
[Chorus: Repeat to End]
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me
 
Give this game all I can give
Show some love and keep it real
Mob as far as Fly can see
And this for L-I-F and E
Those who want some they can feel
I am the one to can come and see
I.B.N. is M to 3 fa sho the realest will feel me

FEEL ME...</pre>
