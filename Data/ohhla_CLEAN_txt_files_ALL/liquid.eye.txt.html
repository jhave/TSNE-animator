[Chorus x 2]
Rain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
Wants to be free, wants to see no more pan
We're guaranteed that the season will change
'Till then, I'm keeping sunshine on my brain
When the drops hit my head they leave a stain
Everyone wants to get out of the rain
We cannot avoid nature's bleeding vein
But I smile while it trickles down the rain

Harvested love only comes after rain
Even though it brings overwhelming strain

Is when their hands sketched the plans that remained
Every man secretly hopes he can tame
The beast he fears most 'cause it can't be slain
Towering, gray faces laugh so deranged
One day we all will break free from their chains
One day we all will break free from their chains
And rise towards the sun with good health sustained
It's almost impossible to explain
But I owe all my success to the

[Chorus]
