[Royce]
Yo, I'm runnin up on you
Whether you packin or not, whether I'm packin or not
Wit the intent to flatten your knot
Shinin like ten diamonds, I been rhymin
I write shit, the paint guides it, spit harder than ten hydrants
Firin on who try to take mine
This nigga here send you around and spin you around in the ground waist high
I'm too authentic, I'll end it soon as you walk in it
Who wanna holler, you'll get swallowed in a New York minute
If your record is gold, then stay on your goals
If you platinum listenin to me, stay on your toes
Yo they done it now, I'm over the edge
These niggas wanna stay underground, that's why the money's over their heads
Undoubtebly rowdy, I'm possibly the hottest since the Rakim odyssey
Got niggas sayin "How does he do it"
Aiyyo I gotta be, cuz ain't a nigga hotter than me
Go 'head lie to me, say you know somebody and I'll demolish you
Fed up, I got rhymes to make you shut up
Have you doubtin yourself, as to why you even have your head up
I shit on, every contender I pick on
Cuz whenever it's on I'm comin wit different levels to flip on
Don't, whether you like it or not, give off smoke in the cyphering spot
Cuz I'm liquid nitrogen hot
You ain't did nuttin I ain't done
If you ever said something dope I ain't said that
It's probably on the tip of my tongue
I've had it wit y'all, tryin to bring static and brawl
Either I'ma kill you, or you ain't make me mad at all
Phony-fuck clicks can suck dick
You know Royce 5'9'' spit only rough shit 
when it comes to this Tony Touch shit
It's over, consider this laced
I'll probably be the first nigga to get a Hip-Hop Quotable on a mixtape
Yo Royce 5'9'', Detroit shine time what! Bad and Evil is comin soon</pre>
