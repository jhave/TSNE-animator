(Intro)
(Clark Kent)
Sonja Blade, Shaq Diesel
T.W.IsM. fam uh-huh
That's right uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Say what, say what, say what

(Shaquille O'Neal)
All these destinations with split second acceleration
It caps enough time to witness you're gone evaporation
Slash paragraphs that emphasize my emphasis
Abbreviate lyricist the lyrical short hands
I kidnap planes for atmospherical advantage 
My lyrical damage the rise for mental mechanics 
With the Mic in hand I'm immortal to hu-mans
My diaphragm allows me to kill a whole clan 
Verse reversal get your verse reversed
Battle rhymes since fear in mid-air and change course 
I've been held captive for scientific attractions
Nuclear rays made my brain radioactive 
Knock the world off its axis re-design the atlas 
Re-construct the globe with gee-saw geographics
Rhythmical mathematics calculated you to average 
More elves than 90 Degree angles and graphics 

(Hook)
(Clark Kent)
Aiyyo you rap cats better sit back and relax
We getting stacks while the rest of you cats getting attacked 
By the fever y'all bad you wanna be with us
Leaving players with 20-20 they ain't seeing us 

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Aiyyo I leave you check form
I respect for when the sex raw inside the Lex four 
Which really means I'm not the one
And these Billie Jean chicks kids they not my sons 
Tryin to scratch my rips tryin to match my chips 
And yo Shaq. snatched my chips 
So my position is to strike with opposition 
Y'all wouldn't know pop the kids who always choose not to listen
So I'm relentless
End it like a seven-day inventiss
Who wanna play against this?
Get rich is senseless ya rather get bent 
While I stack cash you cats never spit 
It evident I flow predicates flows as evidence 
Hittin chicks yelling they celebrant for the hell of it 
In the chest is where the metal went 
Never delicate is how I'm tellin it 
So anything else is irrelevant, the what

(Hook w/ variations)
(Clark Kent)
Aiyyo you rap cats better sit back and relax
We getting stacks while the rest of you cats getting attacked 
By the fever y'all bad you wanna be with us
Leaving players with 20-20 they ain't seeing us

(Sonja Blade)
Aiyyo I go to war and break Mics 
From daylight to late night 
And blades strike just like a snakebite 
Kiss the venom is toxic 
Call me clumsy cause I always drop.
Don't have to lick slugs at men
I spit rays as like Pac in "Above the Rim"
I'm above him or her, Jim or Gin, the fur 
And Tim's, the tennis skirts forelimbs to mini firms 
And if I spit first you get it worst 
Get a nurse or leave in a tenant Hurst
Suit yourself it's hot.. towards boots to melt 
It's murder either way so shoot yourself 
Let me know you want war yes or no?
My crew link like exinal a chick with a lot of testicles
Especially those freshly clothed 
So please don't test me hoes  
I guess these flows got you beating your Johnson 
Eating a Swanson and wishing for my death like Charles Bronson

(Hook)
(Clark Kent)
Aiyyo you rap cats better sit back and relax
We getting stacks while the rest of you cats getting attacked 
By the fever y'all bad you wanna be with us
Leaving players with 20-20 they ain't seeing us

(Outro)
(Clark Kent)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
What, this is how we do
Uh, yeah mop crew 
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
Shaq diesel, T.W.IsM. fam 
Sonja Blade word from 
Clockworld, Supaman 
Yeah, hahahahahahah
You know, we know 
Uh-huh, yeah from now until whenever 
How we get down, Big Cuz 
Around the boards, record lord </pre>
