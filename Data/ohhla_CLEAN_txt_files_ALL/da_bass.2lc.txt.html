Intro:
(mysterious music)
"Absolutely no one under 17 will be admitted 
without parent or certified adult guardian."
"They'll fry your brain.  They're sick as hell!"
"Jolly good fun."
"You'll die dancin'!"
"Dark, gliding shapes that glide every long inch ... "
"Buy 'em or die a thousand deaths!"

Chorus:
(Heyy!)
(2 Live Crew)
(Boys with the bass!)
("You better know it!")

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
That's right y'all, you heard it 'cause we said it
And if you can't read in the magazines,
You read about who?  You know the Crew!  Fresh outta Pac
And the first to put the bass on the 24-track
Some said it wouldn't work, some said it wouldn't last
In New York, they say that the tempo's too fast
You disregarded, but the albums got charted
We put 'em in the stores and millions habe bought it
An underground sound, not liked by radio
You hear it in the cars and at the dicso
On the airwaves, we misbehave
We're too bold, too rugged in our nasty ways
&gt;From dirty minds come dirty rhymes
We're not gonna beg for your time
You don't play it?  That's cool with me
But somehow, our bass still reaches the street
As long as we got it, you can get it
People want the bass, so some try to steal it
From behind our back, and not in our face
'Cause 2 Live is the Crew, the boys with the bass!

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Holdin' out own in the South-East region
When you come to the bottom, pledge to our allegiance
I'm glad to say that we're the proud owners,
The rock-and-rollers, you can't us this over
The name of the game is supply and demand
We supply the bass while you demand our jams
We could not wait to bring our bass to you
Because in this game, you lag, you lose
See, we serve our bass raw, straight up and not false
This is the kind you dance to, and not on 8-Ball
Plenty of bass, the beat, and the rhyme
That my homeboy Mr. Mixx carefully designed
Hittin' hard as hell, and always droppin'
Bass is the reason why you are rockin'
When you hear our songs, and you see our face
Put two and two together; we're the boys with the bass!

Chorus

("It's the best in this city!")</pre>
