(Ladies and gentlemen, Jordan Croucher)

(*Sample of Jordan's new song playing in the club*)

(*Beat starts*)

[Verse 1 - Jordan Croucher]
Whoaaa, whoaaa
See my world, I share it with no one, hope you know
You're my girl, so there's no other way I can go
When we got together I didn't know for sure
But it's alright (it's alright), it's alright (it's alright)
See girl I'm the type of guy who used to creep on the low
Now my playin days are gone girl, I don't need them no more
'Cause I found me somebody (woo!)
Uh, and she's all mine (I, I), she's all mine

[Chorus - Jordan Croucher] - w/ ad libs
I never thought that I (never thought I'd feel this way)
Could ever feel this way (and there's nothin I can say
See you came into my life and now my love don't have to stray)
I never thought that IIIII (never thought I'd feel this way)
Could ever feel this way (and there's nothin I can say
See you came into my life and now my love don't have to stray)
You got me goin (you got me goin all the way girl)
I can't control it (and there ain't nothin I can say girl)
You got me goin (you got me goin all the way girl)
I can't control it (and there ain't nothin I can say girl)

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Ye-ye-ye-yeah, that shit sound alright
Got the whole club gettin down all night
Fellas in the back dr-drinking and smokin
Ladies front row sc-screamin and shoutin
I observe with a bit of a smirk
'Cause it feels good seein people feel my work
Drink all gone, gotta refresh
Jordan's last song, Bru is on next (*beat fades out*)
He hit the stage and kept movin
With a perfect execution
He rocked it, closed the show
Had the ladies sayin "hey!" and the fellas yellin "ho!"

(*Sample of J-Bru's live performance*)

(*New beat starts*)

[Break - J-Bru - talking]
Now somebody say "ho" (ho!), say "ho, ho" (ho! ho!)
Now anybody, everybody scream (*yelling*)
Peace

[Verse 3 - Classified]
So all in all it was a good night
Nobody fightin, no one knocked out like Suge Knight (ha)
See our clubs are usually hesitant to book our type
I guess hip hop has built a name that they don't like, but it's alright
We gonna make it happen, left the club, then we took off
Then hit Pizza Corner for kabobs and hot sauce
Four in the morning, this becomes a hot spot
Last real chance for you to get your rocks off
But me, I think I had enough
Alright one last puff (*inhale*), that's the stuff (*exhale*)
Taxi, alright fellas, I'm gone
It's almost 4:30 in the morn', catch ya later on</pre>
