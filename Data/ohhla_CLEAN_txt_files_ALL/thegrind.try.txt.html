Typed by: cuzgansta@aol.com

Hook:

You tell me yo life and I'ma tell you mine
You show me yo ice and I'ma show you mine
And don't say money I put it all on the line
And you can't fuck with me because my niggas is the grind

Verse 1: Nature Boy

Check it out now
Rap stars be flexing
All about how they living ain't been through nothing
Everybody G'd up and thuggin'
Cold pimpin' or King Pin husslin'
Knowing half the time
Half of yo cream puffs dropping dimes, over petty crimes
And if ya ever get time, ya get ya came hit from behind
I done flip mo' breaks at 26 so quick through the click
Boy unit ain't shit
Done hurt mo' thieves then a little bit
If the ho chose me thats a pimpette
See I know the game
And most of y'all rappers lame
Ain't never sold 3 or 4 things
Never been a pimp
Never shot at point blank range
Y'all hos just claimin' the fame

Hook:

You tell me yo life and I'ma tell you mine
You show me yo ice and I'ma show you mine
And don't say money I put it all on the line
And you can't fuck with me because my niggas is the grind

Verse 2: Pastor Troy

Okay,
I'm in the mist of haters
So called gators and cash
The only creators is the niggas that flash
And then they make this dash to the race thats never ending
These niggas think they ballin'
But all I see is spending
And lending they flows to these groupie hos
And take 'em to stos and buying these bitches clothes
I know that y'all know better than that
So I'ma play a game of return of the mac
And bring it back
Just like little Joe
Cause y'all know how niggas do
For every bitch you want my nigga I got two
So shawty woopy di do if you got yo dick sucked
Nigga I got a bitch that get a kick out eating nutts
Gutts ain't shit
Head is all that
Why?
Fucking sweat when sucking dick the same effect
Put yet these niggas don't believe in the Kid
And I'm the kind of muthafucker that say fuck the shit?What they did, ain't
never hit the breaks in the Chevy
Because I knew that all them muthafuckers wan ready
I was steady make money nigga fuck the date
Look at me now, got muthafuckers buying my tape
And I can't wait to Georgia State invite me to the village
Put me in the Georgia Dome nigga bet I can fill it
Can y'all feel it
I swear the God the lyrics sincere
Its Pastor Troy, Nature Boy lay it down like this here

Hook: 2x

You tell me yo life and I'ma tell you mine
You show me yo ice and I'ma show you mine
And don't say money I put it all on the line
And you can't fuck with me because my niggas is the grind</pre>
