   A young hog in the hood playin' chase
   Smile on his face
   Havin' fun 'cuz it ain't nothin' like this place
   And you don't wanna race
   Fool I got the new ones on
   And we can run from the corner to the Newman's home
   And after that we goin' go raid the plum tree
   And stick ball down where those bos be
   Mom's got the door open bumpin' Marvin Gaye
   Let's get it on all day everyday
   At night I pray
   Lord just let me make it
   And if I die before I wake then my soul you take it
   Never fake it
   My older brother taught me game
   And sometimes even let the young soldier hang
   As a loc
   My only duty was to soak
   And pass it on to my comrads and closest folks
   All friends I knew about it as a child
   I stood proud have you ever seen a ghetto smile?
   
   I'm at the junior high actin bad at the dance
   The slow jam got me with a woody in my pants
   And my baby with me
   Her Momma used to babysit me
   And back then she was just plain old pretty
   But nowadays it seems that she done grown
   Jeans fitting and her perm gotta hella long
   Would I be wrong if I whisper and take her down
   And maybe play housesitter with her like the Pound
   It's goin' down about now in the Northern Bay
   The OG's put it down and make they pay
   Flip a 6-8 'stang with the blew out braids
   The only homey in the hood ridin' on thangs
   And as I peep it thangs have got a little deeper
   And everybody and their Momma done bought a beeper
   And then they post on the lake gettin' loose and wild
   You know the scene it's the ghetto smile
   
   At 18 I graduated and now I'm grown
   About time for the dog to get his own bone
   I left home got a condo out on Quailridge
   And like a king is how this young playa live
   Swimmin' parties in the pool with my dope to roll
   Wasn't trippin' off nathin' we was all folks
   Hillside in the house and we gettin' perved
   Freestylin' gettin' on my neighbor's nerves
   I love the hood so everyday I'm back to visit
   And swoop the young so that they can come through and kick it
   And peep the game just as I did as a kid
   And watch the savage get his cabbage and place his bid
   And even though we fight we still remain game tight
   Handle business and always open for fogiveness
   It ain't nothin' like a homey you ain't seen in awhile
   So when you meet him greet him with that ghetto smile
