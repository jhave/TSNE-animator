Song:   Everyday Normal Guy 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You want some more of this bitch?
Back and easy... We could do this all year long

I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I told you in a first song, I'll tell you in another
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I don't have a girlfriend, my hand's my only lover
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
One night a week, my mom likes to cook me supper
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
And Michael Keaton was my favourite Batman

I was walking down the street just the other day
I saw these two fine bitches, they were walking my way
"Yo, what you girls are doing tonight?" is what I wanted to say
But suddenly, I panicked, my voice started to shake
So I put my head down and I just walked away
I had a bus to catch anyway, It worked out great
Got on the bus, put on my headphones on and pressed play
Sheryl Crow, James Blunt and motherfuckin' Ace of Base

Yo what can I say
It's just a day in my life
I'm up early in the morning and bed early at night
To be productive at work I got to be well rested
Yeah motherfucker you heard what I just said

I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I don't like margarine I much prefer the taste of butter
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
My favorite movies as a kid were superman and ghostbusters
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I have a hard time opening my eyes underwater
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
And I'm not a huge Nicolas Cage fan

I'm from a lower middle class family
Me and my brothers and sisters played hide-and-seek
I have good memories from my childhood, bitch
My favorite toy was my fuckin' fire truck, bitch
I used to play with that motherfucker all day long
Until I learned about sex from the Sears catalogue
and then I played with my motherfucker all day long
About ten times a day, man, all year long

My favorite song motherfucker I don't like to admit it
Is the Celine Dion song from the movie Titanic
Every night in my dreams I see you I feel you
Everytime I hear that fucking shit a tear comes to my eye
Why the fuck did Leonardo Dicaprio had to die
Though I'm not afraid to say that I'm a sensitive guy
Sticks and stones break my bones but its the worst that make me cry
Like that time in grade three when girl called me stupid face
She really hurt me, Why did she called me stupid face?
Is my face stupid? How's that even possible?
A person can be stupid, but a face, that's impossible
Shit happens all the time and you learn how to deal with it
Regular everyday normal fuckin' bullshit

I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
When I get into a fight I usually leave on a stretcher
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
When I've got nothing to say I usually talk about the weather
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I liked the first "Back to the future" but the second one was better
I am just a regular everyday normal motherfucker...
I like red peppers better than the green ones

Ou-ouhh, Savin' up my money to buy a new dishwasher
Mine broke about 6 months ago
Motherfucker

Go Go Go Go
Go Charlie
It's your birthday
Go party like it's your birthday
I wasn't invited but its okay
I just stayed at home and played some videogames</pre>
