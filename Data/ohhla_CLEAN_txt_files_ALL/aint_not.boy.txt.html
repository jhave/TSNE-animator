[Chorus]
I'm still real nigga, ain't nothin' changed
I'm in the Ville witcha, ain't nothin' changed
You know I won't stop, ain't nothin' changed
Until I'm on top, ain't nothin' changed
I'm fuckin with the boys, ain't nothin' changed
You know we makin' noise, ain't nothin' changed
I'm bout getting more, ain't nothin' changed
I hafta let'em know, ain't nothin' changed

[First Verse]
Nigga, ain't nothing changed but my age
But I'm still gangsta, I ain't changed in my ways
I'll take the charge for everything that I say
Fuck these niggaz cuz they talking sideways
If a nigga really wanna think that I changed
Come to the Bay, young nigga, where I hang
Niggaz smoke weed, sip drank, and all that
If that ain't gutter, then what do ya call that?
I stay grindin all the time to get more
Aint gonna stop til I'm sittin on big dough
Paul and Juicy J snatched a nigga in Frayser
Now a nigga on, bunch of these niggaz is haters
HCP, tryna get my shine on
Lot of these niggaz, I gotta keep from firing on
But I gotta chill, stay away from the dumb shit
Let them kill themselves, sit back and become rich
Ya dig?

[Chorus]
I'm still real nigga, ain't nothin' changed
I'm in the Ville witcha, ain't nothin' changed
You know I won't stop, ain't nothin' changed
Until I'm on top, ain't nothin' changed
I'm fuckin with the boys, ain't nothin' changed
You know we makin' noise, ain't nothin' changed
I'm bout getting more, ain't nothin' changed
I hafta let'em know, ain't nothin' changed

[Second Verse]
Yeah, I know you still feel the heat from the first verse
I got something for any nigga who wanna squirt first
And I ain't playing games, and I ain't saying names
Cuz that's for anyone of you bitches, that's on everything
I try to keep the peace, but I ain't kissing ass
I roll with killas, drug dealers, you'll get missing fast
I ride with Three-Six, there's not a nann nother
Them niggaz put me on, I love em like brothers
Them niggaz got me out the hood like whatever though
They kept me out a lot of shit that you will never know
I picked another route, I chose the rap game
I'm like minus all the stuntin, I just stack change
I try to think smart and try to stay ahead
But bro, my family or my kid, you don't play with that
So if you wanna plot, I'm gon leave you with this
I ain't gotta be around when you get hit
