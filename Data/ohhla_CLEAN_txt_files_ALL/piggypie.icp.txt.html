Piggy Pie

"Ahhh! We did it! Woo! 
We got some fresh fills for your fat chicken-ass to snack on, bitch! 
So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!"

[Violent J]
The first little piggy, his house is made of wood 
He lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood
He likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine 
A typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine 
I rode into town with my axe in my holster 
Everybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster 
A farmer at the border, he tried to take me out 
I drew my ax with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out 
Walked in the village, and to the piggy's place 
He opened up his door, and popped me in the face 
And blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half 
But I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (hehe) 
Forty in hand, I rose from the dead 
And threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head 
Since we out west, I had a little fun
And pulled his fuckin tongue out the back of his cranium

[Chorus (1x)]
Three little piggies, to make a piggy pie 
There's nothing like the sound when you hear a piggy die 
I might use a gun (no), I might use an ax (yes) 
The carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
The second little piggy, his house is made of brick 
And this little piggy is a motherfucking dick 
He sits on his bench and gets all the respect 
But if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck 
He walked in the room, and everybody rose 
Lopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes
First they let the piggy, now you can finally sit 
But what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet 
Now I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?
I can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up 
Old-ass man, I let him get away 
That tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow anyway 
Here come the piggy, it's time for my case 
His eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face 
He saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me to die 
So I ragged on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds

[Chorus (2x)]

[Violent J]
The last little piggy, his house is made of gold 
He lives in a mansion on his own private road
I started walking down it, the guard he told me wait 
I bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate
Cuz this little piggy, must definitely fry 
I'm a lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky 
And then I watch the moon take the form of the devil 
And pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel 
People in my city, they fightin for they meals 
He sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills 
How rich he is the devil, he never will admit it 
So I'm a take his money stack and stuff his face with it 
Opened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed 
I grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head 
He begged for his life, I told him it's too late 
And took away his dough and watched the devil suffercate
Cuz I need...

[Chorus (4x)]
