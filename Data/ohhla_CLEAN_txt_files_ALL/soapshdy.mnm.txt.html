[Roger]  Skylar Montgomery?
[Skylar] What do you want from me Roger?
[Roger]  I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica!
[Skylar] Wait a minute, you hold it right there. 
	 Me and that woman love each other
[Roger]  Love!? 
	 What do you know of love?
[Skylar] We were destined to be together
	 I met her on the beach!
[Roger]  Are you out to destroy me?
[Skylar] No Roger. That's not what I want to do
	 I love her! And were going to be together
[Roger]  Never!</pre>
