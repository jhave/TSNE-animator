[Intro]
Turn the music up

[Lil Wayne]
Y.M. C.M.B., bitches call me Tunechi Lee
I be with niggaz that shoot police, I keep that iron - you can get creased
And if she say she didn't fuck, bitch you're lyin through ya teeth
They say it cost to be the boss, the ones in jail wish they were free
Niggaz call me Hi-C, because I'm high as you can see
Niggaz say they paid they dues, well I'm checkin your receipt
Might as well go stupid since this is a stupid beat
Grab the owl out the tree, and ask that bitch - who but me?
Got your bitch bent over nigga hands to her feet
Tell that pig and that cow I'll go ham if it's beef
Cause all my niggaz well rounded, don't fuck with none of these square niggaz
Mask on Ghostface Killah, draw down and erase niggaz
I'm a blood, is you a blood donor? Swisher full of that California
I hit it sideways cat-a-corner, then she catch that nut like pneumonia
Lil Tunechi~

[Chorus]
Lay it down hoe
Lay it down bitch
Lay it down hoe
Lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Put the money on the couch nigga
Gimme everything up in yo' house nigga, shut yo' mouth nigga
Put the money on the couch nigga
Gimme everything up in yo' house nigga, shut yo mouth nigga

[Cory Gunz]
Start it up, vroom vroom
Uppercut a bitch out the bus, boom boom
Unless I get the brain, poom poom
She let a nigga run and get the gang, run a train, zoom zoom
Tryin to get paid too soon, one deep
One sweep away in a room room
We getting money over here, talkin shit and fuckin bitches
I don't know what the fuck they doing Tune'
My syrup purple, my turf Earth
My birth circle, I'll dirt surf you
I'll squirt and murk you, my verse hurtful
My shooters still got curb curfews
Y'all 'bout as hot as Von Dutch; y'all not gon' harm much
Hijack y'all some prom busts, ain't no retreat but my arms up
We don't graffiti, my bombs up
It's Young Money in this shit until a nigga dead and gone
If you wanna set it off, what you wanna bet it on?
I'm bettin the wedding's off when everything is wetted on
Point 'em out, +Truk+ ya life, fuck your style, fuck with me
You a bucket foul, niggaz'll buck your smile
for a ducat pile, you better duck it, pal

[Chorus]
Lay it down hoe
Lay it down bitch
Lay it down hoe
Lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhh - yo~! Shawty, what's yo' name?
Is you trickin? Is you payin?
Is you sniffin, on that cane?
What the fuck, is you sayin?
If you gettin it, then you gettin it
It's my money, I ain't splittin it
I ain't trippin it, if she got a fat ass, then I'm tippin it
Come out the bank, bye teller
Give up her money, hi fella
Bad lil' hoe, high yellow
Brand new Roley, sky dweller
Just left from Dubai, flew private eye
I made a million dollars, swear to God that ain't no lie
Asked if them niggaz was poppin, fake niggaz be watchin
My black glove be drippin wet, but I got my +Cochran+
Losin ain't no option, I'm teachin bitches my doctrine
The Maybach ain't poppin if it ain't got a par-tation
Oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition
I said, oops I mean partition, it's all a part of my vision
I sit and count this money while I watch you bitches audition

[Outro: Nicki Minak]
Hehehehe! Fuck wrong with you bitches?
I don't give a fuck
You don't hear me, you don't see me, bitch you gon' feel me hoe
It's Young Money
Young, Young Money nigga
Young, Young, lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down, ahhh!</pre>
