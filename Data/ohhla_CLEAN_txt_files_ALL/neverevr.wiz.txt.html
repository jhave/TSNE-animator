[talking]
Yea buddy
I gotta cold and all that shit
Show ya'll how hard I work
I really go and man
It's from the heart and soul
Still havin fun tho too man
It's gon be a real big year
You watch I'm tellin you

[Chorus]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players and it
And they don't wanna my team get up there and win it
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Verse 1]
I started off jus a fan writing like every other kid, grew up to be the man
Paying bills at my mothers crib, everyday I'm hustlin, tryna get us out this situation
Gotta deal with phony show goofy hoes and niggas hatin, mostly all embraces
Small percentage of my city races, instead of doin good they rather see me catchin cases
The fans love me but I struggle tryna impress the label
An all this gotta feelin like isway to much up on the table, I'm still smoking outta O
Sum speculations cus I'm hardly ever home, easy to say for how supose to move on
Wen were goin threw depression an our brother Os gon, was told you gotta go threw hell to get the big thing
An will you feel it can't get worse that's when shit change, obama president
The Steelers won the 6 six, so I ought ther tryna I fell like I can do anything

[Chorus]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players and it
And they don't wanna my team get up there and win it
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Bridge]
Started small town, now were major
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement
We dun made it to the top floor from the basement

[Verse 2]
Yea
Big city small town, cus wen your moneys up that's when they all round
But the minute that you slip they dip, and there no one to depend on wen the chips fall down
Me I never cut a corner short I follow protocall, got my focus on, took my notes in all
This hard work gon pay off, the second that I'm rich I'll take a day off day off

[Chorus]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players and it
And they don't wanna my team get up there and win it
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever

[Verse 3]
Yea, yup
If your out there on the grind, put your hands up and the sky, say we grinding, uh huh
Aye, if you got it but you tryna get sum moe tell em boys that we climbin, this for my people
Who no bout struggling, tryn get sumthing cus we came up from nothing
Wat you and a rush for, it's all about timing, but soon as your on you know the limits the sky

[Chorus]
They say the game dun change, there's jus sum new players and it
And they don't wanna my team get up there and win it
Tried to keep me still but look where I'm at now, made it to far to look back down
And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told
And I ain't never ever goin back to being broke
Cus FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever</pre>
