Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I knew dis bitch named candy caught her creepin in my pocket
I told her don't be stealin baby whatchu need I got it
You know that I be lieing if I tell why to shake em'
I take ya bitch from nothin turn her to a money maker
Was fuckin wit a nugget now she fuckin wit a laker
I took from the nuggets now she to that coke n stick ups
Talkin private flight thou's a night she hit the shaker
I took her from the house to a couple thousand on the make up
Its money in dem couches couple ounces for the wake up
Primness always grindin never winein crush the grape up
Toastin by the ocean down to drink up
Made you never play you life a bitch until we break up

Me and you
Yo momma and yo cousin too
Rollin down the strip on 4's
Pullin up slammin Cadillac doors
Me and you
Yo momma and yo cousin too
Rollin down the strip on 4's
Pullin up slammin Cadillac doors

Did it time n time it make no sense a nigga down it
Could only hit the blunt a couple times n den I out it
But you know I'm tryna get her higher than a tower
Sippin on that purple drinkin rollin up dat dowa
First you get da money den respect and den da power
Life could be so pretty give you phanny den da flowers
Keep my circle close make a toast the world is ours
Shorty gave me brain she graduated outa howard
I'm countin every second money comin every hour
You know I'm bringin magic in the game just call me Howard
I'm tryna keep you lookin good when nigga's lookin sour
You fuckin wit dem g's a thousand deaths to dem cowards

Me and you
Yo momma and yo cousin too
Rollin down the strip on 4's
Pullin up slammin Cadillac doors
Me and you
Yo momma and yo cousin too
Rollin down the strip on 4's
Pullin up slammin Cadillac doors</pre>
