(Intro/Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
Why don't you make, hah, a resolution
Heh, for God sake, give a contribution
Huh, you're filthy rich huh, so help the world
Donate some dough to the starvin' boys and girls
They ain't eatin', we're just chillin', stop the killin'

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
Change your ways huh, start givin'
Huh, you're livin' like every day is thanksgivin'
Huh, cool songs huh, nice cars, clear sky, bright stars
Funky, funky beats on the radio be pumpin'
Hah, you're so cool, well let us tell you somethin':
Change your ways

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
Hey you, don't be stupid, comprehend
the words I'm speakin' to a beat
that's crazy funky and keeps the people freakin'
Just trust through us, you're listenin' to God talk
Mic check 1, 2, huh, hey fellas tell 'em what they need to do

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
Come on, come on, let's do it, let's do it
There's just so many of us, huh
hey yo, there ain't nothin' to it
We're just too strong, can't nothin' stop the movement
Hah, party people listen - the world has room for improvement
The groove is small and I know you've
been thinkin' a lot about this jam
So take his hand and take her hand
and let's all lend a hand to our fellow man

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(LL Cool J)
We can do it, hah, that's right, but you gotta, gotta warn her
We gotta help the junkies tastin' their dream
fiendin' on the corner
Cause yo we got the power
And man we are the world, so what you wanna do
What you wanna do homeboys and all you fly girls?
Put your cigarette out, throw away your drink
Take a moment of silence to stop and think
Hah, we gotta change our ways huh
Or we'll never see brighter days

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways

(Outro: LL Cool J)
Word up, youknowhatI'msayin'?
All we gotta do is change our ways
and everything will be aight youknowhatI'msayin'?
There's so far to go youknowImean?
But we gotta keep fightin', we gotta struggle youknowhatImean?
And we stay alive, only the strong survive
So part of you can change your ways and you'll be aight
Peace from LL Cool J

(Chorus)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Change your ways </pre>
