[Zack de la Rocha]
Man walks along the railroad track..
He's goin' some place, there's no turnin' back..
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up, over the ridge..
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge..
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner..
Welcome to the New World Order..
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest..
No job, no hope, no peace, no rest...NO REST!!

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight..
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes..
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light..
Searchin' for The Ghost Of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag..
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag..
He's waitin' for the time when the "last shall be first, and the first shall be last"
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass..
With a one way ticket to the Promised Land..
With a, hole in your belly and a, gun in your hand..
Lookin' for a pillow of, solid rock..
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts..

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight..
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes..
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light..
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom said, "Ma
Whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy..
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries..
Wherever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air..
Look for me ma', I'll be there
Wherever somebody's stuglin' for a place to stand..
For a decent job or a helpin' hand..
Wherever somebody is strugglin', to be free..
Look in their eyes ma, you'll see me!
You'll see me!
You'll see me!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!
YOU'LL SEE ME!!

[Chorus]
And the highway is alive tonight..
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes.
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light..
With The Ghost Of Tom Joad..</pre>
