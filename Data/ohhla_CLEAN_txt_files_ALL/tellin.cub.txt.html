Boo, you know I love you
I'm always gonna be there for you
I'm never gonna cheat on you
I go to school, I go to work
You come home, I cook, I clean
I rub your feet, give you a nice back massage
Always honey, you're a king in my eyes
I don't give a shit what people gotta say about us
It's just me and you and you know it's always gonna be like that
Boo, I love you, always and forever..

[Cuban Link]
Yea, yea, yo,
Everybody knows that you're really a hoe,
So why you still tellin lies to me,
All my homies always told me you were phoney,
Callin me your one and only,
But you really tellin lies to me,
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby,
Tellin everone you love me,
But you really tellin lies to me,
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy,
Frontin just to get my money,
When I know you tellin lies to me,

Mami, you fly but you lie too much,
You not the type to trust,
You got'cha eyes on the prize tryin to ride the bus,
You like the plush life, but money cant buy true love,
You just a slut, right, 'cause every night you up in the clubs,
Shakin' you butt, gettin drunk, coming home fucked up,
If you dont want me then I might just find somebody who does,
You too much, I cant put up with it, you drivin me nuts,
You like to live it up when I'm the one supplyin the bucks,
I thought I knew who you was, but you changed,
The way you used to do things for me,
Now all you do is hang out with your friends,
Only call me to bore me wit all your fake phoney stories,
Talkin 'bout you up in Jackies house having a cup of coffee, C'MON?!
You know me better than that,
Always stay ahead of the pack,
Mad at the fact I didn't catch it from scratch,
Now that the cats out of the bag,
I'm lookin back at the past,
Silly bag, you neva loved me, you was after my cash..BIATCH!

Everybody knows that you're really a hoe,
So why you still tellin lies to me,
All my homies always told me you were phoney,
Callin me your one and only,
But you really tellin lies to me,
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby,
Tellin everone you love me,
But you really tellin lies to me,
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy,
Frontin just to get my money,
When I know you tellin lies to me,

Hey lady, remember me?
That little kid who took your virginity,
Givin you all you need and swore to love you 'till infinity,
Remember me?
The one whos been there for you, willing to care for you,
Even when you dont share the truth,
Remember me?
I took you from a girl to a woman, gave you the world,
Plus made your toes curl when I put it in you,
Remember me?
And in the begining we was friends indeed like it was meant to be,
But now its like I'm sleeping with the enemy,
Ofendin me pretending to be something you're not,
So I had to turn back the clock just in case you forgot,
Dont mean to blow up your spot but you owe me a lot,
You were so innocent, now you're the biggest hoe on the block,
Always lookin hot, talkin like you calling the shots,
I'm at my job while you freakin off suckin on cocks,
Now that I know the whole plot, should I forgive you or not?
Just kick rocks bitch and be happy that you didn't get shot, WORD UP.

Everybody knows that you're really a hoe,
So why you still tellin lies to me,(why you tellin lies to me?)
All my homies always told me you were phoney,
Callin me your one and only,
But you really tellin lies to me, (why you tellin lies to me?)
It's kinda funny, you be callin me you hubby,
Tellin everone you love me,
But you really tellin lies to me, (why you tellin lies to me?)
Honey why you tryin to play me like a dummy,
Frontin just to get my money,
When I know you tellin lies to me, (why you tellin lies to me?)

[Tony Sunshine]
Why'd you lie to me,
Why'd you lie to me,
Why'd you lie to me,
Why'd you lie to me,
Ooh, girl, you's a hoe,
So you know I really gotta let you go,
Should've never really put my trust in you,
Ooh, girl, you's a hoe,
So you know I really gotta let you go,
Should've never really put my trust in you..
