Song:   No Such Thing As Too Late
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know you think I be trippin'
Thinkin' I be playing you be sayin' I'm ain't into you.
Just take a second to listen
Cause I ain't into laying with just anybody
Baby I ain't trying to give my body so soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me know you're worth it
Do you deserve a chance to
To touch, to feel my love
Cause ain't nobody perfect
Underneath the surface can you
Show me your love

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got no where to go
It 'll be way better if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late

You told me you're different
You be always saying you ain't nothing like them other dudes
I'm judging from my intuition (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seem like somebody I could probably give myself to
Not so soon.

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I want you to love me
Whenever you get that chance to
To touch, to feel my love
Cause ain't nobody
Cause ain't nobody perfect underneath the surface
Can you show me your love

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got no where to go
It 'll be way better if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late

[Bridge]
Listen to my heart
And I'll listen to yours
And if they say the same thing
Then I'll know we're ready

But until then we should be patient let's not start
But when we start, I promise you gon' love it baby

[Chorus]
And when it's time
I won't even have to tell you so
You see the stars are shining the same
So take your time
Cause love ain't got no where to go
It'll be way better if we wait
Cause there's no such thing as too late
When you really love somebody you can wait (don't ya think)
Cause there's no such thing as too late</pre>
