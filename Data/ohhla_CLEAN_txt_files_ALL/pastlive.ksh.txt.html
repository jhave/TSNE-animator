Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We were lovers in a past life
I can see it in your green eyes
Maybe you were one of my wives
In the long lost tribe

There's just somethin' 'bout you I know
Started centuries ago though
You see your kiss is like a lost ghost
Only I would know

But I, I keep on falling for you
Time after time, time after time
I'll make you mine, time after
Time after time

Seems milleniums ago, love
We were nothing more than stardust
Just the galaxy beneath us
We found weight

Then we made it through the Ice Age
But I lost you in the crusades
I build the pyramids for you, babe
Just to see your face

But I, I keep on falling for you
Time after time, time after time
I'll make you mine, time after
Time after time, yeah

(Time after time)
(Time after time)
(Time after time)

(Time after time)
(Time after time)
(Time after time)</pre>
