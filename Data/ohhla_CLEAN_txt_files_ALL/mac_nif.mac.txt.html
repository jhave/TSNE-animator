All praise is due

Yeah
To the Mac disciples
Fo' sho'

Let no bitch go unbroke

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm from the corner of the Earth, a loc hood, a thug turf
Itty-bitty city where we all do dirt
Can't tell you 'bout 'beef', but yo, I sho' know 'funk'
When niggas slide up on ya, start the Must' and dump
See, I'm from a small town where the hogs is found
Hope the pigs don't squeal while I chase this mill
Won't be wearin Air Nikes, maybe gator boots
And kick the head off a lame bitch, about my loot
Now I ain't no pimp, Mall mo' Mac-nificient
Manipulatin master, hittin hoes like licks
I know your man ain't sauce like this
He can wear 10 Rolexes, that nigga still be a trick
While every word I bless you with
'll have you light-headed and make your puss wet
Gods gift to mackin, all y'all privileged
To get touched by the Messiah and bear witness
As a young crumbsnatcher I perfected the art
Control a woman through her mind and heart
And her body gon' follow
Little mama quick to grab the ??rallo??
And blast like it ain't no tomorrow
If I tell her, now you can have all the pussy you want
But when I hoe get a mack in her life, she can't front
I bump a bitch from Donald Trump and have her smokin on blunts
She gettin my bread while I get crunked
I'm Mac-nificient

[ CHORUS ]
For the world to see
What the youngsters strive to be
For bosses and the ghetto elite
Mac-nificient
For the suckers to hate
For the fake that try to duplicate
But only those who know can relate
Mac-nificient
For my niggas who never had no chance
For my family doin years in the pen
I'm Mac-nificient
For all my niggas from the gutter
Keep it mackin, muthafucka, we ain't never goin under
Mac-nificient

[ VERSE 2 ]
You might catch me out in L.A. smokin on a pair of quajay
With a broad that like to go both ways
And down to do everything I say
It's major cool every time we parlay
Cause mayn, some real freaky shit take place
Like grindin in my Vee-doub, gettin major dick sucked
Doin 160, 'bout to bust me a big nut
The life that I lead
Fast money, fly bitches and weed
If you'se a player, then follow my lead
I teach you how to be coach 
And not just a mark for a punk-rock hoe
If you'se a ???? teach her how to be shob
Stand tall through it all
Plus stay on top, so next time you say 'game'
You better see me, Young Khomeiny
With a 100 carat mouth piece 
Every line silky like a Taiwan weave
Ain't no tellin where you see me 
With them felons, boy, poppin them p's
We mac-nificient

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
All praise is to the greatest
Mallennium keep em fascinated
Our part of game elevated, the shit you on is basic
Now you can be a dope dealer, a sick lick hitter
Big rap star or $5-ass nigga
A killer with nothin to lose
To a multi-millionnaire muthafucka shootin hoops
And still be a buster, you know how fools do
Quick to count on every route they choose
Then wonder why the bitch won't obey your rules
Suffer square snooze you lose
Could never walk a day in my shoes
I keep it in a Mac fashion, stickin to my own script
Gleamin like a fine-cut diamond
Mac-nificient

Aight come on, Fem

[ CHORUS ]

Yes sir
M-a-c y'all
Young M-a-c Mall
Boss game Ayatollah Khomeiny 535% proof
You know what I'm sayin?
Keepin this shit Mac-nificient
Everybody ain't able, mayn
Please believe, nephew</pre>
