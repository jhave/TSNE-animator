Household Maid
'92

Yo, Red
You know what I'm sayin?
We ain't tell a story about all these girls we used to bang when we was young
Brothers see, they don't believe us
So ehm - I guess I'll start tellin...
A story when I was young
When I first got pussy
Check it out

[ VERSE 1 ]
It was in '77, well at least I think so
Way before the people knew me as K-S-o-l-o
We moved from Queens to Long Island and my moms had it made
But mom was workin two jobs, she said, "Son, I want me a maid"
We went to this agency that was on Broadway
So mom could fill out the papers and see about a maid
When we got there we seen a man who sat behind a desk
He said, "I'm sorry, miss, but ain't too many good maids left
But I'll show you some pictures of all the maids we got here"
I looked and seen this maid who looked like Pam Grier
I said, "Hey mom, let's get that maid, ooh, she looks like my teacher"
Mom said, "Okay" and asked the man, "Can we meet her?"
He pressed a button, said a name, she was there in a flash
Mom signed some papers, gave her money, and everything was done fast
On the way home I could look and see she looked young
And by the way she had me laughin, ooh, I knew she was fun
But somethin was wrong, I couldn't figure it out
Till one day me and the maid were alone in my house
I was in my room readin a book
She came inside my room naked and told me, "Kevin, take a look"
&gt;From her feet to her body, I stared at shock
As I stared at her breast and her hairy provoc'
She had a real bad body, I was put in a trance
But snapped out of that trance when she unzipped my pants
She wrapped her legs around me, she began to tease me
Whispered in my ear, "Do you think you can please me?"
I said, "Yes", I couldn't fess
And then the maid grabbed my young hand and put it on her grown chest
She started seducin me, right there on the floor
She said, "The better you get, you'll get more and more"
Juices started movin fast, and she started goin
"I'm comin, I'm comin", I said, "Stop, where are you goin?"
She paid me no mind, I guess she knew I was young
I guess she said "It's for kids", but I was havin my fun
As she went up and down, and side to side
To make me slippery and wet as I went inside
The maid moaned and groaned, moved my hips
Blew in my ear, in my face and went and tongue-licked my lips
I was only 11 and in the 6th grade
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

No one believed that I made love to the household maid
You know what I'm sayin, Red?
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

Yo, yo, yo
Pee, man, what's up
Redman don't believe me, man
Check the next verse out
Check out the next verse

No one believed that I made love to the maid...

[ VERSE 2 ]
It happened again when I came from the park
Mom was workin late and the house looked dark
There was a note at the door, 'Son, dinner's in the oven'
Steak and potatos with blueberry muffins
But before I could get any food in my jaws
I seen a bra and a woman's panties on the living room floor
Where could she be, cause this I'm sure, mom could never see
The maid was in the room, butt naked cleanin the room for me
She grabbed my comic book, put it on her behind
Opened it up and said, "Hey, read between the line"
I love to read about the Incredlible Hulk
But when the maid grabbed me, she invaded the incredible bulk
On the floor by the AFX track, sweat comin from the back
Moms workin, we don't when she'll come back, black
I''m only 11 and in the 6th grade
No one believed that I made love to the household maid

Break it down, Solo

Gettin busy for 1992, you know what I'm sayin?
Mad true stories
Nobody believe me, you know what I'm sayin?
Yo, PMD, man
Brothers be goin out, man, on the strenght, man
Lyin about butt, man
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, Redman, on the strenght...

Peace
