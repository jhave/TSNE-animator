[Buckshot]
Bounce, to this
You don't wanna miss this, get into this
This is that shit that make em all flip
They all wanna piece
Some keep a steady mind, some get geeked
Now what be the shit to make them niggaz think
when they ship come in, they ship won't sink?
Everybody you meet on your way up, you meet down
So if you burn a bridge, how you gonna cross town?
Think about it now, and cry later
A motherfuckin money maker so I die greater
And everytime I get them visions in my head, everything is red
Gettin high from the stimuli', very blurry eye dread
Said to be, Buck the B.D.B
When you smoke your sensimi' I hope you take out your seeds
and watch your back for them bitches who act shady
with another lady friend that try to serve you with gravy
Menage, I almost got caught, what could I say?
Fallin for the lust I almost got bust Friday
But safely so, got about a Most High
Eased out yo, into some next bullshit I'm like

[Q-Tip]
Bounce to this (3X)
All my hip-hop heads
Bounce to this (3X)
Mr. Buckshot..</pre>
