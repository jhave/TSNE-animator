[Verse]
Chrome on the monster leather intestines
With a top model and a contestines
I'ma Rottweiler yes I'ma rock 'n' roller
It's Weezy Fuckin' Baby yeah straight up out the stroller
I'm higher than the solar system of the twizzle
I'm like Macaulay Culkin I was rich when I was pissin'
On myself I'm ballin'
You niggaz haterholics
I'm jus' the recipe so you can save the garlic
I'm like a set of keys I'm 'bout to get it started
I smoke 'dem Beverly
Hills from California
'Dem bitches after me so I put that paddle on 'em
She rode my dick and said she shoulda put a saddle on 'em
I watch out for 'dem snakes listen for that rattle homie
And I ain't got a clique I got a cattle homie
Wud up five kickin' back jus' bein' boo
I'm talkin' foreign money like a European dude
Yeah I'm heavy man so you should reconsider
I hit you one time fuck up yo equilibrium
I got rhythm yeah I got soul ya
I travel all around the world like a postcard
My flow cold fuck around and get a cold sore
I got this bitch on lock like a closed door
Weezy's real 'dem other' niggaz folklore
I'm connected I got more hoods than a coat store
I'm successful I got more shit than you can hope for
And I got thru 'dat water like a boat ore
Young, Carter the name
Baby boy risin' like hot water and 'caine

[Bridge]
Whip it stretch it and flip it
Reup stretch it and flip it [x3]

[Verse 2]
Reup, we up in the club we up in the club
Money runnin' like water bitch get up in the tub
I'm up in the club she up in the club he up in the club
Now she can't leave so we fuck in the club
Am I lucky or what Playboy Rabbit
And I like big tongues like skateboard fashion
I got more gurls than the Playboy Mansion
I bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Sampras
And a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford
And a nigga smoke like there is no cancer
And I know this world is so cold and deceivin'
But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'
Yeah, and until that chosen evenin'
I'ma be screamin Apple and Eagle
Yeah that's rite Apple and Eagle
Hollygrove 17 I won't leave you
Nope, and this is just the preview
But I'm already workin on the sequel
Fuck wit' me wrong I'll fuck wit' yo home
Like a letter to the wife sayin' ya husband is gone
Like Muslim I'm calm
But like Muslim I'll bomb
And beat the track up like a hundred arms
I'm funky like underarms
The engineers recordin a thunderstorm
My hunger forms then ring the alarms
The Carter 2 was nice but the third times a charm

[Outro]
Weezy Fuckin'</pre>
