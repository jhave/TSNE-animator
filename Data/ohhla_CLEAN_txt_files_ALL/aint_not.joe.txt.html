Intro [Joe]
Hey wooh eh there's nobody like me
Na na no
Wooh 

Verse One [Tony Yayo]
Ma that's your man fiance trick ya baby daddy
Husband best friend or ya sugar daddy 
We could cruise in the navvy 
Or cruise in the Caddy 
Imma tounge lick you toes girl 
I know you like it nasty 
Creep til ya call dough you know my waist heavy
Picture me bein' stuck in the closet like R. Kelly 
That ain't likely I know that you like me 
Just keep me on the low you can still be his wifey comon!!!

Verse Two [Joe]
Hey mammy look like you arrested 
With his hands cuffin he be talkin louder
He ain't sayin nothin 
If thats how he do you 
If that's what your used to 
I'm tellin you that you need to move 
Party's over here you need to move 
I can make him dissapear you need to move 
Let's stop wasting time 
And let's get down to riding girl I promise you

[Chorus: Joe]
I know you got a man but he ain't nothin like me
he might put it down but he can't put it like me 
My hood in my wood in my paper man
you gonna like you gone like cause ain't nothin like me
I know you got a man but he ain't nothin like me
he might put it down but he can't put it like me 
My hood in my wood in my paper man
you gonna like you gone like cause ain't nothin like me 

Verse Three [Joe]
Hey honey you be on restriction 
With da short money
It's cloudy over there 
But here it's sooo sunny
If that's how he do you 
If that what your used to i'm tellin you 
That you need to move 
Party's over here you need to move 
I can make him dissapear you need to move 
Let's stop wasting time 
And let's get down to grinding girl I promise you come see!!!

[Chorus

Verse Four [Young Buck]
She said she like me 
But she hate I got these cubbish ways
I try to work a 9 to 5 but it doesn't pay
We met the other day 
Seeing you and hoolard hey!
Where you from what's your phone number where you stay
Come let me sit youin this Bently 
On these heated seats
Sit us some Crystal 
Let you ride and see the beach 
I know you probly got a man but give me a chance
I guarantee he can't do it baby like I can
Yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
