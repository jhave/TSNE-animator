[Drake]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm goin through her phone if she go to the bathroom
and her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me payin attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talkin strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple porn stars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggaz they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody want make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggaz thinkin about Christmas in August
Do anythin to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
and chef it like Mrs. Fields; they makin the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm workin overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team
Matchin Rollies for real, matchin Rovers for real
Places they say they've been we've actually goin for real
I'm really killin shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm goin trigger happy just to see my niggaz happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's livin in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation to pull all yo'
skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearin all of the jokes, I know that they tryin to push me
I know that showin emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggaz who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy I got my weight up
Roll this and boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggaz came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin spooky
Very very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

[Rick Ross]
Whoa~! You know I love this
Y.O.L.O., you only live once
I'm goin so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal

I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht I'm talkin Carnival cruise
And these niggaz talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flickin lookin like a fallin star
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin yay like Annie Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm runnin game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm gettin cake, nothin short of great</pre>
