[Intro]
Yeah
Back at you (back at you)
Harpoon baby(Harpoon baby)
9th collabo (9th collabo)
You know how we do
Yeah
Yeah
Uh huh
Come on

[Verse 1]
Slow it down love
I know you feinding like a crack addict
You want my body 'cause all the girls got to have it
Pooh the teddy bear type, chicks like to grab it
But I got to be safe, talking profolactics
Naw, you know I'm speaking on this mind game
Asking questions, steadily picking at your brain
Know your tendencies and why at times your mood change
You sing a little but you sweating me you got range
Can hold a conversation
She likes to give hugs
Sendin out thank you cards to her just because
In a special way, thats how I feel about us
Took some fakes for you love to be real about us
Some say the truth hurts and I agree with them
but if that nigga treat you right then you should be with him
'Cause it ain't all about sex with you
Baby I'm trying to get next to you but you don't hear me though

[Chorus]
I hope you listening
I'm still talking and I'm trying to get next to you
But you don't hear me ma
I'm steady writing and I hope you reading
I'm trying to get through to you so focus on it love
I hope you listening
I'm still talking and trying to get next to you but you don't hear me ma
I'm still writing and I hope you reading
I'm trying to get through to you so read between the lines

[Verse 2]
Some chicks know their role
Some like to ball hog
Jimmy post up, she everywhere you are dog
I mean that's good and all if she the main chick
And at the end of the night you gonna remain with
And built this thing with
Y'all got this certain vibe
She held it down for a nigga way before the ride
Who you loving?
Who you wanna be hugging?
Them other broads don't amount to nothing and you the real thing
It ain't nothing like it
Spending time with you is priceless
I swear I told you ain't nothting like it
And since we both low then we can both go sit back and relax and get so comfortable
You drink?
Well have a glass or two
Chardinaye (sp?) bought just for you
Cheers
'Cause it ain't all about sex with you
Baby I'm trying to get next to you
But you don't hear me though

[Chorus]
I hope you listening
I'm still talking and I'm trying to get next to you
But you don't hear me ma
I'm steady writing and I hope you reading
I'm trying to get through to you so focus on it love
I hope you listening
I'm still talking and trying to get next to you but you don't hear me ma
I'm still writing and I hope you reading
I'm trying to get through to you so read between the lines
