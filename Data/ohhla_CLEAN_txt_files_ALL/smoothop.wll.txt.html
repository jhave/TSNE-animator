[Paul Wall]
I'm a chick magnet, I'm a ladies man
I put a smile on your face any way that I can
I got the world in my hands, you got the world in your pants
My squad pimpin there, I approach and put you under my trance
My gameplan is exquisite, so when I pay you a visit
I'ma make you go ballistic from the second I get up in it
To tell the truth I bring great orgasmic pleasure
It seem like it last forever when you float like a feather
My wordplay is clever, I'll have you laughin and grinnin
I lay you on that linen, and make you feel like you swimmin
You callin me King Dingaling and girl I just might be
I know you never ever met a player quite like me, cause

[Chorus 2X: Paul Wall]
I'm a sweet talker, I'm a pipe layer
I'll sweat you out your weave I'm a back breaker
I'm a gentleman, I'm a mack player
I'm a dimepiece layer, smooth operator

[Paul Wall]
Baby cold kick off your shoes and relax your feet
My sweet talk is so unique, girl you in for a treat
I'll be the cream in your coffee, I'm your chocolate and toffee
And when I exercise my mackin I'll be killin you softly
I got a way with compliments, girl I'm sweeter than mints
It'll be common sense to let the love makin commence
I've had all persuasions, on so many occasions
When you spend a night with me it'll seem like a vacation
You gon' love it when you with me, and when I leave you'll miss me
I'ma whisper in yo' ear and get you really hot like Missy
I'll tell you freaky thangs that's gon' make you blush
And I'ma make your body tingle from the tip of my touch, cause

[Chorus]

[Paul Wall]
I'm a superfly cat when I'm in mack mode
Soon as I get deep up inside you I'ma make you explode
I'm a player by nature, I'm a mack by choice
And I'ma make your body moist from the sound of my voice
I got a hell of a resume for layin the pipe
I'll tell you what you wanna hear and I can do what you like
So come on let's spend the night, it won't cost you a penny
I'll put you in the mood right, with a lil' Hyp' and Henny
I strap up twice, when I be usin the rubber
Cause I don't wanna be in bed gettin burned like Usher
I got a nonchalant demeanor, girl I'm calm and cool
I'll have you feelin like you walkin on the moon, cause baby
