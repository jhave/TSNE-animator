[Xzibit]
Yeah, Stand Up
Ha?
What do you believe in?
Ha?
Yeah, Stand Up
Aha C'mon

[Alice Cooper]
Just a face in the crowd
Feelin' lost, down and out
(Can you hear me now)
Millions more just like you
Afraid to do what they wanna do
(Am I getting through)
Lots of losers hanging round
Only there to bring you down
Get you feet up off the ground
Get up. Get up. Get up

[Chorus]
If you don't stand for somethin'
You will fall for anythin'
If you don't stand for somethin'
You will fall for anythin'
Get up

[Xzibit]
Yeah Yeah

[Alice Cooper]
Don't you know that you're worth
As much as anyone on earth
(You`re a megastar)
Put your hands in the sky
Let your freaky colours fly
(Get 'em way up high)
You got style and you got game
So get it out don't be ashamed
([Xzibit] Yeah)
Let everybody know your name
([Xzibit] C'mon)
Get it on out now, what's you name

[Chorus]
If you don't stand for somethin'
You will fall for anythin'
If you don't stand for somethin'
([Xzibit] Stand Up)
You will fall for anythin'
Get up

[Xzibit]
Yeah Ah Yeah
Breathe with me
Yeah C'mon Breathe
You can stand for peace, You can stand for war
I stand in the square I never stood before
I take a stand for my son like Afeni Shakur
I take a stand like a four double six six four
Stand alone in my struggle, Can't make me stand down
Make 'em crash and burn, Mayday mayday may tell
Get up stand up get your damn hands off
If they not shackled to your feet in some handcuffs
We need solutions, not propaganda
Let the tape roll, make the whole world stand up
Hold your position, don't go backwards
X still grinding, the west's keeps shining
Don't look too long you might get blinded
Follow your heart, your head might just find it
I pray for the strength to handle what my city brings
Better stand for something (or) you're bound to fall for anything

[Chorus: Alice Cooper]
If you don't stand for somethin'
([Xzibit] stand up stand up)
You will fall for anythin'
Get Up!

If you don't stand for somethin'
You will fall for anythin'
Everybody's got a voice
Now's the time to make some noise
(Let me hear you now)
Get up!</pre>
