[Soulja Boy]
wuz goin on these niggaz out here wildin
They Don't want won't beef, better run to police
Better yet man you better keep quiet
iguana seats inside it, I'm flying on auto pilot
Deep in these streets, spittin crack on these beats
But the word on the street is keep quiet
Me and my nigga tyga, patron got us wildin
Stereophone cup, throwing money in my clubs, oh you mad becuz I'm stylin
Crush diamonds on my amuelet
Its lookin like a slush hoe
Niggaz meaning muggin, better keep that shit on hush mode
25 Kush blunts, I call dat shit a quarter
Took her to my crib and make her strip like fishburne daughter
I swag to hard too I do it like no other
runnin round talkin tellin keep that undercover

[Chorus]
Jewerly too loud man I need to be quiet
What's that on my wrist? I told that bitch to be quiet
Gone on patron man I swear it got me wildin'
If he know like I know tell that nigga be quiet

[Tyga Chorus]
Uhh.Jewelry to loud motherfucka its a siren
Big fuckin dogs you can hear my wolves hollerin'
On this patron man I got these bitches wildin'
If he know like I know tell that nigga be quiet

[Tyga]
Ugh. Well its that big woolly monster pull up
pull up on your bumper mothafucka pull your mother slum dog million, hold up
I'm so cold I think I froze up
Melt that money like its nothin. Ugh
Spend it like I print it bitches blow it by the hundreds
Young Money this aint new
You just got up on it
I'm Big Willy chillin nigga you just little homie
I just flew Paris Gordon Ramsey up in London he throw

Too many Twitter followers, many I'm poppin
Maybe its my big Why these hoes keep on watchin
I'm tatted out my mind literally I'm out my mind
I'm G'd up all the time. On some G Shit Be Quiet!

[Chorus]
Jewerly too loud man I need to be quiet
What's that on my wrist? I told that bitch to be quiet
Gone on patron man I swear it got me wildin'
If he know like I know tell that nigga be quiet

[Tyga Chorus]
Uhh.Jewelry to loud motherfucka its a siren
Big fuckin dogs you can hear my wolves hollerin'
On this patron man I got these bitches wildin'
If he know like I know tell that nigga be quiet</pre>
