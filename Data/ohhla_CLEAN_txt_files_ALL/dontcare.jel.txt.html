Yeah
Turn it up, yeah
Turn the beats up
It's gon' feed baby
Awwwwwww, it's alright
All that, we got it
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Feel good? Fantastic
Come up in the ghetto with the guns blast, kid
Carry heavy metal for these punk bastards
You ain't on my level, I'm a punk classic
Bitch, I'm a rebel, ain't no need to ask if
Ridin' with the devil till I'm in my casket
Stretch out your pussy just like elastic
Man, a cool hundred thou', my dick's just that thick
Wilin' in the party like "that's that shit"
We file up in the party like crash that shit
Rexdale, ???, crash that
Now every time I get a mic check, cash that shit
All these killas scrap, pack gats that's sick
Hit you in your head and make it snap back quick
Nigga betta move 'em as I crack that whip
I'm like ?back sunroof?
Nigga pass that spliff

[Chorus 1]
We gon' bump and grind these streets tonight
Till the daylight breaks the dawn
And I don't care about a mothafucka on the wall
Cuz tonight we box 'em all
And I don't care if your momma standin' at the door
Wit the strap yellin' "bitch come home"
Said I don't about a mothafuckin' thing tonight
We 'bout to do our fuckin' thing tonight

[Verse 2]
I said I'm comin' to the party in my black hat, kid
See me in the streets on some back crack shit
Niggas want beef, they can have that shit
We don't need to speak...that's it
The Rex roll deep so we don't have shit
I wonder how long you think you gon' last, kid
I box with the CN Tower, playin' last lick
Clap shots if I see a coward playin' that shit
Bang with the big boys, grown man shit
My slang make big noise, I flow grand shit
The ladies say we so rough and romantic
How many MC's you know can make a slow jam hit?
Shit, a nigga proper
Smokin' on weed, but they call it ???
Half cup of henny and a fifth of vodka
Comin' to the club in the helicopter

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
The ladies bouncin' and buckin'
And movin' and groovin'
And makin' it happen like it's supposed to
What ya gon' do?
When we start lockin' and poppin'
And shakin' and breakin'
Takin' it back to the old school
What ya gon' do?
We gonna drink a little liquor, yo
And spend a little dough
Puff a little weed smoke
And sip a lotta mo
Show 'em how we roll, I told 'em
Shake it for 'em
Shake shake, baby, shake it for 'em

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
