(Hurry, hurry, step right up

[ D-Loc ]
Wait, wait, cut this shit, man

[ Richie Rich ]
It's a Saturday night, my girl's actin real shitty
Due to the fact I just left Campbell City
Straight lace Zeniths and vogues all on point
On my way to the Town to get a doja joint
Pushed it to the 7 to get some dank
Hit the liquor store to cold get drank
Now I got my doja, sippin on Nitro
Peace playboy, I'm on my way to the side show
Down [Street Name] to the light
Let me warm it up, I ( ? ) tight
There's a Chevy on my side, windows straight tinted
I think he got hype when he saw me spin it
I'm up outta there, sideways to the next life
Vogues kinda smokin but Zeniths still tight
I'm at the side show, parlayin and playin
Music on hit, head straight swayin
To the sounds of the 415 and the Locster
Girlie on the corner on jock, so I approached her
Spoke real smooth and said, "Hey, what's happenin?"
She said, "Dubble-R, is that you rappin?"
I said, "Ah nah, baby, that ain't me
You listen to the sounds of the L-o-c
The same clique, the 415, we make paper
But back up, bitch, I can see you got the vapors"
A lazy, towed up, tore down hoe
She's lookin for some dick at the side show

You know what I'm sayin?
In Oakland, California, every Saturday night, brothers be ridin
Straight lace Zeniths, rag tops, buckets, high performance
We really don't be trippin, you know what I'm sayin?
But now it's like this

[ Richie Rich ]
Police came through, but now they're gone
In other words, the side show's on
Troy's in a Maxima straight up lit
Short's comin through in a Benz with a kit
Oakland's movin somethin, and that's real
Bruce from the Deuce comin through in a 'Ville
This is a side show, boy, we don't fake it
Police come through on a fluke and try to break it
Up like that with a riot hat
You're gonna need more than a billy club and a gat
To stop the side show, officer, just think
Maybe you should come and hit the spot with a tank
Cause the brothers from the O are gonna keep on ridin
Yo can hit a tight one, straight sidin
See, we ain't really trippin off jail or the tickets
A brother wants to post, make mail and kick it
Now listen, this is the code to the show
For the people out there who just don't know
If your shit is hella clean, then bring it
If it's high performance, then swing it
If it's a motorcycle, you better serve it
And if you get a ticket, you better deserve it
As long as you can say, "Man, I let em know"
Then peace, you did it at the side show

It's a everyday thing
Every Saturday night brothers be tearin up cars
Brothers be comin through swingin em
I don't know what's goin on, I'm juiced
I'm in the Town, I strikes through
I see bitches, corner to corner, block to block
You know, basically it's just (funky)

[ Richie Rich ]
Corner to corner, block to block
Flock Zeuses and EV's that knock
Gold-diggin bitches in the City of O
Lookin for a nigga with a cash flow
That's the type of shit that gets em off
Material shit, at the side show, boss
Brothers get started, and man, don't quit
Kiki's on the engine about to tear up shit
It's about 2 o'clock and the show's still goin
Bitches all at the gas station hoein
A nigga like me never ever spends cash on hoes
Nah, I need a new set of vogues
Candy paint will make a bitch peep
But she'll never get a muthafuckin dime out of me
Peace to everybody in the O that I know
Dubble-R get with you at the side show

Believe that
Cause it's real

This one goes out to my DJ Daryl-Ski
My homeboy L-o-c
And of course the Jigga, the Jed</pre>
