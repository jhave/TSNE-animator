[Intro] [Black Milk]
Yeah, huh. Caltroit shit. Listen up. I'm sayin'. 

[Verse One] [Black Milk]
Allow me to start off raw cousin
Spit raw like fuckin' broads with no rubber
Fuck 16 bar rap with no structure
I'm not radio friendly, nope
I'm not dumbing 
Down my lines for no one cause it's no fun
If I'm not spittin' this ugly
Shit
From L.A. to the Mo' cousin
Got mo' money 
Go to the hood, shoot a video that's low budget
Like
Ha, fuck it
It's all year awe yeah 
Y'all speak on Bishop and Black 
Naw, it's not fair
Won't stop till these wack niggas all dead
At your funeral with your moms and the pall bearers
Like
Yeah, yeah
R.I.P.
Me against these garbage niggas is all out beef
I got it teamed what? 
Teamed up, linked up 
With the west team huh
Dirty D.C. never clean cut
Unless we all minked up, synced up
Speed up in a dark green truck
Windows all steamed up
Huh, I show you who the best cuz
Feels hot
Like catchin' bullets to your chest like a vest would

[Chorus] [Bishop Lamont]
Go on and get it hot but we get it hotter
Black Milk, B. Lamont
Chain, nobody stomp us
He cold on them beats
We fire in the booth
Multi's fuckin' rappers up
It's the inconvenient truth
Y'all beats don't knock
All your sounds sound the same
That +Chicken Noodle+ shit helped fuck up the game
These videos is lame
Rap sucks, what's the use
Hip hop's almost dead
It's the inconvenient truth

[Verse Two] [Bishop Lamont]
Immortalize my image
Recorded lines pitted
My life experience times through assorted rhymes that did it
Being me, no lyin', tryin' to be like rappers on TV
Bishop's Bishop, I'm fine with bein' me
Co-signed by D.R.E.
Another branch off the family tree
We stand tall while the rest of y'all fallin' off
Falling down
Endangered rain forest 'em
Clear the shit
Bulldozers and flame throwers
You garden variety snake
We King Cobras
Spit venom, impair your vision
Break down your nervous system
Send your soul liftin'
Backpack Genghis Khan, gallop from a distance
Crack skulls, clavicles, right wing radicals
A-Team, tattered clothes
Red beams, added those
Look like Knight Rider when I gotta spray at foes
Look like a money shot when I gotta spray at hoes

[Chorus] [Bishop Lamont]

Go on and get it hot but we get it hotter
Black Milk, B. Lamont
Chain, nobody stomp us
He cold on them beats
We fire in the booth
Multi's fuckin' rappers up
It's the inconvenient truth
Y'all beats don't knock
All your sounds sound the same
That +Chicken Noodle+ shit helped fuck up the game
These videos is lame
Rap sucks, what's the use
Hip hop's almost dead
It's the inconvenient truth

[Black Milk]
The plot thickens
The clocks tickin'
Niggas feel this style
Then try to steal this style like shopliftin' 
Whoa
I'm not with it 
No
He is nice with it
Got the God flow like Jesus Christ spit it
Church
Lyrical birth sound like a biblical verse
Make a nigga soul search
Tryin' to crucify me won't work 
And if it did
In three days I'd resurrect back to the Earth
Yeah

[Bishop Lamont]
With penmanship and marksmanship 
We some riders
Kill rappers and they ghostwriters 
With positron gliders
You internet dudes got shit confused
Poppin' shit online
Hidin' behind colorful names and chat rooms
Chat rooms turn to tombs
Tampering with goons
Goons use tools, mutilate fools
Entrails ooze
Some drip drops puddle
The blood pools
Try me, get put on I.V.s
The real you tube/youtube

[Chorus] [Bishop Lamont]
Go on and get it hot but we get it hotter
Black Milk, B. Lamont
Chain, nobody stomp us
He cold on them beats
We fire in the booth
Multi's fuckin' rappers up
It's the inconvenient truth
Y'all beats don't knock
All your sounds sound the same
That +Chicken Noodle+ shit helped fuck up the game
These videos is lame
Rap sucks, what's the use
Hip hop's almost dead
It's the inconvenient truth</pre>
