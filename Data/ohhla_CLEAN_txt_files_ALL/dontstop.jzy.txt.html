[Shawty Redd]
Lady's and gentlemen
Homies and Homettes
I would like to introduce you to a young man we all grown to love
and that motivates the thugs
He just put a little CD out right now
If you a real Nigga you'll ride to it
Yo Young you ready? I'm about to put you on blast

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
So you know it don't stop, so you know it don't quit
Better get your money cause these hoes ain't shit
Gotta run me at the mall, yea you know how it get
Fuck around spend ya lease on the whole outfit
Might see me out cause you know I like to party
Self made Nigga I don't want nobody
See my name Young Jizzle, I don't want nobody
Got something in my safe, I ain't showing nobody
Sucka's still hating but you know I don't care
Real Nigga with me put your hands in the air
Better show respect when your fucking with a player
Now you riding around the city like your fucking with the mayor

[Chorus: x3]
So you know it don't stop {You know it don't stop}
So you know it don't quit {You know it don't quit}

If the music keeps you rocking, and the bottles keep on popping
girl don't worry bout the time, girl you fine
We got champagne on the rocks and all my ladies looking at you
know the party just won't stop til we say {Oh, Oh, Oh}

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
She wants to buy new shoes and a new bag
She can call her home girls up, straight brag
And If you got it like that then you go girl
Keep doing what your doing shit it's your world
Not me, you know I'm on to the next girl
You know how people balled up like an S-Curl
Put some miles on that thing like an S-Type
When I'm going off the goose lay the best pipe
Had the Lexus back then baby white pearl
All that yea thanks to that white girl
Said white pearl, shit I meant pearl white
All you nigga talking slick know it's on sight
Meanwhile see Jizzle off the shed trails
With a bad red ball bitch like Chanel
Got so many gotta name it by the bag whole
Bet you one thing about it, ? bad dough

[Chorus]</pre>
