Kill'em all, kill'em all, kill'em all
Dey die, dey die, dey die, dey die
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bone gone
They wanna see the Bones long gone

Murda, bloody murda
(It's ya nigga) It's ya nigga Leatherface
So murda's on until the break of dawn 
They yellin' and screamin'
It's Krayzie, that's my name
That's my name, that's my name
Makin' mothafuckas feel the pain
Time to die, caught up with Mr. Sawed-off Leatherface
What a hell of a day
Is he real? Is he real?
Nigga, tell me, is he real?
Could ya pull it, then spray?
This Mo Thug organization
We causin' much destruction, destruction, destruction
Listen to the sound of me 12 gauge eruption, eruption, eruption
(Gunshot)

[First Krayzie]
Shit, nigga, I know I'm tired of these
Ho-ass niggas puttin our name in
Their mothafuckin mouth, nigga
Y'all mothafuckas don't know us nigga
What the fuck?
I mean, where tha fuck do you know me from, nigga?
You know this mothafuckin' Bone Thugs, nigga
Straight from Cleveland, nigga
Ain't sayin nothin' about you ho-ass niggas
You mothafuckas runnin' around here
Puttin our name on your mothafuckin' records
Nigga, for fame, nigga
We ain't gonna say nothin' to you bitch ass
We just gonna see you mothafuckas on tha streets
And it's on
Y'all mothafuckas can't playa hate
And dance to tha mothafuckin' beat, nigga
What the fuck thought?
Ain't no mothafuckin shakin' hands, nigga
When we see you it's on
Ain't no mothafucka gettin me...

[Second Krayzie]
I can't stand this shit
While niggas in punk-ass cities you playa hatin
Nigga can only put the mothafuckin' city on
Ya know what I'm sayin?
'Cause Cleveland on tha mothafuckin map
Tha niggas still runnin their mouths
? never playa hatin' niggas, you know what I'm sayin?
Cuz we can, you know what I'm sayin?
It was all about Cleveland, you know what I'm sayin?
It was all about mothafuckin Cleveland
You know what I'm sayin?
Hey, nigga, I feel like this
You know what I'm sayin?
Fuck it, nigga, it's all about them Bone thug-ass niggas
You know what I'm sayin?
Fuck, y'all...

[Third Krayzie]
Muthafuck the police, always
No muthafuckin' thugs, ya know what I'm sayin'
Fuck the muthafuckin' police
Nigga, comin' straight from Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
No regards for the muthafuckin' law at all
Nigga, eternal warfare

Hey, it's alright
It's alright
Tell me do you want to come and play with me? 
Do you want to play, (play, play)?
Roll (roll) with the gun in me hand (hand)
And they can't understand that
We ran with the murda mo, murda mo, murda mo
Rippin' them guts and drippin' that blood (blodd, blood) 

Fin to get 'em with the pump and peel ya
Buck'em up until ya
ya body's so badly damaged that you're not familiar
Who killed ya?
That nigga with the leather face (Who?)
they will never know, 'cause he won't show
Leatherface is identified
See the murda all in his eyes

You can't hide
This murder is the world
(There's no escapin' murder. There's no escapin' death)
No, no, no, you can't hide. This murder is the world
(There's no escapin' murder. There's no escapin' death)

You mercy screams are not needed
Too late when you proceed to bleed blood, yeah
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, kill'em all
Artillery, that's what ya got to have to fuck with me
Murder mo, come come, dey done, meet redrum

It's all right
If you want to come and play with me  
And when you meet the sawed-off
Just say, "Mr."  Nigga, when you meet the sawed-off
Just say, "Mr. Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface" 
Nigga, "Leatherface, Leatherface, Leatherface"
Die, die, die...</pre>
