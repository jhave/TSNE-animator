[Frank Ocean]
Said he never takes her nowhere
And she's always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood
Don't you move cause I'm comin, girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you, don't you move

[Chorus]
Girl you know that's all you needed to say - you got it, you got it
Let me grab a jacket and I'm on the way - you got it, you got it
Ohh you want more, you want more
Is that enough, is that enough?
Say the word and I'm on the way
You got it, you got it all
You know the words, you know the number
You got 'em, so quit playin
A couple words, I'm comin runnin
You got 'em, so just say 'em

[Frank Ocean]
Yeah I'ma knock twice when I get there, ohh
Then we can make love in one of those rooms oh no no no
Listen I wanna show you the ocean ohh
And we can make love under the moon
Don't you move cause I'm comin, girl tell him don't bother
Cause baby I'm rushin to you, don't you move

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Girl I'm, very proud to say that I got you
Like a guy need you oooh yeah
Show you off like a brand new set of wheels
See you lights baby, tell me how it feels
I said I got ya, ohhh yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know the words, you know the number
You got 'em, so quit playin
A couple words, I'm comin runnin
You got 'em, I'm just sayin</pre>
