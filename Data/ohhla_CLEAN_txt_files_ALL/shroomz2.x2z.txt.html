[Everlast]
Oh this tastes like shit
Oh, that's awful

[Xzibit]
Whitey Ford takes the flows, y'all
See I'm about to have the time of my life, Bacardi on ice
Live from Los Angeles, it's Saturday night
While others staty tight we're looking for some parties to crash
I never bounce, rock and splash without my Alkaholik stash
I scooped the homie Tash, introduce me to Everlast
He know where the bitches move fast so we can have a blast

[Everlast] (Xzibit)
I think you know my man Sadat from the Nubian crew
And I can see you're rolling tight with the Likwit too, yeah
I make room for every crew whose beats be booming
I know you puffing some weed but are you down with some shrooming
(Shrooming, hell nah, that's what the white boys be doing)
I got room in the jeep, we can mash a few down
Eat a few bags of shit and we could mash up a town
See I know this spot where them things will be hot
We guarantee at least two chickens up in every pot
So whatcha want (whatcha got), ay yo, eat some of these
And thrust us all up, you'll be cool like a breeze

[Xzibit] (Everlast)
Brought me back some orange juice, two vitamin C's
And the look on my face look like a painful disease
They tasted awful but by that time I had a jawful
(Just chill, ten minutes and it's all downhill)
Downhill, how does it feel, how long does it take to work
Am I gonna fry my disk, does it make my stomach hurt
Captain Kirk pulled into the night club parking lot
The line was aroudn the block, hurry up and find a spot
Straight to the bar drinking hennessey and orange juice
I gotta be trippin', that bitch just melted through the floor

[Everlast] (Xzibit)
Yo, either I'm high or I think that I'm dreaming
Don't take this shot wrong, but X you look like a demon (what)
And I might start scremaing, I think I might puke (yeah)
Cause I just heard a voice saying use the voice Luke, what the fuck

[Xzibit]
Brothers and sisters walking by that I recognize
Feeling hypnotized, Peoples Dilated changing sides
To my surprise we didn't even have to scrap tonight
Higher than kites, staring at lights, this a other type of high

[Everlast]
My mouth was dry, I forgot how to breathe
And I just saw some shit that you wouldn't believe
With this bomb, baby palm, ain't no tricks up my sleeve
Let me slide up in this mix, get some chicks and we'll leave

[Xzibit]
We be stumblin' straight from the bar, straight to the car
Feeling like my feet getting stuck to the street
Went to my house smokin' trees, playing video games
Everlast, a couple of homies, a couple of days

[Everlast]
It was me, X and Tash, we was smokin' a J
With this girl named Michelle, and her friend Chantay
Pumpin' Straight Outta Compton by N-W-A
Am I talking out loud or just thinkin' this way

[Xzibit]
Damn I can't find my keys, chickens ready to leave
They're ready to bounce, yo I think we smoked the whole ounce
I'm roaming the house, finding my words hard to pronounce
Talking to myself, see Mariah Gage on the shelf
For everything stays deep, I shoulda known all the cases
Twenty-five lightnings is what Xzibit is facin'
If somebody catch a slug at my house
That's the last time I ever put some stupid ass drugs in my mouth
Pulled a fifty, unloaded the gage, at least I thought so
Except I kept one in the chamber for Vinnie ?
That's what I forgot, that's what I lost
When I pointed the barrel at the floor and the gauge went off
