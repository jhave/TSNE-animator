Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Wonderful doom
Beautiful doom

Everybody dies, gargoyle skies
Main attraction is your own treachery and lies
Carnival arise, facing your demise
Cuz the acid rain came with a Boom! Pow! Bang!
And the purpose of the circus is definitely clear
Get you in the mirror cuz soon you'll be here
Sweat with the boom, don't forget to assume
Time catches up with some beautiful doom

Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
Beautiful doom
Wonderful doom
Beautiful doom

Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything
Time catches all of us
Surpassing everything

Tents pop up cuz the show's in town
And everybody knows what goes around
You're a three ring act, let's hope it suits ya
Your past and your present will determine ya future
No White Witch can save ya, no potion
And six times deeper than the Indian Ocean
Life goes by with a Bang! Pow! Boom!
And then LOOK OUT! Here come the beautiful doom

Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter

Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter
Tear your ticket, then you enter

Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom

Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado
The throat chokers, cut-throat jokers
Juggalotus and you know this
Most hated band on the planet
So fresh they can't stand it
Dark Carnival minions
The Duke of the Wicked
And the Southwest-side Stranglord himself
Big Violent J, and Sugar Shaggy2Dope
Wicked-wicky-wocked-wicky-wicked Clowns, bitch!
Boom!
A beautiful doom
Boom!
A beautiful doom
Boom!
A beautiful doom
Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!
A beautiful doom
Bang! Pow! Boom!</pre>
