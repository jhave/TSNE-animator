[Violent J]
"In every neighborhood, you got your house that's supposedly haunted
Well in our neighborhood, there's the hell house
And right now nobody can believe it
but there's a sign out front of hell house that says, "For Sale""

[Monoxide Child]
They tell me you can see the chalk lines
In the middle of the living room
A sure sign that somebody must've died there
I think they said it was a bride and a groom
And I guess they both died tryin' to run for the stairs
I don't care, shoot me a price
I wanna move in quick
I wanna sleep with the bodies while the blood still drips
Call me crazy but it's just what I want
I really hope that shit happened and it's not just a fraud

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Into the kitchen
This kitchen floors full of cracked tiles and rat traps
When the sink goes on the drips will make your head crack
And those cupboard doors smackin' open and closed
A preist came to do a blessin' but he got hosed
Pedophile
And that's just the beginning
Cause other shelves are stacked with plates
And they spinnin' on them
And I heard the drawers open and knives get to flinging
The folks that stayed here got seventeen in them

[Chorus]
Did you hear it?
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
With the spirits
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
Did you hear it
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
With the spirits
Did you hear the hell house for sale

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Into the bedroom
They say they found his wife's body mangled on the bed
With six inch wounds to the back of her head
Her kids were there too both hanging in the closet
With one extension cord and their blood still on it
Thinking about the blood it was the most they ever saw
On their clothes, and on the floor, and on their sheets, and on the walls
No one could be prepared for the last fatal finding
Underneath the bed more mutilated grindings

[Anybody Killa]
In the house there's a stairway leading to the attic
People say that there's a room where this witch did magic
On the 12th day of every month you could hear a yell
Like the curse on the neighborhood was sending her to Hell
I was so interested I had to know more
Stole a ladder and I climbed through a window on the second floor
Straight to the attic cold chills with no surprise
A little girl named Amy and a witch giving evil eyes

[Chorus]
Did you hear it?
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
With the spirits
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
Did you hear it
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
With the spirits
Did you hear the hell house for sale

[Jamie Madrox]
They say that in the basement's where it all went down
They cemented the walls and repainted the ground
To hide the blood stains and pentograms that were there before
They put a chain and padlock on the cellar door
This is hell house ain't no chains or paint stopping the shit that lurk
And lives inside the dirt
And in the cracks of the framework
Don't say it's a tall tale
That's why they call it hell house
And it's always for sale

[Violent J]
I here the backyard's a cemetary of bodies
And if it rains hard enough you see the top of their noggins
They got trees that they hung bodies from
It's frightening
Some nights I hear a gurgle, a gasp, and ropes tightening
There's always vultures circling in the sky
And the sun never shines, house covered in vines
And the smell coming outta that yard would choke a pig
I skateboard back and forth smoking a dew

[Chorus]
Did you hear it?
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
With the spirits
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
Did you hear it
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
How much they want?
With the spirits
Did you hear the hell house for sale

Did you hear it?
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
With the spirits
Hell house for sale
Did you hear the hell house for sale
Did you hear it

I just wonder how much you want for that motherfucker
man cause that house is the shit</pre>
