[Woman]
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine

[Mac Dre]
I went bad on a bitch but I don't love her
She want an apology but I ain't Rueben Studdard
I'm buttered so she jock me style
She buttered but she not me style
She don't got it and she ain't trying to have it
Man I'm lavish and got expensive habits
If I stab it what can she offer
Naw sir dreezy ain't gon toss her
And she thick to but I dont want her yokes
I want all her federal reserve notes
I'm better with no hoes over a broke one
I'll take the ugliest bitch in Oakland
And come through yokin Chucky Cheesed up
You broke bitches got me fucked up
I'm a rich nigga I got lawyers
You broke I cant do nothin but ignore ya

[Chorus 2x]
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine

[Mac Dre]
This crazy motherfucker wanna be my chick
Always trying to fuck and suck my dick
I won't happen you ain't got no mail
You ain't got a snowballs chance in hell
I'm from Vallejo where most niggaz is pimps
We eat butterfly tiger prawns not scrimps
On the other side of the fence is what's crackin'
Can you detect some slackin' in my mackin?
You can't try it unless you buy it
Broke bitch got my dick on a diet
Can't fuck on her and no I don't want her
This is O.J. Simpson pimping not homer

[Chorus 2x]
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine

[Mac Dre]
She trying to makeme hers
But I can't be hers
Unless I'm goosing her for chips and I'm taking hers
Trying to live so fat I gotta watch calories
It's all about a salary and that's reality
I'm a book you shouldn'y judge by its cover hoe
I been getting doe since Young Black Brother hoe
I'm a brother that can make things happen
Jacking acting macking rapping
Let's get it crackin get the slacking out
Everyday I blow a half an ounce
I like to smash and bounce in all new whips
What can we do if you ain't got a few chips?
Take a few sips of this game I poured
It's money in these streets and it can't be ignored
It's money in these streets and it can't be ignored

[Chorus 2x]
Something about what you've done to me baby I wanna make you mine
You really bring out the best in me baby can I make you mine</pre>
