CHORUS (x1)
Sick dogs collide with your stride 
Break them off a left and then right 
Fight all over these streets 
'Till I meet defeat I'm with these 
Blocks that rock so many 
Wanted by most ain't touched by any foes 
Inside circles 
Attacking like packs of real sick dogs 
Running wild, crazy 
Sick in the head get out of hand daily 
Sick dogs got one screw missing 
Are you a pelón psyclone on a mission? 
Sick dogs we run deep creep come up while you sleep 
The strong pray on the weak drop your heat 
And protect yourself defend yourself stop the shoot up 
Tatted down saying fuck the jura you're a sick dog 
  
Running right through your city of sin 
Look alive as we all fall in 
Some might fall when the circle spins 
And who knows when the show will end 
Look at you throw against somebody 
Run around and around fighting 
Hand to hand combat is starting 
And you with no combat skills are falling 
For real you know we get down 
In sick-ass world downtown killing fields 
Learn soldier grills 
Fuck'em all up on the street real quick but don't kill 
Ill mutha-fuckas will make you feel that fear 
Hold still 
Some might stand and some might fall 
What kind of man are you? We're sick dogs 
  
CHORUS (x1) 
  
Dance of the dead results in code red 
Fatal blows to your whole head 
City troops are sent and violently 
Answer calls but they're all scared 
Beware of the cold hard stare 
Of a sick-ass man who ain't all there 
I dare the dogs of law 
To come inside my world they all fall 
I lead the rest of the pack 
And send them on commands of attack 
Once you run there's no way back 
And we can't let you go fuck that 
Don't spare the lives of enemies 
On these war frontlines they all die 
War pigs and us don't mix 
Watch'em all drop in the pit 
  
CHORUS(x1)
