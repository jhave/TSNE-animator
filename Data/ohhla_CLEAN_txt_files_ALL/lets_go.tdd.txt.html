[Hook: Lil Jon]
Let's Gooooo! (Let's gooooo!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)

Let's gooooo (Let's gooooo!)
If you want it you can get it let me know (let me know)
I'm bout to fuck a nigga up
Let's gooooo (Let's gooooo!)

[Verse 1: Trick Daddy]
If you want some, come get some
Cause where I'm from we tote big guns
And everybody know somebody that
Know somebody that know somethin' bout it
And I want answers now
Who, what, where, when and why
See, a lot of dudes like to act a fool
And all get all loud but that ain't my style
Now, he who he gonna get and what he gonna do
Run up on me if he want to
Out there impressin' his homies
But he stood up in front of his momma
I mop up the flo' with him
And I kick in the door and let the fo-fo get him
I got fools that'll go get him
This for him, his crew and the dudes that run with him

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twista]
Gotta spit it for the murderers and the killers and the thugsters
That be fuckin' up the ballers and the dealers and the hustlers
Got me comin' at you bogus in the V.I.
While they bumpin' Lil Jon, I'ma brush ya
It's the psycho nigga Twista from Chicago
Rollin' with the Miami nigga, that'll crush ya
We already been lookin' for drama
If a nigga try to get into with us then we gotta get him
Feelin' fury from my tough shit that cant never be true and no penicillin
I'm telling you Trick I'm fit to steal him
Got me swingin' Crissy and Hennessey bottles in the club
In the club with my thug homies goin' for ya scrilla
Don't get it twisted with that "Overnight Celebrity"
You better be scared Of me, in my city I'm a killer

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trick Daddy]
I ain't that rappin' type arright
And I that actin' type arright
That soft ain't in my script
I'm a playa, you, you just a square
See, once that Hennessy into me
The whole industry is my enemy (My enemy)
If you ain't no kin to me or friend to me
Bitch, don't pretend to be
Yeah, I'm strictly for the thugs
I'm part of the streets and straight out the hood
Got moments ghetto (Ghetto)
And I don't even needs the gats for you weasly cats
I'm straight out the county of Dade
3-0-5, nigga M-I-A
Never gone south of the border
America's most wanted, you gon' get slaughtered

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Outro: Trick Daddy]

The SK go fire, fire, fire, fire </pre>
