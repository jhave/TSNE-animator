[Chorus]
I want skin for my bed, spread
I swear the sky just bled, red
I buy, twitch my neck, bread
I'll take them to my bed, dead

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
I might've lost my mind, how did I get this far
I thought about how I, kill you for laughin' at my business card
Feels like I been discarded, And I really don't get this part
Everyone is high and mighty, until they get disarmed
I'm livin' in this darkness, I got a twisted heart
I got a lethal mind state, you got a vicious bark
And there is no catharsis, no remedy to cure my ill
I know my soul is tarnished, they'll never know how to serve that feel
Black blood on the white walls, do a design in the droplets
Psycho what you might call, but my mind is spotless
Do you like Phil Collins, have you ever heard this album
Even if you know how the song ends, you will never know that I'm out of
My mind I'm above the law and I caused it all this mayhem
Whatever you say when speak is, childish crawl in the playpen
Everything falls into place and, black gloves and a tight grip
Sittin' on a chest of my victim, if you breathe I'ma squeeze 'til ya lifeless

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Godemis]
I might've gone AWOL, maybe I blurred the line
Clock ready and alarm set, I know it's murder time
I gotta find my mind, even if only a piece
I'm better off behind, down here where we know no peace
And the clouds don't move when the wind blow, put a seed in the soil but it didn't grow
They say I gotta odd sense of humor, killer clown sittin' still by the window
Tough links in a crimson cape, sat there with my lipstick smudged
I got a glitch on my headpiece, somebody come and fix this bug
Gotta protect the king, follow a black shogun
Cover the neck in bling, swallow a black hole sun
Lookin' down at my shitlist, wonderin' how did it get so long
I'd rather be the one pissed off, than to ever be the one pissed on
Amen I'm an animal inside, feedin' on everything in the open
I've been caught with a loaded weapon, red-handed the barrel still smokin'
And I'm hopin', that they waitin' for me to break a leg I'll be takin' the cast off
Tryin' to wash away all my sins, in the shower with a handful of bath salts

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Smellin' like Hugh Parsons, to get a victim when it darkens
Then I'm hit them with a jargon, fuck her with no rubber
Then burn a bitch I'm an arson
Then have a lot of drinks 'til I'm barfin'
When I went to do the verse for the martian
He told me to put the people up on the milk carton
Keep a knife sharpened then he laughed like Cartman
I got stigmata markings, pardon when the beast get the bar end
I put the, I put the evil in my art when the angel let go of me
And took what the demon bargained
I'm gonna make a change but I'm Harkin
If you cannot tell me when the sex startin'
I got the kind of heart like spartan and I'm enemy scarfin' then I watch Johnny Carson
If you think I'm harsh then, Strangeland not the place to be parkin'
I guess this is the part when, I tell them all that I'm part hen and part sin
Winning about Noah's ark getting carp and the book is so colorful gotta listen to Darwin
Because you like a perfect margin, and that makes my dick harden
So I'm comin' over with the sparklin' (wine)
Get to itchin' when it's carvin' (time)
Ain't no matter what the gods in (line)
Ain't nobody's 'bout to stoppin' (N9ne)
I'm so twisted I think I created the water our women and our men
Thinkin' their gonna take it for a swim, so now I got to throw the sharks in</pre>
