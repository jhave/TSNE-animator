[Intro: Funkmaster Flex]
CAM!!! Lil Wayne!!!

[Lil Wayne]
Flea I got you! Cut the music up man!

[Cam'Ron] (Funkmaster Flex):
I had to tell her I don't care (FUNK FLEX!!!)
Can't lie y'all she got pears-p-pears
I don't care I told her suck my dick
Then I had to ask her this!!!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Hey bitch! Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
You ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Dipset!

[Verse One: Cam'Ron]
I be with some Asian girls and we lost in Japan
I tell 'em konichiwa they say of course you the man
I tell 'em I hear you but that ain't important to Cam
I got my bitch choo choo choo poppin right off the grand
She be sellin hair, I sell drugs we both down for the same hustle
And we speak the same language, yeah, ounces and bundles, kilos too
Either way, keys of yay, TV shows with Lisa Ray 
Then back to the block, do I need to say
Boy I'm on that E and J
Hey you get no chicks, that's no mystery
The last girl you been in, Statue Of Liberty
And I fouls with this, you can have my ass to kiss
But when I seen your baby mama I had to ask her this

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
You ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Dipset!

[Verse Two: Cam'Ron] (Lil Wayne)
Uh! I clean up well, loafers down to moccasins
But back up off me baby girl, I need some oxygen
Ieah, I know I know, I'm Mr. Get It Poppinton
But every time I see you comin I'm like not again
Chill girl, chill girl, I'm done, I ain't got no more to give
You can't cross the line, 'cause I let you cross the bridge
It's blood banks, it's weed spots
You can make me a hundred a hour, suckin cocks
I don't care if your mother's sick, her rent's due
You got three dollars, good bitch, spend soon
(Ever made love to a diplomat?! Ever made love to a diplomat?!)
I'm a chiropract, I'll break your back
Then tell your man he can have you back like

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
You ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Ever made love to a diplomat?!
Bitch you ever made love to a diplomat?!
Dipset!
