With a note around his throat and you know what it say (It's Rasaq Boy)
Ohh! you want some..you's a hoe Dike Jones
You's a hoe Dike Jones, you's a hoe
From the 4 and I don't give a shit
Color Changin' Click in this bitch represent who you with

[Verse - Rasaq]
I'm on 4's, suicide doors
Searchin' through the city for this hoe Dike Jones (where they at?)
Take a shot of drank, just to get me in the zone (in the zone)
I know you see me comin' better strap up ya thong (strap up ya thong)
I heard you bumpin' gums, so you better get gone
Don't let this pistol handle come on top of yo dome (yo dome)
Ridin' 2 tone, grippin' styrofoam
It's the boy Rasaq puttin' it down for Akers Home (wussup baby)
Niggaz know ya fraud, don't make me pull ya card
Tryna play it hard, but I caught ya off guard
They say we fell off, what they didn't tell yall
To get a meal all I need to do was make a cell call
They say we fell off, what they didn't tell yall
To get a meal all I need to do was make a cell call

[Chorus - Rasaq]
I'ma drag em' in the river, drop his body in the bay
With a note around his throat and you know what it say
Ohh! you want some..you's a hoe Dike Jones
You's a hoe Dike Jones, you's a hoe
From the 4 and I don't give a shit
Color Changin' Click in this bitch represent who you with
