[Intro: Shyheim (girl)]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Shyheim
Uh-huh, Bottom Up, yeah (Bottom Up)

[Chorus 2X: Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut, strip something slut
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)

[Hook 3X: Shyheim]
It's Bottom Up and we wanna fuck
And if you feeling like us, say "strip something slut"

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
Can you slide down a pole quicker than a fireman?
And, clap ya ass like ya fucking hands?
Then, I'll take my money out my rubber bands
And, if it's really good, I'll take another dance
To watch her...

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus 2X]

[Shyheim]
A.C., D.C., N.C., S.C.
I've seen more chicken strips than K.F.C.
N.Y., N.J., L.A., V.A.
P.A., A.T.L., won't ya...

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X]

[Shyheim]
Big girls tried to squash me
But I think with my dick, so baby, come and brainwash me

[Chorus]

[Shyheim]
Tick, tock, tock, tick
Look at these hoes all over my dick
Drip, drop, drop, drip
Hoes be talking shit but steadily gobbling dick

[Chorus 2X]

[Girl]
Pull ya money out, trick (3X)

[Shyheim (girl)]
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick
Pull ya money out, trick)

Pull ya money out, trick)

Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)
Strip something slut (pull ya money out, trick)
