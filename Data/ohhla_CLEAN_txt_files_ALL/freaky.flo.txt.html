[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Ass shakin at a quarter to two
And I'm feelin you're ready to, freak me, freak me
Bodies caught an applause

Light the candles up, freaky
You inspire me with ecstasy
Got me feelin so freaky deaky

[Flo Rida] + (Trey Songz)
Legs up on my shoulders if you want I'll bend you over
Climb on top of me it's over let you (ride me, ride me)
