[Verse 1]
Who's house? Hov no doubt
'Bout the only rapper still gettin money in the drought
I moves out, in the global, I'm a mogul
Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile
Fuck talking bout the recession the shit's depressin
I rock with Obama but I'm not a politician
And I , chill with the thugs and the gangsters too
I ain't a blood but I'm warrin with the boys in blue
Crooked officer!!! crooked officer!!!
Why you wanna see me in a coffin sir?!
Is it against the law the way I'm flossin sir?!
Benzes, Rolls Royces and Porches, UGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Haters like Hov why you still talkin money shit? 
Cause I like money BITCH!!!!

[Verse 2]
That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fuckin rock star
{*imitating "Wonderwall"*} Today, is gonna be the day
That I'm gonna throw it back to yoooooou
I'm livin life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, pat'na
Comin down in Mercedes, peelin off on the boppers
Worldwide show, I'm comin down in a chopper
Hundred eighty-thou screamin "Hov!" with the Roc up
It's too easy!!! I got ladies on shoulders showin me they chi-chis
I met honey at the show last year
And now I'm actin brand new like a +world premier+
Yeah, I know life ain't fair
But chill, baby girl - MY GIRL IS HERRRE!
I got models in a mosh pit
Dancin off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!

[Chorus: Sample from "Dumb Girl" by Run-D.M.C.] (Jay-Z)
I seen you Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z 
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z (Yeah, yeah!)
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z (Yeah, Yeah!)
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay Jockin Jay Jockin jockin Jay-Z (I'm so dope boy fresh!)

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit
You ain't gotta jock me, homey, jock my chick
Jock her cinatti, she +Body+ you with her fit
No that's not Pilates, her body is just thick
You ain't gotta jock her nigga, jock my clique 
Jock the dope boys 'cause we all tossed bricks 
Federallis jock me while I'm crossin the bridge 
Click, click - take a portrait of this
I ain't no pretty boy I got a georgeous wrist 
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty, sick
I'm some ghetto chic, I'm where the hood and high fashion meet
Oooh wee I'm like the camouflauge Louis
How you niggas want it the tux or the toolie?!
Haters, I ain't mad at you
If I wasn't I probably jock me too

[Chorus: Sample from "Dumb Girl" by Run-D.M.C.] (Jay-Z)
I seen you Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z 
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z (Yeah, yeah!)
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z (Yeah, Yeah!)
Jockin Jockin Jockin Jay Jockin Jay Jockin jockin Jay-Z (I'm so dope boy fresh!)
I seen you Jockin Jay-Z Jockin Jay-Z
