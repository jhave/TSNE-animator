Song:   Where Are You Going
Typed by: bodyrott@ntlworld.com

People where are you going
People where are you going

Everybody wants to play the game
But nobody wants to lose
I see my people die everyday
That's why I sing the blues
Now tell me who wants to roll with me
Take a look at my world
I see some problems
Maybe you can help me solve them
Turn boys to men
And make women from girls
I see my loved ones turning to drugs
Almost everyday I lose another one
Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they dont know

People where are you going
People where are you going

What if I could save my nation
What if I could save my friends
If I had the whole worlds attention
What if people were really listening
I would tell them that I'm no good without them
I would tell them together we can stand
Another message to brothers, colors bother
I'd introduce them to the hardest man in town
Somebody thell me please

People where are you going
People where are you going

Where are you going I ask you one and all
Anyone can answer
I betcha' they dont know

People where are you going
People where are you going
