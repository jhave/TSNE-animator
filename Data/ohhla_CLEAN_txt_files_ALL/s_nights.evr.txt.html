Song:   Some Nights (Are Better Than Others)
Typed by: wellington75@hotmail.com

Some nights are better than others
Some fights are left among brothers
Some nights are better than others
Some fights are left among brothers

You know the freaks come out at night with the drama
I'm a break it down, take it down, learn it
Roll it up, burn it, think it
Stir it up, drink it, swallow it
Follow it straight to the heart of the matter
Program the data, turn on the lights
Watch them all scatter, from the shine off the glean
Course by my team, it's the high pro glow
One for the show, two for the handgun
Three, the one you man run when it's time for the action
All the stories you told are bound to get old
When your hands ain't as fast as the words you flippin'
Word to Scott Pippin, got to be trippin'
You must have been slippin', or want the ass whippin'
It's time to start flippin'

[Chorus]
Some nights are better than others
Break it down to the bare root essence
Some fights are left among brothers
Count your fingers then count your blessins

[Repeat Chorus]

They say blood runs thicker than water
Mothers to sons, bullets to guns
Hard times are spreadin', just like the flu
The voodoo child don't need to be raised
I'm no kid, act wild son, you might get blazed
Like an acid hit, I rock classic shit
That can make your head bump, put some shake in your rump
This ain't Forrest Gump but I got mad rhyme
Why you shoot that gun, I'm a shoot this gift
Leave you internally perplexed like the question if
Some hit the spliff, some of y'all sniff
Some clap the hammer when they pull a four fifth
But most of y'all fry, kid let's be blunt
You tryin' to be the man, well I be on the man hunt

Chorus x4</pre>
