Voice Talking: But anyway I..I..I like to value my
relationship with women. You know sometimes I get so
deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
oral sex would complete our relationship

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yo,Yo,Yo, Yo Da Lin In The Valley
A delicious break from Potatoes
Yo Da Laheeeeoooooooo
Here we go
Yo, Yo, Yo Da Laheeeooooo
Let em know how I'm layin
Unusual kinda casual yes with me girls are obsessed
To get undressed
Get fresh and have me
Yodle In The Valley
And I'd do it at the drop of a dime (dime)
Sometimes goin from behind (from behind)
Slowly strokin, no jokin
My tongue just keeps on pokin
And the best type of oochie coochie
Is the type that tastes like sushi
Eat it
Watch a girl get fricky
And then wash it down with a shot of whiskey

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo Da Laheoooo

Yo here's a story
(Check it out)
I remember when I spent the night at Sally's house
Woke up with Cotton Mouth
Couldn't speak
My tongue was weak
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Oh I love them mountain thighs
And a pizza pie before my eyes
But before I taste them juices
I make sure this Sally douches
But she's not the only one
I like to Yodle On
It sounds wicky wacky ticky tacky
But yo you know that I'm most happy

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin The Valley

Girls think I'm a freak cause I don't speak
Whisper In their ear and make it clear
I love em'
Sorry dear don't hate
Cause I'm not gonna say I love you when your sitting upon my face
Oh yes It's warm and wet
In the valley you bet (bet)
And get this, one girl I yodled on
Had a bush thicker than the amazon
Forest
I felt like a tourist
A backpacker
Oh shit wheres my weedwacker
Came out with hair on my toungue
But still I got the job done
