"Captain's Log - supplemental. Their entire race was counting on them to wipe out
 the menace that had held their culture locked in a standstill for centuries.
 And now they had the help of a starship..." {Phasers armed and ready general?}
 (Armed and ready sir)

[Kool Keith]
Universe... galaxy... the world, the circumfrence
 {The counterattack will begin... NOW~!}
Deltron Major Nelson, cling-on like falcon
Norelco Gillette
Step to bat like a Met, Mike Piazza
I'm poppin a lot of blase-blasah
My students come to me and say yes so I am the king of big words
Scientific father, transportin Delco batteries
Accessories, ingredients for minerals and oil
I collect the coil
Turn worth, 50 G's
My chest can burn off a hundred degrees
Flammable mass, when overcast
All nucleus is us
The ray's comin
The sun damage the universal, they feel us

Talk to the Romans {*4X*}

The sources compel
To jump 335 cars like Kneivel
In front of five thousand people
Acceleration level beyond the rebel
Courtside Viewmaster
Anything you master, cast the spellphonic
on the rock creator, crystal sonic
High ventilation, overmind stimulation
Orchestration, devestation
No hemisphere, sort the plantation out
Altercation, U-L-3, you will see
Step in the bar and you will be

Talk to the Romans {*4X*}

The baffling symphony, hit the tweeters
The delivery expand, the production
The beats itself was empty
Highs crank the bass, the motivation is astonishing
The voice go crispy
More newer fake jazz artists try Dizzy, get Gillespie
Illustration tough, the circuitry was better
The highest of Jupiter satellites, don't test me
Let the galaxy hold
Stir this like small plane turbulence
The hospital feedback, operation urgence
The dictatorship, on a foreseen future
You ain't used ta, galactica funk
I jump in back of ya dunk

Talk to the Romans {*4X*}

(You're space happy if you believe that's even conceivable let alone possible~!)
{On the contrary doctor, it may be impossible in terms of science;
 but we're not talking about using science here.}</pre>
