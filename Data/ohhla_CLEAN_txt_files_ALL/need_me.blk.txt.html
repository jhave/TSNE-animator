[Bleek talking]
Yo... what's your problem shorty
Acting all stink..its cool though
One yourself ma...

[Chorus (Nate Dogg)]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life

[Memphis Bleek]
Ayo Bleek move through clubs twist up something yeah
A lil hay(hay), Memph not fronting
Then I sip a lil armay where are my mom-ays
Spread love that's how we do it in Marcy
One of em acting a lil different
What is it she missing, what isn't she getting huh
She need a nigga that break it any position
If she take it like a pro oohhh
Let her go noooo
You might be something to work with
Trust I'm not concerned with him
I'm not your boyfriend
Shit I'm just that nigga you call
That'll dig up in the roots ma and break you off
And, I can't lie I'm just a nigga from the Styy
But I, been around a few whores before
Either me or my boys tore it up before
But I'm hoping you not that type
I'll put it in your life ma

[Chorus]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life

[Memphis Bleek]
Some say off the liquor you could fuck all night (fuck all night)
But I say that ain't true you just be drunk all night (drunk all night)
It's me when I'm sober I can fuck all night
Baby girl if we sipping we just drunk all night
It's cool, first you gotta loose your attitude
Invite your girls over let 'em meet my man Murder
We smoke, talk, get aquainted
It's get low so you know you gotta sing this
Whatever happened tonight
Trust it got to stay between us
It never happened tonight so when they ask you
Say you never seen us (bitch)
Then me and Murder get ghost in the convertable
We just came from Fat Burger we full
Thats how we do it in LA from Marcy to Crenshaw
The girls all balls huhhh

[Chorus]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life

[Nate Dogg]
When your additude is gone
You can hit me on my phone
And maybe I'll come get you
Get up and take you home
Girl dont take too long
Just like a dog I like to roam
So when you need some dick
Hit me on the hip and I'll do you that favor

[Memphis Bleek]
Listen, anytime you need me just holla
I'll only hit it if its tight and its proper
The snatch ups no problem
Both of that head drop fitted caps
Now a days they gotta
You get it snatched you never get it back
Something just ain't right you must ain't kill it right
But, go ahead love just enjoy your night
Get your man off your mind
You need me in your life thats right

[Chorus]
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life
Why you mad and acting uptight
Girl I know that something ain't right
Ain't no need for me to lie
I think that you need dick in your life</pre>
