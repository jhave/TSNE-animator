Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Um well J that was an interesting Halloween Story
Um anybody else have another
Halloween story they'de like to share with the class?
I have another one. Well you have just told your story J
So what bitch, you sit here every day and tell stories
I'll tell a story in this mutha fucka
See he doesn't want me to tell my story
Cuz he knows my story, it's about Mr. Rotten Treats
All your parentes know my story too
They don't tell you about him though
Long ago they all killed Mr. Rotten Treats
They're scared that you'll talk about 'em, they're scared that
He'll come back from the dead, they're all scared
he'll cut your fucken ass

Welcome too, the other side
Thats what they told me when I died
I was stabbed in the head
Look what ya done dead
All the blood bleed, one juggalo dead
It was a cold, dark, scary Halloween
So my neighbors and my people,
they didn't really like me right?
So they came and burn down my world
Just because I like to murder their boys and girls
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one
I thought you were suposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?
I come back from the other side
I come for the people that took away my life
Trick or treat bitch, my dead body speaks
You tricked me now it's only right
that you try my rotten treats

Trick or treat, trick or treat
Watch as the dead man walks the street [2x]

Mr. Rotten Treats got all the good shit
over hereboys and girls, I got balls freshly
picked form Detroits biggest nutsacks, I got
Milky bar with the delicious razor blade filling
I got fudge freshly packed from the worlds rarest fudge packer

Must return to the other side
But not before I take these bitches on a murder ride
Murder go round the dead body clown
Put the treats in your mouth, and swish it around
Excuse me little boy, but is your daddy home?
Thank you sonny here's a little treat now run along
Hey buddy, you thought I was dead, man
You probably stuffed the fucken shank in my head
It was the Halloween I never ment to harm no one
I thought you were suposed to murder it was all in fun
I see the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer to
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?
I send you to the other side
Your buddies and your neighbors can come along for the ride
Weak bitches, you thought that you had me beat
But this aolloween I'm commin back with my Rotten Treats

Trick or treat, trick or treat
Watch as the dead man walks the street [2x]

Mr. Rotten Treats runs this bitch, bitch, I got
Fried titty nipples, sweet acid drops, sweet
chocolate coverd nipple nuggets with the fresh creamy
shit filling, ask about my bitch she loves my
cookie dough nut dribbles

Trick or treat? (Trick)
Trick or treat? (Trick)

It was the halloween I never ment to harm no one
I thought that you were supposed to murder it was all in fun
I seen the monsters and the gobblins I'm a killer too
But then they call me sick so what was I supposed to do?

Welcome to the other side
(Trick or treat)
(Trick or treat, trick or treat
Watch as the dead man walks the street)
