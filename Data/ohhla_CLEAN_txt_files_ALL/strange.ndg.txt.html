[Nate]
I've been lookin' for a girl 
Someone to share my world 
For maybe just a day or two
You've been actin' so stingy
I know you wanna' see
If I can do the things you heard

[Girl]
Actually I'd rather be out with my girls and weed
I guess that goes go to show you don't know me boy
If you really want to creep
Then talk to me with cheese
Or just don't even talk at all

(Chorus)
She's strange and I like it
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me
I got game 
So don't fight it 
All around the world she's just a sexy girl
Strange

[Nate]
You be actin' like you cool
Like you don't want to do
The things I know you want to do

[Girl]
Are you tryin' to come up
Or maybe just get fucked

[Nate]
Whatever girl I'm down like you

[Girl]
If you wasn't so damn cute 
I wouldn't even shoot

[Nate]
But yet you choose to shoot me down 
Actually it's time I leave 
You're girl is jockin' me 
I hope she's not another tease

Listen here I'd like to know
Why you keep actin' strange
I got no time to chase a hoe
But I'd like to know your name 
All I got is game to give
And it's gonna' be cryin' shame 
If you choose to disregard 
And pass up on this game

(Chorus)
She's strange and I like it
Girl when your walk you don't know what you do to me
I got game 
So don't fight it 
All around the world she's just a sexy girl
Strange</pre>
