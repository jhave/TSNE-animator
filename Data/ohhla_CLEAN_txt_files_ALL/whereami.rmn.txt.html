[Redman]
Watch out, we run New Jerz
That's my word, this type of shit will leave your vision blurred
The super-cala-fragist, especially I'm the dopest
Give a grand to any nigga who get closest
I re-pre-sent extra swift, gotcha
Taking pictures like Anita in the Rapture
Feel my fatlity my reality is real
Let me cleanse you like Golden Seal, with my ghetto premiere
Known for blowing focus, hocus pocus you're open
Give me a Sattelite I'll have niggaz loc'in in Oakland
Fuck HBO my flows like H2O
I rip MC's by decimal ratios
Non believers, turn your ears to wide recievers
Then you will agree that I'm the best thing since beepers
My ETA is to blow the spot in two seconds
Have y'all niggaz ducking in your section without weapons

[Chorus]
Huh, motherfuckers grab ya glocks (Just do it, ha ha, eh eh) {*4X*}

[Redman]
I shut off more lights then Teddy Pender-grass
I'm in the, my funk agenda, make mcs surrender
Feel the friction, when I have your block lit
Grab your shit, when you enter this station at the bricks
Look far beyond the clouds and the skies
I'm the reason why God has a thousand eyes
Spies be peepin, I know the West Coast be checkin
East coast, mid west, I be busting in all directions
Code red, this is funk's uncut, fuck the Feds
I quote Rahim the dread, life about just making bread
So I remain Kool like G. Rap, fuck where you be at
Make moves where you sleep at, the realness what MC's lack
So I kick subliminals for all hardcore criminals
Giving you, something funky to listen to
Dramatic, wiping your crew off with automatics
Ghetto tactics, backwards, I can knock the world off it's axis
And the buddah keeps my luger hot as Freddie Kruger
Who's the, next loser, to show their true colors
Brothers and sisters, I'm like Motion Pictures
Redman's the name, occupation? Smoking niggaz
I does it, I do it
I represent Newark to the fullest I could prove it

[Chorus]

[Redman]
You know my style, steelo
Throw more bombs then Dan Marino
I jams like Groover Washington live at the BeJu
Flatline people I'm live, lyrics are evil
I got connections up on Pluto *schhh* I read you
The cock thriller, vagina killer
My nine miller, and my niggaz
Control dirty raps like Willer
Recognize, Dee pack two clips
Lex got two tecs in the Lex, here comes Jim Flicks
So who's the next contestant to flex
I translate like Fugees, whether live or Memorex
Def Squad crew always got some fly shit on deck
Cause it ain't where you from, it's about where you at

[Chorus]</pre>
