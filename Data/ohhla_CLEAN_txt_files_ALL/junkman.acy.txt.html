(Somebody say ho-oh...)
(Say ho-oh-oh....)

[Aceyalone - talking]
Yesss man
But im not a motherfuckin' yes man
Yeah you know how it goes down
You just longer now, ain't nothing to it but to get it done
You know i'mma throw in this PMG
I got this love and hate on my mind
You know im sayin; its a cool little summer day
You know winter day, spring day, fall day, everyday, all day
You know good brothers own day with sisters
Good life baby

[Chorus]
You can catch me rollin' through your area
In something big like a aircraft carrier
With the big beat bangin' on the stere-a
Sitting next to a pitbull terrie-a
On the loan so it's no hysteria
In the cut just like the interio-a
Scoop the homies so it's more the merrier
You make a move for ya mic and I'll bury ya

[Aceyalone]
You either got new friends or new enemies
When you show the world ya true identity
You see I move with a God type energy
It's so big one of me make ten of me
You have no idea what it's finna be
You see the whole car smoking like a chim-a-ney
Yeah I got the poison and the remedy
To get mo' hands moving in the center p

[Chorus - 1x]

(Ahh, that was tight)
(Yeah the west keezy easy)
(Yeah, AC.. hey man, wha?, hey, hey!)

[Aceyalone]
Rollin' in my two thousand and twenty-one
More than machine with expandable wings
I land on the scene like a man from a dream
And grip the highway like water in the stream
Faster than your locomotive
Swoop by quick so no one would notice
Project lotus to styles to oldest
The coldest motherfuckas with the world on they shoulders
Top break-a bigga than a tank-a
Might stop and drop the anchor
Make em' bounce an ounce on my lap
And that's a rap, that's a rap (that's a rap, that's a rap)
Drive by just like Mr. Invisible
You can't see me, it's not possible
You can't feel me out, it's not probable
Control the course and move past the obstacles

[Chorus - 1x]

[Aceyalone]
You either got new friends or new enemies
When you show the world ya true identity
You see I move with a god type energy
It's so big one of me make ten of me
You have no idea what it's finna be
You see the whole car smoking like a chim-a-ney
Yeah I got the poison and the remedy
To get mo' hands moving in the center p

[Chorus - 1x]</pre>
