im just tryin to protect myself
you know what im sayin
for the wars to come
straight warrior
what cho gonna do when they come for you
yall feel me

times, hard times
lord my hard times
you know it got me feelin bent up n stuff
smokin and drinkin too much
again, it slowly erase my sunshine
(x2)

cant he see that we
are in need to be free(free)
(x4)

and yes we would be blessed
if we could rest in heaven( heavin, heavin, heavin)
and wouldnt you be blessed 
if you could rest in heaven(heaven, heaven, heaven)

now I can I facts with God as my witness
that this wickedness will not remain
youve got to make up your mind
you wanna be saved?
make up your mind
or do you wanna die?
you wanna die
oh yes were thugs were more than thugs
got soldiers wastelands warriors
were on a mission for God
so bartenda, bartenda, bartenda
so much hurt and pain
bloddy murders man
so much hurt and pain 
bloody murders man

it makes me erase my sunshine
(x4)

if I pray for you
(you) pray for me
(x2)

it makes me erase my sunshine
(x4)</pre>
