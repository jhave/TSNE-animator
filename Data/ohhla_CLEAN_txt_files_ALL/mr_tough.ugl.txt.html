Why do I keep runnin into you
You look like a slackjaw nincompoop
I guess bein tough is the thing to do
For who? 
Mr. Tough Guy

Maybe you watch too much TV
Or you just bought a new rap CD
And now you're out here gettin mad at me
Check him out
Mr. Tough Guy

You think you look cool, it's not the case
That's not how a cool cat operates
So wipe that dumb look off your face
Come on now
Mr. Tough Guy

You act like a jackass, that's your style
But just mellow out and relax a while
And don't be afraid to laugh and smile
(Haha)
Mr. Tough Guy

Please stop lookin at me
Please stop starin at me
Please, can I walk down the street?
Come on man
Oh, please stop lookin at me
Please stop starin at me
Please, can I walk down the street?
Mr. Tough Guy

Who's that in the back with the evil eye
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
Actin like he wants me to die
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
Who's that yellin out (What! What! What!)
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
I wish that you would just shut up
(Drop dead)
Mr. Tough Guy

Chewin em up, spittin em out  (8X)

Who do I see in the magazine
Flippin off the camera actin mean
I'm gettin sick of the same routine
From who?
Mr. Tough Guy

Hip-hop's not about seemin tough
Grabbin on your crotch and screamin 'What!'
Really I think we've seen enough  
Too much
Mr. Tough Guy

The people wanna get their kicks tonight
They came to see UD with the mics
So you turns up and picks a fight
(What's up man?)
Mr. Tough Guy

All we wanna do is have some fun
And there's nothin hip about bein dumb
So stop, you're irritating everyone
Man, quit it
Mr. Tough Guy

Please stop lookin at me
Please stop starin at me
Please, can I walk down the street?

Oh please stop lookin at me
Please stop starin at me
Please, can I walk down the street?
Mr. Tough Guy

Who's that little brat with the potty mouth
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
Talkin like he's gonna knock me out
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
Who's that with the bad attitude
(Who is it?)
Mr. Tough Guy
I can't wait till this trend is through
(Drop dead)
Mr. Tough Guy

Chewin em up, spittin em out  (8X)</pre>
