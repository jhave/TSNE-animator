Typed by: UNVMe4BNSoFine@aol.com

(Chorus x2)
Still ridin clean, makin cheese, and gettin my dick sucked
Still makin cheese, ridin clean, and gettin my dick sucked

(Project Pat)
I swear I'm going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God its tha pistol but tha crack back
Stayin on my job dealin wit hatas wit a jap slap
Dealin wit this mob lice watchin studio phone tapped
You best believe that I could see it from a mile away
Thought that my girl was down sleepin wit tha enemy
Tha streets are dangerous I could be dead anyday
That's why I'm ridin wit my dog smokin plenty hay
Thi shit contagious doin dope and its killin me
Even though I know I hit tha snow is you feelin me
I'm lookin good twenty-three's on that flippin paint
Them twelve golds in my mouth makin these bitches faint
Now can't a nigga see I ain't got no time for games
I'm on this Hennessey and I'm quick to shoot dat thang
But fuck dat one of my young niggas'll take tha charge
I'm stackin loot muthafuck lookin behind some bars

(Chorus x4)

(Project Pat)
Out slangin brickas tha project nigga row-a
A playa that's fa show-a I'm chargin a hoe-a
You weak niggas know-a you step and I fire
Yo life will expire you need to retire
Yo bitch call me sire she flat like a tire
Shot nut in her eye-a on that I don't lie-a
Tha fact of tha matter she blow out tha frizzame
I keep me some powder so I'm gettin brizzain
I'm out dodgin felonies and fuck dat coke
Cause a nigga lovin these streets and that's of course
Mane I hate to see tha judge face and that's fa sho
Prayin  that he'll drop the charge and let me go
Cause I like smokin good green Motel-io
Stick my dick in a hoe's mouth and there I go
Getting drunk off of liquor and smokin this dope
Put tha green in tha Swisher I'm gettin blowed

(Chorus x4)

(Juicy J)
You know who you are you hatin ass bitch
You tried to change yo name but you can chew on my dick
I ain't playin wit you hoes and you federal snitches
Wanna walk up to this pimp and get a hole in ya tensions
Always talkin 'bout the Juice hoe I been on tha town
I done blowed a hundred g's hoe you homey tha clown
You can call ya girlfriend and me &amp; Pancho can meet her
She can lick our ass out or she can suck on our peters
North North is tha hood bitch you know we are real
Know you scared to ride through know you gon' meet tha steel
Can't forget about you cowards you be high when you talk 
Nigga I fuck yo fat ass wife and put her on tha house
Juicy J is tha playa that you love to hate
Boy you betta get a deal or try to sell you some weight
Everytime you see me comin lemons know what I mean
Cause I been ridin Bentley, Roys, and I'm still on tha scene

(Chorus x4)</pre>
