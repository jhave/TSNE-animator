Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone

[Chorus]
I gave my blood, sweat, tears
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known

[Verse 1]
Ay, This right here, this is a miracle
This moment now, this is spiritual
Stay with the fork and the powder to whip
Cause we work and we add on additionals
Niggas be claimin they working, they working, but nigga we just don't agree with you
Don't none of these bad bitches sleep with you
Ain't no real nigga gon' eat with you
Everybody want a dollar, everybody want a check
Nigga there's only one future messiah, now higher than what you respect
How the fuck you get my number? Hungry ass baby, karma
You ain't never knew my struggle, they will never ever understand

[Chorus]
I wish everyone in there could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone I wish everyone
I gave my blood, sweat, tears
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known

[Verse 2]
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it
Ya'll niggas never believed me
Ya'll niggas never believe it
Nigga we fresh off the boat, we don't give a fuck 'bout sleepin' on floors
Nigga I'm fresh out of court, I just fired my lawyer, then bought a new lawyer
I know you went thinkin' I left you behind
You see what I went through to get here
You know what I came through to be here
Everybody want a piece of me
Everybody wants some piece of fame
I wish you could feel all my mama's pain

[Chorus]
I wish everyone in there could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it
I gave my blood, sweat, tears
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known what I did for this
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known
I gave my blood, sweat, tears
I wish everyone, I wish everyone

[Verse 3]
All I ever wanted for you was to believe in me
I came, I struggled, I made it, I conquered
One hunnid, I kept my word, I kept my word, I promise
You envying dedication and some hard work
We redefined gravity, go way beyond Earth

[Outro]
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone in here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone</pre>
