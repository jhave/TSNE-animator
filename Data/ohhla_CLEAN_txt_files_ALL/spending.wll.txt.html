Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now baby look I've
I've got nothing but money, honey
Aha
And I wanna spend it all
Spend it all on you
Aha

Spending money
On you

Tonight
Spending money

Girl lets go to store and spend bank
Buy you things you like
Get you pinky rings with diamonds in them
Dress you how I like
Put you in a flower designer clothes
Look your wardrobe
But Louis Vuitton
Try on Yves Saint Laurent
Let me give you what you want
Take you to the South France
Sit up in nice restaurants
Eat food that we can't pronounce
Go yacht in Saint Tropez
Club happening in Miami
Girl I love you special way
So go help me spend my money

Now baby look I've
I've got nothing but money, honey
Aha
And I wanna spend it all
spend it all on you
Aha

Spending money
On you

Let me get you something
Spending money
Can I bye you dinner
Spending money
Tonight
Spending money

They say money don't bye nobody's love
But you've already got them from me
I've already got it from you
You my baby's mama I'm your baby's daddy
We are family
Let's go spending this money
Let's go take a nice exotic trips
Live a life lavish
Make a wish Lis
I'll give you the things you like
Make a wish Lis
Don't you worry 'bout the price
Girl I do adore you
That's why I'm trying to spoil you
I'm doing all that for you
Cuz, loosing you I can't afford.

[2X]
I ain't try to buy you
I just wanna buy you all them things
That you always wanted

Girl let's go shopping [2X]

[2X]
Now baby look I've
I've got nothing but money, honey
And I wanna spend it all
spend it all on you
Aha

Spending money
On you</pre>
