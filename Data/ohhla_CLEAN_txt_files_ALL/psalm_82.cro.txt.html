Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Talk to the people man
Niggaz don't talk no more in this game man

[Verse]
Psalm 82 verse 6
Thus says the lord
You are gods
Children of the most high
Psalm 82 verse 6
God of the West Coast
They gonna try to stop me
Stop this message
Nobody can stop the God
Nobody
Understand they gon' try to stop you too
(They gon' try)
The whole recipe to the universe
Resides inside your mind
Secrets, secrets they don't want you to unlock
I got the key so follow me
One of my own, that's what you wanna know
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
No weapon formed against my copsters
You new niggas, pay attention
I was born with a powerful mind
A mind powerful enough to attract positive things
And a desired lifestyle
Let's get paid niggas, let's get paid
God of the West Coast
God of the West Coast
Known to flow nice
When the sun shine in the scope
Used to be a death flow
God of the West Coast
God of the West Coast
God of the West Coast
Known to flow nice
When the sun shine in the scope
Used to be a death flow
God of the West Coast
God of the West Coast
And LA Lakers
That's right</pre>
