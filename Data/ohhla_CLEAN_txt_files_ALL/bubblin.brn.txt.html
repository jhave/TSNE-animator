with two hundred fan, to the telly wop and you don't stop

See more pennies than a loafer, whip the SP-500
No chauffeur, if I slide to the ?, make sure I keep a prophy-

We never movin backwards, attractive
To the active, mental state, and these black kids

and admiration of the population pump it on your station

A masked man came with the quick-fast game
with the kick-ass aim, and the plan for holdin big heads
Tryin to jump two spaces and beat two different cases
I been to many places so you know this is the time

[Grand Puba]
So check the rhyme gallery, I earn the top salary
I go to battles, cause my rhymes is superfat with calorie
Watch the Grand blow up like The Nutty Professor
Tommy Hil' better see me with three mil', nothin less

[Lord Jamar]
From the days of James Brown up to Erykah Badu
