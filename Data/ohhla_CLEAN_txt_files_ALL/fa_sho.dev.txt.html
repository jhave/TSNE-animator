[Intro] [Rob Quest speaking]
Yeah. This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway.
Check it out.

[Verse One] [Rob Quest]
Sittin' in the next room talkin' softly on the telephone
Makin' plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin' for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peep it loc
Here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think um
Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. 
With this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin'
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin' with my dick
And I'm constantly askin' myself, 
Like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know 
Damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin'
Illin'
Riffin'
Trippin'
She gave my face a smack, now she's got a busted lip 
And says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin'
Hey yo baby, apologize
Now I realize
Hmm
I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin' at the crib by my god damn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin' my back 
Tryin' to suck my own dick

[Chorus] [Devin]
When you're fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

[Verse Two] [Mugg Jugg]
Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin' on
Every time I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin' in my pants, grabbin' my nuts like a fuckin' squirrel
So what was I to do? me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin' how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe
I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak
We would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We got's to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin' was funny
So she came home early
And all that moanin' and groanin'
I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

[Chorus] [Devin]
When you're fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

[Verse Three] [Devin The Dude]
Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up 
Walkin' round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin' to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspect
There was somethin' up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me
She never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin' they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin' and shit 
When she left, at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months 
And when she call all she do is talk cold to me

[Chorus] [Devin]
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
Fuckin' over yo fo sho pussy
Tryin' to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy</pre>
