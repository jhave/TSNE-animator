[Yung Ro]
Got that poppy, I'm at the top I'm one
You're not you're dumb, slow daddy ay watch it son
Before I cock back the banger, and pop the gun
Have your moms like, not my son (no no no)
Ay I get real serious, about my currency dude
Fuck you up, and send you straight to the emergency room
Have your people waiting on the doctor, hoping you get well soon
But when he come out that room, he like (no no no)
That mean he didn't make it, they like why the violence
Bitch this organized crime, and we move in silence
So when you think you got away, and the coast is clear
The ghost is here, Nobody (no no no)
Ay say don't try that, we don't like that here
We hype like g'eah, live life like g'eah it's like that here
Don't talk to police, bet not talk to them people
I'm like officer I got amnesia, (no no no)
And I'm digging in your broad, and she loving the meat
Got her moaning screaming twisting loud, hugging the sheets
Oooh, she love daddy cause he fuck her right
What's my name, she stutter like (no no no)

(*talking*)
Nobody bitch, it go down
I got my nigga in here with me, (Killa)
G'eah it go down (yeah yeah g'eah
I'm up in here mayn), say Killa

[Kyleon]
I'm a pimp, Kyleon put bitches in they place
I make em walk that track, or put stitches in they face
Fuck a pimp cup, cause I can't stick it in my waist
Pull it out cock it, then stick it in your face
Love getting money, so I can stick it in the safe
And I ain't finna stop, until it's a mill ticket in the safe
So give me that ounce give me that brick, give me that drank give me that dro
Try to make a move and run nigga, (no no no)
I keep bullets for you, and them niggaz you hanging with
You fuck around, you'll be the new Color Changin' Click
You'll be the next turkey, with gun powder stuffed and in your body
You ain't fucking with Kyleon, you ain't fucking with (Nobody)
Y'all cake ass niggaz, must be out of your mind
Don't make the nine pop, and bust some'ing out of your mind
You motherfuckers out of line, cause you suck to me
Even if rap was a threesome, you still couldn't fuck with me naw

(*talking*)
G'eah (Nobody), Nobody nigga
It go down mayn, ay Kyleon man
I appreciate you coming through, fucking with your people huh
Speaking of my people man, I got my nigga Felon

[Felon]

That'll get you high lifted, like cheifing on hydro

While you dudes spit, trolly flows
