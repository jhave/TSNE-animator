[Chamillionaire]
Ay man, you know what? Life is real crazy man
It's crazy how life is like a full circle
You know, back in the day, I used to look at my life
I used to just think into the future
And think that I was going to be a basketball player, NBA player
I used to wake up every morning, go out play basketball everyday
Told myself I was going to go to the NBA, nobody was going to stop me
Wasn't a realistic dream, I ended up changing, I ended up being a rapper
Who would of thought? Over a 1 million records later I realise
The best basketball player, the smartest person in class
The baddest broad in the whole entire school
Everybody that used to be capping on you, ain't got the ammunition to brag no more
So as you stand in the presence of me and the present
I can actually look back in the past
Think about all them little African jokes and laugh
Hahaha, where ya cash?
Don't try to be mad at me, I'm just trying to eat
No, really I'm trying to eat, like I pull up to the window
MacDonald's drive-through, you know what I'm talking bout
I'm asking for the number 4, Supersize
And guess who I see, *Who you see?*
Somebody who used to talk bad bout me
See, you don't even want to show no gratitude
You want to pass me my food with a attitude
Like "Here, have it dude!"
I'm like, "Maaan, can I get some napkins fool?"
Now that's cool, that's cool, that's cool
Then I hand you a twenty, and as I tell you to keep the change
When I drive off the BALLING license plates must ironically make you feel strange
But you ain't got to hold your head down in shame
You just got to get out there and get on top of your game
You know what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's what I did, it's a grind, that's what I always claim
And one more thing, remember the name
