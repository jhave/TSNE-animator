[Timbaland]
Ha hah!! Eh-eh-eh, ha hah!!
Ah baby oh my baby down to (carry out)
Ah baby oh my baby down to (carry out)
I take your order when you steppin when you (carry out)
I take your order when you steppin when you (carry out)
I turn it on my baby don't you (cut me out)
I turn it on my baby don't you (cut me out)
Check it, check it out

Baby, you're looking fine
I'll have you open all night like an IHOP
I take you home baby let you keep me company
You gimme some of you, I give you some of me
You look good baby, must taste heavenly
I'm pretty sure that you got your own recipe
So pick it up, pick it up, yeah I like you
I just can't get enough I gotta drive through
Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you, all night
Have it your, way, foreplay, before, I feed, your appetite
Let me get my ticket baby, let me get in line
I can tell the way you like it baby, supersized
Hold on, you got yours, let me get mine
I ain't leave 'til they turn over the clothesline
Check it

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Take my order cause your body like a - carry out
Let me walk into your body 'til you - hear me out
Turn me on my baby don't you - cut me out
Turn me on my baby don't you - cut me out
Take my order cause your body like a - carry out
And let me walk into your body 'til it's - lights out
Turn me on my baby don't you - cut me out
Ah turn me on my baby don't you - cut me out
Cut me out

[Justin Timberlake]
Listen here girl
Number one, I take two number threes
That's a whole out of you and a side of me
Now is I full of myself to want you full of me?
And if it's room for dessert then I want a piece
Baby get my order right, no errors
I'ma touch you in all the right areas
I can feed you, you can feed me
Girl deliver that to me, come see me
Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you, all night
Have it your, way, foreplay, before, I feed, your appetite
Do you like it well done? Cause I do it well
Cause I'm well seasoned if you couldn't tell
Now let me walk into your body 'til you hear me out
Ah turn me on my baby, don't you cut me out

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
What's your name? What's your number?
I'm glad I came; can you take my order?
What's your name? Girl, what's your number?
I'm glad I came; can you take my order?
Come over here (what's your name?)
Come closer (what's your number?)
Over here (I'm glad I came)
A little closer (can you take my order?)
Come over here (what's your name?)
Come closer (what's your number?)
Over here (I'm glad I came)
A little closer (can you take my..)

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Justin Timberlake]
Don't you cut me out</pre>
