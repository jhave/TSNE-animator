Song:   Don't Worry
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Nancy Des Rose]
I don't wanna worry about the bills; let's go out, and chill {*2X*}
Don't worry, about them bills

[Nancy Des Rose]
All those worries in your head
You know you have the strength to forget about the rest
All those bills is what's causing you all that stress
You know you have the power to go beyond the mess
Master yourself, take that test drive
See your way out that negative path
Dark pattern, unfair weak voices in your head
Life is full of pleasure, take your measure, forget about the weather
Better days are straight ahead

[Chorus]

[Nancy Des Rose]
Put that cigarette away, chokin your life away
All that fear won't help you steer your way
Desires overpowering you, take a bubble bath
A long walk at the park, every problem has a solution
Don't go to those fake card readers about the future
They are far worse than you are, with no conclusion to their confusion
Dark spirits, leading you the wrong way
Someday everything will be okay, trust yourself one day
See how power manifests, to relieve stress

[New Chorus: Nancy Des Rose]
I don't wanna worry about the bills; let's go out, and chill
I don't wanna worry about the bills; let your hair out, and play
I don't wanna worry about the bills; take your car out, and chill
I don't wanna worry about the bills; forgot those bills and enjoy your life

[Kool Keith]
Don't stress yourself, the bills are paid
I cashed my check, foodstamps ready Reggie carry the bags
Spaghetti today, spaghetti to play
Mom cooked tonight, mom hooked it up tonight
Lima beans, biscuits, Fazola butter
Five dollars a basket, Apple Jacks
Don't make no jokes, apple cracks
Minimum to the max
Oats and wheats, grits and beets, candy and treats
Popsicles for the kids, Neopolitan brightest
Hot dogs, mustard, Oscar Mayers, big letters too
I'm at the cash register

[Nancy Des Rose]
I don't wanna worry about them bills (don't worry baby)

[Final Chorus]
I don't wanna worry about the bills; let's go out, and chill {*2X*}
I don't wanna worry about the bills; let your hair down, and play
I don't wanna worry about the bills; take the car out, let's ride
I don't wanna worry about the bills; go to the spa, and chill
(Don't worry) chill (don't worry)</pre>
