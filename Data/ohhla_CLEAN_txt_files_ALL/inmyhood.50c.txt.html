[50 Cent]
Niggaz screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don't want beef (nah)
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggaz better lay down, yeah I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain't gon' make it
You niggaz'll get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete ship already sinkin
I'm from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you're on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggaz'll eat yo' ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I want her
Gimme a second I'ma holla I'ma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk (uh-huh)
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Chorus: 50 Cent singing]
In my hood - niggaz got love for me
But I don't go nowhere without my strap
In my hood - a little 'dro, a little Hennessy
and niggaz just don't know how to act
In my hood - niggaz is gri-mey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood - niggaz might buck at me
So I keep somethin around to buck back

[50 Cent]
In my hood... I don't trust a muh'fuckin soul
When the D's come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth
Niggaz'll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo' case
Co-operate, or Doc'll have to operate
Niggaz I'll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggaz'll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggaz are lurkin, you'll have to catch 'em and merk 'em
I'm observin in my hood, cause niggaz be dumbin
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the runnin
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat when it's hot?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
In my hood - the house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
Up, you shit out of luck if niggaz catch you slippin (uh-huh)
Crack money slow so you know niggaz is trippin (yeah)
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley (ahh)
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggaz where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
{*click-clack, BLAM*} You know not to do good now

[Chorus]
