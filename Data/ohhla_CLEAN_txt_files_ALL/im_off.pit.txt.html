Song:   I'm Off That
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now this real simple
Pancho, beat that up man
If you off that, it means you don't mess with it
But if you love that, it means you mess with it
Let me tell you what I mess with

Skateboarding, I'm off that
Label execs, I'm off that
ANR's, I'm off that
But DJ's, I love that
Poppin' bottles, I'm off that
VIP, I'm off that
Making it rain, I'm off that
But DJ's, I love that

I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that

Being broke, I'm off that
Hanging on the block, I'm off that
Weak bass blow, I'm off that
Stop cop go, I'm off that
Ducking dt's I'm off that
BT's, BT's
Pink pony, scarlets
Tootsies, I love that
Studio gangsters, I'm off that
Internet gangsters, I'm off that
Young as fuck, you can't trust
That metal bust, I'm off that
Bad bitches, I love that
Bobo heels, I'm off that
Her hair a mess, toes a mess
Nails a mess and I'm off that
She kiss 'n' tell, I'm off that
She Instagram, I'm off that
She bring her friends, I'm 'bout that
The more the merrier, I love that

Dirty money, I'm off that
Cleaning money, I'm off that
Phony money, I'm off that
Getting money, I love that [x2]

I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that

Cognac, I'm off that
Champagne, I'm off that
Atlantico, it's cool
But boatin', I love that
Communism, I'm off that
Dictators, I'm off that
Peak rise, I'm off that
But freedom, I love that
Press the button and I'm off that
Stuck on women, I'm off that
Real wise, I'm off that
But freaky women, I love that
Bad bizness, I'm off that
Can't keep your word, I'm off that
Never on time, I'm off that
But haters, I love that
Lamborghinis, I love that
Ferraris, I'm off that
Maseratis, I'm off that
But private place I love that

Dirty money, I'm off that
Cleaning money, I'm off that
Phony money, I'm off that
Getting money, I love that

Dirty money, I'm off that
Cleaning money, I'm off that
Phony money, I'm off that
Getting money, I love that

I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that

I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that
I'm off that but I love that</pre>
