Geah, the nigga-hoes is back in the mutherfucker
MC Eiht's back once again, y'knowutumsaying?
Just like last year we told the girls, talking about they was down,
'Save the drama for your mama.' CMW cause the trauma, y'knowutumsayin?
Me and my DJ Mike T's in the house, pimping all the hoes, 
y'knowutumsaying?
I'm about to drop this smooth line, check this out.

Eiht is back girls to see whats popping.
Once again, the panties is dropping.
But this time I got the shit plugged in.
Another stupid one thinking Eiht's fixing to spend.
Called up the bitch like um 7:30.
Still in the bathtub, damn this was a dirty
bitch, must of fucked another nigga last night.
So what, I was with a bitch so everything was alright.
Pulled up bumping the mutherfucking Cube.
Walked in the door seen my face on the tube.
Stood there and tripped off the gaffle video.
It went off, I looked up and said its time to go.
Girl said she was hungry so I tried not to be evil.
I said you got a choice, Louie's burgers or Golden Eagle.
She started biffing, I said bitch i aint playing.
It aint like your my woman, y'knowutumsaying?
Girl got the grub and it was off to the liqour store.
I said what kind of drinks, she said go with the 4-0
I said what? grab one or two? 
She said get two, one for me and one for you.
Got her to the room and she started to guzzling
the forty, hit the blunt and the bitch was buzzing.
Thats when I told her it was time to come to Eiht.
And I was about to bounce, rock, roll, and skate.
Got inside, got to spanking on that ass.
Her engine got hot, she start moving real fast.
Thats when I knew, she started to feel it.
I grabbed them shoulders, said 'geah, can I kill it.'

Geah, still breaking them off, y'knowutumsaying.
Baby, y'knowutumsaying, aint no faking.
I'm here to break you off proper.
All them other niggas be drag, y'knowutumsaying?
All they wanna do is dick you down, 
But if you try to come to me and get the snaps,
It aint even like that cause I aint playing that way.
Thats played out, y'knowutumsaying?
But I'm about to kick this uh 91 shit, check this out.

Once again its on, geah girls you know the deal.
I'm on a mission to kill.
I gots to get a skee before it gets to late.
So don't perpetrate, just give it to the Eiht.
Called up this bitch, I was already fucking.
That made it easier to get her head ducking.
Told her we was fixing to have this little get together.
She started dragging about the movies, I said hmm whatever.
Told her I pick her up about 9:30.
I called up this other bitch, "damn Eiht you dirty"
Pulled up bumping, like flaunting my riches.
Ran out about I'd say 8 different bitches.
They hung on my window, leaned on my hood, Sat in my seat.
Got the raise in my meat.
I just had to know if they was skeezing.
I ran the line, 'whats the plan for the evening'.
Right then, yo, the shit was all plugged.
And after the night was over she'd be dug
out by a brother who wasn't saying a word.
Cause what I needed to say was already heard.
Picked the bitch up and went straight to get the liquor.
Then right back to my pad, so I could smooth dick her.
Told her a drag, it went straight to her head.
Cause if I said I just wanna fuck my drag would be dead.
She downed one cup, then 2 then 3.
And Eiht was ready to shake the [huh?]
And while I'm in it, I'll ask her can she feel it?
Damn, can I kill it?

Geah, y'knowutumsaying? Killing it all off.
All that's nice and soft, y'knowutumsaying?
CMW back once again, on the late night hype tip.
Or it might be on the 'who's is it' tip? I don't know.
Me and Unknown is in here, DJ Bolo's in here,
Mike T is in here. Mike "webeboomingtheshit" is in here.
And we all outta here. So all y'all girls save the drama. Out

Scratching: Yo I thought I told your stupid ass about the pussy I 
killed X2</pre>
