[Verse One: French Montana]
Light up the fire, you know we get higher
Rollin up loud real niggas movin quiet
Like it then I buy it, you donkeys on a diet
Bringin all my jewels I ain't know I start a riot 
Ridin with the blicker, messin up makeup 
You blowin up her phone, she ain't tryin to pick up
Drinkin out the bottle, leanin with a model
I throw a hundred racks up you think I hit the lotto
Ridin with the wolves I ain't talkin Minnesota
Shorty comin over, 'gon bend it over
Let me plank on it (On it) Put a drink on it (On it)
Heard you a freak, put my name on it (MONTANA!!!)

[Verse Three: Nicki Minaj]
Said he met this little girl by the name of Onika
When my body shake all the boys wanna freak her 
Brag and a boast they be, doin the most
If I, look at his friend he'll be, grippin the toast
So I took him to the crib, to kill him wid it
Put my legs behind my head I hit the ceilin wid it
When I put it in his mouth I couldn't believe it
He looked me in my eyes and said he wanna breed it
Passa passa, you ain't got no ends in mi casa
Big fat pussy, mi fasta 
Hit up Green Acres, hit up Kings Plaza
Some a dem seh dem Gully, some a dem seh dem Gaza
WAH!!!!
