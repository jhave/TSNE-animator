How ya doing?
Nice 2 meet u
Cause were both grown adults
And I really wanna get to know you baby

[Frank]
It's Time for Nitty just ta
Approach you slow with the
Shit to get you and drive just like a flow shifter
That's how nitty get ya
And girl I'm sorry but
I'm a squirrel in your world trying to get a nut
That's right Nitty is a grown ass man
seen the whole damn world from Detroit to Japan
And I've done touch many ladies all shapes and types
But I wanna touch your body get it wet tonight
Cause we adults girl and we can do what we want
This B2K4 we can bump bump bump girl
Look at the way your movin', it's in the way you walk
You make a player bump his dubs on the curb to talk
I know I'm movin fast, but let a player win
I wanna get you naked , and now you fill it in
And we can keep it just between me and you
Dank ain't even got to know the things that we do, mama
No disrespect but it is what it is
I'm not trying ta end up married with kids so
I use that good safety equiptment
And a magical wit it won't leave a finger print
And we can keep it just between you and me
Girl your looking mighty good in those jeans like free so ...

[Hook]

[Dank]
Yo I know you see me looking at you
And your shit is together your body's supernatural
And I really wanna get closer than close with you
Bang you low in the post like I'm supposed to hit you
I'm trying to get it crackin' get it going down baby
I know I'm talking fast and it might sound crazy
But you phenomenal got a player stuck
Ain't nothing wrong with 2 adults doing the grown up and
We can keep it just between me and you
Frank ain't even gotta know the things that we do but
I gotta have you baby girl in the worst way
And me &amp; you can party like it's your birthday
So where you at girl I need your affection
I got the blunts the liquour and the protection
That's what it is girl we gotta have safe sex
And when we leave from here go to my crib next
And we can keep it just between me and you
I wanna get to know you and we could be cool too
But right now...
