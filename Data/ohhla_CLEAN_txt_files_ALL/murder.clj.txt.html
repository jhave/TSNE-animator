Aiyyo don't go near the speakers

(LL Cool J)
The big showdown the display is skill
I'm the type of Picasso witcha girl on the pill
Take a family snap shot kiss ya wife 
Cause I'm like a knife, the concrete is right 
And I'll take ya life and take ya like python 
I'ma do you wrong 
Any emcee who you wanna name?
I want pain that I can be tamed 
Talkin about guns punk it don't alarm me 
Got enough cash to make a whole damn army 
I can't hold back the way that I feel 
Cause when I bust a rhyme it's like ya slippin off banana peels 
Ya like fruit cake ya fruit cocktails 
First your title now I'm takin your female 
All of a sudden you're so proud of a black
A baseball hat but you ain't sayin jack 
The ripper is back and you can't escape 
Cause one of my records will sell more than your whole tape
I want beef so bring on the rookies
I got more than just Cool J cookies
Rip Rock, crush, stop, cop, I'm poison come and take a drop
I bet ya teeth will end up around the corner kid 
Don't ask me why I did it 
I'm civilized damage to a nobody 
And I'm carrying a gun if I'm rhyming at the party
New York, Chicago, Detroit, LA
I'll slay wherever ya play
D.C. or Philly, or Baltimore 
I'm worrying the rich, invading the poor 
Perpetrating in your video, here's the real smoothing 
Country accents, who do you think you're foolin?
I play "crushable", "late night craps"
You only knew cause ya onto your raps 
And rap city and V.E.T.
The channel 31 and but now here I come 
To save the day and the now you're getting done 
Like a hooker, don't try to soul, crumb 
The first sign of the battle you little fake 
It's (???) comin out ya kitchen sink 
Your Mic's a baby bottle son 
Some say they ain't but I am the one 
The slice is that the fire boy it'll break ya 
servin or heard em a word occurred to him
then he could move a would get moved on 
Like a shotgun blast big mouth emcees I'll bet ya none last 
cause they ain't sable or able
And I bruise the party like jumper cables 
So plug me in and put me on 
I'm serial hard so I can battle amore 
from coast to coast fly, cripple, and crazy
Use a dictionary but you still don't phase me
Listen ansd we can sound cheap 
Reach out for my blackness but your records ain't wack this 
Your bitin on the castle door but when you fall in the moat 
I won't see ya no more 
Let's get together  and diss LL 
Use his name and ya records might sell
I can't believe you found a dead maggots 
crawlin all over my name I won't have that 
You better look in the mirror and re-think your plan 
Why walk in quicksand?
When you can stand on your own two feet 
I'm rippin emcees a funky drum with a big beat 
Name the date and a or Rainer 
Ya three year old ballerina 
I can't believe the suckers try to throw-down
Whether you're new or older than old town 
Just kick back I don't like a ?stagger wagger? psycho rap 
You can't handle the format 
Whether you're swab or swoon 
Ruff or rugged all I need is a broom 
If I slay the way they slay, punk play the pay
Mr. Morris has entered the buffet 
Some of y'all are sittin in rows
Plates of hot butter rolls, beat ya with balamey 
Slap ya with salami cause when I get hot I get hot like pastrami
Then I make ya wonder why you don't hear bass 
But you feel the thunder
You get cooked I'll knock out your tooth 
We'll be fighting from lobby to the roof 
You are on me like I wrote your dinnertime
Yo Marley (Whassup?) spill the time 
(Nah man, just kick a little warmth)
Pass the brass knuckles then we break his jaw 
When I'm on the microphone I want silence
Let KRS-One stop the violence 
Ain't no rivals ain't no competition
Punk, I'm beatin ya into submission 
I'm gettin busier than ever before 
Never more will I'll slack I'ma keep it real raw
Eat ya up like a pack-jam 
Video is poppin over a Batman
Rippin you to shreds, tappin you on the head
Then leave the battle lookin as happy as a newly wed 
Give me a tech-nine to spray 
Save the peep and put it on law-away 
I'll make a mailman spin and send a jam the fans will understand
Feel ya weep about the murdergram</pre>
