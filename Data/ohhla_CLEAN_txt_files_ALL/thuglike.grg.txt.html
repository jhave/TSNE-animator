[Hook 1: Deuce Poppi]
How could a thug like me get wit a girl like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a girl like you

[Hook 2: Trina]
How could a girl like me get wit a thug like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a thug like you

[Verse 1: Trina]
I'm a first class chick wit a platinum voice
See me in Bal Harbor in a platinum Porsche
I'ma stay that rich chick - never broke fa sho
You wanna send for me - baby charter the G4
That's the Leer Jet - that's how you break me off
Touchin in the cockpit while we takin off
You got me ridin in yellow Ferrari's and Harley's
Icey Bagari's, midnight manage's
"Take it to the House"  -  let me stretch you out
Lock you in my bedroom - I never let you out
I got you loose on X, get your mind rollin
Handcuffed to the headboard, blindfolded
wit the candles lit - we gettin scandalous
The Maridia Suites - In Los Angeles
I'm the +Baddest Chick+ - wit that bump and grind
And I know just what it take for me to make you mine

[Hook 1: Deuce Poppi]
How could a thug like me get wit a girl like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a girl like you

[Hook 2: Trina]
How could a girl like me get wit a thug like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a thug like you

[Verse 2: Deuce Poppi]
Yea, yea, yea
You a bad lil summin - aint'cha?!
20 karat tennis bracelet 'round ya ankle
I got the chick like you - wit a lotta loot
Body cute enough disguise that body suit - just me and you
Round trip to Vegas and back
Pop Cris' - shoot dice - and make us a stack
You can drive the rest, now give a thug a try
I put you in that brand new Benz bucky eye
I aint trickin' baby girl but I break bread
You get the "Keys to the Range" like Jagged Edge
I wanna lay this pipe till ya half dead
I'll cut ya hard enough to break ya brass bed
I wanna teach ya everything that a thug learned
Doggystyle on the floor wit the rug burns
Lil' Momma if ya scurred, then go to church scared
Cause I'ma hit that thang harder than Jevon Kearse
Wha wha?!

[Hook 1: Deuce Poppi]
How could a thug like me get wit a girl like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a girl like you

[Hook 2: Trina]
How could a girl like me get wit a thug like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a thug like you

[Verse 3: Deuce Poppi]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Lil' Momma you finger lickin, like Roscoe's Chicken
Wussup wit this stitchin - that  midnight trickin?
Yo body, I wanna ride like a Ducati
Like Kawasaki, mami don't get 'ocki
Plus I'm thick stocky and my wrist rocky
Just get on top me till that oochie get sloppy
Mirrors on the ceiling, look up, you can watch me
When you feel that nut comin, scream (Deuce Poppi!!)

[Trina]
Best believe - playboy when I lay witcha
I got "69 Ways" to play witcha
I'm a rich chick - I don't need ya bread
All I need is yo head 'tween my legs
Tell yo girlfriend you comin' home late tonight
You straight the night - I'mma get this thang actin' right
Admit it - I'm the best that ever did it
Anytime - any place - you know a chick wit it

[Hook 1: Deuce Poppi]
How could a thug like me get wit a girl like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a girl like you

[Hook 2: Trina]
How could a girl like me get wit a thug like you
Tell me what should I do - to get a thug like you
