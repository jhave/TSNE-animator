[Case]
Ummm, Say all that I want to do
Is to live my life
Ummm, but everytime I turn around
Another nigga dies
Niggas catchin five to ten years
And it just ain't no use

[Ja Rule]
Uhh, uhh, ever heard of a nigga dying twice
My love is just to live my life
Till the Lord decides to out my lights
Oh I know why niggas ain't prepared to die with me
But we all got to die one day
Even though the life has captured me
Money, drugs and prisons, menages with women
Forgive me God for living
For I have sinned
Now everybody wanna cage me in
Don't make no difference cause I'm still here
Breathing, can I get a witness?
My life is misleading, hey
Hey, cause anybody wanna fuck with me
Come on just grab your heat my niggas
Don't ever doubt your niggas
What's life without my niggas?

Talk to my niggas heart to heart
We all live from hustlin' to ballin'
It's crime we fall in
Feds keep a lens peakin' through the Venetians
But secret indictments
Ya'll niggas is reachin'
C'mon I'm in the business to break niggas
And anybody that want it get it hot from the INC. niggas
Ja Rule ready to kill niggas
Bury 'em all
Lookin to lay them down big to small
Got the world in awe 'cause I'm spittin' the raw
Never seen, never heard before but truly yours
I'ma max out on niggas doin 2 to 4's
Bang a nigga in the yard then get rid of the board
Just because a nigga don't give a fuck get weeded and Hennied up
Still the ball out be nuts
Since you keeping in touch feel the guns bust for sure
If you want any more
