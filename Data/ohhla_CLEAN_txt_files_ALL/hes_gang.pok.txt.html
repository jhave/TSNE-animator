(*talking*)
Uh, I need a bad bitch bad hoe
Go hard with a nigga, in the middle the flo'

[Big Pokey]
I need a bad bitch, bad hoe
Go hard with a nigga, in the middle the flo'
Ain't complaining, bout her knees so'
Ain't gon leave, till her jeans to'
Five foot fo', dark and thick
Call her bitch, cause she bark at dick
When I'm finished with her, then my boy can hit
If not, next time I'ma dodge the chick
I don't, play with hoes
I run through broads, like a change of clothes
Dressed in a fo', top of the line
If you hear my headboard, then I'm knocking her down
If I hit her from the back, I'ma pop her behind
Make it sound off, like a shot from the nine
A peck on the neck, I get her hot as a iron
If she say I went low, better stop her from lying

[Hook]
(he's so gangsta), I need a bad bitch bad hoe
(he's so gangsta), go hard with a nigga in the middle the flo'
(he's so gangsta), I need a thick bitch sexy slim
(he's so gangsta), Niggaz get checked I don't play with them

[Big Pokey]
I'ma pull up in the lot, Beamer or Benz
Jumping out clean, in my skeeto for men
Let the games begin, I'm on Jane and Henn
X-O in my life, so I'm sane again
Hoes in the place, so I got to lay low
Snatch some'ing foreign, get her shots of Cuervo
(where your girl at), I done left the wench
Baby jumped fly, put that hoe on the bench
Past tense, naw I mean
Trying to slide up, in her Prada jeans
Hoes pulling on me, like a slot machine
Plus I got em tripping, on the watch and ring
I need a young stunner, thoroughbred
Pigeon toe, standing on the back of her legs
Buck wild, cause a nigga back in the FEDs
Liquor got her wired up, attacking her head

[Hook]

[Big Pokey]
This one goes out, to my ladies in the club
My niggaz outside, on dubs nigga what
With a slut, ready to get up in her guts
Thighs butt, I'm just sizing it up
Young buck, pushing a 2000 truck
DVD, TV deluxe
Pushing through the lot, with my attitude on
Nigga in a zone, trying to take some'ing home
Flipping through my phone, trying to find a date
Gon be hard to do, cause it's kinda late
Out the gate, I'ma flex my weight
If baby drank, I got a extra eight
I'ma feed her steaks, eggs and juice
We gon make the bed shake, like a 70 deuce
Impala, when I hit her she holla
Choke when she swalla, top flo' at the Ramada
