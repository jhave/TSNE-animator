Song:   The Guillotine
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Hey you!
We got your war
We're at the gates
We're at your door

[Chorus]
We got the guillotine
We got the guillotine, you better run

[Boots Riley]
We want to thank you for flying with us
We know you coulda stayed home, just cried and cussed
May all your guns go off if it's time to bust
May all they tanks have time to rust
They got the armies turning bullets into gold
They got the hookers turning tricks in the cold
And every time the police kicks in a door
An angel gas breaks sticks in the O
And even if a d-boy flips him a O
It ain't enough to buy shit anymore
Sleep in the doorway, piss on the floor
Look in the sky, wait for missiles to show
It's finna blow cause
They got the TV, we got the truth
They own the judges and we got the proof
We got hella people, they got helicopters
They got the bombs and we got the, we got the

[Chorus]

[Silk-E]
Don't talk about it
It won't show
Be about it
It's 'bout to blow

[Boots Riley]
I just spit the dope lines, I don't snort 'em
Tell the boss to call police to escort him
You don't write all them lines, you just quote 'em
Get offline, plug in to this modem
No, you can't out-vote 'em
The rules is still golden
Only jewels we holding is if we guarding our scrotum
If you press your ear to the turf that is stolen
You can hear the sound of limitations exploding
Please sir, may we have another portion?
We're children of the beast that dodged the abortion
Neck placed firm 'tween the floor and the Florsheim
We'll shut your shit down, don't call it extortion
Caution -- we're coming for your head
So call the Feds and get files to shred
Every textbook read said bring you the bread
But guess what we got you instead?

[Chorus]

[Silk-E]
Let's keep it banging like a shotgun
We in a war before we fought one
Now if you're tired of working from day to day
A common enemy, we got one
Now keep it banging like a shotgun
We in a war before we fought one
Now if you're tired of working from day to day
A common enemy, we got one

Don't talk about it
It won't show
Be about it
It's 'bout to blow</pre>
