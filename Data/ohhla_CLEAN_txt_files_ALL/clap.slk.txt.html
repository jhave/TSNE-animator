[Chorus]
We hustle on the block if we have to
We'll pop those thangs if we have to
Give them thugs in the hood something to clap to
We hustle on the block if we have to
We'll pop those thangs if we have to
Give them thugs in the hood something to clap to

[Verse 1]
8 in the morning, feds at my door
Fresh P Miller Jumpoff cross the marble floor
Out the back door, I try to make my escape
I almost dead but a dead nigga almost caught him a case
Either something good bout to happen or I just got bad luck
I need your help cause something just ain't adding up
I got two ferraris and I got one bently
I also got two chargers with another one in it
They like "Shocker used to sell dope, that's a given"
I'm from the projects, man tell me who isn't
I used to travel like I ain't have no pivot
Most ain't gonna understand that only real ballers gonna get it
I don't know how y'all can do shit for love nigga, not me
If money ain't involved, then I ain't involve nothing I free
I gotta make sure I eat, and I sleep well
Even if I stop, the world will keep going like sprewells

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you sliding down poles or you stuck in college
But you gotcha 9 to 5, just do what you gotta
See, a real nigga like myself, you can holla
I understand your pain, I'm addicted to dollas
So ma, nigga love some power
But I don't fuck with bustas, I'm allergic to cowards
I'm a real nigga so I can relate with ya
Do it for yourself, don't depend on these fake niggaz
Usually the boy shocker go for self
Ma if you real, I don't mind giving you some help
If the top is good and your middle is nice
Then I promise you I won't leave you in the middle of the night
I probably stick around longer, wait til the morning
Whenever I leave, if I leave, you gonna hate that I'm gone
Cause I put it on you like boots in a flood
Know you used to the scrubs
But ma you need to come chill with a thug

[Chorus] </pre>
