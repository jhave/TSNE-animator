Twitter? Hell nah, don't be telling what a Twitter means bwoy
What you, what you mean I know what twitter is
Twitter, that's when you grab somebody by their tittie nipples
you know both of um
You know and squeeze'em and twist'em real hard
You know, with your thumb and your pointing finger
Don't be telling what a Twitter means, motherfucker
Yeah, I... I ain't gon Google you either
You know Google? Yeah I know what Google is too
That's when you stick your thumb up somebody booty hole!</pre>
