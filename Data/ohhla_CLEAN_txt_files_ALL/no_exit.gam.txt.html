[Chorus]
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?

[Verse 1]
Can't sleep
3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin'
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia
So be it, say I'm over it
Playin' Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars
Stare at my hands, look at the moon, I can't find it, it's gone
What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright? Yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie
When I'm laughin', I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood...so good I'mma kill that spider
Them kinda things they told me [?] that makes me violent
Go home, lock the door, watch cartoons for an hour
Turn off the lights
Look at the recluse...
Look at the recluse...
Look at the recluse...
Look at the rec-

[Chorus]</pre>
