[Sharli McQueen]
What I wanna do
Uhh, uhh, one two one two c'mon
One two one two c'mon
Yo, c'mon, yo
Movin around the world and daydream of days that money brings
Chasin material assumin that it's happiness inside
You think that you could buy a better life, no matter the price
But you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
Haven't found what you're lookin for

[Pras Michel]
Yo it's official now, I'm your, freedom fighter
If you feelin what I'm feelin people, put up your lighters yeah
Get in my cypher yeah, get in the grind
And I won't stop rockin through the world seen the shine
Because I been many places, seen many faces
Shook many hands and mixed with many races
From nowhere to Bombay, did it my way
Got my style from the ghetto, took it straight to Broadway
Spit these bars cause in the hood I'm the instrument
Been around the world I stepped on seven continents (that's right y'all)
20 millions later, I settled the score
They got money for war but can't feed the poor

[Sharli McQueen]
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
One two one two one two c'mon
I'm stayin love you, but you don't notice me (c'mon)
Diamonds and fancy cars, female celebrities all the time
You give away the things you say was mine, chasin the shine
But you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
Yo, haven't found what you're lookin for

[Pras Michel]
We gotta, make a move, by any means necessary
From January and January to January
Look out my window it's a robbery
People still put they ones in the lottery
Big fish always try to eat the small fish
They do anything just to get their last wish
War in the East, there's war in the West
War down South I stay war 'pon the rest
As it's been said, let it be done
And there's nothing new underneath the sun
So we preserve what's destined to come
And share our thoughts and blessings with our daughters and sons

[Sharli McQueen]
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
And you stillllll, haven't found, what you're lookin forrrrrrrr
Haven't found what you're lookin for

[Pras]
Guerilla baby!

[Sharli McQueen]
Haven't found, oh no no no

[Pras]
Ah, yeah, alright
What, what, guerillas</pre>
