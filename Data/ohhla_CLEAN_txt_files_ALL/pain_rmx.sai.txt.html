Pain in my life...life...life

[The Game]
Check
From the grafitti in the pissy project hallways
To niggaz hustling on the block
Settin up shop crack cocaine ??? tops
Youngins with the boombox lettin they head bop
My vision was blurred
Like the TV that them niggaz in the feds watch
The hood is like a pitfall with corner liq stores
You sellin bricks all, you shoot a nigga
Get em bricks by the big dawgs
It fucked up skinny niggaz get pick on till they buff up
Don't lift weights, shoot 38's
Load the clip pull the truck up
I been through it
Sittin in the block in that tan Buick
KRS in the speakers equivalent to Nas and Ether
That was 85, I was six
Couldn't wait to get him &amp; sit in my father's lap
And watch a ???? flick
I'm from the old school  these new school niggaz bore me
Aint got shit for me
Shoulda been influenced by Calvin Broadus, Nasir Jones, and Sean Corey
I'm on the road to glory
By the time I don't had so much pain in my life
I shoulda killed myself
Smoked that crack cocaine and swallowed all them pills myself
I'm a legend D.O.C. said it
Hip hop is forever embedded inside my veins
And I'm takin my credit

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
You feel this pain I've been havin'
Wouldn't lead to much change
Cuz down here, not muched changed
Cause everbody wanna thug, mayn
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
If you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang
If you would pump your breaks young mayn
You'd jump in the other lane

[Saigon]
Game I'm finding it harder for me to live with it
Thinkin bout getting on some religious shit
They say religion is for degenerated
But if the church take away the hurt
Then damnit I need to get wit it
So much pain in my life
Cuz It's gotta be the devil
It's got us slavin probably below the poverty level
We could blame the whit man but then why do we settle
Collectively we could expect to see the lives in the ghetto
To be forever facin just death is a revelation
We could get on pace if we better the education
And make some real songs about more than just ballin and big ice
For something to get em to think twice
So much pain in my life
I feel for those who felt they didn't need they brothas
Now they teenage mothers
Care about the AIDS in Africa cuz we they brothas
Reguardless of how they portrayed I can see they love us
It bring pain in my life
To know that there's a whole f'n nation dyin cuz they can't afford medication
While we got the money to goto war
Not for something that was sure but for shit that that was strictly just speculation

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
You feel this pain I've been havin'
Wouldn't lead to much change
Cuz down here, not muched changed
Cause everbody wanna thug, mayn
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
If you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang
If you would pump your breaks young mayn
You'd jump in the other lane

[B.G.]
Dawg I'm stressed out
Sometime I be thikin God I'm ready to check out
I aint lyin I be ready to come see you
It cant be worse than if I get caught with anotha heater
And I ride those even though I don't been to jail 4 times for those
In these streets I done seen too much
Too many people I love done had they fuckin head bust
So much pain in my life
You don't know pain
You don't know bout losin yo life in a hurricane
Naw don't you don't know how it feel
To spend a weekend with em then yo daddy get killed
Pain in my life
I don't been thru it all
That stakin hoe Katrina took my city like a dog
I done been down but Imma tell you what
A real nigga always find a way to get it done

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
You feel this pain I've been havin'
Wouldn't lead to much change
Cuz down here, not muched changed
Cause everbody wanna thug, mayn
(*"So much pain in my life"*)
If you knew the pain I sustained
Just from lettin' my gun bang
If you would pump your breaks young mayn
You'd jump in the other lane</pre>
