One family, true family. From Flesh-n-Bone
Thug humbly teachin' 'em what to be:

[Flesh-N-Bone]
A thugsta just like me...
Come follow me, journey off in my world, all boys and girls
Welcome to the land of T.H.U.G.S.
It's the start of a new millenium, and we on a mission
Rappin', makin' money made me put away the drugs, all right
I love my life
When I put it down, I'm so cold, so come up, take note:
This Trues Humbly United Gatherin' Souls
You don't wanna miss the boat, or you float
The nation coast to coast
(We're keepin the) heartless hardest soldiers
Anyone think that they man enough?
Stand up for the face off, gonna get ran over
My feelings never show you mercy
And I been known to swang
Always down for the thugs, and I put in work
Niggas see that I'm all about the ?, man, the reason I bang
? in their eyes and the niggas who with me
But if you out of line, watch how my people feel 'bout they mind
It's ? when they hit'a me (kick thang, gettin' me swished)
'Cause they get tosses and find out they can't win
And they can't 9 times out of 10
When I join my family, multiply with ends, ?

One family, true family, from Flesh-n-Bone

T.H.U.G.S. can come from around the world
T.H.U.G.S. can either be boys or girls
St. Clair playas, common ground we on
We are Trues Humbly United Gatherin' Souls

[Flesh-n-Bone]
With Flesh-n-Bone, pow to get a nigga in ground
I'm'a show you what it is, ana way to get it done
Down to East Nineteen ninety-nine 
All through the year two-thousand
I'm a ? when I'm on the run I'm havin fun
Don't bring you gun, unless someone is giving you static
Then I suggest you pack it, when they run up on you
Pull it, and blast it, that automatic let that fool have it
No thang, for the trigger bang bang bang
Man, it's a shame, but you gotta do what you gotta do to maintain 
And remain this game so people rest in peace, until the finally peaceful
And it be the sequel, when everyone's equal, gonna be humble to people

Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven

[Flesh-n-Bone]
See, I see, picture the world in harmony
Before it's too late
So close to runnin out of time
Soon it it'll be judgement day
And, Lord, I pray Your mercy on mankind
Earn your ticket to get up to Heaven
Maybe Hell if you don't get yourself together
You might be sorry, but it's your turn to go soon
And I know they know better
We are all soldiers of God and gotta job
Connect to them souls
He want you to spread The Word about Him
Simply, that's easy for you to pay the toll
What more could we ask for?
We all are whether you like it or not
We get a chance to profit in life
And living on Earth
You're gonna get put on the spot once in awhile
But I know that you humble heart
No doubt you'll be tested
Even halted by demons
Stressin', wanna get you arrested
(If I'm not workin' this)
You keep it real true with yourself and family
Gotta plan this good and ready
They hand me peace, much love to the G's
Who reall understand me

Give us this day our daily bread
And lead us no in temptation
But deliver us from the evil 
Amen

T.H.U.G.S. can come from around the world (around the world)
T.H.U.G.S. can either be boys or girls
