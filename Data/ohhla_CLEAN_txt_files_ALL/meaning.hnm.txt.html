[Mr. Eon]
High &amp; Mighty back in this
"You think you know what I'm meaning" [B. Real]
I'm just a '86 witness
"You thi-think-think-think ya know" 
Take it out you suckers, you don't know how I did it
"You think you know what I'm meaning"
Yo yo, you're now a game and don't think you're gonna win it
"You-think-you think you know what I'm meaning"

Maybe if I popped Cristal
Said I had a Lexus, or a triple beam I'd get a deal
I'd rather speak upon a Maurice Cheeks steal
It's the outta paper, not the caps I peel
I used my independent, money to pay the rent
Remain at hell bent, and far from heaven sent
Where they went? The days when mics got destroyed
B's just boy-ed, the soft punks got toyed
Unemployed, was a happy-go-lucky MC
And now that's all they fuckin be bringing to me
Where they went? The summer concerts on concrete
Elite could put twelve G's in the seat
Now I release the masterpiece of my music
It's '99, and no one could use it
They rather re-use it, the audience confuse it
Take Chuck D's Time Bomb, try to defuse it

"I've seen your kind before, you're not original" [Lord Jamar]
"Ya-you're not ya-you're not orig-riginal"
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"The-the-the meaning, ya think you know what I'm meaning" [B. Real]
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"Ya-you're not ya-you're not original"
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"Ya think you know what I'm meaning"

[Mr. Eon]
It seems that you gotta come cheap to compete
That's why when I chose to go deep you go sleep
On a verse, you not gonna get at first
Like O.J. would never ever get a hearse first
When he die, think about the lie over lie
&gt;From verse about the hearse of this rap universe
Cuz radical elements remain eloquent
The reprocussions tear right through the fabric
So act quick, kids at the top is lackin
They tryin to turn hip hop to just plain rappin
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
Cuz there's just so much of this shit that I can take
Now I can't stand the rain, this shit's all the same
Mr. E excommuincate your whole game
Back in '88 baby everything was gleaming
"The meaning, you think you know what I'm meaning"

"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"You're not-you're not-you're not original"
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"Ya-ya-think-ya-think you know what I'm meaning"

[Mr. Eon]
Where your skills at, where the ill raps?
Where the new tracks, where your heart at?
Where the new jacks, gettin contracts?
I got a rhyme that I ain't even wrote yet
Save the drama classes for the masses
Hip hop, glacoma, baby I prescribe the glasses
The vision's near-sighted, and narrow-minded
The wack shit that you hear, is all hate and fight
Take it like harder, fools act retarder
In '98, lyrics just disregarded
Now how hard it be yo to really concentrate
Writin metaphors, wack shit I annihilate
Now fools comin through spellin much gibberish
While Mighty Mi and I stay acknicilous
Raps are bed pan, and I be the nurse
Removin shit wit lyrics that I disperse
Nail ya coffin, ?so you're? death's epitome
Ya fate be taken out is most likely
Not likely, we be The High &amp; The Mighty
Stompin out crews, the team of the '90's

"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"Not original" 
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"The meaning, you think you know what I'm meaning"
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"Ya not original--" "Ya not"
"I've seen your kind before, you're not original"
"You think you know what I'm meaning"
