[Chorus]
I'm finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game barely started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

[Verse 1]
Starter, only hit the bench when I'm liftin'
Priceless, but they still gotta pay admissions
I'm so far ahead that I could pause and take pictures
Hold the autographs, I'm a shot away from winnin' it all
Hell yea I'm goin' for the title
And if your name is on the title then finna get the white out
So many cameras flashin' I cant even tell its night out
I swear I saw the reaper, guess I'm finna bout to play my life out
Lights out,
Everytime I'm coming down
Cuz I will knock you out like you weigh 100 pounds
Bartender, I'ma probably need 100 rounds
Theres only one king, and not another crown
Tryna pay my tool like where is the pay station
Whole crowd packed, like they finna vacation
Doing everything in the world that I planned
So now I tell my dreams, c-catch me if you can

[Chorus]
I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can
I said I bet you cant walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can

[Verse 2]
Now look, you can try and keep up, you probably gonna pass out
Yeah I took your girlfriend and turned her into my mascot
Hometown hero but I'll never pull my mask out
I bet the crowd love me, love me like I hit the last shot
Sometimes your first shot could be your last shot
Just see what I do when the ball get passed out
And my shadow is the only thing I'm fearin'
And if I need to see my idol, I just look up in the mirror
So I'm the one they stand and applaud for
And guess who they goin bring out that award for
I hope they shinnin' up the medal case
Cuz the only thing I'm runnin' from is second place
I'm still hungry, I'm on my second plate
You a little guy, you need some extra weight
Bet everybody call me Big
Go hard or go home, so I'll don't ever see the crib

[Chorus]
I finna win it all
They should put me on a poster
I gotta get it all
They should put me on a poster
Every night I get it all
They should put me on a poster

Yea the game just started but its already over
I bet you could not walk where I ran
Tell the competition catch me if you can</pre>
