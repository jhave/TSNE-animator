Song:   Jugg Season
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in
You street niggas snitching out for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season
I blend in good with the rich and famous
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it
You gotta change groups like you change clothes
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go

[Verse 1]
I don't even think before I make a move
And I never leave the house without the tool
In the streets, nigga, you can win or lose
I got bricks, I got bills, but I don't fuck with you
Word on the street, a lot of niggas talking
I'm a work that jugg ass, I'm a keep on balling
My trap phone, I got all the label calling
Jugg on the other line want a Miami dolphin
Put the label on hoe, now money talking
I talk big money 'cause I'm about status
Street first, rap second, that's just how I call it
And you know I drink that lane like an alcoholic

[Chorus]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in
You street niggas snitching out for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season
I blend in good with the rich and famous
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it
You gotta change groups like you change clothes
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go

[Verse 2]
Them niggas are sneaky, but we're still in
Them niggas are greesy, but we're still working
I grind every day like on steer hurting
I'm in the booth recording a song while my nigga serving
I took a couple niggas out, feel it was all worth
Know I can go like the key on tec, nigga feel it
Pour some purple in my cup, I call it purple rain
I gotta watch out for these bitches trying to fuck for fame
I'm trying to find different words for different days
Nigga take fully loaded from a car that changed
You really think I talk to the devil for the fame?
I'm bringing money up in there for everything I claim

[Chorus]
I change a lot of streets, 'cause I got season
Keep it low key, you've got that cocaine in
You street niggas snitching out for no reason
All year round I call it jugg season
I blend in good with the rich and famous
But I will never change the game and I don't claim it
You gotta change groups like you change clothes
They take 'em in illuminati, know I can't go</pre>
