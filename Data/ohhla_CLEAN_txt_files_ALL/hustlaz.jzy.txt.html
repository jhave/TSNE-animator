[Intro]
Melman I see you nigga
Ya, I went And done it, NI
Ya, nigga
Everybody wanna be like Jeezy
Y'all can't be like Jeezy

Look at my watch, look at my wrist
Nuthin' like yo man, he ain't shinin' like this
Nuthin' like yo man, he ain't grindin' like this
And even if he was he ain't fuckin' with cuz
 
[Verse 1]
I come so far from the bottom couldn't even see the top 
Just as soon as a feel the drought, I'm rippin' up every block 
I'm a good hearted crying man with a criminal mind state 
Ain't nobody gave a shit and that's why we grind weight 
My grandma off in the church while I'm in the refrigerator 
In search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes 
She prayin' for better days, I'm prayin' they take this water 
Realest that done this shit put that there on my mother and daughter

[Chorus]
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla. I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla. I won't deny it
My ambitions as a hustla, I won't deny it, I'm a straight hustla. I won't deny it
 
[Verse 2]
It's Mr. Trap or die, yeah you'll remember me 
First album was a classic, them critics weren't feelin' me 
Now as far as award shows, we all know how that goes 
So what's all the doubt about, because he ain't sellin' out 
Because he ain't givin' up, because he don't give a fuck 
Because he ain't changing' up, I guess he ain't lame enough 
And just know I'm savin' up, let you play with my sanity 
Gives a fuck what you think of me, unless you feedin' my family 
Motherfuck all my enemies, one time for my mini me's 
Listen to these niggas, I bet you hear plenty me 
I'm who they pretend to be, the one they pretend to do 
See me I'm a hustla, I do what my hustlaz do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Might not just be the best just know I plan to be 
I refuse to let suckers win but that's just the man in me 
Look it could be the G in me these niggas ain't seein' me 
Unless they seein me in traffic in sumthin' topless and drastic
I say I grind like there's 10 of me I swear to god there's just one of me 
Look I know I ain't there yet just know that I'm gonna be 
I couldn't wait to see the day I could change where my momma stay
I put the B.S. behind me, there's too much money in front of me
