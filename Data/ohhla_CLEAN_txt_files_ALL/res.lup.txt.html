"The international community struggles
To get help into Haiti following
The worst disaster in United Nations history
Amidst the frustration and chaos
Surrounding the humanitarian efforts on the ground
There have been some miraculous rescues"

[Kenna]
Like a phoenix
From its ashes
We will rise
Follow angels
Into heavens
We will rise
Nothing's gonna take you down
We are everlasting now
We are everlasting now, now

[Lupe Fiasco] + (Kenna)
Now I've been shaken
But I'm not broken
I won't be braking
Anytime
I have fallen
But I'm not ruined
I'll keep on moving
Into my
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)

[Lupe Fiasco]
Urgency, emergency among us
Life is in the crisis, tragedy's upon us
And we won't leave you stranded
Rapidly we cometh
To take you out the darkness
Show you where the sun is
Cries from the rubble
Are the voices this is sung with
And those that have stopped singing
We can still hear you under it
Right up out your worrying
Right into the wondrous
Right up off the ground
Right to where the thunder is
And it's where your sisters
And your mothers and your brothers is
Aunties and your friends
and your fathers and your husbads is
Watching with the rest of the world in astonishment
Live from up above, us via news coverage
Seen even more than the misery that happens is
The love, the strength, the history, the passion
The courage of an impoverished people
That the world once abandoned
Shining, infinite everlasting now

[Lupe Fiasco] + (Kenna)
Now I've been shaken
But I'm not broken
I won't be braking
Anytime
I have fallen
But I'm not ruined
I'll keep on moving
Into my
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
Into my resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
Into my resurrection
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
Resurrection
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)
We pray every prayer we know
(Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh)

[Kenna]
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up
We will rise up
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
We will rise up
