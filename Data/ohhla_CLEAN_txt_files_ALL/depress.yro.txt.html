[Yung Ro]
Dear Serenity, I'm sorry I'm just doing what I got to
And this is the truth, your daddy loved you before you saw you
I just wanted you to shine, daddy grew up too hard
With no friends no money, just brought me closer to God
And I can't stop thinking, that I won't live too long
But if you ever miss your papa, just listen to his song
But don't listen to me wrong, understand my love
Critics may judge the way I speak, and classify me as a thug
A nobody loud mouth, who just won't shut up
Full of pain full of love, full of drugs fucked up
What's up, Yung Ro put his life on wax
I ain't no rapper feel my pain, now put some mics on that
You can't disappoint me, I'm a man you a man
But you ain't God and you ain't me, so I don't expect you to understand
I see evil painting pictures, in my head so clear
Voices plotting on my soul, I swear I felt it in my ear
I wanna live a normal life, but dog a nigga doubt it
I done got so use to being high, I can't see a regular life without it
Dear God I'm scared to die, but I'm ready to kick it with you
But I know you will never call me name, until you say I'm through
But until then it's fuck everybody, I love nobody
Call that damn Ro, Rizzo Mr. Nobody
I can't even trust my dogs, cause they don't love me
I try again and again, but somebody always fuck me
They say I'm lucky, you blessed cause God chose you
But I wonder if they had the chance, would they try to switch shoes
Dear God it hurts so bad, when nobody loves you
Sometimes I wish I didn't love em, cause they couldn't hurt me like they do
So look at me full of hate, full of love gone crazy
Just me and my baby, one deep with my 3-80
Niggaz shady, so I been kicking it with nobody lately
Praying for my loved ones, and even the motherfuckers that hate me
I am love I am pain, depressed and hoping
I am anger Yung Ro, I'm a walking emotion

(*talking*)
I see it, in your eyes
You're always waiting, for something bad to happen
You can't trust nobody, you said it yourself you can't relax
You can't hardly, even smile

[B. Booker]
My step-dad never liked me, tried to turn my mom's against me
When I found that out, feel like I had the laws against me
So I went to my room, packed up my things and burnt quickly
Never have I ever, seen myself move so swiftly
A few months passed, the house is different since I'm gone
When I pick up the phone, it's mom's ready for me to come back home
Only 17, my girl a few years older
Both of us young, dealing with these burdens on our shoulders
It's been damn near a year, and life's got cold
Fucking my lady with no rubber, now her stomach's on swoll
Seems like this life I love, has been fucked up since day one
Now on August 24th, I'm expecting a son
My first thought was a baby, gon hit you where it hurt
The first thought of making fast money, was snatching a purse
So that night I dressed up in all black, and did that
Did the crime one deep, cause on yourself you can't rat
Quit school, and on the football team gave up my spot
And took somebody's starting position, hustling on the block
With the thousands I won for, had to do the do
Bought three pounds from my ese partna, and he fronted me two
Now I'm hustling full time, with my mind on my ends
Me and my boo and a soldier, that she carries within
Three days straight sometimes, a week hustling away from home
Baby mama's alone, stressed I'm always gone
But when a nigga finally did, make it back to the pad
I walked up to hug and kiss her, cause I knew she was mad

[Yung Ro]
I done got to the point, where shit don't even affect me no mo'
I use to be a bi-polar child, back in 1994
But time passed mo' problems, and a nigga still standing
After being abused neglected, depressed and abandoned
I was stranded, a live walking loose canon
I use tp pray for the pain to stop, now I only pray for understanding
I'm on some fo' foot prince shit, but it's only been two half my quest
I ain't got time to rest, I'm still here so I know I'm blessed
But I can't help to think about, the ones I love who so selfish
And when they need somebody to talk to, they run to Ro so helpless
And I would go breathless, and hang myself from a tree
Before I do the thangs to y'all, that y'all niggaz done done to me
But nigga fuck it, who said life was 'spose to be fun
A bigger heart than a brain, that's the life of the chosen one
My girl say I worry too much, and I'm always stressing
I swear I seen the pain in her face, when I was gone off X
And I love nobody, because nobody love Ro
And it's M-O-B, with my and my big bro
And you down for life, when you fucking with Yung Ro
Because I'll hit a nigga I love, before a nigga I don't know
And ask for a hoe, she gon get that do'
Or make herself useful, and drive my click to a show
See I could be a pimp, with some thangs that I say to women
But past relationships, got me thinking that I ain't made for women
I'm a walking mess, full of pain inside
Catch myself staring at kids, seeing a part of me that died
Somebody shed a tear for me, cause I ain't got no mo'
Put too much trust in my niggaz, and bad run-in's with hoes
It never fails money and pussy, will help you see the truth
You wanna see how real your niggaz is, then introduce these two
I put that on my T. Lady, I'm a real living witness
But I'm tired of talking to y'all, so get the fuck out my bidness</pre>
