[Violent J's Intro]
I choke... nope... thats wack hold up.  
I stab you with an umbrella, 
then open it cause I'm sick like a diseased Ethiopian
Alright Hold Up!!!! Wait a second listen! 
I peel your cap back with a cannon ball
I buck 'em all fuck 'em all we standin' tall woooo.... 
Three 6 Mafia, Insane Clown Posse, and Twiztid!

[Juicy J]
We used to... we used to.... 
We used to rob for them petty things, like a gold chain
no a motherfuckin pinky ring, now it's cocaine
If you see me on the dope train, I'm the dope man
Cigarettes in muh right hand, ready to make a stain
Old folks scared of eye-gain, at the window pane 
they be lookin' wit a migraine
while I catch a drain and you know it's a fuckin' shame
when you in this game tryin' to sell to a sprung lane
I control ya brain

[DJ Paul]
Now do muh niggas bust glocks fuck wit us Big C 
It's the ¿buggaz? of the boat, bust a trick make 'em bleed
through his neck through his back nigga cover them hoes
ain't no mess goin' be workin' when you twirkin' with some pros
Automatic rep a carrier challange on the barrier, 
hang 'em in the closet kidnap the treasurer, 
bandanas on our face we wilin' out like some cowboys
hoe we need the g's and I'm talkin like NOW BOYS!

Chorus: Gangsta Boo (repeat 2X)

We just anotha crazy click 
Doin whatever to get us wild when we pumped up 
You outta luck bitch I aint gon' lie, put ya guns up
Show 'em who really runnin the streets with the calicos 

[Monoxide Child]
We the click that don't play...
quik to rip ya head off and hand it to Violent J and bury it away 
I'm on a spree killin for free without a conscience
bitches we on a mission to bomb shit!
Twiztid, ICP, with the Triple Six Click
Hoes that pop lip, can eat a dick, or get ya neck slit
I'm havin' these memory relapses of bodies up in the caskets
with no heads Monoxide foolin' wit tha dead!

[Jamie Madrox]
We rollin deep on the lawn with the psychopathic leathers on
You say it's on so come bring it on
We gettin crunk at your funerals treat us like we criminals
We juggalo individuals!!!!!
We just anotha crazy click... ICP, Twiztid, Triple Six!
All up in this bitch and we runnin shit 
We doin drivebys on all y'all wit chainsaws
here I come redefined, rugged and raw!

Chorus

[Violent J]
We just anotha crazy click to fuck around and bury ya 
Takin care of ya we the scrarier than malaria
I walk around your neighborhood like Frankenstein
chokin' anybody I find I'm takin mine

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Ya muthafuckas can't get near it, cause ya fear it
look in my glass eye, I'm sick like Lou Gherig
I don't know Judo but I go "Kheeya!"
I'll fuck you up so bad a wheel chair couldn't see ya!

[Violent J]
Listen... You hear that slut?
That was me! pullin' this stick out ya butt!
I'm a juggalo serial killa, steady screamin' "Fuck y'all!"
I stab bitches wit a chain saw!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We walk around Compton &amp; Watts, beatin' scrubs up
and right in Tim Dog's face I throw the dubs up
we tearin' clubs up down South wit D
.. Three Six y'all.. Twiztid.. and I.C.P.</pre>
