I know you're real high when you hear my voice...
Real high when you hear my voice...
I know you're real high when you hear my voice...

You wanna smoke with us you better bring an ounce
Cuz we get down with a southern bounce
P-Town led the fair where I move the pounds
Now I'm coming and runnin' your city unannounced
So don't get clowned when we come around
We so down to earth that we underground
I'm puffin' on the green while you're smokin' shit brown
Cuffin' to the team compound lock down
I'm aside my krown throwin' strike for the mound
Keep it tight wound like two blood hounds
I'm gettin' so profound we make the haters frown
Got your girl beggin' me to be gagged and bound
Make the world spin round so turn it loud
That danced out, thumped out, mo thug crowd
Started in '96 with the O.C. sound
Now we comin' So Cal
Now we world renowned

Now I'm Johnny Richter that's the king D-Loc
Between Bone Thugs blowin' gangs of smoke
I guarantee you can't out smoke me
We can do it live on cable T.V.
With kings blend dope you choke before you spoke
We toke to call your hope and you still can't cope
With the bubble berry blue you're through
Get your krew tight, shoo get a clue, you belong in the Zoo
Yup, swingin' from a rope eatin' cantaloupe
Or woke in a boat like a frog and croak
Don't get the wrong view, you're all past due
We get the oohs and ahhhs while y'all get the boos
You won't know how I know cuz I put it to a vote
We the greatest smokers that you can quote
Quote for quote let me clear my throat
Been puffin' kings blend bong load al a mode
The neutron bomb, the sticky green
I'm higher than a kite when i hit the scene
Stoners Reekin Havoc ask Kevin Zing
But he'll only reply if it means ching ching

D double dash Loc I'm from O. C.
I still can't see when the smoke hits me
Startin hittin' each hash ki's so I can make ends meet
Defeat the weak matter of my league
I freeze OGs leave me stunned and deceived
I'm freakin' this beat while I'm stoned in the street
While you down on your knees, beggin' oh please
Chillin' in a room hot boxed to the ceilin'
?? the crop cuz we got top billin'
Feelin' high as fuck so the buds fulfillin'
Dealin' then healin' never stoner revealin'
Now my nug buy me E sacks I be killin'
Ran out of paper started usin' ??
Never caught a cold but I always be illin'
Spillin' brew with a view from the ruthless villain

High as a kite got a real funny feelin'
Kings blend dope probably worth about a million
Florescent lights miracle grow
Hydro rock those fans gotta blow
Sittin' low pro on the fog soaked dome
Livin to the party high to the bone
Three months later we's all gettin' stoned
Fillin' up Southern Cali toker zone
Seizin' clones pounds of zones
Cannabis Cup we bringin' it home
To the Golden State where it belong
Kottonmouth king can't bring it home ya'll
