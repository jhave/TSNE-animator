[Intro]
Pine box, box
I would surely, break the lock
I'd jump right in and-and fall asleep, I-I'd fall asleep
Ca-ca-cause you, cause you are, the death of me
Cause you are, the
If you was in a, pine box, box
I would surely, break the lock
I'd jump right in and-and fall asleep, I-I'd fall asleep
Ca-ca-cause you, cause you are, the death of me
Cause you are, the, the, the death of me
You-you, the death of me

[Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin like a suicidal terrorist
We act like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in a matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business
was all I needed, when I got it I was greeted by an alien 
that said last year that she slept with a Canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna has a lady friend
My vice is similar women, love when you're my type
And you're winnin from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel
Sin City, devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance, all cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein read 
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch "Yo' ass too fat, capitalize that"
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we're in the area
Cruisin in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on stand-by when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up, Jeep no doors
All that nigga was missin was Aaliyah...
Felt like, the initiation
A reality livin in the matrix
We talked casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste-makers for the shit we makin
Then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. O.V.O.X.O.
The reason why I'm breathin on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love more than life
but I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight 
was when he said you belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
and bury yourself alive, then I died</pre>
