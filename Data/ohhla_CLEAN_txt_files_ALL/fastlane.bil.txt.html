La da da di.. la da da di.. 
Hey... livin in the fast lane
Drivin fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'
When you pimpin through life
See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey.. there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it commin
Yet he heard the bullet hummin
And he never though of runnin
It's too late for him now layin out on the ground so cold.. so cold
Nothin much to live up to.. damn
It's so far gone.. so gone

Livin in the fast lane
Drivin fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimpin through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinnin
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong.. way too strong
Now shes out in the cold, dying  slow and the spoon still warm

[Jadakiss]
It started when they birthed me
Runnin round stuck in the project now he cant wait to the first come
Little older now and cant wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like tellin is in 
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matchin the car
All white.. slingin all night
So we rapidly spar
Thats what they wanna clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

[Bilal]

Livin in the fast lane
Drivin fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimpin through life
.. got caught up
And some charges brought up
From some people you shoot up</pre>
