[Intro/Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk (Yeah hoe!)
...
Yeah~! I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk (Yeah hoe!)
And there's no talkin back when my gun talk (Yeah hoe!)

[Lil Wayne]
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
Uhh - fuck that nigga, hoe ass nigga
Leave that nigga with a toe tag nigga
Barrel so long, you can pole dance nigga
Run up in your house where the dope at nigga?
"Murder She Wrote" on a notepad nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me nigga
Don't open up yo' fuckin mouth cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth nigga
Shoot 'em up, then leave nigga, I smell Summer's Eve nigga
We shoot first it's better - to give than receive, nigga!!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Keep that hoe shit over there (Yeah hoe!)
And we don't shoot in the air (Yeah hoe!)
I can't fuck with these niggaz man these niggaz gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun I pull that motherfucker hair
It's like man you can't trust nobody; I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck nigga, don't stunt nigga, don't duck nigga, cause I duck hunt
Bitch rock with me, that Glock with me, that chopper with me, obviously
I'ma empty this motherfucker that's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over; emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips, in the clip, my gun loaded - yours sober
I pull yo' card like a lawn mower, fall back or I'm goin forward
I see you got yo' gun drawn, I send you back to the drawin board
Lil Tunechi!

[Chorus] - second half with overlapping samples

[Gudda Gudda]
(Yeah!!) Walkin round this muh'fucker limpin
Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scotty Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and I'm bodyin the witness
Huh, real niggaz don't talk much, do driveby's and walk ups
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw - star struck
I don't fuck with the lame niggaz, I got good aim nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nick name is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga, Eastside I rep that
Pussy niggaz better get right or where I see you you get left at (Yeah hoe!)
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk {*boom*} Gudda! (Yeah hoe!)

I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk (Yeah hoe!)
And there's no talkin back when it go off (Yeah hoe!)
I'm strapped up, nigga fuck a gun law (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
I don't do no arguin, I let the gun talk (Yeah hoe!)

[Lil Wayne]
Speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless, speechless
When I cock back - speechless
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
See me walkin with a limp, that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
That's my gun walk, nigga that's my gun walk (Yeah hoe!)
(Yeah hoe!) (Yeah hoe!) (Yeah hoe!) (Yeah hoe!)
(Yeah hoe!) (Yeah hoe!)</pre>
