[Lord Finesse]
Check it out, for those that know me
Ya wonder why I always play low key
I know I got people and fans that like me
But all the noise and attention don't excite me
So I just lounge and play the D.L
In the crib with just me and a female
I'm still slick besides the others
Cause a player like me
Yo, I'm smoother than the Isley Brothers
When I'm on the scene I get feedback
Brothers runnin up, wassup, where you be at?
I be by myself just coolin
Cause I don't have time to sweat what someone else is doin
Cause their not equal to me
I got places to go, money to make, people to see
What'cha gonna do
The man is comin through
(You got it goin on)
Hey yo, that ain't nothin new
But my fame is stressin others
So you always got some that always wanna test a brother
But I'm wildin at home kid
I'm straight makin papes, so tell me what ya problem is
Ya talk about unity, but when I turn my back
You talkin about what ya wanna do to me
Yeah, you could keep riffin
I ain't the one, I sent ya home with ya teeth missin
So stop runnin at the mouth
Straight up and down
You, you know what I'm about

Knockin brothers off
Knockin brohters out (3X)
Yo, you know what I'm about(repeat all 2X)

[Lord Finesse]
I'm out to get dough
Makin brothers petro
Some suckas don't like me
But I could care less though
Cause I'm a command y'all
I'm smackin' brothers up like Puerto Ricans play handball
But I ain't the funny type that joke around, huh
I gotta get my money right
And I got the right game
I'm definetely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin head cracks, trips
And makin all the brothers mad at me
They might as well give up
The way I'm takin all the dough, this might as well be a stick up
Cause it's a mans thing
The way I got things sold
Yo, they can't do a damn thing
Tryin to gain props
I ain't the one to see
Ya clowns mess around and get played like a drum machine
You gotta find a better way
I'm pullin everything from your car to your resume
Cause I don't play clown
I'm tryin to get mine 
That's why my face stay frown
I don't smile or try to play my foul
I light your boys like ?tile?
Hey yo, you know my style
So just slow down, cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a brothers makin dough now
And I'm livin better, true
I makin more noise than the loudest heavy metal group
It's the cool man, brother with the smooth plan
That's why I'm seeing more papers than a newstand
So peep it, don't try to run and speak it
Point blank that keep my way about secret
While brothers is packin still, actin ill
I'm on the D.L, with a female
And I'm stackin bills
How ya livin?  Yeah I'm livin swell
Cause a brother like me 
Yo I'm ringin bells
No doubt, I got clout
Ain't no future in frontin
Yo, you know what I'm about 

Knockin brothers off
Knockin brothers out (3X)
Yo, you know what I'm about(repeat all 2X)</pre>
