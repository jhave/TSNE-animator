[Black Milk]
Ayo
Long awaited, Debated
But fuck it here we are brah
Here to save the game just like memory card
Memory loss to cali dro
to Amsterdam, out on the patio
Rockin like a Beatle I should record up in Abbey Road
Bet he flow talkin that
Hoodrich, money talk
Hoodrich, Black male
With music thats always in the hood like crack sales
Or out in the burbs like E pills
He feels niggas can't fuck with him
Shows, plenty fans round the globe screamin out you niggas can't fuck with him
(yep yep)
Hit 'em with that new shit
Hittin off a new chick
That want me in her mouth like a toothpick
Who flips better heat? See this shits timeless
While ya'll niggas got bad timing like teen pregnancies
Better be, Better see
we comin with better heat

[Danny Brown]
Sittin on some Kobe's
Smoking on a stogie
Bangin Noreaga
When I'm done I lite the bogie (what, what)
40 on the floor mat a leave ya holey moley
Banana in her tailpipe a make her Axel Foley
Eatin on perogies
Goose mixed with Sobe
Smokin on a OZ
Pimpin like a O.G.
If u never knew me then u prolly never know me
Blade on me homey mask on like Shinobi
Ball so hard, gotta MVP trophy
Blow so much kush I forget the hoes that blow me
Thick white bitch slurp a nigga like Kirby
Hoes on a nigga and they all look thirsty
Say they 19 and they all look 30
Everyday clean yall always dirty
Chronic coming in same bag as a turkey
Dark color purple and its tasting like Hershey</pre>
