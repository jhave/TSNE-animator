[50 Cent]
Ga ga G-Unit! (body) haha, yo, yo

I need no introduction, everybody (body)
Heard of 50 Cent, and heard of G-Unit
I'm not Hi-Tek and I'm not Kweli (Kweli) - you see me in the club
You better tell the bouncers to treat me special, I'm somebody (body)
Cause I get on that jet, in 5 minutes flat
Niggaz'll come back, shoot up your party (party)
If I don't have fun, nobody havin' none
I'm tryin' to holla at ya, come here shorty (shorty)
Shout out to my nigga Juvie, Wacko's here
Buck, my niggaz from New Orleans, wodie (wodie)
If we on the same page, when you see me on stage
You gonna throw your hands up, and you gonna applaud me (plaud me)
You know how I get, I'm still on that bullshit, nigga, nigga

[Tony Yayo]
I run around with the trey (body) pound like its a sport
And call my name in the bench, while I sit in court
I got a million dollar smile (body), and a fist full of pesos
And the wrist so icey, it could light up a stage show
In the club (body), nigga I stay holdin'
Cause I'm on point for them wolves, and sheep clothin'
I play the bar (body), with a double shot of Henny
Cause after this spot, its cheaters, and envy
(Shorty if you feel a nigga, call me) (body)

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, Banks, yeah
Look you ain't got to like me, that's (body) cool, I don't give a fuck
Clowny time ain't gonna put me in a bigger truck
Fuck kids, it (body) ain't my turn to be stressed
A bitch worse nightmare is a paternity test
I'm too young to be faithful (body)
If money means love, I hate you
I only trick on the first of April
Holla at me, if you thugged (body) out shorty ready to fight you
Dice, roll a blunt, and pull the snub out for me
And if your not don't even (body) call me

(*gun shot fired, yelling*)</pre>
