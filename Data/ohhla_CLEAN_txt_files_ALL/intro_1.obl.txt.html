{"Hey if y'all wanna hear that shit let me hear some noise!"}

{"What you know about the Subterraneous?"}
{"I don't hear none of y'all sayin"}
{"One, two, three, SCREAM!"}

(Hey if y'all wanna hear that shit let me hear some noise!)
  Sounds Of Nahshid Originate Good Rhymes And Music
(Hey Lo, hey Lo, is that good enough for you?)
(Ey, hold on, hold on, hold on!)

[One.Be.Lo]
This apple's hard to the core, this ain't about metaphors
Given the spiritual war, we all a part of it
So much emotion inside, I spit with passion and pride
Feel the rhythms I ride?  I put my heart in it (I put my soul in it)
Originality grace, my personality traits
nourish reality based, see how my world turns
Sets anybody in weeks, I practice first what I preach
Experience what I teach, you gotta live and learn
And for the hip-hop addicts, another Sub classic!

  Sounds Of Nahshid Originate Good Rhymes And Music
(So one more time, make some noise!)
  Sounds Of Nahshid Originate Good Rhymes And Music
{*crowd cheering*}
  Sounds Of Nahshid Originate Good Rhymes And Music
  Sounds Of Nahshid Originate Good Rhymes And Music!

(Where the beat go?)

[One.Be.Lo]
Yo, it's time to open your ears, the wait is over it's here
I'm takin over this year, don't even try to stop it
Bangin beat through the chest, it's One.Be.Lo in effect
It's "S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M." in your deck, let's get the party started</pre>
