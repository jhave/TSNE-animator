[Intro] (Sample):
Ha ha ha ha ha!!! (Am I a good man?) Yo! (Am I a foold?) Am I a fool y'all

[Verse One]:
Yo! Nigga this nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the facts, the innovations in a state of lax
My click clack tongie attack tracks
Like Rihanna spreads gonorrhea, Chris Brown beats the blacks on her peeper
Give me freedom of speech to speak ether
That'll send these MC's to meet Aaliyah
Free my flow fever my soul seeker
Little more they T-Pain and Wayne in my speaker
My brain's in bleechers, thinkin with the fans 
Reks defeats his stretch like Lil' Kim's features
Or Superhead's cheek, for the rappers that are weak
All these rappers over beats scary as jeepers creepers
Jesus piece took 'cause you look hard
But shook his knees like Yung Berg or Bow Wow divas
Nigga this nigga that 
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the truth, when Reks in the booth
Freedom is met and necessary hourly for you
Bewary when R. Kelly in the buildin
He peein on the chil'ren, peein on the chil'ren
Nigga this nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
You are now in tuned to the facts, Reks the black Aristotle
With bottles of beer in the backpack
I follow the cheers of the stairs to the stage 
Had it up to here with the ways
Where Cool Kids turn to men in days
These fuckin hipsters spits are fakes, and tight pants for girls or gays
Mama I chew when your son spit rage
Y'all still slaves tryin to be Free like 106 chicks suckin Jay
Make you gargle grenades, covered in semen from Aids
Cover razor blades in your lemonade
Y'all are Flavor Flav, hypin but your, writin fugaze
My mic shall ignite a blaze
Simon say, shoot yourself in the face
Fuckin disgrace!!! Uh huh uh huh!!!
Nigga this nigga that, check, yo!

[Verse Two]:
Nigga this nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
Someone tell these dudes to rap
Over Statik Seleck beats I'm too deep to be dumb to fact
I come from the tracks where they slumber and slackin 
Reks suggest you shut your motherfuckin trap
'Cause you don't rap you advertisin
Clothin lines and since when is that dope rhymin
You screamin no homo, but that's so homo
Such a no no please swallow the fo' fo'
Someone tell Kanye West to keep his clothes on
And if Wayne E.T. ish than tell him phone home
Nigga this nigga that
A nigga rap circles 'round the map rap circles 'round these rap cats
With they slave mind state fact
Their crime rates increasin police policin Diddy's and 50's
Inner city gang where you chase American dreams
It's where you get chased by badge and the high beams
My dreams to awake and find fiends
Dressed in three piece suits, addicts livin they life clean
But I mean, this ain't 'gon happen be happy it seems
We free dumb, um, I mean
Not to disrespect teens who chase black cream
But black cream bloody from the backs of black teens 
Like Emmitt 'til we get it we sing, we sing, we sing.....

(Sample/Outro): 
Am I a good man? Am I a fool?
Am I a good man? Am I a fool?
