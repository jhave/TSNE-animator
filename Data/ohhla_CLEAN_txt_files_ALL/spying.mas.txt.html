[Horace Andy]
You live in the city
You stay by yourself
You a-find all weakness
Still some people they brand you ya
Just because you are rasta
You move to the country
You live in the hills
You a-find all company
When you check it them-a use spying glass
They want to know all your business

You live in the city
You mind your own business
What you see you don't see
But some people they always see
They never mind their own business
You move to the country
You live in the hills
You think you're far from the weak
When you check it them-a use spying glass
They want to know rasta business

Spying Glass!
Spying Glass!
