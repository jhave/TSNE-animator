[Hook] (Too Short)
I, I only see em' on the late night creep
And I, fuck her good and never fall asleep
Cause I, I'm just a big ol' pimp I run, so deep
And its alright, she opened up cause I don't have the key
(Take your clothes of, BIATCH, take your clothes off) la-da-da-la...
(Take your clothes of, BIATCH, take your clothes off)
(Take your clothes of, BIATCH, take your clothes off) la-da-da-la...
(Take your clothes of, BIATCH, take your clothes off)

[Murder One]
Damn, I'm about to smack this
Peepable brown miraculous!, glutious-maximus, shorty is bad as shit!
Little cutie got skills like magic dust, (bling) her throat skills feels fabulous (oh shit)
Nigga mother-fucker feel like this an ambulance
Put a nigga in a coma with some bomb ass head
You mad at me, cause I get it for free you cant, top dolla
Cause you wanna get made, you heard what i said?
Pussy make weak niggas dead
True dat' that's a thang, take two plus bitch, pass it back
I get ass in the Caddillac, Murder One in the house not havin' that
Get freaky wit' me shit I'm bringin' ya back
Oh you lovin' this mack, cause I got your leg shakin' like that
Cause a nigga's straight killin' the cat

[Too Short]
Kill that pussy, make it wet, make it sweat 
Make it wet, eat this dick put in the work and get minimal rich, bitch
I'm all about this money ho, ho money keep comin' you wanna bum some mo'
Yo nigga keep payin' what you want me fo'?
They call me Shorty Pimp, mackin' ho's from here to Flint
I know for a fact it's on again cause I picked her up at 1AM

[Hook]

[Murder One]
Girl, I like the way you shake that thang
Get it girl, make that change
Like the way you pop, drop, stop, say my name
Girl I ain't bout' playin', brown skin with a bow-leg
Head cross on fo'-head, five-eight with her shoes on
She said "I want what you want", now I'm at her home and I'm fuckin on her futon
Like girl let's do some'n, I ain't gone cum you cum 
Homegirl got a true monkey, monkey wanna call that two-some
Come through, with henny and coke, plenty of smoke, plenty of the folks just with me
We ball out pretty, we told on twentie's, we fall out shitty
So if y'all not with me, y'all see me mob with two ho's 
Y'all see em' slob on my knob, mobbin' my bob
Y'all drivin' too close

[Too Short]
I know you from Chi-town, pimp her
Break a bitch and lie down in her
Make a little church girl a sinner
Dont worry im finna', put her in a skirt and send her to work
Big pimpin' on the turf, she better use it til' it hurts
Put the money in her bra and not her purse
Bitch, make that cocky glass then panties always drop fast
Dont ever stuff that ass, just hit me when you got my cash

[Hook]
