[Chorus: singer repeats 2X]
I can do you, do you, better better better than he can, baby baby

[Fat Joe - over Chorus]
Yeah, uhh, it's Cook
The voice is so floetry, it's so magnetic
Hahahaha, aowwwwwww, Al. B Sure attracts the ladies
Seriously, uh, yo - aowwwwww

[Fat Joe]
I don't usually do this, but I
had to push upon you, excuse if I stutter
D-d-d-DAMN, it gets no better
I'm pretty sure you heard it flies no matter the weather
Got a girl, you got a man, this'll be our secret
He plays for the Heat, well that's so convenient
I'm at the games all the time
While your man runs games, it's a shame how he lies
I can lend a little more than a earful
I know ma, you're more than a Dior and a hairdo
Yes, furthermore let me prepare you
Now get it on the floor ma, don't mean to scare you
But I'ma, punish that, then run it back
'Til the sun come up, you screamin let us Crack
Now how you do that, that thing when you do that
Ma if I could sing, I would whisper to you that

[Chorus]

[over Chorus]
Oh yeah?  C'mere pretty girl let me talk to you
Oh what?  You just got off the phone with who?
With Crack?  C'mete pretty girl let me talk to you real fast
Daaaamn!

Damnit baby, let me talk to ya

A nigga like me gotta be in your life

You're lookin kind of... welll, lookin kind of right

Sprinkled with some Beyonce, a little bit of Janet Jackson

Man I don't know why they made 'em like that but

Hop on your good foot, let's get into somethin
