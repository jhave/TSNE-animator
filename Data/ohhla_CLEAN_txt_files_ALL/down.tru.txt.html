Yo we ridin' dirty, you don't know me bitch 

Chorus: 

Silkk and Mercedes together 
Mercedes, Tru niggaz down and dirty 
(repeat 2X) 

[Silkk] 
Watch your back when I be ridin 
Cause I'm known to get down and dirty 
Or should I say I'm bout it, bout it! 

[Silkk] 
See I'm, always sulkin like a bad kid 
AK's under the mattress, automatic for static 
Watch your back when I ride 
Cuz I, roll with the tech and blastin will be uncivilized 
Hat, like y'all niggaz heard me 
I'm known to get down and fuckin dirty 
Y'all bustas just ain't worthy 
I live loose adn live frightless 
I'm in a crowded room, cut the lights off, turn em back on 
I got everybody's rings and necklace 
Check check this, hop on the block, nigga 
Stop, nigga out my mind, thinkin like a glock nigga 
It's a risky business, ask Boz he'll tell ya 
Ask P, he'll tell you niggaz, six deep is how us G's ride 
On some gangsta shit 
I'm down to kickin your fuckin door 
But I'll spray this shit, y'all ain't feelin 
I'm doin it for a meal 
Stop pause for a sec, I'm ridin dirty, guard your grill 

Chorus 4X 

[Silkk] 
I'm on some Beamer 740 shit, crazy retarded shit 
Some rum bacardi shit 
When I bust, niggaz run, cuz they know, I hardly miss 
Potnas be trippin ever since I first made it 
I'm bad like a first grader 
Face like a eight grader 
I'm on some shit that'll make the niggaz wanna jump out the game 
I'm down to act bad, dude I got through, to make some change 
By any means me dream is on the triple beam 
Schemes twice a week to get my money of my cream 
Y'all bitches ain't feelin, how I do it, how I won it 
If you did it, I done done it, dope I count less than hundred 
Got one of my block retaliatin, till we all fall 
I'm out the supersport, bumpin, dumpin on all y'all 

Chorus 4X 

[C-Murder] 
Nigga, I'm ridin dirty, like U.G.K. homes 
If you can't respect the fact that I'm strapped, keep your ass at home 
I'd rather be in the pen, more than the motherfuckin grave 
And have my picture on the news, instead of the motherfuckin front page 
I'm TRU nigga! so act like me to the fullest 
I gots my finger on this trigga, and you know I'm ready to pull it 
C and Silkk, commenced to bustin and that ass 
Don't try to play me boy, we leave you layin up in a body bag 
With P dog, the colonel of No Limit 
That's my label bitch, so I gots to represent it 
Like, Martin Luther King, I gotta dream 
To be a, multi-millionaire, make hits and stack cream 
With TRU tatooed on my back and my arm 
Don't bury me a G, cause I plan to live long 
Much love to my homes, dead and in the bushes 
Reminiscin, pour our 40's, and smoke mad Swishers 
Straight out the gutter, like G-blood 
Silkk, C-Murder, TRU, down and dirty 
We run this motherfucker </pre>
