Song:   Set it Off
Typed by: kurtkreuger@yahoo.com

All I can give won't live up to their lives, up to their lives
And why do I grow so slow?
Is it part of me, the very heart of me?
Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right
Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right

She stands in front of the signs that tell me which way to go
She tries her best to decide through the arrows
Feet are cold cause her soul is so hurt
She unfolds her self worth
Holds the whole earth on shoulders
Tornadoes of fashion with passion
Attached to the back of the tag she can feel
Feel the drag of the eyes staring her down
Staring her down

Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right
Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right

Bags in her hands as she cries all night
It can be hard when you try to fight
Water so deep that you can't see sky
Don't be afraid, girl, just climb on high
Set it off, set it off right
Set it off, set it off right

In the cold amber of a distant street light
We stood slow in the mist, no sun or moonlight
The traffic passed fast, and we merged with the dark
And lost ourselves, and lost ourselves
In harmony and yet out of tune
The single red rose in her hand began to bloom
The trees down the way they swayed and swoon
We found ourselves, we found ourselves
I carefully asked her where she planned to go
She turned away said she didn't know
I said, "I know you think you got something to prove
But love, you can't be guided if you don't move"
I felt she understood, even though she didn't speak
Then I saw a single tear roll slowly down her cheek
I brushed soft curls aside and wiped away the tear
I wished to God I could have wiped away the fear

Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right
Don't waste your time
Set it off, set it off right

(repeating)
When the swords flash, go forward
When the shafts fly, press onward
When the swords flash, go forward
O Thou sacrifice of the worlds, now</pre>
