Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Never jealous 'cause once we're gone
Never leave here til it's done
Be really the greatest of all
Do it well but not enough

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

[Verse 1]
Knock knock  who's there?
The one, remember me?
I'm lookin kinda different these days, don't you agree?
Your boy's going big these days, didn't even see?
The hell with the devil, there's no sympathy
The wishes in my past are still ridin me
All I can do is laugh as they lie to me
You can't take my God from inside of me
Crosses up, light up the sky with me
I got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
Like what's the real reason that the pope resigned?
I got Van Halen, I don't need a bassline
I knew we can do it, it was just a matter of time
Put the axels back on the street and break on the vine
I came back to take back everything that was mine
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

[Verse 2]
I'm on a hacksaw tour, Eddie got a Frankenstein aimed at your door
Speakers under the stage, lift you off of the floor
Why? This music is the end to the war
We endure, cameras everywhere, everyone is keeping score
Everybody talkin bout what's up bout the tour
The world is a steak, I'm a chew it up raw
We're back in heavy metal like we above the law
London, Japan, Germany and France
Lisbon to New York, we're live up in Netherlands
Jump up on some shoulders baby, you never dance
You only live once, come on, here's your chance
You could be reborn, half star, half man
If you rise up and grab my hand
If I live to be 1-0-9 I'm still in my prime
If I don't then I don't, I'll live on in your mind

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world

[Bridge]
Eddie Van Halen
We are the greatest
Rise up!

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh, mama we made it, aye
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world
Oh oh oh, I told you we'd make it
Oh oh oh, we're finally the greatest of the world</pre>
