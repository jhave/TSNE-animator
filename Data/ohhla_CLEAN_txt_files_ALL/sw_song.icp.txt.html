Southwest Song

"Good people sometimes think bad things
Good people dream bad things, don't you
Good people even do bad things
Once in a while, we do" 

[Violent J]
Factory smoke and choke in pain
Cuz Del Ray funk is in my brain
So I break the law but I'm not to blame
You only know my place, you don't know my name

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Well, I grip the fence and bent the steal
And I steal a car and I grip the wheel
And I park the car then I steal it again
Cuz I really don't know what's happening

[Violent J]
I wait for night to fall then I walk outside
And then I run back in cuz I don't wanna die
You see, the air alone, it can corrupt your brain
As smoke fills the sky enough to block the rain

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And I pray to God to help me justify
Look over me cuz my brain is fried
And I don't have a name, I don't have a home
I just lay alone on my bed of stone

[Violent J]
You see, death awaits me on my narrow path
And when I stop to think I can only laugh
Because I'm not alone, it didn't take me long
To see everybody singing that southwest song

[Chorus (2x)]
Wooooooo Oh We-oh
Everybody singing that southwest song

[Violent J]
Some say I'm real and some say I'm fake
But I really don't care cuz it's all too late
You see, my mind is weak and I'm losing breath
As I crawl along I can feel the death

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Everywhere I go I bring with me pride
And then I pay the carny and I take a ride
But see, the wheel is wicked and it spins me death
So I try it again with what pride is left

[Violent J]
If we have to go then you can take me fast
You see, I started under and I'm sinking fast
And when the joker's card is missing from your deck
Then you know the road has finally caught my neck

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Eh, yo, don't look, now, there we go again
It's me and the grim reaper, best of friends
He's always hanging round waitin for me to die
We shot a game of pool, he's not a bad guy

[Violent J]
I feel him in the corner of a circled room
At about thirteen in the afternoon
And then I see the strain as I walk along
I notice everybody singing that southwest song

[Chorus (2x)]

What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry...
What does seem bad to you?
I'm angry...
Everybody singing that southwest song

[Violent J]
If my time has come, then I'm ready to go
Shoot me in the face with your forty-four
And when I'm falling down to my soury death
I'll laugh with my very last breath (hahaha)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Lose some, win some, that's how it goes
I've been down and out, I took many blows
And there ain't nothing here I ain't seen before
I'm just a jugglin juggla jugglin more

[Violent J]
You wanna see the world, you wanna run the town
You wanna meet a girl and wanna settle down
You wanna start a family and ya own a home
I wanna run with a set from the ghetto zone

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
You see the forks up, I see the forks down
But I'm a wicked clown, so don't fuck around
Cuz my brain is gone and it's on it's way
I'm exploding, so get off me, dog!!!

[Violent J]
And I could be right and I could be wrong
And if I ain't dead now then it won't be long
But it does not matter what set you on
Tonight everybody sings that southwest song

[Chorus (6x)]

"What seems bad to you?
Is hitting other kids?"</pre>
