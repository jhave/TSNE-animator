[Intro: Bizzy]
Man I could never be anti any-fuckin-thing man
I ain't even gon' lie to you man
Live and direct from the motherfuckin battle station
I mean, how in the fuck, you gon' see somethin beautiful
Youknowmsayin, to the eye to the heart to the mind to the soul
And I really understand what you lookin at
Praise God for ev-erything
There is only one true God
and you need to get those wicked members up off of him...
(Come to us, tell me what'cha say love, tell me what'cha sayin)

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Only him to come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin love, tell me what'cha sayin
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Come to us, come to us
Tell me what'cha sayin love, tell me what'cha sayin
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
When you come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin love
Tell me what'cha sayin, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what'cha sayin
Come to us, come to us, tell me what'cha sayin love
Tell me what'cha sayin, tell me what, tell me what, tell me what
Tell me what, just come to us

[Bizzy Bone]
Walk through the valley, of the shadow of death, flesh and blood
Evil keep questionin us, we bust, lay back in the cut
Sinister minded blinded, soon as they find it tossed in diamonds
Nibble that tree of science and they think that they laughin at Bryon
Better know that they gon' keep on tryin
And whatever they think that they sellin there won't be no buyin
from Earth, to planet Orion
From birth, I twist in the stomach from hella spices like cheyenne
Quick, hit 'em with trifectas, the fruit of bad nectars dyin
Cause I am, what I am changed, switch it up like OutKast
Everybody thought that Andre was crazy, he get a bypass?
Time trickle like hourglass, who ready to ride?
What? Quit snitchin, I know that it's cold outside
And whether we're cold or not, killin though we bold outside
I'd rather not take a bath, if feelin all dirty inside
But it's pretty inside, look at all them girlies inside
So what, we here in a mission and our mission ain't blind
For all of that wicked wisdom they put in our minds
Go to Akron without a map, walk the streets, look for the rabbi
While sippin on this mai-tai
Talk to religious figures while lookin in at the skyline
I worship no gravin image it's bye-bye
God go where he wanna go, let you know what he wants you to know
You know, how Jesus role, yo' heart, yo' mind, yo' soul
Talkin to the scriptures where all of the saints will see to that
Weeded up, but of course my people, they don't believe in that
Leanin back, demons in a dream and holdin my semen back
Salty like Sodom watchin Gamorra, check yo' almanac
Never had no friends and if I did will they left
They so scared, for who to be crucified, soon gon' lose yo' breath
Yep, get up get out since you got doubt, lumpy potatoes that's on the couch
Feelin offended, speak your mouth (mouth)

[Outro: Bizzy]
They don't want none
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit amen
In the name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ amen
It's only one true God in full effect
That's how we do this shit, wreck shop
No adultery baby only one, only one
Togetherness, huh, huh
Only one, only one, only one
Yea, yea, yea, yea, no adultery watch yourself
They comin at you, they comin at you fast
That's the POLICE right there baby
They comin at you fast

[Chorus]</pre>
