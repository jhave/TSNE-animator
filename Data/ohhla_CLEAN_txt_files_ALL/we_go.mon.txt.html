[Intro]
Yeah
It's time for the smoke and mirrors to come down
Niggaz be talkin', but they don't be livin' that shit
A whole lotta deception goin' on it the world
It's Original Bad Boy Gang, nigga
Check this out
Click, clack
Bang, bang

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Diamond Range Rover
Chains like a dope dealer
Fourth quarter player
Three quarter chinchilla
Gold chains, golden boy
Front row sitter
Niggaz buyin' cars, we buy the whole dealer
We buy the whole plane
While them hoes playin' with 'em
100 chains, all the bad hoes came with us
Shawty held me down when the people on it
Ghostface, right hand, eagle on it
My brother [?] with the motherload
And I ain't fuckin' undercover with them cover hoes
Talkin' 100 chains on, cold dealer
Montana, write your name on the smoke and mirrors

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
If the money ain't the issue I
I don't subscribe
If the money ain't the reason
Well then the question is why
Get money with my people
Then we never divide
It's for the love and the money
Make her love stay real
And the money multiply
Them niggaz can't go where we go
They can't get dough like we do
Them niggaz can't smoke like we smoke
Them niggaz can't go where we go
Cause we go wherever we want

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I skip prayers just to make money
I hope God forgive me, man
I was hungry
I'm tryin' clear my thoughts and [?]
Aplle red Porsche, army guns, air force
Tryna count bills in the sunny hills
Balenciagas, make more than doctors
My crib bigger than your school, nigga
I'm just skiing in the pool, nigga
10 mil just to settle, nigga
Dead-ass like [?], nigga
I done started from the block, boy
Now me and Ne-Yo on the top, boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Ayo, that's me kid
Words produce
Harry Winston under the goose
Half moon, the wave's exclusive
Catch me uptown shopping in a [?]
Watch cost 1.5, I got the blue shit
Everybody love me
His texture's automatic money
Independent drug game dummy
Gettin' his, raisin' kids
These are big boy scholars
Flash money like Floyd
Got the big gold wallet
Roll out, it's 40 of us frontin' a bus
That's the new stretch bubble
Pipe the color of crust
Gettin' high, chillin' fly, yellin' [?]
Now I'm in hard bottoms
Larry King, suspenders and bow tie

[Chorus]</pre>
