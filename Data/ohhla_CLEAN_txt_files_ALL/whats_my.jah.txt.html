Uhh (startin with Ashanti - owwwwwtch!)

[Chorus: Ashanti] + (Ja)
J-A-R (yeah) U-L-E (what, let 'em know)
(Who else you thought it would beeeee)
(All my bitches with me say)

(Who'da thought this wouldn't, beeeee)
(Everybody with me say)

[Ja Rule]
Holla!!  I'm back
Anyone with good sense bet on that
Cause I ain't never went nowhere, I still got business here
All my bitches get your hands in the air
Now BACK THAT ASS, UP ON ME - now let's roll
Go, goin, gone, sold
What's cooler than bein cool? (ICE COLD) Y'all know
that I do this for all my niggaz and my bitches
And it's murder 'til day that I die, can't spit it no more
All my niggaz that tusslin, get yours
All my bitches that's makin money, get yours
The world ain't only mine, it's yours
And I'm sure
That, there's no love if you don't go through pain
And I'm the nigga that done changed the game
What's my name?

[Chorus] w/ minor changes to Ja ad libs

[Ja Rule]
Who's that nigga?
If you feelin yourself youse that nigga, tryin to get hit up
Buried in cat litter cause that's how INC get up
Makin sure they don't get up, it's murder
Who's that bitch?
If you feelin yourself youse that bitch, tryin to get rich
Dyin to get hitched to a nigga that's caked up
Willin to spend time and even more at Jacob
But you assume position, face down, ass up
And I think I got you in that same pose pinned up
In a picture painted frame been hangin love
Ass naked, lookin like you're high on drugs
And that's whassup, what, all bitch niggaz is gettin touched
And no bad bitches is gettin fucked
Cause you know who, did you know what, if you know what's
Then you know it's not a game, what's my name?

[Chorus] w/ minor changes to Ja ad libs

[Ja Rule] + (Ashanti)
Ba-by girl, is you with me? Shit (yes sir!)
Sayin all of that without speakin a word
(I like) to do this that and a third
(And I love) the way you put in reverse
And now clap for me mami, clap back, keep it swervin
Wide body had to be built by suburban
Niggaz around lookin like they nervous, I see 'em
Niggaz around me wanna rob him and leave him
But I'm partyin tonight for one reason
Niggaz know that the bullshit was dead on the streets
Niggaz I'm gettin high, gettin head as we speak
Long live the great ones, B.I.G, P.A.C.
I'm "Ready to Die," "All Eyez on Me"
And niggaz know they can do it the same
But still they try to diss, that's part of the game
What's my name?

[Chorus] w/ same as before

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah
Murder INC, all my family we here
Big shout to all my niggaz
All my crud niggaz, all my street niggaz, all my grime niggaz
All my industry niggaz, all my corporate niggaz
It's love, it's pain, and we together mayn
Holla back at me, uhh</pre>
