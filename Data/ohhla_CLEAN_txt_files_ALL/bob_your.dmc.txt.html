	Bob your head.. (2X)

[D.M.C.]
As we bop on..
to the break of dawn..
the non-stop hip-hop bop..
takes you on down..
to the last, STOP!!		"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."
So won't ya bob your head..	"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."
B-b-ba bob your head..		"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."

[Run]
A freak I find the kind to wine and dine
I freak a blind date, and your fate is to wait in line
at the party.. tryin to get a hottie
Cool T and Roddy, D.M.C. and Scottie
Big Kev and Marty, Hurricane and Arty
Phil, Doug, and Naughty - damn, a big party
So I grab the mic, I like, recite, the hype
and type, and write, with my..
freak it 'fore the niggy night is done
for Ricky-Run to get dumb and then some
So while you're here, it's clear to every per-son
ah that you need to bob get involved
and weave with ease and please the steez with G's
Now, just to be at ease
cause this is it, legit, a hit, I throw a fit
Not slackin or lackin a bit, nah that ain't it
So just a bob ya head, like I said, the fresh it
So just a bob ya head..		"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."

[D.M.C.]
Bob your head!			"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."
				"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."

I make your heads bob, I got you slobbin the knob
So do a good job, why don't ya let me know - HOW YA LIVIN HOBBES?
Whassup wit ya girl?  Ya know I like the way your earrings jang
and your booty swing, ah while my beat go
BOOM BOOM - why don't you let me take you to my room
Take off our shoes relax sit on bed and watch the Looney Tunes
But no!  You want me take you out and wine and dine you
But I ain't got no time to chase behind and never find you
So be this dope a lethal dose of poisonious potion
Stick to the sound that's up and down now sit ya that's the motion
Buckwild inna style for ya honey child
The organization of bobbin and pacin will make you bob a while
Grab a cutie, Duke her Bootee, bust a ?? box
That's my duty, girl please do me, don't try to cockblock
Give nuff respect, I love the sex, again I said..
Here it comes from Run (yo Jay) 'Yo D!' HOE BOB YA HEAD

				"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."
Ah just a bob ya head		..
Bob ya head			"ruff, ruff an' rugged we comin.."
Ah just a bob ya head		..

[Run]
Well I believe you weave and bob the job is done
by Run so come get some for fun
Keep the force I'm nicky-number one
and I'll scratch my vocord for f-f-fun
And nevertheless I must confess that it's a bless-un
that people are ride and must abide to this direct-ion
I triple it up to let you know that I'm a swift one
Those who oppose get broken nose that's how I live son
I move the head that's what I said, this is my miss-ion
I'm dickin em down and all around, to make the head bob
So bend your neck, give nuff respect to me, dance Hobbes
for this is it, the brand new shit, I'd like to mention
so hurry up because the cut is my inven-tion
The jazz, pizazz, with class, at last
kickin your ass, for the past
three and a half minutes, you been in it to win it
So you defin-in-it..-itely need to bob your head
