(1st Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
As I walked through River Rouge, I saw this man
He was covered he was buttered snatched his jewelry and ran
I cought up with Nate and said, "I think It's worth a grand"
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
His hand was going down handed me money so I'm giddy
The fucking snake was cruel, all they gave was $7.50 [What?]
My mamma threw me out I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I haven't eaten, I starve and I call
Saw my teacher Miss Elena up in Weatherton mall
I broke into her Docson, and jumped in the back
And waited for the bitch them put my shank to her neck
She offered her car keys, cried and said, "Please!"
She promised not to tell and give me A's and B's
I said, "I want your money, bitch, and all I can sell" [Now]
I looked into her eyes and she was SCARED AS HELL!
I new she was a snitch, so I cut off her tongue
Got happy with the trigger now I'm on the run, I'm an assassin!

(Chorus 2)
(Chorus 1)

(2nd Verse- Violent J)
My father was a priest, cold-blooded, he's dead
Hypocrite, he was a bigot so I cut off his head
Poured on the holy water, "Bless the dead" is what I said
And heard the demon screaming as his body bled
Now I'm drunk on the freeway, just the other day
I saw a fine hitchiker and I wanted to play
Pulled up to the curb so I can offer a ride
She said, "Thanks," I said, "No thang," and she got inside
Peepin' as I'm creepin', I'm packing an erection
I'm staring with my dick I'm like 'look,' with direction
Made it to her app. she got out and said, "See ya"
"Yo babe like won't you chill and help me kill this 2-liter?"[Baby]
Went into my trailer, I filled up a glass
Before she took a sip I had my dick in her ass
I banged it and banged it, this shit was absurd!
Like she was Sporty Spice and I was some fucking nerd
Then she rolled over and gave me a kiss, and said
"So when am I getting paid?" WHAT BITCH?!?!
First I tried to choke her, she went for the door
And said, "Welcome to the disease there's no cure for"
Bitch, I love you, but now you gotta die
I chased her through the door but she slammed it in my eye
She passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Billy pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Still wanting booty, I went for the hatchet
And screamed at the moon like a sick psychopathic
Choppin' and choppin' they said, "J, WHAT THE FUCK?!"
On the news they found her head stuffed up her butt, what?
I'm an assassin, hahahaha, a motherfucking assassin, eeeaahhhh, AN ASSASSIN!

(Chorus 2)
A fucking assasin
Ah, an assassin
A motherfucking assassin
An assassin
