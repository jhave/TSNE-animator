[Intro: Kanye West] (Lil Wayne)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
I'm cold! (Yeah)
(Yeah)

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cuz you cut up my life
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooooh how'd you'd get there
Cuz we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Kanye West]
I got my life
And it's my only one
I got the night
I'm running from the sun
So good night
I made it out the door, door, door, door,door
After tonight
There will be no return
After tonight
I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And letting you know
LETTING YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Kanye West]
Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you cuz I'm just gon' be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And the night is young
The drinks is cold
The stars is out
I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know

[Chorus Kanye West]
Tell everybody, EVERYBODY that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cuz you cut up my life
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Ooooh how'd you'd get there
Cuz we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

Babygirl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it
And now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stank
but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you
With me no more
Now tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
THAT YOU KNOW
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

L-L-L-L-LETTING YOU KNOW
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW</pre>
