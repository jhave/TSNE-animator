oooh oooh Don't make me call the police
oooh oooh It's a crime the way you bend them knees
From the table to the floor, spin it up and do it slow
Give it up to all my niggaz on the corners spending dough like
Game nothing but money to me
So sweet but you ain't nothing but hunnies to me
Shorty get you sexy dere sipping on the cavasier
Stylin up in the VIP, plannin to roll out with me
Knowing that she's gonna come back
As if shes up on my reindeer
You know that she'll never wanna come back
So I add her to my hall of fame here
Bet your man can't do it like this (tell the truth girl)
Bet your man can't do it like this (its all on you girl)

Come on, When the Time's Right
I'd like to come over and get to kno ya
Try to get closer, (Come on)
When the Time's Right, I'd like to come over
And work ya over, across your sofa
Come on, Is it ok if I come over, Come on
That way I can get to kno ya, Come on
Let me get a little closer, Come on
Do you all over your sofa, Come on

When I walk in the club with all the ladies so fly
Gotta work that body so beautifully make you wanna cry
That body could do whatever, thats no lie
Gotta make it to gettin bigger makin me wanna slide
Up under my apple tree, better yet you on top of me
Switch it over let me bust all over you and not me
Your so sexy, gotta punish you wit the first degree
Ain't no stoppin the body rockin until we fall asleep

Come on, When the Time's Right
I'd like to come over and get to kno ya
Try to get closer, (Come on)
When the Time's Right, I'd like to come over
And work ya over, across your sofa
Come on, Is it ok if I come over, Come on
That way I can get to kno ya, Come on
Let me get a little closer, Come on
Do you all over your sofa, Come on

I can tell by the way you act so hard you like my type of nigger
Better bang in the back of the jeep and put a puncture in your liver
I can tell by the way you act so soft you like my type of nigga
Better get romantic with ya make love to ya by the river
I'm wit the wine glass to go with your fine ass
I could make that shine last if I make you mine fast
Your the type I go all out to put you onto my staff
Let me be your teacher baby girl cause you in the wrong class

Owwwwh, When the Time's Right
I'd like to come over and get to kno ya
Try to get closer, (Come on)
When the Time's Right, I'd like to come over
And work ya over, across your sofa
Come on, Is it ok if I come over, Come on
That way I can get to kno ya, Come on
Let me get a little closer, Come on
Do you all over your sofa, Come on

Hey hey hey, So tell me what the dealy girl, hey hey hey
When I get to go inside you girl, hey hey hey
Remember there is no rush girl, hey hey hey
Gotta get you with tha masta
Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on(repeat till fade)</pre>
