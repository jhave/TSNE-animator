[Chorus: 2X]
Freefallin', when you're shook from the pack
Keep walking, lift a foot, leave a track
We often got to look for the path
These problems are the good ones to have

[Slug]
Nobody want to struggle at home
Bass in his voice, trouble in her tone
What kind of couple makes a puzzle out of stone?
Chopping and popping all of the bubbles that are blown
Nobody want to be wrong
And once the line gets drawn across what we disagree upon
it could be the time bomb that we sleep on
It's just a little one, back and forth like a ping pong
Nobody wants an argument
You try to bargain as a friend
but it's hard to with a star offence against a smart defence
And the history you share is full of scars and dents
Nobody likes breaking up
When you hate the situation but you crave the touch
You might stay in the relationship for the simple sake of it
because you know it's based in love

[Chorus: 2X]

[Slug]
Nobody want to go to work
for some older jerk that doesn't know the dirt
that's embedded in the hearts of those that hurt
Monday through Friday, and Saturdays for bonus perks
Nobody but friends to beast
Just to make ends meet and try to pay rent and eat
Spread sheets by the end of the week
He'd rather spread them sheets than try to get some sleep
Nobody want to lift a crate
That ain't living great, you want a kid and play
You should dip, escape, no two week notification
Show up late and quit today
Nobody wants an awful boss
that got you popping out the top of your mouth as if it's common talk
You ought to wait until you off the clock
and appreciate that fact that you've got a job

[Chorus: 2X]

[Slug]
But somebody want that life you got
They think your boyfriend's nice or your wife is hot
They on your block looking at that home you bought
They'd move in today if that door wasn't locked
Nowadays you ought to watch your spot
Even with all the flaws of that boss you mock
You could still close your eyes and toss a rock
I bet you'd hit someone that'd love to cop your job
That's what I thought, of course you don't stop
You won't take the shot, you can't afford the loss
If you don't want to taste the sauce
then put the plate down and take a walk
Drop, or move away from the pot
cause every time you talk you complain a lot
Don't forget to count the balls y'all caught
Enjoy what you got before it all falls off

[Chorus: 2X]</pre>
