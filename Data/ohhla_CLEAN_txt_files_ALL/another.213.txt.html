A pool party at the church
G'd up and others barbequeing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy
Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
to pop some fireworks with my kids
and fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion

It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Chorus - Latoiya Williams]
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
I love the summer
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see
I love the summer
Everybody if you with me sing

[Nate Dogg]
We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch
I like the girls 'cuz they hot
Plus I know what they want
They want the game that we got
Hold up baby girl I think not
I like the nasty girls from around the way
Hoppin' in my gray drop-top Mercedes
Shouts go out to my sexy ladies
Just in case your man is hating
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
I'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
Tank tops, flip flops, make this nigga love the west
Different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage
It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine
When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world wanna hear our music
The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my nigga Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'

[Snoop Dogg]
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, another summer
Kanye West good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
Well spent summertime, let's enjoy ourselves
We just wanna celebrate
You know what I'm talking about?
It's too hot for all that
Yeah 213
Moving mountains y'all haha
All the time, yeah</pre>
