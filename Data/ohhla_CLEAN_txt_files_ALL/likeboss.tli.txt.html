[Intro]
Mr. Samberg, thanks for coming to your performance review
(No problem) So you're in charge around here
Is that fair to say? (Absolutely, I'm the boss)
Okay! So take us through a day in the life of the boss
Well the first thing I do is...

Direct workflow (like a boss)
My own bathroom (like a boss)

Get rejected (like a boss)
Sallow sadness (like a boss)
Send some faxes (like a boss)

Cry deeply (like a boss)
Demand a refund (like a boss)
Eat a bagel (like a boss)

No promotion (like a boss)
Fifth of vodka (like a boss)
Shit on Debra's desk (like a boss)
Buy a gun (like a boss)
In my mouth (like a boss)
Oh fuck man I can't fucking do it, shit!
Pussy out (like a boss)
Puke on Debra's desk (like a boss)
Jump out the window (like a boss)

Crash into the sun (like a boss)
Now I'm dead (like a boss)

[Outro]
Uh-huh
So that's an average day for you then? (No doubt)
You chop your balls off and die? (Hell yeah)
And I think at uhh one point there
you said something about sucking your own dick (nope)
Actually I'm pretty sure you did (nah that ain't me)
Okay, well this has been eye opening for me (I'm the boss)
Yeah no I got that, you said it about 400 times (I'm the boss)
Yeah yeah I got it! (I'm the boss)
No I heard you, see ya later
