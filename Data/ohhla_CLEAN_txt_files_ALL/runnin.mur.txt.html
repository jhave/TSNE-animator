[Verse 1]:
Look I shot many men many men fear me
Even gangstas when I come around get leary
Like I don't want him near me, that boy schemin
Keep yo' hand on yo' gun be ready to start squeezin
This man said I knoow, let Murda try some'n
These kids feelin themselves they must be high or some'n
Then I step to 'em they like what up son!
I'm like what up mu'fucker y'all see my gun
Then them dudes start stutterin like wh-wh-what you talkin 'bout?
Then we rob these niggas they like wh-wh-what's this all about
My man heard you talkin slick yeah that's what happened
Now we violatin y'all for actin like it can't happen
The jokes on y'all you see all the chicks laughin
Then we take 'em to the back and let my little man's clap 'em
My little man hit him all up in his fitted cap
Told him tell Biggie that Murda's bringin the city back (Bang nigga!!!!)

Tell Queens that Murda's runnin the city now!!!
Tell Harlem that Murda's runnin the city now!!!

[Verse 2]:
I know how it feels to win I know it feels to lose
My Gettin Money Gangstas I run with the realest crew
I do what the killers do, so when I spit at you
I ain't just rappin know why I get at you
I'll hit yo' punk ass up 'fore I hit at you
I know you heard of Murda I ain't shootin and missin dude
They said I'm an animal I'm uncontrollable
I ain't like these rap cats I'll put a hole in you
These streets said the same thing yeah they know it to
That's why they embrace me they know what I'm goin through
People in the hood like Murda you killin 'em
I used to bump they shit but now I ain't feelin 'em
I only bump yo' shit your songs more realler son
You should change your name to Uncle Murda The Killer son
You ain't like Jay you know he that drug dealer son
You that BK boy with that finger on the trigger son
Cause they know it that ego gettin bigger son
But that's aight cause right now you that nigga son
You that new boss you the boss of the East Coast
When I go to L.A. I'm keepin my heat close
You see they made B.I.G. rest in peace y'all
I think somebody reachin that ass is meatloaf
He finito, man, tell Biggie to tell Pac
That the East Coast is back Murda rollin with The ROC
