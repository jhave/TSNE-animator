[Pharrell]
First day of school, guess who?
I would bump, into
the creme de la creme, that's you
But they treat you like, doo doo
So then you had to use, my wit
And think a-bout it
That's when I had to admit
They were right, you're the shit

[Chorus]
I don't care who gets you
I don't care what they don't see
I don't need God to remix you
It's less for them, but mo' for meee~!
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nuttin for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Pharrell]
Let's take it slow, to begin
Don't worry about, the blueprint
Get to know you, then we win
Friends to love, the end
I know it's always, somethin
But they ain't talkin 'bout, nothin
This is my car, jump in
Cinderella, no pumpkin

[Chorus]

[N*E*R*D]
Yeah, why?
Ahh c'mon cheer up baby
You know I make you laugh
Meet Tina Tonya Tracy
We're havin a bubble bath
The girls are blowin bubbles
They naked in the field
The smoke comes out the flowers
Mm-hmm, you know the deal

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Oh you're so perfect, oh don't ignore me girl
Them other girls just service, they do nuttin for me girl
Oh you're so perfect, don't you ignore me girl
Ain't no need to be nervous, this'll workout surely girl

[Chorus]</pre>
