[Intro - Keri Hilson - talking]
One for the paper, two for the money
(My girls get money)
(Oh we gonna give it to 'em now baby, hey!)

You see this what I like to call - buyou music
'Cause you better buy you a car
You better buy you a phone
And you better buy you some where to stay
Or I'm a walk right by you
(Give it to 'em, give it to 'em, go!)

[Verse 1 - Keri Hilson]
I don't know what's goin on baby
What the hell has gone wrong baby?
Used to take me to dinner
Used to take me shoppin, now you askin me for my paper
It's my money, boy my money
I bet you never, ever get another dime from me
No you can't use the phone baby
I think you need to get your own

[Break - Keri Hilson] - w/ ad libs
Was lookin for a man to hold me down
But how'd I end up with you?
Yeah, baby you
And as hard as I try, sometimes it gets hard
Payin all these bills, the note on my car
So I don't need no broke, broke boy tryin to holla (holla)
So baby shut it up 'til you show me dollars, hey

[Chorus - Keri Hilson] - w/ ad libs
One for the paper, two for the money (money)
Brand new bags, new shoes yeah I want it (I want it)
All my girls, fly girls gettin money (money)
All my girls, fly girls gettin money

One for the paper, two for the money (money)
Nails did, hair did, yep, yep I want it (I want it)
One for the paper, two for the money (money)
All my girls, fly girls gettin money

[Verse 2 - Keri Hilson]
You want a ride or die chick baby (yeah)
But you ain't got a whip baby (yeah)
It ain't gon' happen
You don't got shit, you need a walk or die chick baby (yeah)
Yeah, yeah that's funny
Don't look my way if you ain't got that money
And I ain't makin nothin to eat baby (yeah)
I think it's time you treat (you treat), baby

[Break] - w/ ad libs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - J. Cole]
Hey, hey, hey, yeeeeeah, Cole World
I see ya, it's hard not to see ya (damn)
Face like Aaliyah and plus a college degree a
Climbin up the ladder at that full-time job
Tell me how the hell you end up with a full-time slob? (good God)
I mean you been a ride a die for him
Paid for the dinner and the movie and the popcorn
How you figure it's gon' last? He just sit up on his ass
And play that damn Xbox that you copped for him (copped for him)
Buyou, buyou, how much to try you? (hey)
Ain't sayin you for sale but baby let's be for real
Buyou, buyou, shit that I could buy you (hey)
These niggaz all the same, either they can or I you
Stringin you along allow me to untie you
Vitamin D supply you, let them little boys walk by you
They frontin 'cause they broke but the numbers don't lie
If they swear they so fly, tell me why they never fly you?

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Outro - Keri Hilson] - 2X
Get ya own [hell no] (gettin money)
get ya own [hell no] (gettin money)
get ya own [hell no] (gettin money)
I don't need no broke, broke boy tryin to holla</pre>
