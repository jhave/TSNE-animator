[Mannie Fresh]
One saturday night I was looking for some ass
I call shawt and ask her could she pass (come on over)
By the house so we can get it going
Don't act like that bitch, cause I know you hoein
Could you bring your friend, the one that both like
And could we do the chu chu train tonite? (check it out)
Please give me, a big ole bag of weed
Some drink, some rubbers and anything that you need
I'm so high I want you to take this dick
Wear some shit that you can take off quick
Please hurry up, cause I'm so lonnn-ey

Uh uh uh uh uh, one saturday night

It was one saturday, we was on the block
The block was so hot, we had to close up shop
Sarge flat tie it was dry all night
Try to catch them a mother, out dere servin that white
You better respect the people, if you know like I know
Unless you tryin to go do you a no no jose
That's why I'm 'bout to hit the club, and go fuck with them hoes
I don't care if a nigga want ten million foes
I close 'till tomorrow, I'm not servin the gram
I want be the one sargent flat tie slam
With the city off the chain, packing stuff up
My nigga Keith got a freak bitch, he once we tossed up
So we 'bout to jet on out and go hop in our whips
Got our strap one our hip incase a bitch nigga trip
One saturday night

Uh uh uh uh uh, you can fuck her, you can cry

Uh uh uh uh uh, I can't think some shit, ya'll wait a second

[Mannie Fresh talking]
Could see, on saturday night

But if you gon be there, you need to call and let me know
So I can get the fuck up outta there on saturday night

Her head is like bad on saturday night
See what I'm sayin?
Saturday night head, is like best head in the world
On saturday night
