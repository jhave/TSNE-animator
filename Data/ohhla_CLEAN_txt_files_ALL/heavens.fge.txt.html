[Intro/Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
If it was my last day on Earth, treat it like my first
Go out the way I came in
So innocent so pure, with no thoughts of insecurity
Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be
Last day on Earth I tell my momma don't cry
See my daddy in paradise
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk
The crippled can walk, but for nowwww heaven's in New York
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-oh heaven's in New York
Oh-oh-oh-oh... I need a ticket, to New York

[Wyclef Jean]
First thing I'd do is go back in time
Take the Twin Towers put it back in the skyline
Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make it right
Make love for the last time under the candlelight
Pick up my homies, hit the gentleman club
After that hit a pub, reminisce on the high school days
Man I sucked as a quarterback~!
Remember getting sacked man I almost broke my back

[Chorus]

[Wyclef Jean]
Heaven's in New York, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-oh
Heaven's in New York, oh-oh-oh-oh...
I tell the man give the people a tax break
Kids stop shootin I can't sing in no hallways
I can't take the money with me, so I caught a movie
Favorite actress, Angelina Jolie
Favorite singer got to be Marley
Turn up the bass and move to the stylee
I can't go without readin my daughter a bedtime story
The heavens is calling

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Wyclef Jean]
Even though I walk through the valley of shadow of death
I fear no evil, for you are with me
So tell my loved ones please don't cry
Cause if doves can fly... so can I!

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Wyclef Jean]
Heaven's in New York, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-oh
Heaven's in New York, oh-oh-oh-oh...
Yeah, this one goes out to all my refugees
that leave the land where they from, to come to the land of the free
But don't forget once you get that dream
To take it back to your country and give them a piece of that inspiration
CHURCH! I need a ticket, to New York
