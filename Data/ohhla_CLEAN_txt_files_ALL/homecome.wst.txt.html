[Kanye West]
Yeah... and you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!

[Chorus One: Chris Martin]
I'm comin home again
Do you think about me now and then (yeah)
Do you think about me now and thennnnnnn
Cause I'm comin home again (AOWWW)
Co-min, home, a-gain

[Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil' homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and, I like blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggaz come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to to' 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said "'Ye, keep makin that keep makin that platinum and gold for me!"

[Chorus Two: Chris Martin]
I'm comin home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and thennnnnnn
Cause I'm comin home again
Co-min, home, a-gain
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and thennnnnnn
OHHH~! Now I'm comin home again
Maybe we can start again

[Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn'ta never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talkin 'bout me
She said you left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin 'bout what niggaz tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all, wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's, gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back, home
And guess when I heard, when I was back, home
Every interview I'm representin you, makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin 'bout Chi-Town

[Chorus Three: Chris Martin]
I'm comin home again
Do you think about me now and then
Do you think about me now and thennnnnnn
Cause I'm comin home again
Co-min, home, a-gain
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigannnn
OHHH~! Now I'm comin home again
Co-min, home, a-gain
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigannnn
OHHH~! Now I'm comin home again
Maybe we can start again

[Chris Martin]
Low-e-oh-e-oh, low-e-oh-e-oh
Co-min, home, a-gain

Low-e-oh-e-oh, low-e-oh-e-oh
Co-min, home, a-gain

Maybe we can start again</pre>
