Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I have a vision that had to give to subtracted limits
If everything was gone tomorrow who would miss it?
And if I packed my bags and moved away who would visit?
If you knew it you should say who would listen?
Yea I'm talkin' 'bout a new religion
Something to feed off, we search for it like groups of pigeons
Kinda futuristic, yea it's cool, we different
Cause what I do's terrific, I'm just hopin' you could feel it
Yea, so tell me if you can
Are you numb enough? Or can you listen in?
I lose it all to show 'em I'll get rich again
But matter fact fuck that cause I don't give a damn
You see it's simple when it's only cigarillos and the world don't want shit from you
You don't expect it from a little man
Fuck empty, my glass is filled
Counting roses, daisies and daffodils, chill

Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
So get your money (So get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)

I say my prayers but I don't know who they to
Layin' on my back, lookin' through the roof
Just tell me, am I gettin' through to you?
Stickin' to it, superglue it, make it beautiful
Fuck, what am I missin'?
Speak to your soul so shut up and listen
Give me a reason to pop
Getting' me goin' and lettin' me stop
Head to the top, it's better they not
Call me in forty so they don't need shots
I got a girl, we in love
She my money, she my drugs
This my pain, this my pleasure
Last forever, keep me up
Late at night, tell me it's alright
I believe her, I don't question she who knows me best
I know you wouldn't either
Something happened when I see her
It's right out of a fairytale
Got some shit she goin' through it
It's something that she handle well
Life a bitch but she my bitch
Gold Rollie and it's timeless yea

Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
So get your money (So get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)

We all wanna know what to do in this world when it seems there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream but we don't know exactly how to get there yet
And we all wanna know what to do in this world when it seems there's nothing left
And we dream just to dream but we don't know exactly how to get there yet

Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
What if it's gone tomorrow? (What if it's gone tomorrow?)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Get your money (Get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
Every day, could be gone tomorrow
So get your money (So get your money)
Fuck 'em all (Fuck 'em all)</pre>
