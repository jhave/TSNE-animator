Shorty run up on me, you know what she startin
Ass all in front of me, bitch I beg your pardon
Put it on me good, do it for me darling
Creatin a scene like we fuckin in the garden

Now get her back up on it, grind real slow

[Busta Rhymes]
Back to throwin money, baby girl you want it?
Fallin on yo' ass, pilin all up on it
Keep doin your thing, shorty I support it
Make them niggaz spend it, 'til they can't afford it
When you finish with 'em, come back here to get it
When yo' ass got a nigga diggin all up in it
Know I'm always with it, girl get low
Now throw it back up on a nigga, grind real slow

[Chorus] + [Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
I love the way you wear your hair (uh-huh)
Love how yo' ass is everywhere (that's right)
It's just them little things you do (c'mon)

I like the way you wear your hair (uh-huh)
Love how yo' ass is everywhere (uh-huh)
It's just them little things you do (do it)

And you know a nigga enjoy that when you
