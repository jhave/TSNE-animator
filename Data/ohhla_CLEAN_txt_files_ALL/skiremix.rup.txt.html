[50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly

[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dress shirts, stomp through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really want it you pussy?  Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude: 50 Cent]
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money

[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window?
WOW - the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggaz with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggaz slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt, but a nigga low-key

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
