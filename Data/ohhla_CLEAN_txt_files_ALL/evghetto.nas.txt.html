Uhh... yeah... uhh...

[Verse 1: Nas]
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin the earth
Watchin your own murder reoccur

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another mornin

[Verse 2: Blitz]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggaz for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin high to relieve the pain, breathin in the game
Exhalin guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin I'll make it through tomorrow

[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
