First time I seen your face I was like damn 
Put your arm around my waist I was like man 
Gentle with the touch I ain't fuss still a strong hand 
I ain't know if I should lust or play it like a man 
True I'm human like you but gotta play it smart 
Questions I gotta ask for we get this start 
Pulse racing fast damn can you feel my heart 
Got me feeling wild yeah you doin your playa part 
Tryin to feel you up excuse me I mean feel you out 
What your life like tell me what your mind about 
Oh you ain't even trynna share no secrets straight to bis 
Wifey, baby mother, you got any kids 
One word answers oh I ain't feeling that 
Then the pain for american express black 
But I'm a play it cool and let you think you running things 
You seem official long as you ain't runnin names 

(2x)you ain't getting none 
his touch it really turns me on 
this message comes from me to you 
please stop touchin on me (you know you want it) 
but I got go 

Listen baby you know that I'm attracted to you crazy 
but I ain't gonna play stupid so you can try to play me 
You ain't really tellin me shit and trynna slay me 
And on the real this quiet shit is startin to drive me crazy 
The only thing that's keepin me still is sex appeal 
Strong but silent type is that you what the deal you 
Know what I like on me gotta keep it real 
Something in my mind sayin that you probably got the skills 
but I ain't giving in your friends they feminine 
And I don't know how many of them you might be swimmin in 
but them lips though make me wanna try my luck 
Straight thug what I love and you got me stuck 
Cause you dress right I'm supposed to be pressed right 
But on the real you got me thinking if I could be blessed tonight 
Let me stop thinking these things it's not polite 
I wanna give it to you raw but i'mma put up a fight 

(2x)you ain't getting none 
his touch it really turns me on 
this message comes from me to you 
please stop touchin on me (you know you want it) 
but I got go 

From subliminal seduction not really touchin 
but like rubbin actin like you wantin nothin 
Your eyes say it all playboy but you no rushin 
Treat me like your pray only your sexual huntin 
I'm runnin frontin cause really I'm wantin to 
Let you lay me down pound for pound we be crushin 
I'm tight vexed cause I'm really dwellin on the sex 
Chills up my spine the way you smellin up my neck 
I'm like putty in your hands I gotta keep my composure 
Plus I'm trynna remember how long I really known ya 
You make it hard fightin you off is like a job 
but I'm doin good so far body startin to throb 
Should I give in ready to open my garage 
and let you park in the dark but damn I gotta 
Fight you off gotta roll out but before I leave 
You need know that dinner was lovely but I really gotta go </pre>
