[Lil Wayne]
Man fuck these niggaz
I'm-I'ma spare everything but these niggaz
I flip the gun and gun BUTT these niggaz
Take the knife off this AK and CUT these niggaz
YAH! And fuck these bitches
I swear I care 'bout everything but these bitches
I-I don't care, I "so what" these bitches
And I put Young Moolah baby way above these bitches
Huh, if it ain't broke, don't break it
And-and-and if he ain't shook I'm gonna shake him
Hope I don't look weak, cause when a wolf cry wolf
You still see that wolf's teeth motherfuckerrrrr
Heh, futuristic handgun
If you act foul you get two shots, and one
Ha ha ha! I'm at your face like Lancôme
You niggaz softer then Roseanne's son
Hey, you-you-you cannot reach me on my Samsung
I'm busy fuckin the world and givin the universe my damn tongue
Heh, crazy motherfucker, I am one
But-but the crazy thing is, I began one!
Heh-eh!! All-all white bricks
I'm straight like it's jumpin' back to 36 nig-GUH!
Big house, long hallways
Got ten bathrooms, I can shit all day nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And we don't want no problems
Okay you're a goon, what's a goon to a goblin?
Yeahhhh, Big Kane on the beat
I fuck around and leave a nigga brains on the streets - oooh
Now pop that pussy
I bring her to my bedroom and pop that pussy
Uh-huh, and we be steady mobbin
Whoa Kimosabe, big ballin is my hobby

[Gucci Mane]
What the fuck is up? It's Gucci Mane the G
Ask Titty Boi, no pity boy, Big Scar City the city boy
So Icy so no Nike boy, just Gucci Louis Prada 'scuse me
Gucci Mane keep shittin on me, why that boy keep buyin jewelry?
East Atlanta cockin hammers, bandanas on car antennas
No we do not talk to strangers, just cut off these niggaz fangaz
Gucci's armed and dangerous, cocaine codeine and angel dust
This AK 47'll hit'chu everywhere from ankle up
Clit same size as Nia Long, clip long as a Pringles can
Fo'-five desert eagle on me, you'll think I'm a Eagles fan
Toni Braxton sniper rifle make you never breathe again
Fuck that nigga, kill that nigga, bring him back, kill him again
Gucci!!

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, the-the-the money is the motive
Fuck with the money it get ugly as coyote
Okay I'm reloadin, better pull it if you tote it
I buy a pound, break it down, and put it in a stogie
Swagger so bright I don't even need light
I'm with a model broad, she don't even eat rice
But, would you believe that she dykes?
And she asked for a pitcher so I gave her three strikes
Yeah, I'm-I'm the man around this motherfucker
I'm so hot you probably catch a tan around this motherfucker
This rap game, I got my hand around this motherfucker
Yeah I said game, but I ain't playin around this motherfucker!
YEAH!! I'm the best to ever do it bitch
Heh, and you the best at never doin shit
If you the shit then I'm sewer rich
Try-try me and I'll have your people readin eulogies
Ha ha ha, I swear you can't fuck with me
But I can fuck your girl and make her nut for me then slut for me
Then kill for me then steal for me and of course it'll be yo' cash
Then I'll murder that bitch and send her body back to yo' ass

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhhhh! Man-man suck my clip
Swallow my bullets, and don't you spit ughhhhh
I am the hip-hop socialist
Life is a gamble and I'm all about my poker chips
Do you want a dose of this? I will make the most of this
F is for fero-cious, murder your associates
The top is so appropriate, this is just where I belong
Keep a hard dick for yo' girlfriend to wobble on
Weezy!

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
