Well I'm extremely cheap
I snore when I go to sleep
The little bit of nothin have left
I'm strugglin trying to keep
Your friends may all agree
You could name a million things I'll never be
If you feel like flyin feel free
You know that you could do better than me
I'm a simple man
I'm doing everything I can
When God sent you my way
It was the moment my life began
You stood by me through the storm
Well I was hopin you'd have my hand
I wish I understood how you were strong enough to undestand
Cuz see no one is crazy enough to love me but you

Never thought myself as much to see
Material things don't mean much to me
A good father, husband, and workin man
Are sometimes so much to see
And all them bills are due 
I can't afford to buy you nothing new
We don't talk like we used to
I know that loving me is hard on you
But you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die
We've come such a long way
And sometimes I want to ask you why
You continue to be the only star in my entire sky
Because no one is crazy enough to love me but you

You see, girl you know I try
You are the completion of I
As long as we're in love
I'll never be ready to die
We've come such a long way
And sometimes I want to ask you why
You continue to be the only star in my entire sky
But see no one is crazy enough to love me but you
I want to thank you (yeah)</pre>
