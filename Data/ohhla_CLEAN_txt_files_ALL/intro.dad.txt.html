Damn
I would have never thought it ever woulda been like this
Life is crazy
God -- please watch over my family
Please protect em
Forgive my enemies -- for they know not what they do
Please Lord -- forgive me for my sins, and protect me from evil
For thou art the kingdom, the power, and the glory 
Now and forever
In your name we pray
Amen
