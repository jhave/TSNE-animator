Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You don't get them girls loose loose (TJR!)
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money move move
But I do I do
You don't get them girls loose loose
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money move move
But I do I do

I said, y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm running through the world like I'm running back
Scarface, world's mine, running back
30,000 people went here on me
80,000 in london wembley
90,000 morocco, and I'm just getting warmed up, papo
Catch me with redone in stockholm, beirut, cafe getting my drink on, mole
We're how to put the women, here the hooka
All of them sweet, azucar, azucar
Dale disfruta

They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party

I said, y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm from the city, where they stress, and they sleep real bad
And now I'm doing shows in helsinki
I know what ya'll thinking, you're thinking, that you can outhiking, but you can't frankly
I'm out for the benchies, frankies, chinos
Just cause you ain't me, don't hate me
As a matter fact you should thank me
Even if you don't, joel come yankees
Zig-a zig-a zig-a zig-a
Who got the key of the world, now, yours truly

They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party

I said, y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'mma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'mma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'mma give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Get funky, get funky
Now stop!

I said, y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party</pre>
