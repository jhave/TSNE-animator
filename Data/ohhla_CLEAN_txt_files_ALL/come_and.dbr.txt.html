   Verse 1 - Da Brat (Mac Daddy)
Get down... ain't no room to mess around
When Da Brat-tat-tat-tat's all up in your town
I'm in the front with a blunt never playing the back
It's that new nigga on the block and I don't slack
Ta- dow now (I know you love how I put it down)
Now (I know you love how my shit sounds)
So close your eyes as I mesmerize your mind
1 time 2 times 3 times I'm
Not that bitch to be fucked with or seen 
Cause puttin it down ain't no thing bitch you know the routine
Either recite what I write or hold that ass 
Cause ain't no seeing this G be hitting your ass with a blast
Now (There I go there I go there I go)
(With my funkdafied funkdafied westside flow)
If you ain't down you best to get down quick 
Cause ain't another bitch (like) this bitch (right) shit

   (Hook)
When your in the mood to flow let me know
Cause to me it ain't no thing I'm always ready to go
So I know that you know that I know you gets none
But if you want some come and get some

   (Verse 2)
To be or not to be fucked with is Da Brat with some gangsta shit
I'm cappin any nigga that step or disrespecting my click
It be the crooked letta O double that once more
Def and I have yet to speak on this bad ass ho
How many bitches do you that kick shit like this bitch
No nothers so others witness the rack-ed wicked
As I bust shit niggas can't fuck with
This bad mamma jamma lick shots like twin glocks and plus it's 
On, till I let them fools disperse
Ghetto bust proper first verse after verse
It gets worse as I puff on the chronic smoke
Me and my pad locc up I smoke up and niggas get broke 
Off, tossed like a cloth
I gives a fuck about what niggas say how they walk how they talk
Cause to meet 'em y'all needs to quit
Cause in '94  I be the wrong bitch to fuck with

   (Hook)


   (Verse 3 - Mac Daddy)
Now as the sound breaks down let me slide up in
The M-A-C's who I be Kris Kross is who I represent
For so very long
But this time I'm with Da Brat and once again it's on
With the K to the K (by the way) dum di di dum
Mr. Mac pack now can I drop the bomb
Saggin all dressed in black
I'm the nigga with them braids shades khakis and pimp packs
Leanin to the side peepin out the scene
Niggas on my dick cause I got green and I'm a fiend
To the microphone which I'm known to rock	
Bangin till the boogie end boogie time I'm hip hop
I know you still feel
The devastation of my lyrics so please kneel
To the king that I may very be
The macadocious A-town player the M-A-C
