"Better to have money and not to need it;
 than to need it and not to have it!"

[Intro]
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some

[Willie D]
Lemonheads don't quote, I ain't with bein broke
I'm tired of my mother bustin ass for other folks
Gettin nowhere fast
While the hoe on the corner makin mo' money sellin ass!
I ain't with this outfit
I gotta make some moves to buy G Jones some nice shit
Before she kill herself, workin on a job all week
That don't even make the fuckin ends meet
I walk down Main Street
Growls in my tummy cause I ain't had nuttin to eat
So how the fuck am I gon' thank?
When I'm in a funky sweatsuit and Syl bitchin to me
Her ass is tooken out puttin non-stop
Make the swap and go shop
I said that to say this and every note
I ain't with being broke!

[Chorus]
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
Got to get my hands on some
Money, more money
Got to get my hands on some

[Bushwick Bill]
I was BORN in a cheap-ass hospital
Brought to 5th Ward, stuffed right in the middle
of a rock and a hard spot
Before my dad got that ass I was already counted out
What a motherfuckin pity
Momma couldn't afford milk so we had to suck her titty
In the kitchen every night I would see
Rats and roaches eatin better than me
There was no Thanksgiving~!
They say I'm a fool for thanking God for living
But bein broke ain't no motherfuckin joke
Well out in '91 shit just ain't happenin bro
I never had a God damn thing
Christmas came and went, without a choo-choo train
In the ghettos gifts get stole or bought
Ain't no motherfuckin Santa Claus!

[Chorus]
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet mo-neyyyy
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some

[Scarface]
Let the gunshots RANG OUT, blow my God damn BRAINS OUT
If you've been there, you know what I'm talkin about
Gettin over tops my agenda
The easy way out, is to jump out of a window
But that's a dopefiend move gone left
I'll kill you, but not MYSELF
I tried to do the right things major
But that didn't put no food on the table
Went back to school to get my G.E.D.
But who's gonna hire a motherfucker like me?
... McDonald's don't fit
They work you like a dog plus they talk too much shit!
Without them dollar signs
It's like livin and dyin at the same time
And you wonder why a motherfucker sell dope?
He ain't with being broke!

[Chorus]
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, yeahhhh
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet sweet

[Outro]
Money - yeahhhh, money - yeahh
Talkin 'bout money
Yeahhh money
Talkin 'bout that mean green
Talkin 'bout that money
Money, more money
We've got to get our hands on some
We need money.. {*fades out*}</pre>
