{Everyt'ing you want}
  What?  Everything?
{Everyt'ing you want}
  Man, you believe that shit?
{Everyt'ing you want}
  Talkin' 'bout everything we want ...

{Everyt'ing you want}
  You know I'm a freaky motherfucker!  Everything?
{Everyt'ing you want}
  We gon' let Shay hit that hoe first.  
{Everyt'ing you want}
  Yeah, yeah, Shay, you gon' hit that hoe first.
  Get on that hoe, Shay!  Yeah!

Verse 1:  AK Shay
Hey miss lady, what you gon' do?
I got a lil' somethin' I wanna ask you
Runnin' 'round town, you're a nympho
Won't you suck my dick, and suck it slow, uhh
Let's get n' go straight to the hotel
Cat stay wet, you don't need no gel
Damn, girl, I heard you're a freak
I'ma fuck ya ass 'till the end of the week
A girl like you, I know you ain't shy
Cut ya ass up like you're cuttin' a pie
Bend it up nice and turn it up right
Like the feel of rubber, gettin' fucked all night
You must like it slow, uhh, so gimme slow head
Let's fuck on the floor, I'm tired of the bed
If I call my crew, you'll fuck them too, huh?
{Everyt'ing you want}  Ahhh yeah!

Freak Nasty:
Check this out, baby, what about fuckin' me and my girl?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
See, I like to hit it from the back, can I do it like dat?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
What about fuckin' my boy D-Bo, would you do that?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
What about me fuckin' you and you suck my boy' dick?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
Ohh - AHH YEAH!

Verse 2:  Freak Nasty
You said everything I want, anything I need
When we first hooked up, you was eager to please
Now it's "Hold up, freeze!", you straight-up tease
You want a nigga like Freak on his knees?
What's up your sleeves?  Tricks, I seen,
Got a nigga on prime time live TV
Just you and me and your cousin Trina
Live on the set of the Jerry Springer
I was glad to meet her 'till I shook her hand:
I found out your cousin was really a man!
Nigga named Tyrone givin' you the bone?
Fuck that shit, you shoulda' stayed at home
Told me on the phone, you and I were alone
But I got a surprise of my very own!
Yo Simone, tell your daughter what you gon' do!
{Everyt'ing you want}  Fuck yo' mama, bitch!  

Freak Nasty:
Check this out, baby, what about some anal action?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
You know how I like that real sick, huuuuhhhh!!!
  {Everyt'ing you want}
Uh huh, what about yo' girlfriend and my girlfriend?
  {Everyt'ing you want}
What about, them two and uhh, my boys?
  {Everyt'ing you want}  I'm a freak.

<hey baby="" bitch="" c=""> (4x)

Verse 3
[F-Nasty] My place or yours?  Your place or mine?
          I got the Dom-P and 69
          You're one of a kind, I'm a hell of a freak
          I wanna work that ass until you speak
          If ain't you Greek, I can make you shine
          You better get yours before I get mine
          I love to grind, baby, say my name
          Freak Nasty, all in that thang!
[AK Shay] Now here we go, you silly hoe,
          Lick from my head down to my toe
          Virgo is the sign, I fuck all the time,
          I got mo' heart than a valentine
          I fuck all night, I fuck all day
          By the way, I'm AK Shay
          Oh, you glad to meet me?  Then bitch, come freak me!
          {Everyt'ing you want}  Oh, shit!
          Don't tell me that, girl, my dick' gettin' hard</hey></pre>
