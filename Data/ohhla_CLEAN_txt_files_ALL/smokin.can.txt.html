[Hook]
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me,(Well he if he love you then tell him to stop)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (He love that rock)
He love me (Come on bitch, he love that rock)
He love me,(Well he if he love you then tell him to stop)

[Canibus]
You ever came home everything ya owned was gone
TV, VCR, fridge and phone
Emporio Armani, Bulgari cologne
That nice China set from your mother-in-law
Ya say to yourself "How could I get robbed?"
The guard dog would've bit somebody for sure
Could it be somebody that you probably know
Got the ABT code and the keys to the door, no
You better think again gullable ho
Somebody you know was on a rob patrol

[C-4]
And I seen em' pull up in a Pinto
I couldn't believe, eyes peekin' through the window
Ain't y'all engaged, well that day he was with the neighborhood bimbo
I thought to myself, OH!
Why would he a need a credit card to get in for
You keep a set of keys under the mat
He ain't thinkin' of that, he stealin' for crack
On the street he can get a hundred for that
I hope you don't really think he bringin' it back
I'm tellin' ya girl he stole it
He was standin' around the last time I saw it
I remember when you bought it
That son of a bitch got balls if he can pawn it
I remember when I seen him this morning
He pulled me to the side asked me if I want it
I had to look real close for a moment
I was shocked when I seen it was your shit
He put it away cause he somebody was comin' and just took off runnin'
I told ya woman, he love that rock

[Woman]
I remember when I met him two years ago
At the Texaco, I was checkin' though
He impressed me though, he was enchanting though
He ain't have no dough but he was sexy though
At first I played hard to get though
But it got so good I had to let it go
It was one to four, put it on me slow
Even asked me to marry him in Mexico
I can't explain how he made me feel
I was head over heels, in love for real
I took him home so he could meet my dad
Took care of his ass, gave him all my cash
For a year and a half I treated him good
He said he needed space, I understood
He be out all not, what seems for days
Then he showed up crazed and he needed to shave
Smellin' like rotten eggs, I'd tell him to bathe
Clean him up, take him to church and get him saved
In Jesus' name I can make him change
If I would've lost my way he would've done the same
Cause he love me

[Hook]

[Canibus]
I'm tellin' ya he ain't gonna stop, stop
And he just love that rock, rock
Kid run up in ya crib like knock, knock
Take everything that cha' got, got
Gold watch, watch jewelry box, box
The go straight to the pawn shop, shop
He's ridin' that white horse, horse
And he don't wanna get off, off
I got a 800 number you can call, call
Cause that love y'all had is lost, lost
He don't love you he love that rock
