[Two women talking]
Hey girl, how you doin?
Long time no see.
(Yeah I know.)
Girl, you still messin with that dude?
(Umm kinda sorta, we off and on.)
I think I'm kinda in the same boat as you.

[Mo B. Dick]
Sometimes I don't know why
I just let you take control of my life
I'm tired of the lies you keep telling me
I was blinded by love but now I see

[Dolliolie/(Mo B. Dick)]
And I'm fed up (I'm fed up)
What's goin on (What's goin on)
I'm tired of this shhhh (I'm tired of this shhh)
That's been going on (That's been going on)
I'm fed up (I'm fed up)
What's goin on (What's goin on)
I'm tired of this shhhh (I'm tired of this shhh)
That's been going on (That's been going on)

[Man and woman talking]
Yeah man, um, what's happenin with you and this nigga man?
(What you mean what's happenin?
What the fuck you talkin bout?)
Man just what I said.
What's happenin with you and this-
You fuckin round with this nigga.
What's goin on wit chall?
(There you go again.)
There I go my ass.
What's happenin with you?
You need to slow down with that bullshit.
You ain't got time for that shit.
What you, what you, you don't wanna be, you don't wanna be down no more?
Fuck it.
(That's all on you first.
You want your shit back?)
Man I ain't trippin on that shit.
You can keep that bullshit.
(Aight.)

[Mo B. Dick]
Baby who do you think your playin with
Things your tryin to do, I done already did
I heard you had a nigga ridin in my Escelade
Your lucky I didn't get that chopper and do you both like O.J.

[Woman and man talking]
Wait, wait, no that wasn't me.
(Man fuck that shit.
I ain't bout to do no time behind no raggedy ass bitch.)
Bitch, who you callin a bitch?
(You got too many fuckin hoes out here.
Too much money to be made.)
Baby please, just wait, just listen.
I was wrong for messin with that other dude baby but I'm sorry.
I really mean it, I'm sorry.
I love you so much.
Baby wait, where you goin?</pre>
