[Chorus 1: 2X] 
Dance threw the cha cha for me ma mama 
Shake and make it drop drop for your pa papa 
Touch your hips and your na na 
Get high 
Bounce with them ta tas 
Don't stop 

(Dance threw the cha cha for me ma mama 
Shake and make it drop drop for your pa papa

[Chorus 2: Johnny P] 
Ball wit us

(Turtle Banxx) 
Cha cha baby girl 
Step off inside this legit world 
Hang out like motorcycles and on Madison and Micky d's parkin' lot 
Legit ballaz status 
My playas call the shots 
Get away from neighborhoods gang they tied 
This raccoon leather and wood grain at night 
Smoked cars pound 
Call L.A 5 
Twista smoked 2 b's so now we valley high 

(Liffy Stokes) 
It aint nothing to floss and ballI 
live a life that say a high price cost to ya'll 
Jet set with my hair hanging out the vet 
Doing donuts on the air cuz the streets wet 
Bringing more rats 
Sippin' on the finest 
You might fine this 
Fly as the nigga roll 
Smoking on the Philly slow 
Screamin' what dilly hoe 
I got a whirlpool sweet at the mo mo 
Plus a quarter of some hydro 
With the rainjo 

[Chorus 3] 
Ball wit us 
Come and ball wit us 
L.a.g.i.t 
Wont you come ball wit J.P 
Come on 
Ball wit us You can ball wit us 
Rockin platinum ice 
That's what's ballin life like 

(Miss Kane) 
Now everybody wanna get a glimpse 
Of the little miss 
Now that I'm rollin with twist 
I keep my shit legitimist 
Got condos up the lake 
Cd's and tapes 
Keep a shit 
Look it straight 
DVDs to plate 
Lay back on the E-way 
Switchin up lanes 
Eyes low from the dro 
Me and Liffy just lain 
Rockin the gold 
Sippin mo 
Get the party of the chin 
We got enough dope for yall all to hang 
So come up come up 

[Chorus 4]
So many ladies 
Wearing the thongs 
They drop it, shake it, working that booty 
Nobody's hatin' 
Cuz when we ballin we are family

Holdin' the not cherry drop top 
Haters cock block, block, block, hot clock, cock block
