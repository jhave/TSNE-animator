[Intro]
I think this intro should be more dramatic
Ah man
It's LL season, let's ride!

Hands up, hands up
Hands up, slip into the bath salt

[Chorus]
(Push it) never 'cus I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good

[Verse 1]
Uh, boss of all bosses
Face in the car, make a young girl noxious
Yea, this beat salad when I toss this
Never go against me, you lack resources
What? I skywalk with the forces
Back in the 80's I was playin in Porsches
Money ain't a problem, I toll my losses
Maserati coup, take galloping horses
Nah, there's never been one like me
They're looking for a new me as if there might be
Even with a love song, that's unlikely
If L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me
Uh, killin Queens all day
I got what you want, what you willin to pay?
Your boy ladies love sound, clean on the track
Slip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on

[Chorus]
(Push it) never 'cus I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good

[Verse 2]
Honestly I was scared to come back
It was ugly not knowing how the game would react
Said my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap
But now I teach class, put back Tony
You see it in my eyes, transparent like glass
Giving all for my soul to have another smash
Yea, LL Cool J
30 years later, be me for a day
Same day, just a daddy, she love me anyway
So I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray
Cats on my team, got NBA
But it's my black, from the web we stay
I don't whack my suicides, I act my age
Never try to sound like a rapper I raised
Roared as a tiger, can't grow no brains
But the money's coming in in 360 ways

[Chorus]
(Push it) never 'cus I have to
(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard
(Push it) and I got the game mastered
(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment
(Push it) we back to the basement
Hand on my nuts, that's product placement
The game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
(Push it) slip into the bath salt
Push it real good

Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
Lookin kinda salty over there
They's are kinda salty over there</pre>
