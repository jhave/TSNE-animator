[Intro: Smoke DZA] (Pete Rock)
DZA! RFC! (Smoke 'em)
Funk Flex what it do! New New York old New York all New York! (NYC!)
Coney! (Come on! Uh!) 
Pete Rock this that boom bap they was lookin for though! (You already know)
J Allah real cinematic with the flow (WOOO!) Uh! 
RIIIIIGHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTT!!!!

[Verse One: Smoke DZA]
Uh! They tried to stick me in the box like a Brady 
'Cause, this that flow that make the stoners go CRAZZZYYYY!
Bullshit I may weather the storm
But I'm young Adrien Broner I'm the heir to the throne
Sunshine like it's eight in the morn'
Cool nigga pluck the toothpick at you like I'm Razor Ramon
E'rybody know my name, Young Norman +Cheers+
Hop out that Panorama in them paranormans yeah
Don't even ask me what's the brand, know it's Lauren yeah
Other than that, it's some very rare Thompson gear
On my square, y'all know he got next
My lawyer like, oy, vey will he see that check?
Where I'm from either you blaze or you leave out stretched
9/11 doin we catch wreck
Come on nigga what practice, really what's a loco to a cat 'round the atlas
Nigga who you talkin to you Teo with +Catfish+
I'm too real life for these niggas I'm active
Put me in the whole 'nother bracket
You only cop work when your baby mom's file taxes
Hope she hit you off, better not piss her off
Nigga! Heh Heh Heh! Your money year round I'm a boss
Figure, these lil' niggas is buggin, I off niggas!
And spark somethin somewhere on the wing
That N.Y. golden age flow all over again

[Chorus: Smoke DZA &amp; Pete Rock]
I said it's plain to see, RFC, we 'gon be them niggas for life!
I said it's plain to see, RFC, we 'gon be them niggas for life!
I said it's plain to see, RFC, we 'gon be them niggas for life!
I said it's plain to see, RFC, we 'gon be them niggas for life!

[Outro: Smoze DZA] (Pete Rock)
Funk Flex what it do?! (Uh!) Pete Rock! (Niggas for life)
New York shit (Uh! Say what!) Really fuckin cool! (Niggas for life! Funk Flex!)
(Yeah! Uh! Yeah! DZA! Huh! Smoke D! Funk Flex! Uh! Yeah! Keep it movin! Huh!)
