[Chorus - Brenna Gethers] (Akrobatik) - w/ ad libs
I try to keep my head above, but I keep on fallin down
Seems like everytime I get it right, damn that shit ain't never right
But I fight and stay strong, no matter what's goin wrong (yeah)
I suggest you do the same, when the raindrops (uh)
When the raindrops (uh) fall on you, you, you, you

[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Yo, when it rains it pours
Globalization puttin poison in the stores
Tidal waves washin good people off the shores
Sometimes I feel like I can't take it no more
I've seen white and black ladies, with crack babies
In fact maybe, sellin them to get that buzz back baby
Boys are in Iraq, when shady dealings got 'em them in the first place
They put us on the front lines to lessen our birth rate
The children of the poor fight the wars (uh)
And when that shit is over, they'll be the broke ones in the stores (true)
And even though we all different
The little issues in life are seemin much less significant
So when the rain comes down on you (you)
My question is: what you gonna do?
From where I stand, you could fold your hand and let your world crumble
Or fight back and keep it on the humble (uh) - I know my choice

[Chorus - Brenna Gethers] (Akrobatik) - w/ ad libs
I try to keep my head above, but I keep on fallin down (uh, uh, uh, uh)
Seems like everytime I get it right, (BG: damn that shit ain't never right)
But I fight and stay strong, no matter what's goin wrong (yeah)
I suggest you do the same, when the raindrops
When the raindrops fall on you, you, you, you

[Verse 2 - Akrobatik]
Why's it rainin so hard a young child asked his mother?
She said God is cryin cause we killin each other
Now I don't know if that's the reason or not
But I know I'm sick of seein young brothers in the hood gettin shot
As the blood flows through the street, through the heat bussin
Understand cousin, that it's mostly over nothin (nothin)
I'm sendin shouts that are real rare
Whether you're dyin of cancer or confined to a wheelchair (uh)
And all my people tryin a make ends meat
That fell to the same demons that you helped your friends beat (what)
This is goin out to all my welfare parents
Who all they really wanted was some healthcare clearance
Homeless veterans, who can't help they appearance
And anybody else within earshot to hear it (woo)
When the frustration starts to fuck with your nerves
Stand strong and remember these words y'all - let it rain

[Brenna Gethers &amp; Akrobatik) (Akrobatik)
I'm a still do my thing (let it rain!)
I'm a still do my thing (let it rain!)

[Brenna Gethers] (Akrobatik)
I suggest you do the same, when the raindrops fall on you
(Uh, woo, let it rain!)

[Brenna Gethers &amp; Akrobatik) (Akrobatik)
I'm a still do my thing (let it rain!)
I'm a still do my thing (let it rain!)

I suggest you do the same, when the raindrops fall on you
(Uh, uh)
(You, you, you, and you, you)
(You, you, you, and you, you)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, rise up)
(You, you, you, and you, and you)
(and you and you, you)
(And you, you, you, and you, you)
(Rise up, rise up, rise up, yeah)
(Uh, let it rain, uh, uh, uh, yeah)
(You, you, you, and, you, you)
(You, you, you, and, you, you)
(You, and, and, and, and)</pre>
