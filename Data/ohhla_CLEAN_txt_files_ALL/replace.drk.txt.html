Typed by: chrisbyungjock@yahoo.com

[Echo-Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Drake]
Lat me show what it is
I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
if you lookin for the goods then we got in the trap like
[Trey]
Ooo wee
[Drake]
Took 'em from white snakes to
[Trey]
Ooo wee
[Drake]
This metaphore might sound a little confusing but
[Trey]
Yall don't really even know me yeah yeah

[Drake]
I done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that stayed in
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us 
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town
Two or three days I shut you down
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince he rep two up two down
Anyone I know get used to me
Im far from the man that I used to be 
I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providing that
Understand that I'm worldwide
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK
From Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans
But yo this hook is for my exes

[Trey Songz]
This one is for you girl
You know who you are girl
You only show you're face
'Cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you trying to to make it
Don't ever mistake it
'Cause my time is limited and I ain't trying to waste it all on you 
You had a chance now It's gone
Oooooh
You had a man now you don't 
Back to the basics
I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a yougin so fly
Lookin for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life
Tryin to find another one tonight
And if it's you baby
Let yourself be seen
Don matter skirts
Dresses or jeans
I got that work
Know what I mean
And I'm flexing on my ex if you know what mean

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Check this out
from the that she get picked for some take out
Until they slip up and break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out
And I'm lean back
Scoping
Looking for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipating us living the good life
We go LA, VA
NY, TO
Sunshine in that heat stroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kelz ain't doing the thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz is the replacement

[Chorus]

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Ay, Ay, Ay
Let's Go</pre>
