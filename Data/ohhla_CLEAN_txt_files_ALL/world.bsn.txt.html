[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down,
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright

Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be [x3]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, when they need a cure
I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Mrs. Freeman's son, across the street got shot,
Now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
I know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You know I love you momma like she mine,
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out,
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

[Chorus]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down,
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright [x3]</pre>
