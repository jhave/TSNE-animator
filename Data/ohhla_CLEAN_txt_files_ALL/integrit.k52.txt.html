[Talking]
Yo, yo what's up yo?
Yo, what's up man?
Yo, y'all are GRITS right?-yeah man
Yo, I-I want to get into this gospel rap thing man
Aw, sh man it's a task
Yo I was just wonderin' if I could give you this rhyme I wrote
Go ahead man, I aint hatin'. Go ahead yo

It's all about me, me, and did I mention me
I'm the dopest rapper in the gospel rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper
Yo, all y'all cats need to retire
With your played out raps, I'm the roughest and toughest
I love the spotlight yo you better make sure this mike sounds right
or I'll charge you double on this honorarium
Don't ask me to speak words of encouragement cause yo I got the dopest skills
Don't ask me to do what God wills
It's all about keepin' it real and makin' sure I get me a fat type of record deal
Give the crowd something they can feel
Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile
Yo, I been doin' this a long while, man, like two months even
So what if I look like a heathen, I can still kill the ruckus demon
I got all the girls fiendin, I put emcee back into emceeing
Yo God and hip-hop versus the god of hip-hop I believe in
I'm acheivin' what I want. These skills is what I flaunt
Yo you caint get me so tell me what you got
Man, I live and die for the god of hip-hop, I mean God and hip-hop
So y'all fools need to stop

[CHORUS]
This is a message to you rap infants
showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills but skill alone dont get you props
It takes integrity, when rappin' for Christ on microphones

Who's this Babylon emcee with the audacity, approaching me
as if I got a stamp of approval for his fallacy
I hear you talkin' 'bout yourself
and claim you keep it real but I aint feelin' it
I'm feelin' to your flesh but only kill the little light so dimly shinin'
I question why you rhymin'
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use Him as a jewel well then your crown
and you clout your time will tell
In life He must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
You see the ministry begins theminute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life you hear in the pages of His very Word
Cause if not face His rage
You aint understandin' He demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to hip-hop caint be found in His Commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense
wanna find relatin' truth to some gone take it offense
young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
who got responsibility to let you know what kind of bilities to key
but it seems that some of y'all aint caught the vision as we

[CHORUS]</pre>
