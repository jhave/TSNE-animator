Ha ha ha
Come here
Got a package.....
Wait, wait I know what I want for Christmas
What you want?
I want T-Boz to get me ah, some headphone sets
And I want Left Eye to make me a, uh, make me a fly dress!
Well Merry Christmas from TLC!

[Chorus]
Let's have a very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year (a happy new year)
Give with love and joy and happiness
And lots of good cheer
I want you to have
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year ( a happy new year)
Filled with love and joy and happiness
And lots of good cheers

Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling
Ring-ting-ting-a-ling too
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is fallin
And friends are calling you
It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

[Chorus]

Uh-huh reindeer, presents, happiness (yeah right, check it out...)
Giddiup, giddiup, giddiup and away we go
In winter wonderland
Off we ride in the snow (ho ho ho)
With the Left everthing is grand
Sleigh ride if you like me baby
Don't be scared
Take my hand
T to the Left Eye C if you can take a glide
Giddiup the guts and step on up
So we can sleigh ride
Cheeks so nice and rosey
Comfy cosey we're in
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
So let's take the road before us
Sing a chorus or two
C'mon it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Aaahh so let's have a  

[Chorus]

Um jingle bells, Batman smells
Robin laid a... (yeah right)
Up, up and away
If we're flyin in the sleigh
Home alone Christmas Eve
Make-believe it's time to play
So let's flow on this snow with a sack on my back
Cause Santa's tryin to mack in his Cadillac
Ridin' and a ridin'
But when it gets to decidin'
He's a slippin' and a slidin' in his own sleigh ride
A merry little Christmas
Oh yeah, hey yeah
A merry little Christmas
Oohh oohh
Baby don't you know I'm home
Don't wanna spend the night alone
A very merry Christmas
Would ya wanna spend it with me
It's somethin in the way I care
About the times that we have shared
It's a very merry Christmas
Would ya wanna spend it with me

Chorus

Let's have a very merry Christmas (ho ho ho)</pre>
