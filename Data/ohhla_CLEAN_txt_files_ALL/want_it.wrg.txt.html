[Warren G]
What's up negros and negrettes?
It's your boy Warren G 
You know what I'm saying?
Chillin' with the home boy Mack 10
And we gon' lay a lil' sumpin' down for y'all
Let y'all know what time it is
Show you how we keepin' it real wit' it
You know, cuz this world is built on material thangs
But we ain't trippin' off that
We want y'all to know this, check it

(Chorus)
I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls 
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

[Warren G]
They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare'
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that
&gt;From falling, tryin' to walk from crawl
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy
And shit stank, so if you plot a lick and hit a bank
And get away, or get gaffled, the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga
I said remember what you told yourself, nigga

(Chorus)

[Mack 10]
I want it all, so I got to wake up and ball
And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
&gt;From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got clout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leach talkin' about
Slow down player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Will it enable to shoot C-Note "Yo's" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
A nigga fly and fly, with the desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall cuz Mack 10 want it all
What

(Chorus)

[Warren G]
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hot like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip and perculate
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all

[Mack 10]

Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dog, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dog, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread
I want it all

(Chorus x3)
