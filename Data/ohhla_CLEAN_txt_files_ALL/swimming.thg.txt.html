[Chorus: Slim Thug]
I got a swimming pool full of (drank) them pints of the (drank)
That purple (drank) we po' up (drank)
I smoke and (drank) cup full of (drank)
I'm leanin (drank) I'm leanin... haaa!

[Slim Thug]
Tell her faint, tried to stop but I cain't (hold up)
Them cups keep callin and it's costin me a bank
We mud sippers every day, we po' up a paint
Leanin hard on the 'vard, doin what you cain't
Ain't another nigga fresher, Louis' out the dressers
I'm foreign with the compressor molest a beat, like I'm Chester
Nawfside flow wrecker, twelve years and goin (goin)
Green still growin, chain and rang still glowin
Nawfside flow wrecker, twelve years and goin (goin)
Green still growin, chain and rang still glowin
Nawfside flow wrecker, twelve years and goin (goin)
Green still growin, chain and rang still glowin
Showin boys how to hustle, it's time to boss up
Ten karat charm'll make you put your cross up
Po' it down, pop trunks around, I'm comin down in them foreigns
Purple label, Ralph Lauren, now with Big K.R.I.T. we tourin (we gone)
So throwed when I'm on the road, you know I like to party
I've been drinkin drank since you was drankin 40's
Been thuggin; cain't nobody tell me nuttin
I been a grown man since I had to start hustlin with

[Chorus]

[Delo]
I got a pint full of purple I'ma cruuuuise in it
Get it? Huggin on them corners like a fitted
Sippin on that batch that got me itchin
Rollin up that stank got me lookin fake busy
Shoutout to my city - I'm all about the H
Like the Hermez on her waist, lil' momma know my taste
She been tryin zip her case, I just really need an eighth
I remember payin fifteen dollars for an ace
Now that shit is out of rate, make my homey send a package out of state
On the sneak shit, I'm waitin on the mailman as we speak
Me and Charley sippin early, got me goin straight to sleep
It's ironic we in dreams try to do this every week
Lil J with me (yeah) couple straight 50's (yeah)
20's on the bottom, we can clean up baby bodda
In a hour get'cha shorty, I bet she be a naughty
I'm 'bout to make her chill and po' it for me

[Chorus]

[Paul Wall]
Codeine conniseur, cup money like a sewer
20 ounce Vanilla Cream, mix it with a four
I done muddied every single soda in the store
I've been drankin for 50 days straight like it's a tour
Sip until I snore, wake up and sip some more
Straight to the medulla I don't measure I just pour
Dody in the cabinet and some Swishers in the drawer
And my maid come tomorrow you can ash it on the floor
I be leanin like a see-saw, throwed like Clayton Kershaw
Smokin on that brown kush and I'm 'bout as high as a tree top
Best get out my Reeboks, shrink your feet with a free knot
I got my kicks a month ago, you gettin yours on restock
My Rolex don't tick tock, my dick justice mink edition
My AP is A-1, your oowop got a dime emission
Fuck the haters and fuck the system, all day on a hustle mission
My eyes low and dead division and did I mention I'm sippin on that drank
