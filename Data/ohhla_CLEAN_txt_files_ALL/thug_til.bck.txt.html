Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As I walk through the street
45 on my front, AK on my back seat
smokin' your fat ass across the street
Then I ask myself "How do I survive?"

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
How can I tell ya'll to stop sellin' bricks?
Thats the way that man choose to pay his rent
Shit its hard to get a job gettin' out the pen
Then they wonder why we right back in that bitch again
Try to peace talk and sit down like men
But then theres always a friend that be like "Fuck them"
When the guns bust a body must fall
Nothin' can stop it, not even Farrakhan's calls
Its a shame though
What I came in the game fo'
I really done slanged dope
So really i'm thankful
To be in a position to make a thug listen
Ain't no tellin' who 'gon come up missin' or go to prison
Run from me, try to hide it from your kids
Let 'em hear about it, before they go see what it is
I can give it to ya, tell you about what I done did
Even though i'm gettin' money ya'll this is how I live

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Still on the block lookin' for a better way
Its safe to say
I'm thuggin' 'till my death day
Every gangsta in the world let us all pray
And put in work homie, thug 'till your death day
Still on the block lookin' for a better way
Its safe to say
I'm thuggin' 'till my death day
Every gangsta in the world let us all pray
And put in work homie, thug 'till your death day

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
now everybody in the race for the first place
They gave Deke twenty years for his first case
We form gangs to protect our hood
If the police could lock us all up they would
But we don't trip no
Just pray to god we got a big fo'
Relyin' on side hustles to get dough
Ain't nobody rich, even if you workin' with some millions
You need more money to support your cost of livin'
See we don't cry in the hood no mo'
Ain't really too much I ain't seen befo'
And crack head Fred he'd kill for a nigga
when it came down to it he did for a nigga
That don't get no realer
Cause ya'll niggaz ran
You was the only man with a gun in ya hand
Good thing that I don't trust a nigga with my life
Fill the clip with hollowtips, we ridin' tonight

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Still on the block lookin' for a better way
Its safe to say
I'm thuggin' 'till my death day
Every gangsta in the world let us all pray
And put in work homie, thug 'till your death day
Still on the block lookin' for a better way
Its safe to say
I'm thuggin' 'till my death day
Every gangsta in the world let us all pray
And put in work homie, thug 'till your death day

[Voice]
Every neighborhood
Every project
Every one in the motherfuckin' world
We got to ride niggaz
Motherfuck the police
Got no love
A man is only good as his word
Death is something that comes to us all
What you scared for?
Nigga what you scared for?
Ride
Gangsta holla when you see me</pre>
