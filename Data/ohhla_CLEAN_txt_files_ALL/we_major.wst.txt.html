[21 second instrumental to open]

[Chorus: Really Doe]
You muh'fuckers better do your job and roll up, and WATCH how we roll up
An', I can't control it cain't hold it, it's so NUUUUUUTS
I take a sip of that 'gnac, I wanna FUUUUUCK
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazin is how I keep blazin
Towel under the door, we smoke until the day's end
Puff puff and pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotiq or Henny?  Nah nigga, that's a chaser
Turn nuttin to somethin, now pimpin that's a savior
Best things like green now pimpin get your paper
High off the ground from stair to skyscraper
Cool off, thinkin we local c'mon homey we major

[Kanye West]
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We MAJOR?!  C'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon homey we major
We major, c'mon..

Feelin better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggaz hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that 9
Nigga come through flickin and he had that shine
Put 2 and 2 together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan but I brought my hood with me

[Chorus]

[Nas]
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We major?  C'mon homey we major
We major!  C'mon homey we major
We major!  C'mon homey we major

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Fo-fo's or Black Christ?  Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, "Nas what the fans want is Illmatic still"
Looked at the pad and pen, fell, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent and I'm thinkin it's time
to build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived, of executive 9 to 5's
And it hurts to see these companies be stealin the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LP's and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggaz around
Last longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke

Yeah!  Yeah!  Ye-yeah, ye-yeah

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away...

[Chorus]

[Kanye] + (Nas)
We major?  (C'mon homey we major)
We MAJOR?!  (C'mon homey we major)
We major  (C'mon homey we major)
We major...

[Tony Williams]
Feeling better than I ever felt before today
But better late than never, it's
Orien-tation, still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away...

[music starts to fade until 5:21 in the song]

[Kanye West]
Can I talk my shit again?
Can I talk my shit again?!
I can't believe I'm back up in this muh'fucker
I'ma be late though
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear
Yeah... the Roc is definitely in the building
Good music's definitely in the building
I gotta say what's up to Tony Williams
On the vocals sings, he sings quite beautifully
Don't you agree?  Don't you agree?
Uhh, and Jon Brion on the keys right now
And Warren Campbell on the keys right now
So they ask me - why you call it "Late Registration" 'Ye?
Cause we takin these muh'fuckers back to school
If you know this part right here, feel free to sing along

[Tony Williams] + (Kanye West)
Feeling better than I ever felt before today (If you feelin good)
But better late than never; it's orien-tation (It's orientation)
Still we can make it better
Throwin all your cares away... (We want you to get used to this)
(Uhh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh, they cain't do what we do baby)
(Yeah...)</pre>
