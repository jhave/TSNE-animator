Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Sun shining, top dial
Everyday beautiful, I jugg a hundred, pal
You should start organize free band good time
My son six, he's on, counting a hundred thousand
I'm about to have a girl, now my life complete
Plus I don't have no girl, I'm married to the streets
And this a money world, I'm a money freak
It's a beautiful day when you can buy keys
I always ride around with bands on the seat
Your name on wait when you can flood the streets
It's beautiful to sail six trucks a week
B&amp;G I'm on my own girl beneath

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, sun shining away
Smoke kush and sip drinks, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2]
I'm talking about bad bitches, gold Rollies
I'm talking about getting digits, the whole on me
Niggas in the hood still moving marijuana
Their biggest dream is getting rich and move to California
My uncle Phil humping the master wheels, hoping out, let me know
I'm walking around this gold on that shit where I kill em
That east side, that glam hood, that camera roll, that flash sound
Riding round my top down, my year here, that's black bowl
Everytime pretty, pulling up dirty
Presidential Rolly, cost about a birdy
Trying to see a hundred in, tell my heat thirty
She so wet, I pull up on out the girly
Where'd you got the rims, serve roof open fit
Black came sand girl, I'm a whit towns
I drank a lot of codeine and smoked a lot of dope
You know I always scoop that it's a cope

It's a beautiful day, I wait this bitch by a bench
She ain't putting no problem, I fuck every day
You're living up your ass, that's what it was on the sail
Been working hard for a long time, right now it's time to play
The sun shining so bright, diamonds shining so bright
A top down in a hundred time, just thank God for the life
My bills paying, nigga, I won't pay 'em
I got thrill lane, my bitch faded
You can't erase me, I'm a nineties baby
Damn

[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, sun shining away
Smoke kush and sip drinks, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day, sun shining away
Smoke kush and sip drinks, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 3]
Ring back home, make me feel so good
Roger did a seven, man, it's all good
I gotta say fuck the fan, do that for the hood
We're millionaires now, we're on billboard
Everything I couldn't have now I can afford it
Spin the pot around like the wheel of fortune
Had that crack pot had made a fortune
My partner primetime told me stay focused
My OG homie Pat told me keep it going
I messed a minor block, I need a Grammy for it
Marry, God and everything, remember that summer, homie
Salute my home niggas, is like a home for me</pre>
