[Chorus]
Came in the game as a youngin, signed with Cash Money, pocket full of money
Niggas poppin shit always talkin bout somethin
See ya ass in public, it's a whole 'notha subject
Man they just talkin bout it, they just talkin bout it
And I'm on the streets with it, I'm on the street with it
See from where I come from, you gotta be about it
And if you want it want it, we come and see about it

[Lil Wayne]
Unhh, it's Weezy Baby like the last shit
A big car and a bad bitch
Unhh, I'm so fly I need an ass kick
These niggas ballin by accident
Unhh, keep talkin, nigga fuck up ya body
Send ya home and tell ya mom, it was an accident
Unhh, I'm a G 'till the casket, drop on my glasses
Unhh, fast money, I'm the fastest
I got that hustlers passion
Ya know, dem boys back at the ass end
I'm at the bank, tryna cash in

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
It's been murder, bitch I make a killing
Insurance papers in the safe, money in the ceiling
I got pillow case full of pistols
Come through a nigga house and aim at the pillows
Unhh, wake up wake up
Fuckin with them boys, you can wake up, taped up
Ya dig, now gon' an drink that lake up
Stick 'em in the truck, let 'em feel that bass pump
Deez niggas is nuts
Man, that M14 leave you physically fucked
Deez niggas is ducks
Well you can call me Scrooge, because I'm swimming in bucks
Bitch

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Yea, yea, too hot, too cold
I'm red hot, blue cold
Yea I knock ya melon out ya fruit bowl
All my guns black, I got true soul
Yea, and I call my coupe the Black Panther
Blat.. blat.. blat, that's the gat anthem
And if a nigga play with family for that matter
I'ma smoke so many niggas, I'ma catch a cancer
And if I step up out this benzo
You know I'm coming with a gun, like a Nintendo
They soft, them niggas fallin when the wind blow
And I'm rollin up my window
Fuck 'em

[Chorus]</pre>
