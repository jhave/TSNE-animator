Typed by: eutley@wsu.edu

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

I know you keep them in your heart
That special part. Didn't care to share
Thought he'd always be there
But he had to go. It was his time to fly
Though he struggled to live
See we all gotta die
Don't question why
It's just how life goes
It just happened to be your number one homie that God chose
Your sadness shows, your woes, your sorrows
But keep in mind the sun will shine tomorrow
Now he's gotta halo, an everlasting glow
And it's painful but only God knows
What's next on the agenda (yeah)
Either way you gotta return to sender
But while you're here you gotta keep ya head up
Moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil he's a liar and ya feed up c'mon

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

Release and let go the fault wasn't ours
She was called upon by a much higher power
What's important for us all to understand
We're just little pieces in God's big plan so
Hold on when I tell you hold on, stay strong and it won't be long
Till you see your little boy again your mommy again your brother again
your best friend
Sometimes you just wanna ball out his name
Seem like your sun don't shine the same, but you gotta maintain
Remain sane, know you're not to blame
But while you're here
You gotta keep your head up
Keep moving on your life and never let up
Let the past be the inspiration to get up
Tell the devil he's a liar and ya feed up c'mon

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day

I know it's hard living life after death
Sometimes hard to see what you got left
Now you're feelin' lost don't know what to do
Don't let the demons out there try to fool you
Give it all to God he'll pull you through
Jehovah'll make a witness out of you
You know it's true, but it's hard to realize
That God's still there when your best friend dies
They'll be times when you just fall apart
Just remember to keep them always in your heart
Let the tears fall it's okay to cry
Try to understand it's his time to fly
There's a time when a spirit to say peace and release
From a body that's left deceased
You've got to know there's so much more than what's right here
Have no fear

Have you ever
Had someone close to you die
I know you wanna cry
But keep your head up high
And remember (remember)
They're in a better place (in heaven)
Up there somewhere far away
And they'll be waiting for you to join them one day
