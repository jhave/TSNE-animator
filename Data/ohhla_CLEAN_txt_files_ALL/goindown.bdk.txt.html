Hit me, baby (that's right)
Hurt me, baby (that's right)
That-that-that funk
That-that-that-that-
That-that's-that's funkdafied-like fonk
That's that retarded-like fonk
Like you put your armpits in a drum machine
Good God
Break me off some of that
Come on

Easy Mo, just let the beat rock from your sweet stock
To bounce the complete block, make everyone on the street flock
To this here rhymthm, music'll hit em, get em, my lyrics'll fit em
When I get with em, girls I'm in em, smokin like bags of ism
The one that keep amazin y'all, don't even know who you're facin, pa
The Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car
The one who created it and many others imitated it
I heard your rap style, kid - hated it
Let me show you how, look here, now check my style
What I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say wow
Ba-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down
And sway, sway when you hear the music play
Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say
Hey

        I'm in love with Big Daddy Kane
        He makes the party swing
        He turns the mother out
        And rips apart things

Then I go...

        Da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down
        Da-da-da-da-da
You know I like the way it sound
And I just love the way it's goin down

Now, what's this b.s. you're sayin?
And don't try to act like Martin now with all that 'i was just playin'
No need to grief or mourn cause now the beef is on
Boom-bow-boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap that don't mean that you catchin wreck with me
You step to this, I give you mic-o-vasectomy
I only know one person that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle
Cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle? I gots to have it
Unless you're gonna rob me like they give Riddick a win for Chavez
Cause tryin to go against the Kane rappin
Is like a pimp tryina pull a nun - ain't nothin happenin
Clear the way for the one, champion, true black don
Gun gettin the job done take a look, hon
Back up, son, you know you can't get none
Come on, I'm on a whole other level of rap
And it's like that, now show me where the party at

        Da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down
        Da-da-da-da-da
You know I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down

The B-I-G D-A-D-Y, no, back up and add another D
Come back to the K to the A to the N to the E
Live from New York, the one and only
I give it to you raw for my homies
And to the ladies: I take em lookin somethin fine
It don't mind if we bump 'n grind
If you're with me, jump in line
Because if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic
Then you better believe, girl, that you're gonna get your ass dicked
Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur
The kind you saw rhyme before
But now you never find no more
Steppin to the Kane with some drama to be startin
Because I put em all on ice like Tonya Harding
Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy
Rollin with me on a mission that's to seek and destroy
So, to all the people that's been tryin to talk about me
You better change your name to 5000 cause you're Audi
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin to them too
Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through
The groove, with more style than a backstroke
Drivin past my competition like cab drivers do black folks
That's the way I move, I always stayed a Smooth
Operator with data watin for you to play a groove
To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about
Good lookin, Brooklyn, yeah, we in the house</pre>
