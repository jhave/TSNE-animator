[Intro: TV Interviewer]
Ice-T, after your tremendous success on your past album 
Some have said; you have sold out
because of the use of rock'n'roll in your music
How do you reply to that?

[Ice-T replying]
You see, a lotta people don't realize that, you know
Rock'N'Roll is truely black music
It was created by Chuck, Berry, Little Richard
Even black people like that, who started it off back in the day
You know, and as far as I'm concern music is music
I don't look at it as Rock or R&amp;B all that kind of stuff
I just look at it as music, you know
And anybody who said that I've sold out, they can basically suck my dick
Cause I really don't give a fuck about that shit, you know
But uhh.. I do what I like, I haven't like Rock'N'Roll 
And uhh.. I feel sorrow for anybody who only listens to one form of music
You know, right now, I got my own Rock band, it's got to jump off
It's really black hardcore band called Body Count
And uhh.. on some of the records I'm like laying some vocals on it
And uhh.. I got a tape of it right here, yo, check it out

[Song's Intro: Ice-T]
You know, sometimes I sit at home, you know, and I watch TV
And I wonder what would be like to live in some place like
You know, The Cosby Show, Ozzie and Harriet
You know, where Cops come and got you cut outta the tree
All your friends died at old age
But you see.. I live in South Central, Los Angeles 
And unfortunately... SHIT AIN'T LIKE THAT!!
It's real fucked up!

[Verse One: Ice-T]
God damn, what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and blue
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a brother with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
You try to ban the A.K.
I got ten of them stashed
With a case of hand grenades

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Verse Two: Ice-T]
You'd know what to do
If your kid got killed on the way to school
Or a cop shot your kid in the back yard
Shit would hit the fan motherfucker and it will hit real hard
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Break: Ice-T]
Yo Beatmaster V, take these motherfuckers to South Central
Ha ha ha, yeah, fuck that
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count
Last weekend thirty seven kids killed in gang warfare in my back yard
NO!!, NO!!, NO!!
Yo Ernie C, take these motherfuckers home, yeah
Yo, we're in the house, Body Count fool, 1991 motherfucker
I hear it every night, another gun fight
The tension mounts, on with the Body Count

[Verse Three: Ice-T]
God damn what a brother gotta do
To get a message through
To the red and white and you?
What? I gotta die before you realize
I was a nigga with opened eyes?
The world's insane while you drink champagne
And I'm living in black reign
Don't you hear the guns?
You stupid, dumb, dick sucking, bum politicians!!

[Hook: Body Count]
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!
(Tell us what to do?) Fuck you!

[Outro: Ice-T]
The tension mounts...</pre>
