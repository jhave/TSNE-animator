[Tre]
We got the perfect combination
(Krayzie: Mo Thug, Mo Thug)
So you better change your location
(Krayzie: Move out, move out)

[Tombstone]
Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you wanna come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
Y'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really wanna know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' y'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you wanna ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many wanna roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

[Krayzie]
This Mo Thug Family

[Mo Thugs Family]
This Mo Thug Family

[Krayzie]
Scriptures, we keep 'em all within me

[Mo Thugs Family]
We keep 'em all within me

[Layzie]
No competition
I gotta get mine
And scream out, "Mo! (Mo! Mo!)"
And let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone
Mo Thugs'll follow
Chain gang remainin' the same
Flamin' my dank, and drinkin' brew
Think about that hangin', clockin' my bank
And thuggin' with trues, fools, you know it

[Tre]
Mo Thug family
I got all my thugstas with me

[Ken Dawg]
Hoes stayin' up
Close enough for ya to let ya know
It's do or die forever, ridin' together (we're ridin' together)
'Til the day of the stormy weather
Pleasure and pain is all in this trip
Only scripts to flip is these old Mo Thug hits
This click of soldiers, who keep it real until the end
Some green in their hand, and we in it again, right

[Brina]
Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures
The last to remain by sneakin' up on you, backdoor
Hear 'Brina comin' relentlessly bustin'
Trues bringin' the drama for them bustas, never no bluffin'
No, gotta run my game tight
Never know weaklings, when a sista fall victim hit 'em
We Cleveland original money makers up in your system

[Boogy Nikke]
It's the Mo Thug Family Scripture
We singin', my people and me
Ya better believe the family tree's much deeper
Than what you see and believin'
Hey, gotta give up peace to the love inside of my halo
Gotta stay headstrong for soldiers
Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)
(Never forget) to pray for the people
'Cause when you need 'em, they there
You better beware Mo Thugs' steppin' with weapons
We comin' with the word of the Lord
To teach the people not knowin', we showin'
It's Armageddon again, we comin'
Better be ready, boy (I'm ready)
You better be teachin' your people
To write when this day's done, pray soldier boy

[Gates]
We soldiers trapped in this world
Don't step in our face or my bullets ?
Fed up with these haters, I'm breakin' 'em up
'Cause they fakers, and fakers fakin'
Pullin' them gat on Mo Thugs
But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs
I'm feelin' ?, and I'm bustin' men
Gotta load me clip when I rip
Then slip them slugs up out the chamber
Shoulda flexed upon me, stranger

[Krayzie]
Busta, you in danger
Tell 'em they in danger

[Mo Thugs Family]
All consequence

[Krayzie]
I take it that flippin'
Realize what it is that you have missed
Attention: be down for the family
That don't get no realer than this
Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Steady puttin' it down
Just the way we told ya Mo Thug soldier got ya
Back at it, (postin')
Puttin' your face on the ground
Murdered execution style, leavin' 'em roasted
All the while I'm servin' you hookas solution ?
Don't you wonder why niggas that hate me die?
With my family multiply
Scriptures be puttin up the tracks
Takin' a journey deep on the darkside
If you want fuck with
You better have the heart to handle the pressure
'Cause my niggas surin' to test
Weak niggas prove you ain't hard
Step with your ho-card, remind them of the St. Clair style
How we do it always, keep foldin'
Flippin' through the pages of literature
Scriptures, we laid...

[Tre]
Tre, we come to play, Mo Thug
Eternally, no unnecessary tension with me
My Mo Thug family stays beside me
Behind me, leads me, guides me
Ladies are we, eternal Mo Thug</pre>
