[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
One, two, one, two, the High Chief
Yeah, Inspectah Deck, yo... so alone... baby

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm just lookin' out of the window
Watchin' the gunshots blow-ow
Thinkin' how we all was turnin' out
I'm keepin' my head above water
Got to make a weight when I can (cuz I can)
Temporary lay off, cop pay offs, daily rip offs
Informer tip off, clips lick off
The judge got hit off, boss got knocked off
Worker made a come off, cash got dropped off
Buildings got burnt out, sisters got turned out
Work out in the yard up North, tryin' to burst out
Pissy elevators, dirty cop favors
Tongues hiding razors, minors turn majors
Wave them bigger tools, shoot out inside the school yard
The game ain't changed, niggaz done made their own rules
They buildin' plans, let's pull a million dollar scam
Watch for taped conversations, Jakes and dollar bands
The black market, labelled the movin' target
Dwellin' in the heartless projects
Evil eyes walkin', the BBS rims flossin'
The beat walk in, harassin' the street walkin'
They keep talkin', like the Rebel might slow up
They set me up to go up, the witness didn't show up

[Masta Killa]
Look out in drug stores (but I'm slippin') bare approach the look out
Be off the block by ten, the kite was sent
Then all those who dare to oppose, were sent back
Chained to the train track, protect ya jaw
These Silverback niggaz eat their oatmeal raw
Cee Allah sawed the shotti, 'Preme went down for a body
He killed Poppy, dusted in the lobby, toxy off shocky
Cops be harassin' tryin' to stop cashin'
The episodes pass, I flash back to guns
And crack stashed in grass, you movin' savage
Please warn him of his ways and actions
Before I blast him
Then the homicide was justified when I arrive
Black tints on the glass with the stockin' cap mask
It's all official, steel pistol style whip you, to the gristle
While my team be stompin' you out after the whistle

[Chorus 2X: Allah Real]
You go up, you come down
Don't mess around
Cuz you might get what your head called for
I know, you know, time to, go, ahhhhh, yeah

[GZA]
I went from the slums of Hell to paradise in Heaven
From a sling-shot to a wall of mac 11's
I drank with the Devil and ate with the Reverand
We talked numbers and I told 'em, that mine was 7
The total amount of hits, behind the collapsed building
That had exploded in a frenzy of killings
Bodies lay near tons of twisted metal
Of a structure and atomic force, it leveled
From the tale of the tape, the product failed in comparison
The weight, the height, the reach, was not a year within
Sight, the significant, difference was the ammo
Wrecking y'all individuals and their man know
Second by second, heat blazed through the night
Leaving a dazzling array of neon lights
The primary reason of mission for them spitting
The fire that kept hitting, them dust, they kept sipping
But the informants x-rays gave off electrons
Within a few next days, entire cess gone
Clinical precisions used to remove the eyelids
Those responsible for my brothers with high bids
Life in the hood is an award winning film
Lived out by savages who can't escape the realm
A place where the young meet and greet with guns
In the park they interrupt the pure innocent fun

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
