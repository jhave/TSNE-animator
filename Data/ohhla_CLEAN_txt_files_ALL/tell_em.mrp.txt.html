Y'all done made me go back to the old me
I'm the last soldier standing and I will not lose
(All Ready, All Ready, These No Limit Boys All Ready x2)

[Chorus]
Tell 'em hoes I'm a pimp
Tell 'em niggaz I'm a pimp
I'm a country motherfucker
And I walk with a limp
Tell 'em hoes I'm a pimp
Tell 'em niggaz I'm a pimp
I'm a country motherfucker
And I walk with a limp

[Master P]
My momma jacked niggaz so I don't trust no chick
Put the gas up in the tank before I give it to a trick
I got syrup in my cup mayne straight out the freezer
Pass me a blunt then throw me a heater
I see a flea up in the club, hatin on a pimp
Put the collar on your dog before I leave him with a limp
Boz looked at me mayne said - I don't give a fuck
We got the whole fuckin club sayin THROW YO' HOOD UP!
I'm the only pro baller, without a contract
But a nigga got mo' cheddar than Kobe &amp; Shaq
And it ain't trickin if you got it real players speed it up
And if they go quack quack put em in the truck
It's that time of the month, don't bring um home to papa
I'm a motherfuckin pimp, I ain't no motherfuckin doctor

[Chorus]

[Master P]
I ain't the police lil one, I don't chase no tricks
I put em in the ville and we both get rich
See I taught yall the game and yall wanna know if I still got it
Who work on a 100 mil nigga still bout it bout it
Y'all young motherfuckers must be pussies
cause I'm at your baby mama's house havin Ice Cream &amp; Cookies
I'm a grown ass man, I don't play with you mosquitos
A nigga still drunk and still loadin up them heaters
I got caught up in New York, you thought a nigga changed
I made it out the hood but I ain't sleepin in this game

[Chorus]

[Master P]
All Ready, All Ready, These No Limit Boys All Ready
Excuse me Thelma, I'm lookin for JJ
The 1st and 15th, that's a pimp's payday
Got wheels on the caddy that stop and keep spinnin
Got ice on the grill cause pimps we keep grinnin
These pimps drink out of gold cups like ??
Chickenheads got dirty mouths washin out the soap
I said shake it for a pimp, girl do dat there</pre>
