Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh-huh

Chorus:

U for me (U for me)
And me for you (Me for you)
One for all (One for all)
That's the way we do (That's the way we do)

U for me (U for me)
And me for you (That's right)
One for all (One for all)
That's the way we do (That's the way we do)

Verse One: Grand Puba

Yeah I keep truer, sidestep MC's like manure
Play the corner like a sewer, keep it milky like Kahlua
Ya heard my shit be off the optimately optimate
Once a nigga begin to spit, get ya high like trees and shit
That's it, then I push it uptown to the Bush
Yeah I moosh, watch me hook it off like a Nike swoosh
My conglomerates reign dominance with prominence
Son, a lot of niggas thought I was done but I only just begun
Can y'all feel me because we feel y'all can
Smoke the tree right off the tims, long live Brand Nubian
My rhyme flow be imported, got so many different styles my shit is assorted
Never distorted, wanna catch my flow, better camcord it
I'm a take you there, believe me yo
See I'm here like welfare, got so many niggas livin my nickname should be
"Air"
You for me, me for you, that's how we do, 99-to-two-thou Brand Nu

Chorus:

U for me (Uhuh)
Me for you (Me for you)
One for all (One for all now)
That's the way we do (That's just the way we do)

U for me (That's you for me)
Me for you (Uhuh)
One for all (One for all)
That's the way we do (That's just the way we do)

Verse Two: Lord Jamar

Yeah, we engage the enemy, arrange the assembly
Flip thru the pages of time, do you remember me?
Thru the ages I existed only as a memory
Some of me exists inside your biochemistry
I be the slave that always misbehave, runnin for days
The North Star help me find my way
I ain't got no time to play, I'm trying to get away
Bloodhounds tryin to track me down, tryin to bring me back to town
If they catch me they just might ax me
Won't arraign me, they probably hang me
But it's freedom or death, exert speed til my last breath
Can't half step, Whitey's on my trail
I'm ridin on the underground rail, hidin from the face that's pale
Me and Harriet, Swing Low Sweet Chariot and take me home
They wanna break my bones and take me where they keep the tombstones

Chorus:

U for me (That's you for me)
Me for you (and that's me for you)
One for all (One for all baby)
That's the way we do (That's just the way that we do)

U for me (Brand Nu, Brand Nu)
Me for you (Me for you, huh)
One for all (One for all)
That's the way we do (That's the way we do)

Verse Three: Sadat X

Let me find out, y'all tryin to dine out without me there
It can't happen, why is ya still yappin?
I'm known by college grads and then by anyone who all knighted
Why you so excited? You scarin chicks and grabbin em
Talkin bout cabbin off the bat
Relax nigga, you here with me, we don't get down like that
I keep 13 with one in the ass, you Catholic mass
Nobody wants to die and be a mural on the wall
I'm the apostle y'all, I'm like Samuel L.L.
But I'll swing by you like Eve with a gun in my sleeve
Weed spots is like my need spots, let freedom ring
Sadat X Luther King
I wanna 1000 from the housing, don't know how much the club allows in
but I told the bouncer, I said "Yo that's not my fault
there's no need for assault", push and hit the asphalt
Now I'm a peaceful man, would you do for me, or is it......

Chorus:

U for me (Is it in like that?)
Me for you (Fo' sho', here we go)
One for all (I said it's one for all)
That's the way we do (That's the way that we do)

U for me (U for me, u for me y'all)
Me for you (Fo' sho', I'm for you, dogg)
One for all (One for all)
That's the way we do (That's the way we do)

U for me (Brand Nubian huh)
Me for you ('98-'99)
One for all (Touche, here we go)
That's the way we do (And that's the way, that's the way, that's the way)

U for me (Yeah sho' nuff)
Me for you (Uhuh, keep it goin)
One for all (One for all baby)
That's the way we do (That's the way we do, that's the way we do)</pre>
