[Timbaland]
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh, uh, uh uh
(oogie oogie overlaps)
Ginuwine

[Ginuwine - Verse One]
You can't fool me girl
I know you well
What's on your mind
It ain't hard to tell
Don't leave me now
Don't play wit' me
You think I'm blind
But baby I can see 

I saw your eyes, from across the room
You was checkin' me out, and I was scopin' you too

Don't say I'm wrong (what)
Don't mind those eyes
I'ma call your bluff
So baby tell me why

[Ginuwine (Timbaland) - CHORUS]
Tell me standing here (tell me baby am I gettin' on your nerves)
Baby keep it real (why don't you tell me how you feel)
Tell me what's on your mind (tell me am I wasting my time)
I gotta know, baby let me know
(repeat x2)

[Ginuwine - Verse Two]
Could you have told me girl
Is what I said
You can tell the truth
I'm all in your hand
And what's wrong wit' that
Are you ashamed of me?
You can fool your girls
But you can't fool G

I saw your eyes, from across the room
You was checkin' me out, I was scopin' you too

Oh I'll turn and walk away
If you deny (I)
But before I go
Could you tell me why

[Repeat CHORUS x2]

[Timbaland
Baby baby
Baby baby
What's yo name
What's yo name
How bout you
How bout you
Come play our game
Come play our game
It's me and Ginuwine
It's me and Ginuwine
A new day and time
A new day and time
C'mon baby
C'mon baby
Wha wah wha
Wha wah wha

[Repeat CHORUS x 3]</pre>
