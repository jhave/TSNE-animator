[ INTRO: The Fresh Prince ]
Now I'm the Fresh Prince, and if you got good sense
You'll keep your distance, because my sole intent
Is to rock and shock the spot and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top

[ VERSE 1: The Fresh Prince ]
A whole lot of people rap, but what good is that
If the rap that they're rappin is way off track?
I don't mean to attack you, but I'm cuttin no slack
To those people that I hear saying meaningless raps
In actuality, I mean in reality
The words that you use are a mere formality
Vocabulary is not what it's about
The point that you're tryin to get across is what counts
Cause when a lot of rappers rap, they try to use big words
But that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard of
They think that that's impressive, but when will they learn their lesson
That it's not the words that count, it's the message
They get a lot of big words out of some magazine
And nine times out of ten they don't even know what they mean
They stand up on the stage, huffin and puffin
Rappin for nearly an hour, but they're not sayin nothin
Really but a lot of jibberish
And I know that they all wish
They had access to fresh rhymes like this
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top

[ VERSE 2: The Fresh Prince ]
Fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz
Smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz
Good looks and charm and personality
You punch it in your calculator, and it adds up to me
I know the same goes for the rest of my crew
My deejay Jazzy Jeff and Ready Rock C too
The ultimate combination of strenght and prestige
My crew holds the key to fun and everything you need
To party all night, yes, it's you we will excite
The time is right, so don't fight it
Suckers, please don't bite it
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
And no, we're not about to stop because we're takin it to the top

[ VERSE 3: The Fresh Prince ]
I really hate to brag about him
But when people doubt him
I have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him
'United we stand, divided we fall'
Is the moto of our crew and it's honored by all
Of us, we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse
And it enables us always to come out first
We came to rock and shock and give our all, which is a lot
Yo Jeff, man, why don't you take it to the top?

[ VERSE 4: The Fresh Prince ]
We succeed everytime we attempt
To rock the house, you've got to dance cause no one is exempt
&gt;From the rules set forth by us, of course you know
Stay out our way or behold the brute force of
Me Jeff and Ready Rock C
We're a trio, oh, you didn't know? That means
That there's three of us, one for all and all for one
And we're takin it to the top before we get done
I'm inclined to rhyme, anytime you'll find
It ain't a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine
I insist on a rise and I despise a decline
On the day I descend, that's the day I resign
I'm creatin my trends and innovatin my rap
Why is that? I don't know, I guess I got it like that!
My personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre
My advice for life is, if you want somethin, go for it
Cause there's nothin that's beyond your grasp
Just set your mind to it, work hard, and you can have
Anything that you want, the sky is the limit
Stop lunchin around, get up and go get it
Cause I came a long way from the past till today
Now I'm never slowin down, ah-ah, no way!
I came to rock and shock and give my all, which is a lot
And no, I'm not about to stop because I'm takin it to the top</pre>
