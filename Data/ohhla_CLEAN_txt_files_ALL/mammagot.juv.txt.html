(Uh-ah, uh-ah, uh-ah) She get it from her mamma

Oh where she get her eyes from? She get it from her mamma
Oh where she get her thighs from? She get it from her mamma
Where she learn how to cook from? She get it from her mamma
Oh where she get them looks from? She get it from her mamma
But where she get that ass from? She get it from her mamma
But where she get her class from? She get it from her mamma
Oh where she get that chest from? She get it from her mamma
Where she learn how to dress from? She get it from her mamma
Where does she get her sense from? She get it from her mamma
Where does she get her income? She get it from her mamma
Look, where she get that walk from? She get it from her mamma
Nigga where she get that talk from? She get it from her mamma
I wonder why she so crazy - She get it from her mamma
Why she wanna be my old lady? She get it from her mamma
Why she be actin like that? She get it from her mamma
Why she ain't give me the cat? She get it from her mamma

A big fine woman'll make you smile when she pass you
Damn that girl sexy, her mamma got ass too
A big fine woman'll make you smile when she pass you
Damn that girl sexy, her mamma got ass too

Why we always havin arguments? She get it from her mamma
Why she always gotta call her friends? She get it from her mamma
Why she always gotta piss me off? She get it from her mamma
Why she always gotta take the call? She get it from her mamma
Why she wore the tight jeans man? She get it from her mamma
Got a nigga ridin hard and I'm tweakin - She get it from her mamma
Why she gotta make it look at honey speakin? She get it from her mamma
Why she got me tryin to get with her this weekend?

She'll leave and make ya stuck too - She get it from her mamma
Who told her I was fuckin 'round? She get it from her mamma
Who told her I was back in town? She get it from her mamma
Who said don't be scared of him? She get it from her mamma
Who said you better marry him? She get it from her mamma

Who told her not to fuck with me? She get it from her mamma
Who told her I'ma fuckin leave? She get it from her mamma
Who said I'm smokin marijuana? She get it from her mamma
Who said I be up on the corner? She get it from her mamma

Oh where she get the lip from? She get it from her mamma
Oh where she get them hips from? She get it from her mamma
Where she learn how to twurk from? She get it from her mamma
Where she learn how to work from? She get it from her mamma

And when she's shy it's to draw attention - She get it from her mamma
