Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas
Cross the bombest
We blowing up your house
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes
On Vietnam war vets
I am more or less sick in the head
Maybe more 
Because I smoked crack  today, yesterday,
and the day before Sabateur
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure</pre>
