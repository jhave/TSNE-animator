[Intro]
Awe Yeah
Hynotize motherfuckin' Minds in Here and we ghetto motherfuckin' ballin
nigga you know what that means that means you might walk up in the projects
in the south and see a 2,500 motherfuckin' benz or a motherfuckin' 72
motherfuckin colors slamed on double duces on some motherfuckin 17s
you know what I'm saying dice games going on, no crystals
Fifths in the back pocket and its going down nigga we on top

[Chorus]
Drove to my liver, pass it to my nigga
Sippin on that liquor, flossin on you niggaz
Ridin through the hoody, fuckin with that goody
Flip-floppin pi-zaint, and we on some 20's

[DJ Paul]
Back, Back up Bitch cause we comin through
In the motherfuckin prowler on the back 20 motherfuckin' two's
Skinny nigga with gold's and tattoes a beer belly
but still I make them ho's say I love you
from a motherfuckin pretty boy smile them diamonds in my mouth
make them gals go motherfuckin' wow
Draped in some fuckin' ICE be ERG
or jeans with white motherfuckin tees

[Juicy J]
Ridin Heavy Chevy thang foot on the gas
sippin on that syrup bout to smoke a pack
Niggas know I'm bogus cause I ain't got no tags
Eyes like a China man nothing but laughs
Bumpin' like a motherfucka I'm bout to flip
Everywhere I'm ridin niggas know its a strip
Phone in my hand two-way on my hip
atone in my lap with a blunt to my lip

[Chorus]

[La Chat]
Why you bitches want to hate on La Chat
Man ya'll don't know
Cause I'm everythang flexing so mean upon you hoes
Life is good motherfucka I'm gon live to the fullest
Got a problem step on up and you be dodging these bullets
I pull up so clean Expedition this beam
They know what's finna go down once I'm back at the scene
Hit the mall get the rag gotta took up my golds
Yeah I be gettin my shine on man you already know
Niggas choosin but you losin
gotta chop out your cheese
Don't need your ass I don't want cha unless you got more than me
Ima real bitch tril bitch Takin no shit
bitch dog, bitch nall, bitch ready to ball (trick)
See I'm that motherfucka breaking you down
You already see these niggas faudging when La Chat come around
Bitches discing when I'm flickin, know I'm out for a killing
You Want your nigga don't be stippin cause I stay by my biby (yeah)

[Chorus]</pre>
