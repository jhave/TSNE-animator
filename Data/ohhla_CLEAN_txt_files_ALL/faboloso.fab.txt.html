[intro]
Haha, uh, uh, uh, uh
uh-huh-uh, uh, uh, uh-huh-uh
uh, uh, uh-huh-uh, uh, uh

Mida, allow me to introduce myself, I'm known as Faboloso
When it's time to slide, I'm known to grab the most hoes
When I climb inside, they known to grab me close though (yeah)
When it's time to ride, I'm known to grab the toast though
By the expression on these hotties grill (uhuh)
I can tell that wanna holla at somebody real (what up)
And I'm usually looking for somebody skilled (yeah)
Enough to make a nigga scream Ayayayo
Niggas get mad, cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't wanna let these AK strays go
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten me
Besides, what I need wit another case fightin' me
Nigga what I need is a ounce of good cronic (yeah)
Unbelievable amounts of hypnotic (yaeh)
A shorty wit a ass that bounce like hydraulics (yeah)
And a nigga is straighter than six o-clock (yeah)</pre>
