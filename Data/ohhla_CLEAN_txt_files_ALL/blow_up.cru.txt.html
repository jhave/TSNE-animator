[Verse]
Although we might not be know-en, right at the moment
We got a hype show it's an exciting performance
Igniting emotion to fight your component
With frightful emotion to stifle opponents
Invite you to stroll in, cyphers are growin
Precise with the flow, K.O.'s nice when he's holdin the mic
I'm a showman, fight just be chosen
to fight all these role men in life to expose 'em
To cypher the globe - cause some don't like 'em posin
Unite with my bros, say goodnight when we roll in
Writin a poem that'll strike 'til you're open
Recitin the quote so insightfully spoken
Sniper's reloadin, rifles is smokin
Your life can unfold and the price is revoltin
My mic's always roastin, right in the open
To blow up the spot like dynamite explosions

[Verse]
Fuck it, and if you're fuckin with mine
I'm disgustin whenever I'm discussin a rhyme
It must mean that I'm lucky to be stuck in my prime
as the underdog, now I'm comin up from behind
And that's lovely, even when the sun doesn't shine
My temperature is hotter than 109
And when we up on the stage, we got another design
And we got nothin to lose, we got nothin but time</pre>
