Y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile

Y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
Remember in I-5 you couldn't feel my style
Remember when y'all said you ain't nuttin but a kid
Y'all said I wouldn't make it
Hey but I did
Remember when y'all said me and hump ain't workin'
Just check the driveway nigga we ain't hurtin'
I bet y'all niggas never take a bank style
It ain't my fault that yo group ain't high
It ain't my fault that you can't do shows
Either we movin' to fast or y'all movin' to slow
Now why you wanna go out and make me mad
If you drop another album you gone make me laugh

Cause y'all niggas tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile
Y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile

Buy the car 
Buy the house
Remember that
That was me
Diamonds all in yo face
Remember that
That was me and C
Southside still holdin'
Me, Duke, and A.P
G's and ballers 
Ballers and G's
That was me and H and C
And ever since
I became
The freestyle king
I got dope fiends 
That wanna be
The freestyle king
But I can't be copy-ed
My style ain't sloppy
Do yo C.E.O 
Put yo money in his pocket
How does it feel tryna look like me
Nigga you can't even write a hook like m
I'm the first young playa in H-Town with platinum teeth
I'm the black richie rich with the brain of Master P
And I know I got skills
I'm droppin' hits like fumbles
You got cars in yo yard
They ain't shit like hummers
So you need to stop rappin' and go back to hustlin'
Cause if you drop another tape man you ain't gone make nuttin

Y'all niggas tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggas tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile
Y'all niggas tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggas tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile

I hate copy-cats
I hate sloppy tracks
If you see me in the club I'll be wearin' botany black
I wrote a million hooks
I'm down with a million crooks
So watch yo mouth downsouth
Cause boys stealin' hooks
Every time I perform 
I got a dap for dat
You wanna be the freestyle king 
I got a plaque for dat
And you sold some of my raps 
You think I ain't gon tell
I'm sorry but yo next tape ain't gone sell

Because y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggaz tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile
Y'all niggas tryna steal my style
Some of y'all niggas tryna steal my style
I think y'all niggas tryna steal my style
What you gone do next try and steal my smile

[Lil' Flip talking]
Know what I'm sayin'
Lil' Flip the leprechaun
A K A the freestyle king
I come out sayin' I'm the leprechaun 
Now everybody else wanna be the leprechaun
I come out sayin I'm the freestyle king
Now everybody else wanna be the freestyle king
Man after this year I'm gone be the freestyle legend
I ain't trippin' get yo own stuff
Suca-free niggas don't steal 
Man I don't understand</pre>
