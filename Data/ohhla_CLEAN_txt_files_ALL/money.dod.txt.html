(N.A.R.D.S., talking)
Now for some typical reason, I'm rollin' up on some ho's
And pattin' my back seat, haha, my pimp lyrical tactics
Just like a dirty kid flippin' on a matress
Now flex this...

(Verse 1, Twista)
Now I just be
On the front porch, with the torch, ready to scorch
Two women peepin me, cuz frequently I'm gone
In the zone, they havin' thoughts of freakin' me
Keepin' me company, bumpin' me for the frequency I'm on
They can see I'm a cool muh-fucka, kickin' it petty
Down with the Kango on my razor fade
Peanut butter complexion, two silly processions
Two Phillie's, a fifty sack of some reefers, and a razor blade
Like a game of Spades, cut the bullshit
These days was made, for me devise strictly games that paid
Women freakin me, greedy, lickin me, doin body graffiti
Throwin they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age?
The players in the Chi, Twista and Do Or Die
You not gon' relate if you vibin' on the shit I'm thinkin' up
The style of flow is a vocal calico
To show you with the mic I be speakin' of, afterwards we can uhh...
Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and glock
Try not to pass the block, gettin' more high than a astronaut
Sippin' After Shock
I ball cuz of C-Wall and Rap-a-Lot
Let's keep partyin' to crash the spot
Plenty Henny for my crew, and I ain't even broke up half a knot
Keep on holdin' me, while I roll a B, we can "Smoke and Ride"
And you can play with me to keep the passion hot
Don't you know how the money flow?

(Hook)
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow

(Verse 2, Belo)
Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex
Fine gear, fresh car,  heavy on the skin tech
Money clean like Windex
Givin' up the Ave. like a brother gonna pass up the "Ho Check"?
Ho flexin' on the avenue, laid back sippin' a half a brew
So I see if I can have a fruit
A creep show acts a hoe, when she thinkin bout me havin you
She laughin' too, and pass a few, B's around
Smokin trees til' the leaves come down
Should be callin' dame skeezer now, show em the paper
They be caught up at your crib with they pants'es down
But money maker want a triple take
Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight
See him ridin in the C-A, D-I, double-L, bumpin' A-C, always
Stackin' paper in tall ways
Pull 'em off the small ways
Waitin' for the ho's in clothes, and I'm supposed to be, all day
Parlay, parlay, in the door, that's how the money flow

(Hook)
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
Don't you know...

(Verse 3, AK)
Bend the block with the indo, blowin' out the window
Rolex on my side door, laid back in the slow flow
Gettin' paid as the night go
I see some fly ho, tell me where you crib at?
Where's the place we can get back?
Hit you on the phone, see if you all alone
So we can get it on, baby just kick back
Swiggin' brews and Perregnon
Thick chick with D magazines, bangin'
AK (to where) to the pen
And to tell all my niggaz to keep it strong
They ain't got long (to what) to see
Where the niggaz seein kick it where a nigga kick it
But where I go, Cadillac to the show
Po Pimp, fuck the dough, hit the stage and become wicked
Get the money and ride out, go back to the hide-out
Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out
I'ma pull my surprise out
Then my boys just slide out, but two girls were chasin'
Gettin' paid in Chicago, been doin' this since the nine-oh
Comin' up, put it up, on fine ho's
Let the money flow

(Hook)
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O

(Verse 4, N.A.R.D.S)
Now for some typical reason I'm rollin up with ho's
And I'm pattin' my back seat
I pimp lyrical tactics, just like a dirty kid flippin on a mattress
Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit
Then We dip through the Chi, in a truck like a Lexus
Rollin' blunts, while ya bobbin' ya head to the censorship
While you waitin' for the next hit
Motherfucka makin' money just wanted to take a look at the Mid-West
Put my color in
Spend my money in the Souther-an
Motherfuckas steady stutterin', but I'ma come from the heart for start
To stop all the niggaz, the bigger the trigger, the larger the dividends
Pimpin and deliverin', leave 'em shiverin'
The money flow like a rig-a-lin
But really though, could you tell me how the money flow?

(Hook)
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how the money flow
Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O</pre>
