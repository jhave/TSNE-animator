[Verse 1]
Been had to get for get, lived in the sickest pad
Slept with mice and roaches, woke up pissed up slab
School of the hard knocks, I on the vicious Ave
Jim chase Mark Chan, we beat a bitches ass

Ask me who you loving, Cam you been bugging
Must have lost your mind; you fought Lucien's cousin
And St. Mark's, yeah big LE watch
my nigga red squashed it, forget that topic

40th, down the block danger zone
up the ave forty wall, hope yall niggas bring you chrome
what you saying homes, cops they raiding homes
activator juice, yes to spray your dome

from a tiny dude, developed grimey dude
stuck delivery, took all his Chinese food
I'm so good but bad, I'm so kind but rude
Americas most wanted, should have signed a Q

Plus its savage, cop car crash your door
Further more heard the boy em at the sack amore
Boy yes, over seas more sex
4 jets, corvettes, and I aint done a tour yet

Cuz I'm moving bricks, yes they serve in fours
Signing off dipset boss, truly yours

[Chorus]
We gon make it make it, we gon make it yall
We gon make it make it, we gon take it yall
We gon get it get it , money we gon get it get it
We gon get it get it , money we gon get it get it

We gon make it make it, we gon make it yall
We gon make it make it, we gon take it yall
We gon get it get it , we gon get it get it
We gon get it get it , we gon get it get it

[Verse 2]
My cerebral stress, eagle let it rest
Feel it in the air yeah, siegel said it best
It's a legal mess, needles need to death
Blame the government, until then I need to chef

Turn right, lead left, street games scrams
Call the cops oc, like we need a ref
You cant cheat a chef, I can see your chest
No heart, cherish your oxygen, breath your breaths

He need a rest, how he gon be the best
Like I guess a couple slugs he need to catch
See the sketch, you lassie
The gun is Frisbee proceed to fetch

Side up the hoopty, spray up the sentra
It be sixty years before I'm layed up in benter
Sprayed up her denture, your girl
Then I layed her placenta, blew hazed in her rental

Some days in December, some days I remember
A boy sugar ray want to play the contender
Just say I got a temper
And my temperature is off the thermometer

Korean New Year to Hanukah I'm bombing ya
Put you to sleep for good pajama ya
Wrangle you in ya he man pajama's
Wrap you up in your pac man sheets

[Chorus]</pre>
