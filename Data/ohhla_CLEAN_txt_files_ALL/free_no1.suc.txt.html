Asshole By Nature, you ain't never gon see me sweating
Z-Ro the Crooked, AKA King of the motherfucking Ghetto
Know I'm tal'n bout, Southside for life
S.U.C. I'm a Asshole, Southsi' for li' uh huh
Screwed Up Click, my nigga DJ Screw I know y'all knew

[Z-Ro]
I'm all out of space, with my game
Hell yeah nigga, got my pocket full of change
I use to have a pocket full of lint, now they wonder where I went
When the laws hit the corner, I'ma hit the fence
I'm gone, out do'
I'm outtie five thousand, but I'm still blowing dro
On the Castle Creek, or the Vetaven or the motherfucking Ridge road
Bitch, I put a widded up in your wig hoe
Motherfucking, teflon
Or seven point two sixes bitch, all in your arm
All in your chest, or all in your face
Or all in your leg, now your back is in a brace
You riding in a wheelchair, nigga can't walk
When you talk down on a nigga, I gangsta walk
Up on your bitch ass, open your ass up like Vick Sab
With a series of quick jabs, and six slabs
I ain't tripping bitch, open up your six pack
Know I'm saying bitch, lips back
Cracked open, talking that there
But I ain't even much tripping, I couldn't give a care
Cause I swear, I got killers on my team
Riding round, with the infra blue beam screen
Hell naw, the silencer is on the fucking tip
Of the motherfucking, extended clip
I rip through your flesh bitch, now I'm all up in your chest bitch
Better hope, God blessed bitch
Cause if you don't, that's your ass
I promise when I see you hoe, that's your ass
It's still fuck Watts, cause I don't give a fuck
Riding in a truck nigga, South up
Southside nigga, but the Nawf is part of the South too
So watch, your motherfucking mouth fool
Know I'm saying, disrespecting the Don
I'll drop your bitch ass, with the left arm
I'm right handed, kinda ambidextrous
But I ain't tripping bitch, see your chin I stretch the shit
I ain't tripping, I keep the flow going longer
I'm still, on the motherfucking corner
With a square of marijuana, I ride the track out until it's gone
I ain't tripping, I'm still repping for my fucking home
What's up, to the motherfucking Southside
My nigga know I'm saying, I got to keep my mouth wide
I showed the diamonds in the back, so shine the light on them
But I ain't tripping, yeah he got the light it ain't dim
I ain't tripping, I got the shine up in my lips mayn
I ain't tripping, I'm on a sip mayn
Yeah, the motherfucking Phantom red
You heard what I said, I put the lean up in my head
Make me lean to the left, and then I lean back
Just like the Fat Joe, but a nigga ain't Fat Joe
Mo' like the skinny Joe, or the thinner Joe
I'm still a winner bitch, yeah I'm still a winter hoe
I'm on spinners hoe, three's on the Cadillac
Hell yeah I chop your ass, with my battle axe
I'm still looking dead, off up in the lens
I ain't even tripping, you better ask my partna Den
How we get down on the South, we don't play with ya
Know I'm saying, gun talk we say with ya
Peep out the Skip, peep that U-G-P
Peep out that Juvenile nigga, then peep out me
Then peep out the mo'fucking, S.U.C.
We got niggaz like Chris Ward, and that C
G, know I'm saying that's the gangsta talk
Get with it bitch, and do the gangsta walk

(*talking*)
Know I'm saying, I'm just fucking around
But y'all know nigga, DJ Screw is the Don nigga
All you hoe ass niggaz, y'all gon mind nigga
Fuck you and your click nigga, know I'm saying
This how I do my shit nigga, Screwed Up Click for life
Southside nigga still sipping, wish you would run up</pre>
