Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is war with no weapons
Marching with no stepping
Murder with no killing
Illing every direction
First, no sequel
do the math, No equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people
And no I'm not afraid of that
Print in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement
Bang
Fade to black

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, to get it
The show's done
They're talking for just talking
But meaning they got none
None of 'em come proper
They talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity
Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and
And wait and see..

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear

In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today
When there's nothing left to lose
And and there's nothing more to take
But you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away
And your hope turns into fear
And your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today!
In the wastelands of today!</pre>
