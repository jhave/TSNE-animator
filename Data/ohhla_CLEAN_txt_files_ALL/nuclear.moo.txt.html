[Talib Kweli]
Transmittin.

[Donte]
Unorthodox, out of proportion
Slop, nuclear hip-hop
Tell the feds I'ma hidden underground warhead
And when we go to Armageddon, I'll leave more dead
You can kill what's killed, innocent ain't guilt
I feel like pissin on your bed on that american quilt
Keep my head at the tilt, ten is not what you spilt
The kids still can believe these pyramids I built
How Niagara Falls, what time death calls
I shoot the gift and I'm still like a myth to y'all
Pitfall, get on your knees and crawl
Through the leaves, as steady, as he goes
Y'all ain't ready for these flows
Graphic, 3-D-O's lyrically CD's pose
With the flash out your nose, like some fresh kilos
I devour, your energy feild like powder
Meteor shower slayin, decayin meteor power

[Talib Kweli]
I fly in, in the decked of the deckedets
My presense be evacuate, in the presidents residence
They never seen evidence of somethin like this
Ever since the big bang theory
And that's just a theory, hear me
Fallout shelters, and the heat swelters
Main book me a flight on Delta (You's a flight outta town)
I seen the plan as clear as an Azima
They got the CIA, the NAS, FBI, and FEMA
Darsika you and the baby stay with Cheryl
While I find an underground spot, I know of several
I'm comin of age, and my special powers are showin
Babylonian towers is blowin away in the wind
I clense like showers, the sins from men
They bugged everyone of my kin, I'm not sure what's happenin

[Chorus] 2x
Nuclear hip-hop, non-stop (non-stop)
Non-stop, non stop... (Continue to rock unorthodox)

[Talib Kweli]
They sayin the rhymes that I write is unforgetable
And the styles I bust, is to mysteriously luxurious and lushious
Like shots to the vein, the high rushes
Straight to your brain, your focus is in my clutches
As much as you pretend somethin such as your end
Won't happen for awhile, you are livin in denial
You were born, from liberated moms abscorn
My family's torn, I'm the third eye of this hip-hop storm
In my energy feild, phony men'll be killed
Some of my files top secret, with the government seal
Now they own us, cuz they want us, to be goners
This is the time, who is the warner?
We been preparing our techs in the van
And Rampage is steering, let's make this jam
Doing backwards changes moods on the land

[Main Flo]
My land survives plans like a stand
Nuclear like 1945 in Japan
I foreign aid my conflicts with porn raids
When my snoring days were roaring like soaring grenades
My average plot, took me to established spots
Ravage docks, take control like Tavey Stocks
Just mind control torque aight
Wanna break with contacts, with mental cord, jackin four right
I'll make you cough more {*coughs*}
With long term effects just like the Gulf War
Not purse Benon, but I sensed the charge
For war in the east, when I lynched the guards
Teams flips, money's king, assassination teams was clean
Like Gipsapp ravines
Regime caps, Korean gaps, was freein blacks
A way out, had me seein traps

[Donte]
Yea, so I came in the forms of migraines
And torn by brain fly crane style, I drain Habec pals
Poppin all se-niles, with these for being foul
Man enough to carry cuffs, man enough to stand trial
You feel guilty by association
When I capture your mind, then the rest'll motivate ya
My brain is a weapon strong enough to hold a nation
While balancing, galaxies and planets
You can't understand it, while you out in seas stranded
Visualize, infinite individual eyes
When they realize the way we make the spiritual riiiissseee

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Non stop..</pre>
