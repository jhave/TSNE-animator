Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Young Thug x4]
Baby pass me the hookah
Pass me the hookah
Pass the hookah
Pass the hookah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Damn I love this place
I'm a rich nigga got chanel on my waist
Run up on me playin I'mma aim it at ya face
And that go for anybody... anyways
I'm a rich blood by the way
And I have swag roll it all like a tape
Fish scale, yeah I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man I said I need some space
My new car get geeked up
I just paid a cop, now Im running out of coupes
Panoramic top, I'mma put it on the rocks
Crawl, walk and hop, got all these bitches shocked
Stone molly whiter than my socks
I don't, I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap
Clowning you niggas I see you flop
I buy pints by the 2 no Pac

[Chorus: Young Thug x7]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Rubbin on my chain blowing cloudmatic
Smoke something with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back relax and talk mathematics
Later on we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt said 'Where the hookah y'all?'
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong
It's all set; Mozart art on the blog so wet
I got a where I want her and I ain't done yet
Looking at your future baby put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight
Tell them bitches 'mmm fuck that'
You wanna lay in bed I got a magic carpet for that ass yes
I'm also on one
Got two Olsen's on me
Big homie
Young Thugger Thugger rolling
Rolls Royce so shorty

[Chorus: Young Thug x7]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Ben Frank baddies in the Benz waggin'
You know she want a ride home hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggy
You know that life lavish
Lifestyles like this gon' need magnums
Pass baby
Welcome to rich class baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl but black girl ghetto fly ting
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes don't cry inhale and breath regular
My baby on it
High at the crack of dawn and
Baby shape, figure 8 like Picasso draw ya
Oh yes I'm winnin'
Bling kingin'
Ring blingin'
Like like for no reason
Let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes we close friends
Don't get choked smoking OG Oakland
Shout out Oakland

[Chorus: Young Thug x7]</pre>
