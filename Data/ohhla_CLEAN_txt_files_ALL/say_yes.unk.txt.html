[Intro/Chorus: Unk]
Baby girl all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me and I'll relieve your stress
Whatever your problem might be
Come and get with me and get it off yo' chest
Baby girl, all you gotta do is say yes
Come get with me I'll make it worth your while
Get in between and be trippin with a smile
Let me make you feel so riiiiight~!

[Unk]
Whassup ma, how you doin?
Twenty-fo' in the waist that's how you do it?
Rockin them Sell with the waistline low
The kind I like that let the crack show
I ain't never did shit but rock mic and fuck hoes
Between me and you, the shit's gettin old
I could see me and you, in the skrill
Or ridin shotgun while you whippin the wheel
Come take a trip...
wit'cha boy Unk, I want what you want
Don't be talkin 'bout what you don't
Open that bottle, shots of Patron
Let's get it on...
Fo'play my way and she bumpin my song
Five in the morn'
She holla one mo' round, started lickin my cone
Y, E-S, I could take away, yo' stress
I say Y, E-S, I could take away yo' stress

[Chorus] - first half only

[Unk]
So whassup ma, is you down or what?
I can see it in your eyes that you ready to cut
Meet me at the crib if you ready to cut
The lights down low, if you stressin, for what?
If your car messed up, you can borrow one of mine
You got credit card debt, you can borrow one of mine
Just say yes, you can have a piece of mine
That nigga ain't ready, I tote a Glock 9
And then fo' sho' do'
Blowin kush, we can do it in slow-mo
From the front to the back if you say so
Just don't say no cause I'm feelin yo'
whole vibe cause your eyes got me hypnotized
Thick thighs, you don't wanna come and get your prize
And that's you and me, in a life of luxury
Say yes and that's just how it's gon' be

[Chorus]

[Dru]
Baby girl don't liiiie to me, I know you wanna do it
Saw the way that you were lookin when we was cruisin
I know I ain't the type to buy you a tulip
Give you a blunt and weed, let's get woozy
Don't say maybe
Cause I ain't askin you to be my lady
Might as well say yes and you'll get a night of sex
Rough stuff without cuffs we'll make it
Two into one, now you beggin me
But it's all good, just hit me up
I reply "Hell yeah~!"
Tell me the truth, well shorty can you take it?
I think you can, no I know you will
Wait and chill, I'm just bein real
Sit back, relax
Now tell me shorty - how do you feel?
Do you wanna be my girl (yeah)
So you wanna be my queen (yeah)
All you gotta do is agree
But I can't promise a damn thang
Just get down

[Chorus] - first half only
