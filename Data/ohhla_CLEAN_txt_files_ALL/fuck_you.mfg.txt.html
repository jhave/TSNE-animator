Aw you motherfuckers

[MF Grimm]
MF Grimm Reaper, one of the best
I battle DMX, spit with KRS
Rock with Tupac, roll with Death Row
KMD, Kool G Rap, Freddie Foxxx know
Lord Finesse, Tragedi, Nas, Large Pro
King Sun, Just-Ice, deeper I can go
Stuck in street wars, back and forth murders
My name said by someone never heard of? Nah
This bitch wanna be a gangsta, scream fuck it
Got my hand up his ass like a puppet
Try to disrespect me, fronting like he live
Turned into a bitch, make him apologize
No negotiations, brought it to his face
On Myspace I turned his face to my space
Disrespectful, to my race
Your career didn't get started, now erased
Nigga climb through your window, tie 'em up, burn 'em
Kill master, carve in chest Nat Turner
That nigga that run with you, he's a traitor
House nigga, put him in a skirt and blouse nigga
Manhattan murder, you bitch nigga I'm a vet
I'll body you before I let you disrespect
Every fucked up tape for the internet
The redneck who oppress us sign your check
So who you really working for?
I'm a pimp bitch, fuck the camouflage I can spot a whore
I'm calling you out, I declare war
At shows there'll be blood on the floor
This is what happen when you fuck with Mad Flow
Tough guys get beat up and shot at they shows
Grabbed up, stabbed on stage, die slow
Going AWOL toy solider what the fuck you on?
Freedom fighter to frightened to fire firearms
Salute the general, you're not my rank son
Challenge me, fans salute you 21 guns

Fuck you (x14)

Fuck you up when I see you
Put one in your ass
Right on stage bitches
Yeah y'all wanna fuck with me?
You thought I was just gonna let that shit slide?
That shit ain't gonna slide motherfuckers
Yeah
Niggas better run
