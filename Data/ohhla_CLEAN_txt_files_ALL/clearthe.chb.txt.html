[Verse 1]
Like the blessing of kids, none budhist the breeze
And the vocal mist scared and gets maried to ?
Exec's 'recs, discripting I bounce checks and the big cribs
And the promise of sex layed
From costumes contaning Shell Adidas, and the Runners and Gooses
And the rap companion ?leaders?
And the phone and the celular way stayed Rome
?Lebotomizinc? the Aribic ??? ? 
I arrive in a nick of time
Drowning in depht with the bullshit rhyme lyrics
After 10 to kill boom critics
With the chrome and my man Curt Hon with the ??
And this might, if you like the no mic holders
And the Flatbush ?gushies? the ruffneck soldiers
Told me: "Come from stick place flex"
So (I hate/hiate) this thug 
Clear the decks

[Chorus]
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--

[Verse 2]
Before lies within our souls, within our self
Shakespare. I bought some ?? wrote that last year
This street game birth to all those lyrical ?burks?
Tradition of gun stunts ?deriping? up skirts
In their rhyme silly ? ? with mine same beat,
Same bass and their usual ?charms?
This beats trumble
This asumble with the Hudson and the sleepers puff spliffs
Eyes reder then the Russians eye
Infiltrate that this beats Jewel made
In the nickle plated cellar with those tons of crates
Strictly in fact on a ??? fort
Brought up on a first hot trend swift, no corpse
You live and up outta the exec's wish to follow
While the grass roots took to you like a ??
I tend to become overwaxed on the set
Catch wreck and clear the decks

[Chorus]
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--

[Verse 3]
The usual Chubb Rock shit was strictly smilie
The next is my number one pick Fuck Rolley !
I'll run a New York undercover kinda brotha
The Flipside of the mental is a lover
While the burbs work into a wall of nouns
Profound bits of english profound
My cerebium tends to gas then leave 'em
In a unusual sceen cuts ?? ??
Done vibes bones and a chrome metronome
And the Lexus dreams to keep up with the jones
Magazines this then start admiring. Why ?
Cause New York Times ain't hiaring
Prepetual addits then creditin
Feature full page lies with the marathons
Of bogus zip-soft more Rick plexin'
Energize biceps
Clear the decks

[Chorus]
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--
--Clear the deck--
--Aa-aaaa--
--Mc's go run like a bomb threat--</pre>
