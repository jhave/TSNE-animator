It's like this yo, and we don't stop!
Jay-Z
Check it
I get deep and dark like ditches
But when I rap I come off like that without the glitches
Never crossed the black cat with the riches
I'm leaving Stevie sayin' no Wonder you're superstitious!
Beef, I'm with it, simple, ya'll can all get it
Ya'll don't all get it
Don't nobody of mind for this matter
Can gather the data until ya mind don't matter!
I bubble like lather, hustle like the lead-off batter?
Cause all that matters is the money, 'til it ain't funny!
You feel me? When the beast screams kill me
Don't jerk me boy, I rip it silly!
I'll let you rise of course, but if you don't fall off on your own
Emcee's I cut off at the knees like shorts
It gets worst! If you don't care for my sick thoughts like a nurse!
With no known remedy, I'm leaving boys and men on bended knee till the end of the road
I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale

Check it out!
The nerve of these herbs
Ya'll know which swerve from the curb in the LAX
The best observe
I'm splashing, splurging, dashing that's my word ya know
Champagne glass is crashing, can't ration
Used to having a whole lot, so dough, I blow a lot
Had a buck fifty while you were still taking skibby to school
Ran with one of them cats that hides Tiffany's for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping out of cabs in Krush Groove
I was scheming and plotting mostly
Dreaming alive, but look what it got me!
Four cars and four hundred shots later
You know what I mean!</pre>
