[Cam'Ron]
Killa, What we want uh I want ya'll to get the fuck off my dick

[Verse 1: Cam'Ron]
Yo, Yo, Ayo
I just wanna come through ice in the crown
I just want the coke price to go down
I just wanna get a couple months, dog
Not like for these pounds
I just wanna have this orgy and these dikes to be down
Want dro when I'm chiefin
Want doe for some reason
Want hoes to stop coming over knowing they bleeding
I want head from east nava
I wanna get the benz at least dropper
Painted peach-cobbler
Want a girl who don't need prada
She could be a damn reeboker
Long as she freak proper
I'm only asking for Halle, Janet, Toni Braxton
Come over show ya homie action
I want em now I want em wild I wanna bone they back in
I wanna whip I wanna drop I wanna chrome reaction
You should know I'd give a kidney to ya'll
I want my women to shine I want my niggaz to ball
I want it all

[Chorus]

[Juelz]
Come on, Juelz, Dip Set killa killa, ya'll know what the fuck I want

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Yo, Yo
Yo, I just wanna get money 
I just wanna get hoes 
I just wanna smoke weed and o's
I just wanna get a million get low
I just wanna do a album , shit 4
I just wanna live rich not po
I just wanna be happy not stress
I just want my girl to know right now I'm not happy I'm stress
I just want the struggle to stop
But on this beat I don't wanna talk I just want the muzzle to pop
I don't want a job I just wanna hustle the Roc
I just love the way that coke fluff in the pot
I just want the coupe to be pretty
I just wanna cruise through the city 
Baby, I just want ya ass to be fat
I just wanna play tag from the back
I just wanna go half on the sack
I just want my dick to fit in ya mouth
I just wanna sit in the house
I just wanna make music for my niggaz to bounce, come on

[Chorus]

[Cam and Juelz Talking]

[Verse 3]
[Cam'Ron]
I just want you to know you'll get slapped in ya face 
I just wanna know what happened to mase
I just want him to know,
Rock dem jewels flash that chrome
Its all good you can come back home
If you want
[Juelz]
Ayo, I just want this paper to be straight
I just want this cake to hurry up and bake
So I can send it upstate
I just want my money back in a week
I just wanna get the fuck out this studio and back in the streets
[Cam]
I just wanna fuckin stop being aggie as hell
I just want head from Pattie Labelle
I just want when I'm stress when I'm vex 
Want L to pass me the L 
You don't want L to pass me the shells
It will get ugly
[Juelz]
I just want my moms to let me smoke weed in my home
I just want my nigga T to come home
I just want the v to be chorme
I just want these hoes to leave me alone
Come on, I want it all nigga
