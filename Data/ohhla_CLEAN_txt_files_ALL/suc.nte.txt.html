[Hook]
I'm so thoed, in the game
Southside Playaz, Screwed Up Click mayn
Southside Playaz, Screwed Up Click mayn
Southside Playas, Screwed Up Click mayn

[H.A.W.K.]
I'm thoed in the game, which means I'm off the chain
The flow's insane, you hear me coming through your bang
You can catch me in the turning lane, in an all terrain
With my right hand, guiding the grain
Think it's a game, look at the rocks in the chain
The watch and the ring, and how your dame is watching me mayn
H.A.W.K. is the name, the leader of the Screwed Up gang
Some'ing like Wu Tang, with a Southern slang
I'm Screwed up mayn, just need to do it up mayn
And you wonder why tracks, get chewed up mayn
So boot up mayn, the time is finally here
The world premier, we bout to end a few careers
I'm the Jordan of this shit, but I'm not Michael
And most niggaz act, like they on they cycle
And most of y'all niggaz flows, are recycled
S.U.C., we coming for the title we thoed

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
When the Don explodes, and unloads it's murder G
Original S.U.C., you rookies it's Don Ke
I bust my glock, till it pops and empty
And shatter your crew, if they test and tempt me
It's Screwed Up Click, monster flow is in me
And tell the whole world, Robert Earl just sent me
Cause I been thoed, with the rhyme
I sold a half a million records nigga, I ain't lying
Southside Playa, catch me macking on a dime
Some say the Don, the greatest of all time
Blow another dro sack, seats in the Lac back
Chop it if it's Fat Pat, smack gon get your hat cracked yeah
I'm getting blowed, on thangs
Let the kush burn, while I'm turning in your lane
I let the Rover Range, I'm hustling and getting change
Texas living legends, we thoed off in the game the game

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
I'm young black and grown, bad to the bone
7-60 from the rims, shop shagging it home
That nigga Dina in a zone, they better leave me alone
I'm the real deal authentic, a nigga can't clone
I'm a Southside Playa, Screwed Up Click mayn
With a sick spit game, cause a nigga spit caine mayn
I spit flames, like a human with a dragon head
S.U.C. taking over, on a mash for bread
Thoed in the game, driver seat holding the grain
They recite my verses word for word, holding they brain
I'm the gorilla that's untamed, still off the chain
Still spit it off the brain, I'm making em seeing my pain
Ain't nothing changed, still a ape on the track
Mob boss Sensei, got the state on my back
Hardest Pit hit em, make em fold like a stack
Ready for whatever, I'ma roll like a Lac

[Hook - 2x]

[C-Note]
C-Note quote unquote, but I'm still top billing
On the streets I made a killing, in this rap I made a million
Stacking cash to the ceiling, got my name from drug dealing
On the block niggaz chilling, but it's caps that they be pealing
It's Screwed Up Click, you get screwed up quick
Get your ass mixed up, in some screwed up shit
But I blew up quick, though I lost a few homies
R.I.P. to my niggaz, but I'm dissing all the fonies
I'ma ride for you Screw, I'ma ride for you Pat
I'ma ride for you Gator, lay them niggaz on they back
Lay them niggaz out flat, still squash the chit-chat
Still beat em with the bat, still breathing with the gat
Lil' niggaz picture that, tell them niggaz it's a wrap
Tell them niggaz it's a trap, hit them niggaz with the straps
They'll never make it out alive, will survive
Chunk the deuce for my side, let the wood wheel guide uh
