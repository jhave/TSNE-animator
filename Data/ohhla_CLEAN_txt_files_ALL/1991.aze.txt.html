[Azealia Banks]
Oh, la la la
Flirting with a cool French dude named Antoine
Wanna taste the pastry chocolate croissant
Ce soir with your bitch, cafe au lait
Voulez-vous nigga mad Francois
Who are you nigga, hahaha
Miss one, miss young, miss cutie pie
Young noobie, young coochy tight
Young juicy, young Uzi-mic
Rata-tat-tat-tat
Nick-nack pitty-pat-pat-pat
Silly cat, you know how that scratch
How you do that, do that, do do that that that
1991 my time has come
Oh nah nah Ma
Your time is done
Primadonna Mama, like a virgin
Private jets, my flights, no fly Virgin
I sell you, you buy, that's my version
Mommy tie these rhymes it's my verses
Oh me, oh my
Illuminati princess
Pyramid, one eye, on my assets
Here it is, off top, peep my progress
Here it is, off top, peep my progress
Peep my progress, here it is off top
He took her to the Louvre in Paris
You want a chance with a youngin
You wanna ruin the weave
I get the grams and the hundreds
And the shoe with the bleed
And fit the grams and the hundreds
Send the Lou to the V
High class, no school, the tuition is free
Lil Bam(bi) no fool
And tuition is G
Gimme the gem or the jewels
I'll commission a fee
I make hits motherfucker
Never do it for free, ha
Young tender from the NYC
No contender
None in my league
Young kill-em-in-the-denims
Young venom on the M-I-C
Young villain and
Developing the heat that's sick
Elite rap bitch
I gotta send that beat back quick
Tip-tipping on these niggaz, suck a d-dick
Cause you gonna be a bitch nigga
I'm be that bitch, what
Just believe that shit
You gonna be a bitch nigga
I'm be that bitch
Believe that shit
Believe that shit
Nigga I'ma be that bitch

[Azealia Banks]
Come around, come around
Let the litte Bambi run it down, run it down
With a sip of Bailey's
Sip of champy on the alls
Nineteen number naughty baby
Press it on your dial
Sex kitten honeys
No cougars in the house
I'm hush the rumors and the doubt
Came in the game with a beat and a bounce
Never for the fame, my feet on the ground
Cloud number nine, headed to the stars
Baby I ride with my mic in my bra
Baby I recite in the raw the appetite for life and the hunger for the more
The island of Manhattan
I was Born in New York, city never slumbers
I would always dream it never sleep to the hundreds
Coco with the cream in abundance
Million dollar baby you can get it if you want it, what

[Outro: repeat 2X[
NY rose me, most high chose me
Let me know what I can can can can do for you
If you don't speak, boy you know you won't see none
Let me know what a man man man man want
NY rose me, most high chose me
Let me know what I can can can can do for you
If you don't speak, boy you know you won't none
Let me know what a man man man man want</pre>
