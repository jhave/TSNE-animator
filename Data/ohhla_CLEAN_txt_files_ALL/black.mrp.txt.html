Kid: Hey dad I got in a fight with this white kid today at school.
P: Son, didn't I tell you I don't want you fighting?
Kid: But he called me a nigger.

[Master P]
I'm just a black man trapped in this white world (x5)
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

Its a shame when you can't send your kids, to decent schools
We live in the world for the laws and no rules
Gang-bangers, crease sides, and chalk lines
Correctional facilities full of juveniles doin' petty crimes
In this ghetto, got me crazy
Sometimes I wish, mama wouldn'ta made me
But its a shame when you gotta raise a baby
And the color of my skin might taint me

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world (x3)
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

And all the money can't change the color of your skin
Why so many blacks and Mexicans in the pen?
It is cause we VIOLENT?
But why Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and started smilin'?
So many people have dreams
But why society eliminated Martin Luther King?
And they tell us to be proud to be black
And at the same time Uncle John shoot us in the back
Independence, its a free country
No jobs, most blacks turn to street money
A bunch of ghetto full of drugs and alcohol
Where found history books about white laws
And tell me Hilfiger discriminate
And sell us clothes
But we can't blame him cause
We don't support the black stores
And only God can judge or point the finger and what's
White or black and red and blue equals gang banging

I'm just a black man trapped in this white world (x3)
And this goes to every woman, man, boy, and girl

(I'm just a black man
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain
(Hold on, hold on
Trapped in this white world)
I'm colorblind, so Lord won't you feel my pain

[Silkk]
P pray for your little brother
[Master P]
Silkk, keep your head up
[Silkk]
I'm tryin' but sometime I get fed up (Damn)
What about all of the people that died in the past?
Peers I can't get back with too many found guilty
And I know they didn't do it
But still they can't get back
I see the copper be tryin' to nail me
Police constantly trailin' me
Cause I'm young, rich, and black
I'm always under survelience
Dash me out the car
And wanna ask me who the car fuck
Thay allowed to carry guns
Can't never be convicted
Who that law fuck?
I'm guilty till proven innocent
Still we all equals, how do you figure?
Cop told me
"you weren't speeding but I'm gonna give you a ticket cause you a
nigger"
I seen the hardest of my homies
Break down in tears
A white judge looked them in the eyes
And gave them 35 years
Now its a everyday struggle
I hustle just to live
To raise your kids
When they got them teachin' them
Their parents better than them
They got me thinkin'
The color of my skin
Is a sin
I'm a black man in a white man's world
Where its set up for me not to win
Lookit, ain't that about a bitch
They look at us like we ain't shit
But lookit, I ain't racist, but face it, it exists
I'm a black man (Unghhhhh)

[Master P]
I'm just a black man trapped in this white world (x3)

Outro:
Check this out (check this out)
Underneath (underneath)
Ain't no black or white (there ain't no black or white)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all equal (we all equal)
We all (remember that)
Got the same opportunity
Whether we wanna be judges, doctors, or lawyers
Ain't a black or white thing
Pick the best man for the job
And there shouldn't be no hatin'
Where you live, if you can afford to buy a house
Should be able to live wherever you want
The same hospitality they give to athletes
And movie stars
Should give that same hospitality and companionship
To your neighbors
You heard me?
Y'all know it ain't a black and white thing with me
I just make music
For the reality
Only the real could feel this, huh
Only the real could feel this
