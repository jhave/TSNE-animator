[Busta Rhymes]
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes yall
Busta Rhymes in the place to be
So So Def, Flip Mode, J.D., Jagged Edge, check it
We keeps it hot to def you can't deny
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Til my people feelin' good, yes you'll react to mine
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
Before I hit you off
We'll bust a million and one
Raise your whole adrenaline baby have fun
I be rollin' with womens whippin' Benz and Beamers
Makes ya shivers when I delivers like Doc Quivers
I keeps the shit that'll get you outta your dressers
Pass the testers, overcoming the minor stressers
I got your message and only in a matter of seconds
I'll be there for you whippin' the five S's
Feel my jagged edge's bouncin' on fly records
While I bounce on smokin' beats like Benson &amp; Hedges
I'll be here by all for one baby one for all
Need a nigga call anytime I'll be there for yall

Sometimes you need someone to be with
But your private side just won't let you
How can I show that I love you so
And I care about everythang that happens to you

1-	So tell me do you have someone who you can call on
	Do you have somone that you trust
	And will they always be around you to protect you
	Will they be around when you need them the most

2-	When you're feeling low, nowhere to go
	You can call me, I'll be right there
	When you're feeling down, no one's around
	You can call me, I'll be right there

I know what you, you need from me
If you dial the phone I'll make you see
No one can do the things
That I'll do for you that's that
Give me that chance and I bet I can ease your mind

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

[Quick] (JD)
Can't speak it's way past due
For something new (I agree)
So live and direct from DC, it's J.E.
Since demos, we been makin' dem hoes hot
It's been a long time since you heard a crew rock the
spot like us
And plus, stay plus just what you missin'
If you can't stand the heat keep yo ass out the
kitchen
Stop bitchin', listen to how it should be done
(Where you from?)
Eastside til I die you don't want none</pre>
