[Intro]
C'mon shorty, let me get it in
Just let me, let me touch it then
Let me touch it (no!)
Why you actin like that shorty?
And we been fuckin around for awhile boo, y'knowmsayin?
C'mon let me, just put the head in (no!)
Check, uhh (oh no no no)

[Saigon]
Uh, shorty was a sweetie, believe me she was a darling
Even come cook us some grub when I was starvin
Never interrupted the thug, she said "pardon"
Only 18, and still was fuckin with Marvin
Her mother was a school teacher, her father was a sergeant
Them trickers in the club, my baby be out joggin
Would even go as far as givin the god noggin
But when it came to the coochie she just would not bargain
Did it all, takin her shoppin, the ice department
Even put shorty up in a real nice apartment
Would come over at night sometime with some roses, some white wine
Tryin to create the right time
for her to give me some behind, let me get it in
I know if I hit it once she gon' want me to hit again
And she said that she tryin to use discipline
I said, "Look lil' mama, you not listenin!"
Go 'head

[Chorus 2X: Devin the Dude]
If you're in love with me, and I'm in love wit'chu
Then it's alright for us to do what the lovers do
Just follow my lead, I'll show you what to do
Cause I know cuttin is somethin you're not accustomed to

[Saigon]
Uhh, they say I gotta put a ring on her finger before I ding-a-ling her
I understand, but the man ain't tryin to hear it
My brain wanna shake her mother's hand
My dick wanna hit her father with a car just for doin his job
Shit was comin so much it was problem god
Was stressin me like them white broads would see me on "Entourage"
Seen what's in the car garage, shit is a mess
Brand new CLS, dressed up by Funk Flex
That's besides the point, nigga I'm stressed
Either she give me some sex, or this relationship's put to a rest
Rather leave her than do her dirty, son this birdie's the best
I had to show that respect, she didn't deserve less
Step to her like "Boo, either we doin the do
Or you can give me the keys to the view cause we through"
She started cryin like, "How could you do?"
As I turned to walk away I heard her soft voice come out the blue
Said

[unknown female + Saigon]
After all the time you needed me here
How could you just turn and leave me here?
Never to look back and see these tears
Didn't you swear that you would treat me fair?

[Saigon]
Yeah, but I was lyin though/Lion-O, and I ain't no +Thundercat+
The skirt you got on mami, I want what's up under that
The shirt you got on boo-boo, I want what's up under that
I wanna see your booty d-do-d-do the thunderclap

[Chorus]

[Saigon] + (unknown female)
Boo-boo (yeah)
I know you're thinkin I'm a foul type man
But I ain't really seein how I can
When I'm just tryin to get my nuts out the sand, without my hand
Boo-boo
I know you're thinkin I'm a rude type dude (yup)
Spend all my money at the Moulin Rouge
Layin up with some shorty cute like you
But nah I'm in the stu' doin this for guess, who?
Yes, you (I don't know what else to say)
Yea-yea, go 'head (I mean, what you want me to say? Ha ha ha)
Say yes bitch! C'mon...

[Chorus]</pre>
