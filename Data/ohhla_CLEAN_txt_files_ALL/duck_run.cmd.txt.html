You better duck an run when you hear the tank comin' through,in a show or at a
sto' near you. When you hear No Limit Soldier or Bout It Bout It my tank dawgs
bout to get this muthafucka rowdy, them hoes bounce that ass in the front
line, an my thugs be throwin up gang signs an all they talk about is break 'em
off somethin' rolled an start fightin' 'til the muthafuckin' place close.Po-
Po's mad I'm smokin' weed on stage crowds gettin' smashed by da barracades.Red
an Blue be muggin' on both side 3-Ward niggas talkin' bout take it out side.An
them muthafuckin' GD's they got them Uzi's an they be bang like them niggas in
the movies,huh, you can come to my show for fun nigga,but be prepared to Duck
&amp; Run nigga....

Fiend;duck an run (better duck an run nigga),duck an run (you better duck an
run nigga),duck an run (said duck an run nigga),duck an run (duck an run, duck
an run)
