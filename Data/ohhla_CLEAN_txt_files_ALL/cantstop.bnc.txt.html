Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops

[LIL' HAWK]
Blood in, blood out
Steppin' up in my fresh red Chucks
All Crabs run up and all Crabs get rushed
Damn now I gots to watch my back again
Hooked up with the homies Mr. Mack and the 10
Cause if it's on then it's on let the funk begin
I'm goin' out like a soldier C and the M
45 on my lap 4 extra clips and
Lil' boy flue you don't wanna set trip
It ain't no stoppin' this shit
But you wouldn't have known
That them Crenshaw Mafia niggas keeps it rollin'
Cause if it's gon' pop then let it pop
Cause nigga with me is like I can't stop and I won't stop

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops

[LANIAK]
Tanqueray is the drink that gots me fucked up
So the first thang that I would like to say is West Up!
To my motherfuckin' Damu down Figueroa, the Mafioso
My East Side nigga Mango be up your homie but fuck a hoe though
My intro so way you need to ?nickel? gangsterism
I'm fadin' niggas, fadin' their evil back is gettin with 'em, plus I'm
Hittin' on a motherfuckin' ??
Until I dizzie bitch
I'll be high off chronic
I got these shouts out to my nigga Hawk duece
From Lil' Laniak duece
Because my nigga gets loose
To y'all niggas that's strapped I respect that
But still watch your back cause Laniak is bustin' Tecs back
It don't stop

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops

[GREEN EYES]
Now as I'm takin' the motherfuckin' phoney to the brains
My niggas claim that I'm insane on Crabs I'm goin' nuts main
Pumpin' lead in they ass like everyday
And make your fuckin' mama holler out C-K
Green Eyes - the 104 Blood gangsta
Promotin' Bloods and for Crabs I has no love
Shouts to the W's, SWANS, LANES and A.P.B.'s
FIVE LINE BOUNTY HUNTERS, B.P.S. and the I.N.G.'s
?? I can't forget about the CRENSHAW MAFIOSOS
And all my motherfucking homies claimin' WEIRDO

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop

[BATMAN]
Oh shit
.9 millermetre Crabs get served
I got the Blood, the G, the Cherry Koolay
And the Thunderbird
My motherfuckin' homies who be hangin' the Deuce
??? Freeze and niggas like me
We get loose
I put in work I drop a Crab nigga with my Glock
And when 'em hollow points spits I make his heart stop
We Bloods is anybody killer when I'm watching my back
Rebuilt the shadow of death
Is killing all blacks
?? the power is them eyes
Keep them motherfuckers peeled
And don't be a victim you get that ass killed
Crabs don't get caught slippin'
Don't stop won't stop
Eastside Swans, head to tip to top, Blood

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops

[YANK]
Click-click-bang was the sound of Glock 40, main
Five Lines four deep looking for some Rips to fade
Stabbin' down Imperial but ain't nothing poppin'
Buffle up on Brenshaw now we headed towards Bompton
At the 120th he had got stopped by the redlight
I grab the glizock I got the ?? and I grip that motherfucker tight
And I just might circle back around I finished
Pour one in your chest and watch your breath the man is quick
Fuck it, I'm messed up
And the Hunters is the blame, automatic is the weapon Gangsta Yank
Is my name
The Hunters can't stop and they won't stop

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops

[POPS &amp; DOG]
It's the P-O-P-S finna roll ya
C-K all day young motherfuckin' soldier
It's the Y-G Gangsta creep that bank ya, fuck Crabs
I break you down without a sound now I'm rollin your zig-zags
Uh, the shit that they claim makes me laugh
I tricky Rickets' life, we roll 'em up then I smoke their ass
Bloooooooood, I'm comin with that flow of the gangsta shit
I fuck this Crab bitch because she loved Bloods' dicks
I guess this static just gots to be your downfall
C-K when I'm sprayin' and I'm layin' down all y'all
I move creep real swift from the shoulders
If you press the issue then I gotta dismiss you
I'm the G Poppa D and I can't stop
I'm the Y-G D-O-G and I won't stop, fuck the Crabs

Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
Can't stop, won't stop
C-K till my motherfuckin' casket drops...</pre>
