(Jahlil Beats! Holla at me!)

[50 Cent]
Uhh, all I do is this
Stunt when I want, and rock newer shit
Uhh, all I do is this
Uhh, niggaz new to this

I'm super rich like Russell, naw Lyor
I'm decked out, my bitch smell like Dior
She's spoiled, she want it she can have that
Your bitch cool, but where her Birkin bag at?
You could tell a lot about a nigga by his bitch
Be my guest, look at mine, I'm the shit
I'm hot, my shit bump coast to coast, don't it?
I get bread, my watch I blew a loaf on it
Get caught starin at that get smoked for it
Fool, my swag unlimited
So fly ain't shit I can't buy
Louboutin kicks; my Louboutin bitch
Fresh off the runway, get you one one day
Catch me in Milan, tuxedo on
The Black James Bond, nigga I'm a don
I do what I want, when and where I want

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - bitch quit playin
Put yo' hands up (put 'em up)
High where my eyes could see (what's up)
You know you wanna party with me (let's fuck)
We whylin in the place to be - nigga quit playin

[50 Cent]
Catch me ridin solo, Purple Label polo
Paparazz' photo, my side bitch in Manolo
It's all about dough though, my knuckle game like Cotto
Plus I get to shootin but keep that on the low though
Ay~! Nigga I ain't really got to talk about it
Me I get paper, moves I make major
Shoes I rock gator, wing tips playa
My style so pure, I'm so couture
I'm down by law, certified B-boy
Hold up, wait a minute - money I'm gon' spend it
Or why the fuck would I hustle hard to get it?
So many flows the hoes be on the diddick
And when they pop it and lock it they know I'm wit it
"Dame lingua," give me tongue while I hit it
She a star, fresh from P.R.
Give me more, baby give me more

[Chorus]</pre>
