Uh, check it out now (6x)

Chorus (2x):

Everyday and all night
I dream of holding you tight
Crazy as I may seem
You're all that I ever need, babe

I gotta make you mine, you're someone I wanna own
I wanna be the one you call when you feelin alone
I'm gonna make it easy for you to unedrstand
You can be the infamous woman
That partner in hand could be me, pleasurable company
Gettin you like enter, when I feel on your body
It done hit me like "Jesus, please"
You movin authentic 'cause energy sent to me knees that
Make em buckle (Baby) Speakin a buckle
Why don't you undo yours, and make our body hussle
Isn't it love when two body collide
Lettin all sparks that resembles Fourth of July skies
And you know how much I care about you right (Oh yeah)
When you're on my mind, I'ma be alright (Oh yeah)
I wanna love you down in so many ways (Oh yeah)
When I'm feeling blue, I think of you and say (Oh yeah)
And if you knew how deep I feel about you girl, then you will
Not think twice when I ask to hook up and go chill
It could be in my place (On my place)
Or your place (Or your place)
And we could let our body conversate, 'cause

Chorus (2x)

This ain't no attempt to get all up in your jeans
Even though I wanna make you scream to extreme
Our mouths give you chocolate treats like Halloween
Act out scenes where you and I wrote, my scene 'cause it's
(Something in the way you make me feel)
You got me feelin like I'm supposed to feel
Just you and I, upclose and personal
I'll be gentle while you lettin your emotional feel
(Chick-a-boom-boom) And you got it good like that
When you and I interact you'll be whipped on contact
'Cause once you Willy, you never go back
Baby, once you go Willy, you never go back
I said how much I care about you right (Oh yeah)
When you on my mind, I'ma be alright (Oh yeah)
I wanna love you down in so many ways (Oh yeah)
When I'm feeling blue, I think of you and say (Oh yeah)
And since you knew how deep I feel about you girl, then you will
Not think twice when I ask to hook up and go chill
It could be in my place (On my place)
Or your place (Or your place)
And we could let our body conversate, 'cause

Chorus (2x)

(Something in the way you make me feel)
You got me feelin like I'm supposed to feel (Feel)
You got me feelin like I'm supposed to feel (Feel)
You got me feelin like I'm supposed to feel (Tell me babe)

[Repeat]

(Hmm...baby, alright)
You're all I need, babe, slow it down
You're all I need, babe, slow it down, uh, yeah yeah, uh

You're all I need babe (3x)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it won't stop, 'cause

You got me feelin like I'm supposed to feel
The way I'm supposed to feel (2x)</pre>
