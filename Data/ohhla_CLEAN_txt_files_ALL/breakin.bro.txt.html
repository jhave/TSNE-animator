[Intro: Phonte]
Hey baby look here, this new song I wrote it's got that nice groove that everybody dancin to
And when I play it it kind of remind me of me and you
I mean, it's it's one more thing I wanna talk about now look
It's It's It's time now for you to come home now
Look everybody got there problems I'm dealin with mine
I I I done gave up my narcotic, I'm a changed man!!!!!!
 
[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, how many ways can I say I'm done fishin?
You wanted the role, smashed the audition
Havin a partner for a man in my position
Eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
and some say that it was the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between your knees
On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once and again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin out for love, men do it to cum
"Not a Player" like Pun, but when shorty's get to grabbin on me
the last thought I get is, "Poobie run!"
To them girls wishin on a star this will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is, hon - One!
 
[Chorus: Phonte] (R&amp;B Sample)
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)
 
[Lil Wayne] (R&amp;B Sample)
Yeah! She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think bout leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)
 
[Verse 2: Phonte]
We was high school sweethearts, talkin since we was teens
Every mornin, and every ev-ening
Ten years later, she eatin that Lean Cuisine
I'm on the field, straight gone off that creatine
in the NFL - which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back, the wifey she like, "Stop the song"
"I'm takin the kids to my momma's, I'm out, I'm gone!" - whoa!
Momma was like, "Baby now, I hate to see your tears
But I been with your daddy for bout 35 years
And in my day, I had to turn a blind eye to cheatin
but I ain't never had to wear no black eyes from beatings
As long as he doin right, by you and the kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is?
I ain't sayin that it's right, but we often pay the price
cause a woman's life is love, a man's love is life
and he gon live it to the fullest, 
and I ain't tryna pull you down, or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that ALL niggas is dogs
Better to have a rich Pit than a broke German Shepard, uh!"
 
[Chorus: Phonte]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)
 
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Word up, I say I don't have nothin If I don't have you
Like Sade, you got the +Sweetest Taboo+
And my game is skin deep like the first tattoo
I gets all in your head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey! Girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like the Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play fair like roller coasters and clowns
Yeah! You gotta hold your soldier down
Even when the war is lookin like, it is right around the corner
And you don't wanna leave me believe me
Cause I can turn you on like a person on TV
It's Young Weezy, I know what you thought
But I'm just here to play my part so, don't go breakin my heart
 
[Chorus: Lil Wayne] (R&amp;B Sample)
Yeah! She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think bout leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)
[Chorus: Phonte]
She say she love me won't leave me won't never let me go
But if you think of leavin you need to let me know
We better together than further apart
So darlin don't go breakin my heart (Don't go breakin my heart)</pre>
