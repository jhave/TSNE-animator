[Fabolous]
Aiyyo Drama this the first
This the first time you had a nigga from Brooklyn
I think with a gangsta grill man
And I-I-I, I just wanna
I-I just wanna say thank you man
for takin Brooklyn down bottom y'knahmsayin?
Lettin niggaz see what's goin on man
I know niggaz heard a lot about Brooklyn
They heard about Big, they heard about Jay
But Brooklyn's still comin nigga, we still comin
There's a lot of niggaz, y'knahmean? Brooklyn is one of the
hungriest places in this muh'fuckin planet
We walk around with our ribs touchin nigga
I'm still touchin - e'rywhere I walk</pre>
