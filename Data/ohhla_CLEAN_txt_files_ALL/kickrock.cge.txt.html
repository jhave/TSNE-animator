[Junkie] Hey, what's up man?
[Cage] Hey, what's going on man?
[Junkie] Not much, I just got out of rehab a couple hours ago...
[Cage] Out of rehab!? Man, you look high as hell!
[Junkie] Hey, forget you man! Anyway, you got a cigarette?
[Cage] Uuuuuuuum, a cigarette?

[Chorus]
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks, motherfucker!
Kick rocks!

[Talking]
[Some dude] Oh, man! Chris, what's going on, man? How you been?
[Cage] Oh, you know... just playing a gig tonight
[Some dude] Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say, uhh... could you get me on the list tonight?
[Cage] I guess I could give you a plus 1 or something...
[Some dude] Yeah, okay, yeah. Sweet! Well, I've got a couple more people with me man, do you think you could hook it up?
[Cage] Oh... what do you need?
[Some dude]: Let's see, I've got me, I've got Suzy...
[Cage] You've gotta be kidding me...
[Some dude] Can I get a plus 6?
[Cage] Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh...

[Chorus]
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
[Some dude] Yo what the fuck do you mean kick rocks, man?
[Cage] It means take a fucking walk
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks, motherfucker!
Kick rocks!

[Talking]
I'm sorry I really need to take this... Hello?
Oh hey mom, what's going on?
Oh you know, the usual, not much. How you doing?
Are you serious? Are you okay?
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about that mom, but uh look, I'm kinda busy right now
Help you move furniture!?
You're kinda breaking up...
Can you hear me!?

[Chorus]
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks!
Kick rocks, motherfucker!
Kick rocks!
