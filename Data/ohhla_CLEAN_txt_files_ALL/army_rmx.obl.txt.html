Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal...
Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal...

[Verse 1]
Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal
Flyin through the sky, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military top secret mission
You ain't seen nothin yet; it's like a stealth jet
My mental plane take flight, I air strike the mic
The mystery pilot in the cockpit all night
See how I keep the shows live?
I never lost a dog fight, see how my enemies nose dive?
The name of my plane is The Pitbull Terrier
Keep my targets locked in, the more the merrier
Over your head when I break the sound barrier
So fly my voice need a aircraft carrier
Travel airwaves, every track is a runway
Keepin jams packed like church on Easter Sunday
Rappers thinkin they shall over come one day
They must be +dreamin+, and I'm lyrical James Earl Ray

It's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal...

[Verse 2]
Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal
Marchin 'cross land, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military top secret mission
You ain't seen nothin yet; I roll up on your set
With speed, movin like a German Blitz-Kreig
MC's, be like Chuck Norris comin to get these rhymes
I got what they +Missin, in Action+
Stand at attention, military fashion
And listen to the rappin Rambo, the mic commando
Fully equipped, I write rhymes for extra ammo
Too much to handle, you had the nerve to try to grab the mic
That's like Herns tryin to fight Hagler
I'm too +Marvelous+, when I'm droppin this, watch the mic
turn into a nuclear test site
MC's better heed the words of Tina (why?)
Cause we don't need another Hiro-shima -- check it out

It's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal...
Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal...

[Verse 3]
Yo it's the OneManArmy, General Subliminal
Dive into the water, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military top secret mission
You ain't seen nothin yet; how deep can I get?
Six thousand leagues beneath MC/sea level
A submarine hero, with torpedo steelos
My strategies turn MC's into P.O.-W.'s
I love to battle with other rappers and sink they battleships
I send 'em up the creek in they lifeboats, paddlists
Salt water, Navy SEAL strategist
Dive into the your brain waves with the backstroke, fabulous
Ain't interested if it's shark infested
Sonar equipment was a stupid investment
You can't see my style and I've shown this
Too many times, I've been in more missions than the homeless
Always on point like a compass, 360 degree
All around MC, the OneManArmy

[Outro]
General Subliminal, ready for war with syllables
Literary, military top secret mission
You ain't seen nothin yet...

Yo it's the OneMan, Subliminal
Ready for war with
Top secret mission... Army
Ready for war with syllables
Literary, military top secret mission</pre>
