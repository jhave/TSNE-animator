What did I do wrong

(CHORUS)(repeat)
What did I do wrong
Don't wanna live

My momma was a dope fiend but what I mean
She was mannic depressed, like the Supremes
And all my tears wiped with a cleanex
I'm on the scene and I drop dead like River Phoenix
A life I can't handle, so I drink Jack Daniels
Straight, I bought me a 38 with one shiny silver bullet
For the werewolf in me I don't pretend to be
I'm fucked up off life
I walk around with a bloody butcher knife
I wanna kill myself, but first
I think about what's worse
I vision my body take a ride in a hearse
And somebody, anybody, but nobody hears
Buried alived, pine box, and my deepest fears
I been doin' dope since I was 13
But when I close my eyes unconciously I scream

(CHROUS)

Overdose scare again, I'm doin' heroin
So been suckin' my leg like Nancy Kerragan
Heroin addict like Kurt Cobain
Needle's in your dick, 'cause your arms outta veins
The system raped me, society hates me
The man in the mirror is scared to face me
My only friend is me, but how can I pretend to be
My friend, I'm public enemy
A number one, son of a shotgun
So when I blasphamy, I bust a brain cell
Dead cells make me faint
But I can't faint no more I don't dream and never sleep walk
Uncut dope make me comotose
Growin' up with the scandalous from here to Los Angeles
What does it mean, infetamine, niggaz so envy they green
As I watch the fiends fiend, my mind screams

(CHORUS)

Your body's cold you feel numb from your addiction
Just say no's a contradiction
It seems like the whole world's high
And I'm tryin' not to fry, brain cells passin' time until I die
Suicide contemplated everything's drug related
I wish when my father got erect he woulda masturbated
Sperm concentrated now they sell it at the bank
What has life come to? Tell me whatta you think?
Crack babies be born like everyday
I sucker born every minute right around my way
What a rush when you're brain bust
All your shit got flushed down the toilet stew
What a fool
Who gives a fuck if you self-destruct
All you hoes and dreams 'cause you just a fiend
And this world ain't big enough for the both of us
Who can I trust with one slug down the bust?
And say

(CHORUS)</pre>
