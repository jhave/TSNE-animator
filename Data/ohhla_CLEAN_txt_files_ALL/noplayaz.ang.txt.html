CHORUS: Angie and Lil' Mo 
Even though you got no money 
Other chicks be actin funny 
It don't matter boy cuz I got love for you 
  [a nice guy that like to fuck alot]
I'm so tired of all these playaz 
And I don't mean to be a hater 
But I know just what I'm lookin for 
  [a nice guy that like to fuck alot]
 
[Verse 1]
This is for my on the low niggas 
Average joe niggas 
You know, I'm tallkin plain ol' niggas 
Big up, big up all the regular dudes 
Appreciate 'em after dealin wit a playa or two
What I'm sayin to you, is all the ice is nice 
But a girl get tired of payin the price 
See it aint what we eat, it's how we do 
I like Mr. Chal, but we can do BBQ 
Fuckin wit you, you gon get to my heart 
We can chill, crack jokes, smoke a L in the park 
And when it come to lovin, you go hard... 
Yeah, now that's really what a girl want 
And uh, nobody can do me 
Like you, so you the one that I'm givin it to 
For rich or tore up, I'm in it wit you 
For you fake smooth niggas, I'm finished wit you 
Beat it 
 
CHORUS
 
[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, uh 
I shine, you shine 
Gotta alotta big things playa that's nice 
I don't wanna knock your hustle but I know your kind 
And I don't trust ya so I'm lookin for mine 
Not tryin to sell me the gathos, not poppin bottles 
Not tryin to stick it to models 
You know misled bitches, after your riches 
Try to throw me in the mix don't even notice a difference
I don't like Coogie sweaters anyway 
I like a nigga in a hoodie better anyday 
I'm not a chick-en, I'm not to be tricked on 
Matter fact you the rea-son 
That I, don't wanna get with playaz no more 
I wanna low key nigga fo' sho 
You don't really gotta be my boyfriend 
I'm sayin though...
