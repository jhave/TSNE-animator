[Sample from "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"]
I'm not hear to make a record, you dumb cracker
They broadcast me out on the radio

[MF Grimm]
Off guard, sleeping hard, like it couldn't happen
Tore me up, riddled up, bullets yeah they hoppin'
Like bunny rabbits, to the creator I'm sent back
Let me live twice, he said "nah, it's a wrap"
Lives are taken when it's about the paper
Some are starving and hungry for the power
Others are thirsty for the blood and love the pleasure
Don't want to go so I summon the devil
I said

Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
I'll make the best of it
Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
Then my soul you'll get
Cause I can't handle it
Revenge I need the shit
I wanna live on like I'm Spawn, raisin' hell and fits
Grant me what I need
Brought back and make 'em bleed
I want 'em all gone cause I'm gone and God won't let me leave
So listen up, I'm asking you to give me
One more chance like them girls be begging Biggie
Cause I got to dance with these niggas who tried to kill me
If God don't feel me, then Satan I know you hear me
The fact I summoned you, some will find silly
But they never been dead, so why the fuck really
Would I stop to be undead or fed until they under
And undercovers can't stop me nor the feds
Bowling for dollars, knock 'em down for the bread
Kingpin is the charge cause large is bloodshed
The seventh circle, the square I'll rest my head
Cause they step to my b.i. this is what I said
I said

Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
I'll make the best of it
Lucifer Morningstar
(If you give me one more chance)
Then my soul you'll get
Cause I can't handle it
Revenge I need the shit
I wanna live on like I'm Spawn, raisin' hell and fits
Grant me what I need
Brought back to make them bleed
I want them all gone but I'm gone and God won't let me leave
So listen up, I'm asking you to give me
One more chance like them girls be begging Biggie
Cause I got to dance with these niggas who tried to kill me
If God don't feel me, then Satan I know you hear me

Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)
Revenge (get it, get it)

[Sample from "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"]
I have it from the highest authority
That that Negro sold his soul to the devil!

Oh!

W-W-Wait a minute now folks, it's true!
It's true!
Wait a minute folks no
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?</pre>
