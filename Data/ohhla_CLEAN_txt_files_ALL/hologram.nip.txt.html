Holograms - 11x

OK motherfucker, I'm pissed to the max
A Texas typhoon horror 30 blade torture axe
Bitch ass devil, its murders I'm bringing 'em
A reborn foot soldier, thirsting for craniums

Psycho, catch my drift
I'll come up to your kids,click-click and conjure a quick death
Rip out your face cause I take shit serious
He said something about my mama, by that time I'm delirious

Bring on the spirits, I'm a spiritual man
sacrificing the devils, ???, so lets join hands
All praise to psychos,eating flesh is a hobby
Holiday inn homicides,hundreds of heads in the lobby

Surgery, the surgeon said lets go
He saw the corpse and said dont call me for this shit no mo'
Peel his cap back, this bitch nigga want to riff
Only on my command, we throwing his motherfucking ass up off a cliff

Rough slice from a knife, hold him up
Paramedics were scared, the coroner said I'll roll him up
Niggas that oppose me, you fought out this jam
Of evil spiritual illusions with ghostly physical holograms

I'm having holograms! - 4X

Watch as the Psyche destroys like a flood
Even though my pen writes in black
It seems like it writes in cold blood
For the pain that they give
Time I change my voice, white people die if they want to live

Now as I wake up the dead, 
I grab him by the face and ??? into the back of his head
Its crushed, like the butcher do meat
Manic depressive monster inside my mind ready to be unleashed

Death is like transforming a rhyme
Appear holy spirit in the form of Dr Psyche-instein
This is something I couldnt dodge
Look at all those astronauts flying there to peep the Gods

This is serious, my brain is a jail
Walking through the tunnels of my mind is like walking in hell
I had this talent since birth
At this moment right now Farrakhan is the wisest man on earth

Movies, seen one came around
Ink pen so evil, it weighed a thousand fucking pounds
Hes the sheep, disguised as a shepherd
Gun already loaded, we could get up in that mangy leopard

Step with the quickness,the deuce-five is dissing you
Duck from the bullets but the javelin aint missing you
Pissing you off, scrape up the blood from the floor
Tidal wave came so quick it soaked up 50 people or more

Now do I make myself clear?
East and West coast murder rates so high I feel it down here
So many styles and then, 
When the constitution was wrote that was death from an ink pen

I'm having holograms - 5x

(NIP talking)
A hologram is just a state of mind. You see a
picture thats really not there. Or is it really???

(NIP-evil voice)
Demented voice, demented style
Step to the devils demented chosen child
One by one all devils get dropped
Split open my chest
Squeeze my lungs until my heart stops

Pyscho ass nigga watch this fool go left
Somebody mutilate my body so I can show you it heals itself
Raging beast, raging beast
Blow up the elementary I'll bet we have peace-Kill

Enemies died, that is no lie, 
He dissed the coalition, ammunition Lil Frye
High off this weedGanksta Nip is not a sucker(?)
A psyche ward in 96 dead from an inkpen motherfucker

I'm having holograms - 5X (holograms) 14x</pre>
