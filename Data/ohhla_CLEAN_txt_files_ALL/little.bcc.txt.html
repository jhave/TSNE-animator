[Chorus: Tek and (Starang)]
Get a little bit of ass and a little bit of head (take that)
Little bit of haze and a little bit of dro  (pass that yo)
Get a little bit of goose and a little bit of mo (swig that)
Little bit of this little bit of that (true true true) that's tough
Get a little bit ex and a little bit of sex (mix that)
Little bit of coke and a little bit of dope (slang that)
Get a nice jersey along with a fit
Little bit of ones little bit of guns (stack that)
Little bit of Rocawear and some nice products (like that)
Little bit Nike and a little bit of Gucci (cop that yo)
Little bit of this and a little bit of that (true true true)

[Tek]
I know name is range bout' to get he rover man
Yall new names finito yall over lanes
Peep my form necks backs and pecks
Jeep wagon Cadillac truck drop Lex
I mean big checks and guns
Asses on bitches
E.P.M.D. album "Strictly Business"
I'm mean on the fizzy flow
Beam on the crizzy fo
Pockets got them lumps and I lean off the drizzy dro
So who know fuckin with smoke besides ya girl
Stick a dick all in her throat until she hurl
See Tek in the cars or treat us at the bar
Or V.I.P. and envy
(Starang and Tek combined)

[Starang]
Dressed up in Sweatpants, headbands call Dru
collect my advance
Hit the club up
Bouncer type chumps looking cut up
What up? Will in the house spark bud up
Switch up park the truck pull the six up
Almost had to smack some bitch up (for what yo?)
Opening the door I'm tryin to get my dick sucked
Ain't no mix up as I spark the spliff up
In the club I can't be on the low
Cause some ho from some show
Be like I know yo
I can't even get my grime on
Back up man I ain't here to get my rhyme on
Spend a little time until my time gone
Weed and Hennessey got a nigga mind gone yo

[Chorus]

[Buckshot]
Who that little bad ass nigga named Buck?
Made a little fast cash got a little stuck
Got a little fucked up in the game so what
I don't care when I'm here put your dancers up
Hands up or stand down
Cause if it get deeper than this in this bitch
Their comin like man down
A little bit of bouncers now
I know they wanna bounce us now
Seein the ___ by the little clout
Little shorty bad as hell
But look fowl come a little close to the crook
Don't get shook now
I'm hooked now
You got a little body on you baby
probably already took now
I spit a little game and you came
Got you like who that little man with the little frame?
A little fame
Your fuckin with the Boot Camp Clik shorty
Respect the name

[Chorus]

(Shorty)

[Steele]
Cocks, cunts, drugs, booze
Pamela Anderson, Penelope Cruz

Vivica's a fox and Maria's hotta
The Titi is fire
And the Vica Secretes
Came in with Calice and got all my peeps in

[Sean Price]
I ain't been in the club since the romp and chub rock
Doin the electric slide
when it was called the bus stop
When yall young niggaz was in school with ya luchbox
I was in club Bentley's silk shirt and my gun cocked
Red Parrot Rooftop
20's of coke bitch niggaz got they jewels popped
Yo, Shems to Baron shirt

Now that's tough
