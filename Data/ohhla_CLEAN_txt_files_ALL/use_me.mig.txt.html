Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Sedate me... Salacious, salty, &amp; sweet.
Im overwhelmed by tasty thoughts of you.
Daydream... my body's waving a white flag.
Take me, yeah, baby!

Now, I know I'm sober.
It's just so profound
That every wall I built up
Has coming crashing down.
Dont the waves pull the sand?
Dont the moon pull a tide, baby?
Well, I'm yours! Yea!

Use me. Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go...
Forgive me. It's the very first time
That I'm nervous. Can I trust you, huh?

Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on.
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me. I could teach you, yea.

Sensation... as I place my tongue on your lips
You overwhelmed by everything I do, oh!
Curse me, yea, with such a beautiful nightmare!
Dont wake me! Yea, baby!

Now, I know I'm sober.
It's just so profound, yea,
That every wall I built up
Has coming crashing down, yea!
Dont the waves pull the sand?
Dont the moon pull a tide, baby?
Well, I'm yours! Yea!

Use me. Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go...
Forgive me. It's the very first time
That I'm nervous. Can I trust you, huh?

Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on.
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me. I could teach you, yea.

Blissful collision as our bodies tangle, intertwine
Biting your lip (uh-uh) baby, put me inside
Crucified thoughts, tender moments on a ricochet
Purging my mind of the power I own
Fall into forever. Just forgive me.
I was faithless. Danger in your eyes.
Baby, you can devour me!
Defile me, yeah!

Use me. Wanna give you control
With the lights on
If I could just let go...
Forgive me. It's the very first time
That I'm nervous. Can I trust you, huh?

Trust me, while I take this off
With the lights on cause it turns me on.
If you're nervous, just let me show
You how to touch me. I could teach you, yea.
