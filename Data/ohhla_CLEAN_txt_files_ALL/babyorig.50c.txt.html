[Intro: sample of 50 Cent's "I Get Money"]
Have a baby - have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire-aire
Be a millionaire, be a - be a millionaire

[Interlude: sample]
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire-aire
Be a millionaire, be a - be a millionaire

[Chorus: Jovan Dais]
Shawty said take it off, I'll take it off
Climb right out of my clothes
Want me to break you off, I'll break you off
'Til your love come down on yo' walls
I'm extremely focused, sweatin I'm strokin
I better get you open
I'll leave your headboard broken, you think I'm jokin
I bet I'll get you open

[50 Cent]
First it's her neck, yeah then her back
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I'll perform for ya, like a porno star
'Til ya had enough then I just need a little bit more
New music, new move, new position
New erotic sounds, it's goin down now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, you're sweatin I can paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper, I told ya I'll get ya
I'll work that, murk that, just the way you like it baby
Turn a quickie into an all-nighter maybe
Your sex drive, it match my sex drive
Then we be movin as fast as a NASCAR, right?
Switch gears slow down, go down whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I'll use my tongue baby, I'll leave you sprung maybe
I'll have ya head spinnin sayin "50's so crazy"

[Chorus]

[Interlude] - 2X

[50 Cent]
Girl I want you to give me what you got then give me more
Baby you could start on top or all fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennessy thug
Passion you're laughin, I'll make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty that's what I'ma get for ya
I need you to be what I need, more than liquor and weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin you so now you know what I need
I'd be ya part-time or full-time lover, significant other
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutter
Girl you could get it however you wan' get it
I'm feelin you, still I'm tellin you right now, get it

[Chorus]

[Interlude] - repeat to fade

[50 Cent - during Interlude]
Shawty said take it off, I'll take it off
Want me to break you off, I'll break you off</pre>
