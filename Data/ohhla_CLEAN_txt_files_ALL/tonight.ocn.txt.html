[Frank Ocean]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

[Chorus]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nuttin for me
You can't do nuttin for me - that's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal," girl I don't take it personal - no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight night, at the end of the night night
And all fuckin night night, it's gon' be tonight night, yeah
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

[Frank Ocean]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or som'n, she said "Is it game or som'n?"
"You pullin the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down ohhhhhhhhh</pre>
