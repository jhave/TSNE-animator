[Chris Brown]
Turn up the music cause the song just came on
Turn up the music if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, can I hear it til the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup, and drink it down

[Chorus One]
If you're sexy and you know it, put yo hands up in the air
Put yo hands up in the air, girl put yo hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
If you're sexy and you know it, put yo hands up in the air
Put yo hands up in the air, girl put yo hands up
And

[Chorus Two]
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
