Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Hey, don't trip, bitch
Matter fact I got something you can trip on
Gonna need your expensive luggage for this one

[Hook]
I might be with my girl
But you can bring your girls too
And we can do all the kinky things you
Think you ain't supposed to
I'll take you out this world
And we can't get commercial
See I'ma need privacy its obvious you ain't learn
So, I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly
I can teach you to fly

[Verse 1]
And she dug my chain
Love my swag, how I does my thang
Love my slang, talk just like me
Say she proud to be taylor gang (taylor gang?)
Man I'm paid
Tell the waitress bring more champagne
I done made what you tryin to get
And my style is sick cause I'm taylor made

Got no time to waste, see its like we in a race
All the bitches in this club that would die to take your place
Girl they call me mr space, and I can let you taste
But you been on the ground for so long
I can teach you to fly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'll take you all the around the world
If we do some things you can get your wings (hey)
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
Private beaches in the sand, Paris, France, Tokyo

We party, we live it,
We party, we live it,
We party, we live it
That good life, I'm gettin it, I'm gravy
No show unless the club owner pays me
Red Bull lil Goose got her crazy
No wheels, the girls wanna kick it where the planes be
But we fly-y-y I can take you somewhere in the sky (girl)
Got chicks in the cabin, laughing, autograph em, let her call me captain
Ain't just at home, I get love anywhere that we go,
I'm always on the road, my bank got a lot of zeros
I'm tellin ya
I got all of this paper no one to spend it on lately
And you've been on the ground for so long
I'ma teach you to fly

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'll take you all the around the world
(I can teach you to fly)
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go
(I can teach you to fly, I can teach you to fly)
Ill take you all the around the world
(I can teach you to fly)
I'll take you anywhere you wanna go</pre>
