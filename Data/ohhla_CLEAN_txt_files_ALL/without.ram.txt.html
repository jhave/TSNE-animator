[Zack de la Rocha]
Uh.. 
Got no card, so I got not soul
Life is prison, no parole, no control
The jura got my number on a wire tap
'cause I jack for Similac, FUCK a Cadillac
Survive, one motive no hope
'cause every sidewalk I walk is like a tightrope
Yes, I know my deadline, sire, when my life expires
I'm sendin paper south under the barbed wire
Tha mother of my child will lose her mind at my grave
It's my life for their life, so call it a free trade
"Por vida" and our name up on the stall
I took a death trip, when I tried to cross the white wall

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates - born without a face
One motive no hope, uh - born without a face
Walk unseen past the graves an the gates - born without a face
One motive no hope, uh, - yeah, born without a face
Without a face!

Yeah, I tried ta look back to my past long lost
A blood donor to the land owner holocaust
Pop's heart stopped, in came the air drop
Flooded the trench, he couldn't shake the toxic shock
Maize, was all we needed to sustain
Now her golden skin burns, insecticide rain
Ya down wit DDT - yeah, you know me
I'm raped for the grapes, profit for the bourgeois
War tape boomin, path is Luminoso
I'm headed north like my name was Kid Cisco
To survive, one motive no hope, uh
It's hard to breathe with Wilson's head around my throat, UH!
Strangled and mangled, another SS curtain call..
When I tried to cross the white walls..
When I tried to cross the white walls..

[Chorus]
Walk unseen past the graves and the gates - born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh - born without a face!
Walk unseen past the graves an the gates - born without a face!
One motive no hope, uh, - born without a face!
