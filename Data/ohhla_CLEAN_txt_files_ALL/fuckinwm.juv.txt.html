[Juvenile (Chorus 2x)]
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me

[Juvenile]
I got my mind right, money right, life right, paid right
Can you see me cutting the beef like a steak knife?
Don't stay up late I'm a be home when I'm finished
I gotta drop my people off at the airport in a minute
This is business; you ain't wit it then give me five feet
I don't need you and children wherever I be
I'm a man if this bitch is out then it's on
As long as I don't bring no diseases or no hoes back home
Let me roam  you won't even much need that phone
I'm a take care of my shit baby just leave that alone
I know when the pussy get wet and you need that bone
There ain't too many bitches out here that's gone be that strong
You was provided by your parents
Just knowing a gangsta was fucking they daughter was scaring em
I speak fat me and you bitch we got our life on track
And if I ever leave from you I'll be right back

[Juvenile (Chorus 2x)]
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me

[Skip]
Nowadays these chicks they too emotional
I just wanted to get her (haha) I joke a few
I just met you yesterday I'm barely knowing you
"You ain't say that yesterday when I was blowing you!"
See that's what that mo and that dro will do
See drink up, smoke up come on I got some more for you
You like that? I got another joke for you
You grin, you in and I'm into poking you
Sounds funny hunny? How much money hunny?
You heard that but you ain't getting nothing from me
Except them three 20's that Slim had (Slim)
See I'm +Cut Throat+ in a Skip mask
Well then lose the number, you do me a favor
I ain't a lifeguard; I can't be your savior
You met me like this, I'ma be a player
So stop all the fussing and just beat me later

[Juvenile (Chorus 2x)]
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me

[Wacko]
Come on Ma don't stress me
I was a gangsta when you met me
Knew I'd be where the pimps, the players, the hoes, and the tecs be
Where the dope, the coke, the dro, and the X be
New Kisha Keanne and Mil wanted to sex me
You still want to ex me or try to disrespect me
Now them hoes in your ear, got you trippin wanna test me
Look meet me on Freret Street right where my set be
Go home; pack all your shit and drop off them Vette keys
Anyway I'm tired of problems, you can catch yo cut
But first drop off the B.B.'s and the princess cuts
Round here stunting for them hoes  letting them gas you up
Now you stuck for them hoes  let 'em cash you up
I ain't gone lie is gone be hard for me to pass you up
But my plane fly straight, never crash for nothing
And before I fuck it up with a passenger
I'll get rid of you and snatch me an amateur

[Juvenile (Chorus 2x)]
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me</pre>
