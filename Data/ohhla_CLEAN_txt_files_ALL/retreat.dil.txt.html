Typed by: jason_ray@mindspring.com
  
"Till the end of...No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender and no retreat"
"N-N-No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender No No surrender no surrender and no retreat"
"Y'all ready?"
  
[Evidence]
Yo, aiyo potent
Straight up with the force to keep fighting
Samson, Atlas, Colossus, Ti-tan
In the dark night the torch steady lightens
I'm strong, cast iron heart of the lion
A mighty foundation to a tower of power
With the energy needed to turn the seed into a flower
Fortified type, sturdy sound constructions make rappers duck down
Like I'm Boogie Down Productions (Boop Boop Boop Boop)
I can tell they're weak, delicate
It ain't hard to sell when I speak
Over rock-hard breaks (breaks!) never riddle little beats
See me on rap city B-E-T spit graffiti
Present a full section of flavors thats robust
Dilated Peoples my brother we gon' crush
Leave up support, insulate your stage
I got self control but can't hold the rage
Many ya products, gimmicks wit' time limits
I give you what you want plus put my mind in it
Rocka Iriscience trained to go the length
Finding all terrain thin tanked in full strength
  
"No surrender and no retreat"
  
Chorus [Evidence]
Stand my ground dig in with both feet
No surrender no turning no cheat no retreat
Stand my ground dig in with both feet
No surrender no turning no cheat no retreat
Stand my ground dig in with both feet
No surrender no turning no cheat no retreat
Stand my ground dig in with both feet
"No surrender and no retreat"
  
[Evidence]
Uh, uh, yo, worldwide
From great heights we take perish by night
And lay by day from sonic doodalay espy tight
Twelve hundad tech me sharp cut and free
Detonate the drums heat the plastique
thats a dangerous man
Who can speak with his hands
Watered down lyrics on dirty tracks turned to sand
To sink in better watch the the X that you inkin' 
Or on so disrespect and step on my lawn
Pass the gate insulate till sound deton's
Twelve ten and debt never met chapter eleven
My fam's my strength my pops I got my aim from
?????????????????????????
One's for breath, the rest as you feel it
Fuck what you've done you've got skills reveal it
Team with Iriscience pro's with flows
I risk my life on flights for hype shows
Rest assure vaccines are far from cures
And plant some new shit that hit me two weeks into tour
But I'll adapt guaranteed make it through
Evidence, Iriscience and my man Babuuuu
Worldwide
  
"Dilated"
"I told all these corny mothafuckas what a no retreat sound like"
  
Chorus [Evidence]
  
[B-Real]
Never givin' up never givin' in never holdin' back never runnin'
No cowardly acts dumpin' no retreat
Constantly moving ahead ???
Psychological diabolical shrimp filleted it eat ya
Now I hate it cuz the flavor is gone cater to those
Lyrics are bomb savor the shows wait for the pro's
Beats made it with flows hated by foe's
Never surrender your soul and rope with the cold
Others are makin' but sadly mistakin' the straight broke
In the end with no cheddar of bacon thats left poked
Pictures afloat over remote notes and potent mic's
Break you up put you in the pipe light you up
To the night, shadows are runnin' around peepin step out of bounds
And watch a nigga get put to sleep
But never recover never surrender 
I know you hate it quit us get eliminated
Fuckin' with Dilated
  
"No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender and no retreat"
"No surrender and no retreat"
"N-N-No surrender and no retreat"
  
"Ha! Hahaha"
"Ha Two Thousand"</pre>
