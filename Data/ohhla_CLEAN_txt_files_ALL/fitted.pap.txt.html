[Intro] 
I got the Armani's, got the Versace joints 
My fitted cap low, let me put my hater blockers on 
Papoose Pa-poose 

[Chorus]
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat on my face (My face) 
Why you all up in my space (My space) 
I don't want these haters all in my grill so I cop me some brand new shades (New shades) 

[Verse 1] 
I wear a mean dark pair of shades 
And you can't see my eyes unless my head bent 
It's about to be a cold winter, I'm on some shit 
Show you how to rob the industry like 50 cent 
Hopped on the airplane, hit Miami quick 
Linked up with Scott Storch, so you know it's a hit 
Everybody lookin for me like where Pap went? 
Going going going gone, I'm outta here bitch 
Look at shorty over there, she thick like quick 
But she got her breasts done, she thinks she slick 
Yeah, all the girls with the real hair 
Yeah, the real chest and the ill rear 
Even if it ain't real, I ain't hating on it 
Uh! It's still yours cause you paid for it 
Get your weight up not your hate up and see me after you got it up 
I'm clockin ya, Versace shades watchin ya 

[Chorus]
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat on my face (My face) 
Why you all up in my space (My space) 
I don't want these haters all in my grill so I cop me some brand new shades (New shades) 

[Verse 2] 
My groove, come get into my groove 
Walk through the industry doing what I choose 
My chain hit your girl in the face, she 'gon bruise 
So when I'm on top, I take off my jewels 
Four hundred songs, what more can I prove 
Versatile, I'm hardcore, but I'm smooth 
Cop new hammers and give them to my goons 
None of y'all crews don't want it with my dudes 
The throwback Mike's, black and gray pair 
Not those, the suede pair 
Had that '07 leather in '06 
I switch it up every year 
Since it's 07, I'm copping my '08 gear 
They don't face fight, when I pull out the thirty eight here 
Make the doctor press down on your chest and say CLEAR! 
Sucker punched you fast and say they ain't care 
They can't swing on me, I weave like fake hair 

[Chorus]
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat on my face (My face) 
Why you all up in my space (My space) 
I don't want these haters all in my grill so I cop me some brand new shades (New shades) 

[Verse 3] 
Count my money once, I count my money twice 
Then I count it again to make sure it's right 
I keep my guns dirty, and my jewelry plain 
Cause fly bitches love gangstas, nah mean!? 
I know y'all shades is fake, but not these y'all 
Armani, Vioni, Versace, her body like Halle 
She probably think she got me, but not me 
Ma please I bet you I can make her feel like a virgin 
I bet you I can make her scream like a virgin 
And her pussy smells good, I said it 
Cause she a clean version) like a radio edit 
But it's all about the clothes, the homes, the hot cars 
Looking through my shades, it's easy to spot ya 
Rock ya to sleep, then drop y'all 
Seen alot of stars get rocked, that's why I call them rockstars 

[Chorus]
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat low, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my hater blockers on, block em out (Block 'em out) 
I got my fitted hat on my face (My face) 
Why you all up in my space (My space) 
I don't want these haters all in my grill so I cop me some brand new shades (New shades)</pre>
