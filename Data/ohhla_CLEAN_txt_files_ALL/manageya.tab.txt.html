[Intro] [Talib talking]
Yeah, this is some shit you can set shit off to (Get familiar)
Get familiar with that. {gun shots}
Talib Kweli, Clinton Sparks. It's Anger Management y'all
You see, the tour ain't comin' to Brooklyn
So it's my job to bring Brooklyn to the tour. Yeah

[Verse One]
We're gon' show you how to manage your anger
Before you do damage to a neighbor or a stranger with the banger banger
Mayday mayday, danger danger
A lot of these rappers in the closet like wire hangers
It's '05, summertime, gettin' scarier and scarier
Drug dealer's business still control America
The block to the boardroom, a tomb to the courtroom
We find dope, we smoke, we shoot and snort too
Fiends, come for more coke like free refills
Around the way, they move enough white to make ski hills
Whiter than the cast of One Tree Hill, we ill
We got angels in Heaven all jealous of our free will
Look at 'em, they ain't got no respect for what He created
They live life, get to go to paradise and don't appreciate it
But they don't know this life is Hell on Earth
For what it's worth, it ain't about the ideas but who ? (Clinton Sparks)
Some will rap between a rock and a hard place
Torn between spirituality and the lifestyles to partake in
Trust, my adrenaline rush like a car chase
Flames bust out the neck when I'm speedin' up my heart rate
Tryin' to find a dark place for me to pull my songs out of
Inspiration based on things I ain't proud of
I could rap about faith and repentance
But then it's me shoutin' out, "Message" like I'm Keenen in Don't Be A Menace
"Ain't don't nobody wanna heart that shit."
So said the pussy nigga at the label who be scared to go near that shit
But it's cool
I don't depend on them to make me a star
And they scared cause what I spit will expose a fake nigga's heart
Now here's a bar {crashing noise}
Let me tell you what's gangsta
When you doin' God's work cause it needs to be done, not for the thank yous
Let me tell you what's thugged out
When you show niggas how to get paid without goin' the drug route
Let me tell you what's hard
Breakin' the cycle that got our sons and brothers fillin' up the prison yards
Let me tell you what's real
When niggas say what they feel
and that'll eliminate most of these niggas with the record deals
I hurt your feelings, it took longer than you expect to heal
The beef is fake, imagine how soldiers in the desert feel
I'm like a veteran with special skill
Comin' from the home of the original gunn clapperz like Tek &amp; Steele
Cut shit out, ? feel
Spit so hot that the flesh will peel

[Outro] [Talib talking]
Haha. Clinton Sparks. Anger Management. Let's go</pre>
