[Twista]
I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers thats prepared whoop
Leave a body bloody red to scoop
Poppin off lead for loot
Shot the pussy up from head to boot
Just for talkin dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot
Police prepared to swoop
To catch a nigga on the runway but don't none stay for the white chalk
If aired out your tip whatch your lip niggas pipes talk
I you wasn't seen then you might walk
Even if it ain't the time of day niggas will find a way like locos off of nodos
Cappin when you servin your blows niggas doze hoes
Got the popos posin as hobos
Take a photo of him please 
Tell the Chi Town he freeze they don't give a fuck if it was DT's
They be up like the sea breeze on CC's 
And they handin out these murders like free cheese
Could you pass me the B please
I got intercate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang
Bumpin though in different denominations in the nations, 
and the nations racin worried bacause I'm slangin the thangs
If you can ahng up at my town up a K Town 
if you dissin them then you dissin me
Niggas actin like they glad to die so if you had to try, 
if they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me 
just a unsolved mystery

[Chorus]2x
Before I saw his body lyin down 
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery
And left an unsolved mystery
Before I saw his body lyin down 
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Call the popo the man and mess
Shot up his head and chess
Put to rest now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin down 
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery
And left an unsolved mystery
Before I saw his body lyin down 
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Niggas actin like they glad to die 
So if you had to try 
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

[2nd vesre]
In a hoopty  shorty's will design a spot
So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest 
if you can throw it and motherfucker its a nine to knot
Just go back to where your thang lay
Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip 
if you get the guns and clips to keep doin what you doin
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef 
claimin they ain't been doin the bruh be givin it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then its a blessin she a lucky hoe
Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
Cause you can't be actin thug roof
Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even considered gettin caught 
cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe
Cause its a pitty when hype
For niggas wanna get witty
For comin too pretty 
Get the chilli filled and desipher 
To pay the piper and bow to viper
Twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin hype enough
Cause everytime I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin fuckin and fury cause I dont like to bluff
So if we ever get into it and let the static get to me 
Lets squash it and make it history
Niggas actin like the glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
Just an unsolved mystery

[Chorus]

[3rd verse]
Now listen they be kickin hocus pocus
I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus
So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see our base and you said then you better be ferosheous
And matter fact I hope the dopest
For to try to cope this is hopeless
Cause my lethal rhymes 
Is the kind that can beat you blind
And pre-design 
I pee through mine
Like I see through lines
Check the brain and see define
The reason I'm gunnin I tried the runnin
Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted
West side to the hunters you can't step to hoe
In the state of emergency urgenlty the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence 
or trippin on elegance they be holdin out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get wit him here come the victum he be shot up in his pants and lungs
Cause he actin hard and ran his tongue 
Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run
Cause a prison is some shit to see
Matter of fact fuck the talkin my lip let me hit the B
Niggas actin like they glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
Just an unsolved mystery

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
