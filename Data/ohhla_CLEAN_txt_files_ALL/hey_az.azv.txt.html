What's the deal son?
Herm Fiasco
It's the world famous AZ Show
For the world (AZ Show)

[AZ]
No doubt, time to mellow out
Party at the yellow house, yell it out
Invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laidback with the Alize, merely's conceal
Conversatin' like some whore pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supportin' your bitch
Let the eyes shine, easing my mind with white wine
It's your lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time
'K imma floss life, feds almost bagged the guard twice
Bizare nights move on the grace of a lost light
All them horney whites feeling like Christ with the army 
Tight cons be writing all my life 
It's based upon on how you burning incense
With intents to school the infants
The rules are different so for those that chose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

[SWV]
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)

[AZ]
So many deaf and blind got caught up or left behind
I guess bacardi lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low key-ing
Me and the crew win the gold B.M. O.D-ing, top speed
Blowing through the sweet night breeze where ever life leads
Anything's better besides a tight squeeze, sliced cheese
Even my pieces put your nice V's dress precisely
Hoping soon will be the wifey, it's working well
Process words up in the pro's you sell, a urban hell
Playing park benches, burning L's
It's all basics, probation, open cases 
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of satan, congregatin' 
Conversatin', trying to map ways of escaping 
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels and souvenirs

[SWV]
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)

Long (fucked up, all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)
AZ, knock me off my dog gone shoes

[AZ]
For the world, no more case pending
It's all a brand new begining
AZ I'm back winning, dressed in black linen
Attract women, low fade ways later spending this
State paid four different ways
Put my bid in, no sleep, be playing with time
My mind goes deep these cold streets rock a diamond chip, goutee
Trying to stay sane, amoungst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message evolved or made plain
Poor advice given, we'll strive for nice livin'
Inside some pay the price or we'll spend nights in prison
Plea bargain, hopin' my peoples speak the problem
We each disolving trying to make moves to keep from starving

[SWV]
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night (all night)

Yeah, Herm Fiasco (fucked up, all night)
AZ (fucked up, all night)
Hey AZ (fucked up, all night)
Hey AZ (fucked up, all night
Long (fucked up, all night)
Long (fucked up, all night)
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)
All night </pre>
