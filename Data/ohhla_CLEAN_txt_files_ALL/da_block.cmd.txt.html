[C-Murder](Talking)
Say Bass Heavy brah
Turn that shit up ya dig
De one here, ya muthafuckas ain't bootin up on tha flo' 
(yeah boot up nigga or shut up)
Lookin at that nigga Krazy
Listen to it (3rd ward)
I wanna see a nigga get hurt of this shit yeah ya dig
We makin moves nigga
On da block posted up ta get mine

[C-Murder] (Chorus 2x)
I'm on the block posted up 
Wit them thangs loaded up
Hope them folks don't pull up
Cuz if they do then I'm stuck
I'ma be in jail wit dat dig look
Hair all nappy lookin like a fuckin crook

[C-Murder]
I'm on da block with them thangs loaded up
I mean them toys
Fuck them niggas if they fuck with my me or my boys
I'ma tru nigga don't care bout nothing boy
If ya start frontin 
I'ma have ta start somethin
Fuck the whole world
If they don't like 
If I go to jail my old lady gonna ride me
Cuz I'ma thug a a lil' ghetto boy trapped in crime
I hope them folks don't put up a take my muthafuckin dimes
On the block posted up and I'm down for whatever
Have you been ride for yo shit, nigga never
Cuz if I gotta gun (what) and he gotta gun
Shit I don't give a fuck nigga I ain't gone run
It's degree but a pen in my future (in my future)
That's why I live how I live
Cuz that's all that I'm use ta
You don't wanna go to war and that's real
Lil' nigga gotta chill cuz he might get killed

[Chorus] 2x

[???]
I'm on the block tryin ta make some change I'm tired of being broke
So I'ma get my money right and smoke some weed and coke
I couldn't concentrate in school with the problems I had
When my brother went to jail is when I took the wrong path
That's when I had to step up and be the man ta make it right
Eat and sleep all day and hustle, hustle all night
If anybody need me well they can catch me be on the block
In all black with a glock and a mouth full of rocks
Muthafuckin cop straight fillin still totin glocks
I'm on the block posted up chillin by the barbershop
I told my nigga make the holla if them people pull up
So I can get the fuck cuz I ain't tryin to get that dig look

[???]
I dig up in y'all like Min Yawl
Fuck around and get ya head cracked
Playing with this tru dawg so back up off me lil' daddy
Before ya piss me off
Carry max, gauges, choppers, and double barrel sawed-off 
We ain't come ta have stuff, we came ta bust heads
Burn houses to the pavement if we feel we gettin
played, now everyday 
Hobbies is load and bust and knock a nigga leg off
If a bitch say somethin, now who be the rawest nigga 
T-R-U the most dangerous
Just load'em up it ain't no thang ta us
We maxing up a coming ta get cha 
Oh fake ass niggas gonna make us split cha
On the block with the rocks getting richa, the picture

[Chorus] 2x

[C-Murder]
Hum brah</pre>
