*car speeds off*

Verse One: WC

*police sirens throughout song*
Last man standin', I'm shot
But I can't fear bleedin'
My nigga's face down, stretched out, no longer breathin'
I'm speedin', pump eatin', swervin' in the G and
Red &amp; blue lights and squad cars is all I'm seein'
I told you motherfuckers "No moves, no altercations"
Now it's half a tank a gas and a hostage situation
I'm facin', 25, with the 'L' so I'm stompin'
I can't shake One-Time bitch, I swear I'm dumpin'
Helicopters trailin' my ass, won't surrender
Only thang I'm givin' up is hollow points and middle fingers (fuck y'all!)
Whoever set this shit the fuck up, done got us fucked up
Runnin' outta time, and shit outta luck
Take that! *2 gunshots*
I ain't goin' down mothafucka'!
Take this! *2 gunshots*
My car roof could suck my dick!
I'm on a high-speed chase, with two money bags, *woman screams* and a
screamin' ass BITCH

It's All Bad!

Chorus: WC w/ cops

[cops] "Possible 211 suspect driving southbound on the 215 driving an '84
Cutlass Supreme. Believed to be armed. Please proceed with caution."
[WC] It's All Bad!
[cops] "Everyone proceed with caution, suspect is believed to be a black male
carrying female hostage. We got a runner fellas."
[WC] It's All Bad!

Verse Two: WC

They trynna cut me off against the gutta' lane
Trynna run these motherfuckers to the border man
Side-swiped the mothafuckin' El Camino!
Trynna get my black ass up outta San Bernadino
I catch the 215, to the 405
I'm catchin' hell trynna make it to the 5 I line!
They cut me off again I got to go the other way
Channel 5 in the sky we'll take *helicopter sounds* 'em through L.A.
*woman screams throughout* Quit screamin' BITCH (shut the fuck up!)
Ho' you slowin' me down, they ain't thinkin' 'bout yo' ass SHUT THE FUCK UP
now!
The bitch didn't budge, so I shot her, *woman stops screaming* "Bla! Bla!"
*with 2 gunshots* (stupid!)
(Fuck, take a look at you now!)
I kicked the door open *door opens*, threw her body on the freeway
Continued the chase, wiped the blood *door closes* off my face
Lookin' for an exit as soon as I reloads my mag' *reloads mag*
*car horns throughout* Stuck in heavy traffic...

Nigga It's All Bad!

Chorus: WC w/ cops 
*car horns and helicopter sounds*
[cops] *unitelligible* "Suspect has just thrown female hostage on the side of
the 605 freeway. We now have him in heavy traffic on the 105 heading
westbound."
[WC] It's All Bad!
[cops] "Looks like he's trying pulling 1-8 10 and Central. He might try and
make a run for it. Don't let him get away. Take this fucker."
[WC] It's All Bad!

Verse 3: WC

Now it's time for me to make my getawaaaaaay!
Fuck a hostage, I'm doin' this the nigga waaaaaay!
I jumped out the car, and started squezzin' the trigga' 
*8 gunshots* (bla! bla! bla! bla!)
And duckin' at 'em,  I'm bustin' at 'em, laughin' at 'em, trynna splat 'em,
cussin at 'em
Like a true fuckin' G is supposed ta
I'm bustin' at the helicopter as I get closa'
Trynna shake 'em off my tail
I make's my way to the side of the freeway
Now I'm climbin' over the guard rail
I'm a felon, I can't take no shorts
I'm runnin' down Imperial past Imperial Courts
Stop to catch my breath 'til I heard the dogs barkin'
Now a nigga's runnin' past a nigga's [?]cigardens[?]
I hear the helicopter closin' in, yellin' "freeze"
But I'm yellin' back "fuck you!", hittin' 'em up with C's (fuck yaa'll!)
A beautiful day for dyin', nigga I'm hearin' sirens
On sight, no warnins that these coward's 'll be firin'
I made my way to Avalon
Peepin' any, get in the corner
I got's ta think quick, or I'm a goner
Saw this nigga slippin' in a '98 Ac-Right
*gun cocks, followed by a gunshot* (Get the fuck out!)
Left him bleedin' at the light!
Now it's back on, the money bag full of riches
Fuck One-Time, that get in my way, I'm killin' these bitches
I'm doin' 85 loc, these fools can't touch me
Came across Western, hit the back at Kentucky
Fish trailin', mashin' on my brakes I had to stop
Awww FUCK! Ain't this a bitch?! A road block!

Break: WC w/ cops

[cops]"Get out the car now I say, keep your hands up! Get out the car now or
I'm forced to shoot!" *gun cocks*
[WC] Fuck that... 
[cops] He's movin'!! He's movin'!!

*car speeds off*

*car horns until beginning of chorus*

*about twenty gunshots*

[cops] "Cease fire!! Cease fire damnit!!"

Chorus: WC

It's All Bad!
Dead on arrival!
Nigga It's All Bad!
Dead on arrival!
It's All Bad!
It's All Bad!
Nigga we all, dead on arrival!

*helicopter flies by*
