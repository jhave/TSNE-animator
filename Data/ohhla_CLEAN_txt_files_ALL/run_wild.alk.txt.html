[Shae Fiol] Come on everybody Tha Likwid crew
is comin through your town and we're runnin wild

[Tash]
Ahhhhh! (Say what?) Alkaholiks in this bitch..
Smoke somethin, drink somethin
Run wild, run wild..

Niggaz, bitches - back again to get it crackin
Smoked a blunt, drunk a brew, turned around and look what happened
(Whatcha workin with?) Official party clique
Weed smokin drunk, O.D.B./Bob Marley shit
(We got that shit) so ladies come and get it
Custom-fitted flows for all the hoes that's fuckin with it
(Liks comin thick) so where the party at?
You know how we act once we buzzed off that Cognac

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha wanna do? (Whatcha wanna do?)
[J-Ro] Whatcha wanna do?
Look who's in front of you, crazy old Likwid Crew

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha gonna do?
[J-Ro] Get it poppin now
It ain't no stoppin now, bustaz we knockin out
(You must be off that rum) I was born to bust
Some say I cuss too much, but I don't give a fuck

[Shae Fiol] Where's it comin from?
[J-Ro] It's comin from the soul
Hip-Hop and rock'n'roll, we bout to lose control

[Chorus: Tha Liks]
We run wild, RUN WILD, run wild, RUN WILD
{*E-Swift scratches: "run.. run.. run.. run wild"*}
We run wild, RUN WILD, run wild, RUN WILD
{*E-Swift scratches: "run.. run.. run.. run.."*}
{*E-Swift scratches: "run.. run.. run.. run.."*}
{*E-Swift scratches: "run.. run.. run wild"*}

[Shae Fiol] Come on everybody Tha Likwid crew
is comin through your town and we're runnin wild

[Tash]
{"Run wild"} - off that gin and tonic
Alkaholiks comin through, smokin all y'all niggaz chronic
(Why you trippin on me?) Straight black and blue
Yo I ain't know homey that bitch I fucked was married to you

[Shae Fiol] Tell me bout your flows
[Tash] My flow is lethal
J-Swift and Rico smash mics like the repo
(Can we po' some mo'?) Got beer
Listen here, y'all niggaz could fight, but not in here

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha wanna do?
[J-Ro] Where the smokey smoke?
Man I just broke a note, up in the club I'm choke

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha gonna do?
[J-Ro] We came to beat it up
Break it on down and clown, order another round
(Do the damn thing) Please examine the
way that we damage ya, peace out to Canada
(These fools can't hang) We runnin wild tonight
with a new style tonight, we bout to..

[Chorus]

[Shae Fiol] Come on everybody Tha Likwid crew
is comin through your town and we're runnin wild

[Tash]
{"Run run"} we go all out to ball out
CaTash be runnin wild like ARRAGH - who let the dogs out?
(Run wild) break yo'self through the maze
We rockin ninety-thousand underground at the raves
(Say what?) Dialogue is strange, I wrote this in the rain
I do what I do then I pop that champagne

[Shae Fiol] Pop that champagne
[Tash] I rap passionate
Bitch, make yo' breath stink, and house party crashin it

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha wanna do?
[J-Ro] We came to rock for y'all
And it don't stop at all, we bout to have a ball

[Shae Fiol] Whatcha gonna do?
[J-Ro] I wanna dance with ya
Pose for the camera, are you a fan of the

[Shae Fiol] L-I-K-S
[J-Ro] I like the sound of that
Keep it around the map, hip-hop is comin back

[Shae Fiol] Best from the West
[J-Ro] We got the shit tonight
Get with Lik-wid tonight, we bout to

[Chorus]

[Shae Fiol] Come on everybody Tha Likwid crew
is comin through your town and we're runnin wild</pre>
