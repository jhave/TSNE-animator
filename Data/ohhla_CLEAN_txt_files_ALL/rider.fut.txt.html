[Intro]
Whatchu lookin for
I'm lookin for a bitch
That'll stay down for a nigga through thick and thin

[Chorus]
Would you ride for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga (Yea!)
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

[Verse 1]
Got a bankroll [?]
Dubbs I can letcha blow it right now uh? huh?
If everythang fell would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms
Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from.. Gotta hold my bong, hold my gun
When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue
Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor
When I'm on the road doin shows from mississippi all the way to hong kong
And we made the bond thats ways beyond Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton
don't worry bout the money, the money gone come (Racks!)
I just need to know these two questions

[Chorus]
Would you ride for yo nigga (Ayee, whatchu lookin for)
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider (watchu lookin for), a rider, a rider

[Verse 2]
If some things on my mind I need to get off
Can I come to you?
When I need to talk
If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault
Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did
Could you love me? Could you love my kids?
Can you be there for me like you never had been
Like any relationship you ever been in
We make a connection thats full of affection
Can you hold me down, knowin my profession
Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully
Will your loyalty lead to royalty
Can you answer these two questions please

[Chorus]
Would you ride for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

[Tasha Catour:]
Take you on the town, Baby everythangs on me
First I'ma pick you up in the red rauri
Baby its yo night you can have whateva you like
Bet you ain't had a bitch thats gone treat you right
Bitch thats gone stay down
Bitch thats gone stay round
Bitch that'll hold dem pounds.. If twelve pull up right now
I'm in love witchu
Baby its the truth
[moans]
Baby its the truth

[Chorus]
Would you ride for yo nigga (Alright, alright)
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider
I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider (Alright, Alright)

Thats all I wanna know!!</pre>
