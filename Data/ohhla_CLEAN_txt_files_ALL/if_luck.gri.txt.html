Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They say that if it bleeds it's alive, and God created all of us
But right now at this point in time, I'm feeling discarded
As the sun hits the shades, and tiger strikes my nightmares
I'm finding all the feelings I've been searching for, alright
Here in the moment, look into my soul
Break that boundary that's empounding me to forfeit what I hold, and move past it
I keep my dreams wrapped in plastic
Retrack my past steps to catch it with my last breath
So, who wants to know what it's like,
To feel the things I touch and wipe the blood off of my life
Cause it's all broken bones here, open wounds that don't heal
Chokin on my own fears, drowning in my own tears
Human; and that's the way that I remain
Fuck fighting my beliefs and limiting what I should say
Fuck standing with my arms out, hoping I'll be saved
And fuck screaming at myself tying to make it through the day
I write life down, and it's coherent when I speak
Raise the hairs up off the back and the neck like a static cling, go

I said if luck was a lady, she'd never let me buy that drink
The tongue slipping in my eyes won't blink, and if your
God was a woman, her boyfriend would beat her kids
Now I got more scars than teenagers' wrists, and if the
Time was my father, he'd missed all of my birthdays
Drinking with his friends and now it's hurting in the worst way
And, I can say it just the way that I know
They say the pain sticks with you, I'm training to let it go

So, hold onto this one, and save it for your bad days
Open up that passion in my words to make the glass break
And, I don't know if my written words can affect you
But listen to my heart and every single breath I stess through
Come on! This is not a note to hip hop
All I'm trying to do is make that quiver on my lip stop
And, chase out the bad scent
Purpose thinks he's got me figured toward science now and I ain't even ass-checked
Tell, meet the treading water champion
The other side of happiness, the most that y'all are standing in
Raise up, and try to capture the trust
Cause I move with all my passions and extract what I must
And I move with all my people and I act when I must
To take a con-honored stab at them, peeling the rust
Now despite all of my efforts, I'll always play the low
Now, if something in this catches you, you best to let it show

I said if luck was a lady, she'd never let me buy that drink
The tongue slipping in my eyes won't blink, and if your
God was a woman, her boyfriend would beat her kids
Now I got more scars than teenagers' wrists, and if the
Time was my father, he'd missed all of my birthdays
Drinking with his friends and now it's hurting in the worst way
And, I can say it just the way that I know
They say the pain sticks with you, I'm training to let it go</pre>
