Damn she right
Damn she thick
And I may not know perfect
But damn she it
And she thick and she right
Damn she nice
You can be my judge baby
Yea I'll do life
Give me life
And I know that you be dancin till yo toes hurt
But I can make yo toes curl
I can make yo soul jerk
We can soul search
And I also got that street credit
I got more work...
Than any... dude... you ... knew
Girl I am a blood, su-wu
I hear you want somebody you can call boo
I will change my name to boo and fucked around and call you
Now what you wanna do?
Because whatever that maybe baby I want do that too
And ooh I can G.P.S you be what you gon do?
Like a pair of wet and sticky vicky's girl I'm on you
Ok ma the mood...is so...right...like...two...can take... flight
My nigga T.I. is the King I am your Prince, your Knight
Right, you dont need a superman, you just need a man like Weezy

Ciara: Baby

[Lil Wayne]
And I can make you feel the same way
We can post pone and stay home like a rain day
She'll have the salad, just put her on Wayne's plate
What you know bout havin syrup poured on that pancake?
Nasty as I wanna be... but nasty as you like me to... .be
I hope you like me too, but now you know I like you too
3 a.m. room..service...serve ya
You can be my desert, be my caramel sherbert
Call ya mama we can make a baby
And the way you work dat mic in the video is so...

Ciara: Crazy

[Lil Wayne]
And that chair or stool...move... was cool
You make me wanna, ooh... 
But I'ma be kool, I need a moment
I think you are the finest human on earth
Me and you together I can help you with that homework
Take yo ass to school... to... whoo... 
Teach you all the rules... you never knew we need a moment
I could be your future, I could be yo teacher
Be yo professor
Write down this letter
You want some extra credit
Let me check yo homework
I could be yo tutor and help you wit exams
No feelins... or its some... parton...for you
You got dem goodies and I got a sweet tooth
Now can y'all blame me?
Shit HOV got B and I just want C
See I just want see if you're taller den me
No really I want see if you're my Mrs. Carter to be
Yea I know dis is pretty awkward for me
But I jus act like you are talkin to me, when you say... 

[Ciara]
Awwwwww
I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I would never... ..never ever... hurt you
I open my heart (open my heart)

[Lil Wayne]
Believe dat... .and I agree dat... 
Open up yo heart to me and you won't get the key back

And baby I aint talkin to nobody else but... 

[Ciara]
