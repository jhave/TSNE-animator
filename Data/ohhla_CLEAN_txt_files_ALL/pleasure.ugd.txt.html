[U-God]
Once again...

Through the storms... I gotta stay strong
Take deep breaths, hold on long, bring the harm
with no regrets, on my chest, let me knowledge be born
on levels, wild, devil copters mark my every step
When the riots form, my woman keeps me warm
&gt;From Fort Green I sing the song mean
Bring the calm overseas, glide high in the skies
Sky dive... far... far as the eye could see
In the midst of acapell', I ball my fist up
Unravel, travellin to the cells of Gotti
I shot up a shell, will he drop? Will he flop?
Will he go pop a cell? Is his mind frail?
The worst is groove frantic, he expand the planet
Plan harder, your Godfather's plans failed
I air mail the senseless scar, two snub noses
Niggas love those expensive cars
Is it him and those twenty inch rims, splittin the tar?
An amazon woman from the stripbar
God, it varies, Halley Berry, stars eatin hard cherries
This world is bizarre, not bein far from Mars
Galaxy hoppin, non-stoppin the sun rays
Stay and paid for real, 'til I'm old and grey
Pretty legs, of course, soft as clay
Degrees, hot breeze in your hair all day, all day
Engaged a lot, rockin hot and cold chains
Is my brain vain? Flames, still dock the missles
Let off one, stay in your lane
Everybody got issues, I'm drunk off the rum
Numb, one case got thrown out in dismissal
Everybody got pistols, but will the referee blow the whistle
before I lock on your ass, bone gristle?
These streets is crystal, crystal, crystal

[Hell Razah]
Pleasure and pain, some took lead to the brain
Got rich and couldn't live for the end of the game
Government chain, breakin off the slavery chain
&gt;From a weddin to a funeral, it's pleasure and pain
Guns, gangs cock back, ready to aim
Call in Fergusons, ridin on the back of the train
Televisions and this cocaine, got us insane
We got to war, if we all got a burner, then flame
Baby showers, same day as nuclear showers
Prophecy's harsh, world will be destroyed in an hour
Shots fired in the night, from the heart of the coward
Stop the crow from the young flowers, goin to Howard
Brooklyn Babe Ruth, raised in fatigues and boots
Blue-printin who we hittin, and we need to shoot
No description, all though it was dark, an Egyptain
And didn't have no love, but a grudge against Clinton

[U-God]
Representin... how much gold can one man claim?
Over horizon, recognize him, it's candy rain
Flusty, lookin out of dusty old window pane
with nothin to lose, but everythin to gain
So far to go, much more is unclaimed
No delay, when we spray, we Play IV Keeps in the Jeeps
stumpin somethin gritty, it's gun nitty in the city
that never sleeps, street sweepin
is senseless, intense, fenced in, fleein
A long road ahead, I'm still believin in my freedom
On the darkest day, I'd say your darkest hour
I came to realize, the sin is most inner-most power
So enchanted, cry inside, fryin and dancin
At God speed, damn it, fear is planted
Severe nature of man, there's still no cure
Seduce me, reduce me to ashes, caught in the law
Atoms scatter, brain lashes, to the core question
Still no answers, moves of the phantom, handsome
Midnight silence surround us, eye in the sky
Everythin is a lesson, riddle another God for all of your blessins
I'm reppin, grateful 'til I'm dead, hateful heads, we under Allah's 
protection
Essence of life, one second, after the blastin
I wonder, is Heaven truly everlastin?
I'm askin, I said it to four lost relatives missin, in action
Communication breakdown, it's all the same
Havin a nervous breakdown, draw you insane
It's just pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain
Another man's loss, another man's gain
Stay in the game, pleasure and pain
We treasure the fame, pleasure and pain
Pleasure and pain, pleasure and pain, pain, pain, pain</pre>
