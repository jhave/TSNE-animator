[Motion Man]
Yo, this goes out to my man Ced Gee
TR Love, Moe Love, yeah

[Chorus]
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge, the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, bay bay bay

[Motion Man]
I bing brass, like a fifteen inch subwoofer
Rattle the attic, collect from another hooker
Hook off, like a boxer in the ring off
Air will probably rat you out for the sting off
You iced, like a rapper in the video
Remove your sihlouette, now you lookin silly though
I turn, like a many-faced racist
Praise the Lord, and study as an aethiest
I'm massive, like an outstretched polar bear
Rappers they feel me, girls think I'm teddy bear
She holds me and hugs me, links to drama that she loves me
Rough ball playin like rugby
I wanted her ugly, needed her ugly, treated her ugly
Look - she's very very ugly
Sexin her ugly, callin her ugly, send her back ugly
for - you black MC's
Who's gettin that deez nuts, star struck
on the uppity up, chicks cluckety cluck
I vanish, like ounces out the bottle
You blemish, like a bohemic model
I tarnish, like a warn out athlete
Bring it back to freestylin on the corner street
Skills, you ain't got 'em like a newborn
Muse the park on the ride like the Matterhorn
Now catch me, Jeep out, Grand Cherokee
Hit the highway and you stare at me
Livin like Earl, "Ea-rrr-l, That's Yo.."
life and time of a scientist
Buggin stance like a praying mantis
Showing size mentally gigantic, best mechanic

[Chorus]
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, Bronx Bronx Bronx

[Kool Keith]
When I rock, within Iraq, you can't deal
Reel to reel, your girl is on the birth control pill
Open 'em up, dopen 'em up
Catch it like a cold until I pour soap in your cup
It's nice and slice, he's rollin the dice, he's chasin the mice
And leavin no price, shows for the broads in tights
It's right price, he's pound for pound and down
Check it check it check it.. like Man-tronix
Hydraulics, supersonics
Ain't that boring ebonics girls up on it
You know you want it, like Katie, I te-ach
Spellbound, K-double-O-L
Move the crowd swell, battle anybody in a tight little cell
They all light in the ass, real frail, backslasher
Keith is on the stereo, grand imperial
Funk material, take you to the burial
Keith is wheelin, what more can I do?
Booin your crew off the stage and find a big wayback
Look at you fumble, look at you stop, look at you flop
Look at your jam, look at your clan, rhymin on a sequin stop
Your fakin and takin and eatin the pork and bacon
and shakin and hatin and waitin and outside
Standin around, lookin around
"Man you know it's true"
Blockin you out, droppin you out, stoppin you out
No cop in the house, we came here tonight with Bacardi
You can't stop me, you - you, you
"Kurt is on the Mpeeeeeee, and... and... and..."

[Outro]
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
The Bridge, Bay-Bridge, the-b-the-b-bridge
The Bridge, Bronx-Bridge, the bridge the bridge
