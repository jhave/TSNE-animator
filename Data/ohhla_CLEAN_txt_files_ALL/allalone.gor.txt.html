[Roots Manuva]
Laviti caso? Due to ?run mile?

Snatch a piece of my wonderin'
Distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, seat of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, "where's the waitress?"
Can I take this, really, can I finish this?
These years and all these creatures
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle
Shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted cane, I'll twist a-gain
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say
Known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where
We's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy or we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth o-vah, WE TURN UP THE O-GAH! [Ogre?]

[Chorus w/ weird voices]
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
(ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh)

[Martina Topley Bird a/k/a Noodle? - singing]
Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be, come and save the niiiiiiiiight
'Cause I don't leave
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to meeeeeeee, hmmmmmm

[Chorus w/ weird voices]
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)
All Alone (All Alone)</pre>
