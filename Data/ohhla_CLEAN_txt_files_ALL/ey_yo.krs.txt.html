Who wan come try, dis-respect
De mother yon chop upon dis head (chop man)
Mother knows every style, oh-wayyy-ohh
like Shaggy, one called KRS [Yes!] (whooooh!)
The champagne drink, rock-n-roll link
Holy smoke pon de bass mix (tell em, tell em, tell em)
Never know tell me go, oh-wayyy-ohh

[KRS-One]
You don't realize the magnitude I laugh at you
Flappin you rat-a-tat, you on your own avenue
while I'm slappin you, askin you, "Why you actin new?"
Crushin a mack and you turnin up the black in you
Skill for skill you the minor we the major
I grade your whole album like a mad term paper...
ZERO, don't be a fan!  Like DeNiro
Be a teacher, be a role model, be a hero
Get it clear yo, I be rollin with de po-sse
Now do your plan over or get, ran over

[Mad Lion]
I be crusin down the highway, just sportin in the fly way
Turn it up a notch and de sound hits dem
Creepin through traffic with the sunroof open
to ventilate the scent from the spliff we smokin
Huff with a chop we do not
We make up a mighty powder, said scrap, last week!
We close in the Jeep, no fire for sleep
Dem come rough and make you one of dem weak or
in de dance kill a watch like chicken in my pot
Call dem with de champagne, can't stop that's right!
Man of been to dem place, to champagne away
Sign of money, can virus strike

	"I see you move..."
Look now man, look look
	"I see you move..."
I think it's time for it

[Shaggy]
Who dat from the chat with the boom shot
Hit you with the lyrical bash, so won't last
Rudebwoy check your stash, caught the cash
and if you don't like dat, somebody gettin bitch-slapped
I'm the raggamuffin with the Dream Team
KRS, Mad Lion guaranteed to make your money scream
(See?  All you need) rhythmatical style
(Need) ya done gwan irie, peep
Pump ya best if ya irie, like me
Cause we don't want know si-ren, hey
Nuff a rhyme works, nobody gets hurt
Look up on the dancefloor, herd of nothin but skirts
Fellas in the club, actin like vi-pers
Bitin them girls like your name was Marv Albert
Baby love no fighting, come to back biting
You and your girlfriend should do the right thing
I'ma let this beat swing, while I think I'm the king
and go rap pon a nice sexy young queen

	"I see you move..."
	"I see you move..."
