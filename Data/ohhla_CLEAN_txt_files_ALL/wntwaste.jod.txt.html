[People Talking]
Yo what's up K, what's up dog (Hey)
It's cool man, yo what's been goin' on with you man
Look K, you know everything that's been goin' on, what's up baby
What's up, so what's up man,
Nothin' just the same girl that gave me a tatoo last weekend
Well, yeah I heard that, she got it goin' on

[Chorus]
Won't waste your time, I won't waste your time
Don't play with my mind, don't play with my mind
Won't waste your time, I won't waste your time
Don't play with my mind, don't play with my mind

[K-Ci]
Ooh, last night I called you on the phone
Sounded like you had an attitude with me
Do you want me to leave you alone
If so, like a bird I will set you free
I won't NO!

[Chorus]
I won't waste your time
So girl don't play with my mind (Do what you wanna do)
Do what you wanna do (Don't cha' play me like a fool)
Just don't play me like a fool

[K-Ci]
Was it something I said or something I done
Ya know I would do anything for you
Just last week we were having fun
Now all of a sudden you wants to be so cruel, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
I won't waste your time (I won't waste your time, no no)
So girl don't play with my mind (Don't cha', don't cha' play with me)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do baby)
Just don't play me like a fool (Don't waste no time)

[Jodeci]
You know time is too precious girl (Yes it is, yes it is)
So we gotta do, what we gotta do (Yeah)
You know games are not for me no, no (No, no)
If you want, I can play them too (I won't waste your time, no)

[Chorus]
I won't waste your time (Oh)
So girl don't play with my mind (Hey)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do with me baby)
Just don't play me like a fool (Don't cha' play me like ya fool)

[Missy]
Black sugar, the man gets enough of this stuff, it's good nigga
Give me, give me hey, yeah, they got the fingers
Up, up me ass but bigger black sugar
Big up, big up BUMP! BUMP! black sugar
Cats get enough of this stuff, it's good nigga
Give me, give me hey, yeah, they got the fingers
Up, up me ass but bigger black sugar
Big up, big up BUMP! BUMP!
Give me the day, give me the day, I'm freestyler
Breakin' through the place, black sugar on she prowla
Just because I'm far, plenty gent-men gets angry
Bucks and bucks, in my butt and then ya take me, ooh baby
Help me, help me, help me 9-1-1 honey
Check for respect and a nine for me gun, son
I don't really wanna hurt no one
Me just wanna break a few bones when I'm done

[Chorus with various ad-libs] to fade</pre>
