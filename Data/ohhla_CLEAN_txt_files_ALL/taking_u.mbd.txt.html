Song:   Taking You Off Here
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Block the corridor, call the coroner
The drama's over can't you feel the euphoria?
A warrior, you cowards getting cornier and cornier
We don't play games never will we ever toy with ya
Camp with you niggas, so my answer to niggas
Take you for a swim throw his ass in the river
My lord, y'all bitches all fraud to me though
Never banged out, we launch torpedo
Nigga still on paper he report to P.O
Damn!
Jump in the Lamb and we off to the show
Play my cards right, never go see a ho
Or catch me in the crib, compromise like Oh shit
Bitch what you got me into
My Goons will be here with the metal utensils like
Pop pop pop pop pop pop
Noodle heads scream all u hear is them shots

[Chorus: Havoc]
Takin' you off here
Said you gotta get God
Nigga violate it so he gotta get got
Vaccinate me you get bodied that shot
Handle that shit off top [x2]

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Don't play scared business around me
Nigga bleed just like us, I flood the cold street with ya'
Hot Blood, was mad now he steaming
Your soul in Limbo, right there on the cement
The ghost of a bitch ass nigga, Casper
Nigga I'm the worst demon you could ever ask for
Don't conjure me up
Burn in hell like I put a bomb to your truck
It's serious when I creep on a nigga 'nough
Machine dot green grief dot gun powder lungs
Power Ball Money off rap, baskin'
In a lime green light come and get your ass whipped
On cameras
There's no tapping out on that concrete canvas
We don't do the body locks
Fuck a sleeper hold you sleepin' from a headshot
My gun don't premature nut
It bust at the exact time it's suppose to bust

[Chorus]</pre>
