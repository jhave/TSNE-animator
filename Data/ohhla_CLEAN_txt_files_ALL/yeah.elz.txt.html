[Intro - Elzhi - talking] (*echo*)
Up early
Top of the morning to you weak idiotic motherfuckers
It's new Phat Kat and Elzhi
Yeah nigga!

[Verse 1 - Phat Kat]
Your now listenin to the voice of reason
I do it for you hatin cocksuckers and the none believin
Here's another classic for y'all to sink y'all teeth in
Don't be mad at me and mine cause y'all still underachievin
We out cold in the D, me and my niggaz stay freezin
I ain't friendly, fuck all that smilin and grinnin
Quick to turn a situation to the start of your endin
Where niggaz is grimy, we all got cases just pendin
Face on America's Most Wanted, try to find the defendant
You silly rappers, still yappin about your cars and your wheels
Truthfully you need to focus more on buildin your skills
You're stlll, stuck in a time warp, we light years ahead of y'all
Real on the comp, I smash all competitors
I'm ill with the battles, too clever with the metaphors
Dilla told me 'Kat, keep your foot on they neck
And don't even breath on a track unless they cuttin the check'
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs
A lot of suckers won't like it, but they gotta respect
How I don't water my shit down for the record execs

[Chorus - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now put your hands up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Yeah, you know it sound fly
(Yeah nigga)
We bringin hip hop back, it's no lie

[Verse 2 - Elzhi]
Modern day Alex Haley, off the Bailey's
Strikin niggaz on the daily, for comin out they face like Israelis
It's so blissful, listenin to the official
There's no issue, the flow could melt a snow crystal
I bring the drama and spring the armor out my bomber
Like Osama, I quote, your float on the ways of karma
The crowd pleaser, give your child a mild seizure
Rock a style Caesar, run with crooks and wild skeezers
Vacate your premises, him against your nemesis, equal hemorrhages
Bad dreams and foul images
Y'all real funny, when I rain it spills runny
While it's still sunny, I bill money and drill hunnies
DJ's on the wheels spun me
At the right clubs, even lit up the white pubs like lightbulbs
Top notch, trippin off of movies off my watch
Drinkin scotch, observin as I watch what you botch
Yeah, it's the phenomenon, disguised as a common don
Spittin kamis, bombs, grenades, you laid, remember my grade
The phlegm that I sprayed, sharper than a Samaurai blade
Bet it could trim a guy's fade

[Chorus - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
Now turn your levels up high
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)
Pour the Henny and spark the ty
(Yeah nigga)
We livin it real, 'til the day that we die (die)

[Verse 3 - Phat Kat]
The phony MC's, they speak my name in vein is blasphemy
Probably mad cause his ho tried to get after me
Cross my path and end up a catastrophe
I told you the flows I rock nigga, they come naturally
Elzhi he told me 'Kat you shinin
And with every line that you spit, it's like your levels is climbin'
Cause in the booth, I'm the savior
The fruits on my labor
Used to have me on the top of the roof with a laser
Kangaroo boots and my pager
Crew your get paid a, if they gank some loot and a major
Tore off half of your leg and the blast only graze ya
Don't gamble with your life cause Detroit niggaz will fade ya
Got fans all over the land from London to Jamaica
Paris, France, Asia, Hampton and Malaysia
Lost the whole day flyin from Sydney, Australia
Back in L.A., I caught the Pistons and the Lakers
Butter pecan, she got the haters catchin vapors
I seen the world, I've been all over this bitch
And my mind is rich, you need to try to find your niche

[Chorus - Elzhi]
(Yeah nigga)
You gotta keep 'em up high
(Yeah nigga)
We want to see you touch the sky
(Yeah nigga)
It's Phat Kat and Elzhi
(Yeah nigga)

[Verse 4 - Elzhi]
Yo, I'm the chose king, when flows swing, the blows sting
Hoes cleanin my clothes, I stand out like nose rings
At any given time I will shatter the soul
Your head and your hat is just rolled, I splatter your hole
It's the confusin words, makin 'em confusin
Words of what you heard, how to die losin
Niggaz remain cheesed, they main squeeze is on they knees
As my trainees on how to give me a brain freeze
Now me the prick, was flyin bullets out the heater quick
To feed a click, I'm even sweeter when the beat is sick
Dick long as that centimeter stick
Chicks feel it in they stomach like it's a fetus, when the fetus kick
Pullin thoughts out of thin air that my pen share
I'm been rare, even if I came as a twin pair
Oh no, the flow doesn't end there
Strokin my chin hair, I'll send flares to clear it out like skin care
Provoke the scanner, better be in a jokin manner
Cause my spoken grammar, comes equipped with cloak and dagger
Good luck shit, I'm the one you can't fuck with
In a truck lit, by the crib near the lake, where the doves sit
What bitch (what bitch, what bitch ...)</pre>
