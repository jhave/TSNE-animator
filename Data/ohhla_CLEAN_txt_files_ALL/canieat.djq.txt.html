[DJ Quik] + (Voice Box)
A ha ha you don't understand me goddammit (I don't wanna eat it)              
A ha ha ha nah baby I aint wit' it (don't wanna eat it)
I can't do nothing for you on that tip girl (I don't wanna eat it)
So you can keep that salmon sandwhich to yo' self (don't wanna eat it)
Well I kick it for my niggas...
Peep  
 
[Verse 1]
Getting right back back to the nigga named Q
Telling my homies be careful o' the things that you do
Cuz I went out, assed out 
I shoulda never tripped and put my lips in between hips
But I used to eat that thang that didn't sit on a plate
Didn't taste like stank I up and left about 8
But I had to build her make for the fact that I was young
I was showing to prove the hoochies I could work they pearl tounge
But then game got kilt 
Cuz the girl kept pushin' my head all up under the quilt
And I was like damn, you must be sick
You mean you'd rather have a tongue
instead of a pair o' nuts and a stick (You goddamn right)
And every single night, I lick it till my tounge turn white
I thought I was a freak till I heard my homies brag
(Eating that coochie make you grow a mustache)Ya!
So I took that advice and right before I hit it
I took baby monkey lift it up and I bit it
Yeah homeboy I had the coochie in check
But then I got this real bad cramp in my neck
Now my back got so'
But this little ho kept a humping in my face like we was on the dance flo'
But thats what I get for having Susie Q for dinner
Got stuck in her creamy pink center
Help me
 
Chorus: (Voice Box)                       
(don't eat the coochie)  You gotta hear me tho'
(don't....eat the coochie)             
(don't....eat the coochie) A he he you think its a joke huh girl?
(don't....eat the coochie)
 
[Verse 2]
Well my nigga, you ought to save yo' self some grief
If it ain't worth havin' a little hair in ya' teeth    (don't fuck with it!)
Ya cuz you'll come up sho't
With a full pair o' nuts and a lump in ya throat
Cuz even though shes screamin 
She don't want ya semen
She just want a tooounge to keep her ass creamin'
But Im'a let her know baby doll I can't do it
Not in here and fuck cuz all coochie got a taste to it
See I don't know who been digging you out
And licking ya down 
I aint the first girl so I can't clown
But instead Im'a tell you how its done
You gotta tell a ho 68 and I owe you 1
Cuz if you don't then she'll play you like a sucka
Have you lickin on a lollipop......{dumb motherf.....}Ya
But it aint no trippin on mine {Why is that?}
Cuz tounge condoms are hard to find {Yeeeah}
And even if ya dicks protected
You can still catch the high by doing a nose dive
So be cautious and don't be anxious
Even though you never could now you wanna catch ST-Statures
(Now you wanna catch ST-Statures)
But niggas still put they nuts in a frier
Then they get burnt and they wanna fight fire with fire
And then a bitch back
But the song that don't bare back
And please don't eat the coochie
 
Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Yeah.
(don't....eat the coochie) You better hear me baby.
(don't....eat the coochie) I can't do it girl
(don't....eat the coochie)
 
[Verse 3]
So now ya know
Aint nothin' fly bout' the pearl tounge lickin'
And be real safe with the girls your stickin'
Cuz if ya' bare back way back in the day
Then you could be on your wayyyy out! (On your wayyy out!)
And it don't get no brighter
When youre walking round with a tounge like a lighter
Bic (Bic) flick sparkin' often
Sittin in the middle o' the clinic coughin'
Hurt by the die hard bare back feelin'
They got shook like kids from a sinnin'
Dwellin' all in your system
Killin' ya slooow
A real jacked up way to go
So next time you get a fi-fi in ya bed
Make sure you gots you a helmet for the head
Have her wash up if the ho is a hoochie
And keep your mouth away from that coochie
 
Chorus: (Voice Box)
(don't....eat the coochie) Repeat 7X          
You gotta hear me baby
I'm tellin' you
Do you feel me?
You gotta hear me girl
Nah I can't do it
I can come close though
I might lick ya bellybutton and shit
And we up outta here
 
(Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah....Oh Yeah) - Repeat 4X
(I don't want..I don't want to eat it) - Repeat 2X
(I-I-I-I-I don't wanna eat it) - Repeat 4X
(Don't Eat The Coochie)
