INTRO [Maestro Fresh Wes] {Ebony MC}
Ahh yes
Swinging along, just swinging ahh yeah
Me and my main man Ebony MC {Right about now}
Just swinging along {We just swinging along}
Ah yeah, special shout out {Bust it}

[Maestro Fresh Wes] {Ebony MC} (Both)
We rock the mic {We rock the mic well}
We rock the mic {We rock the mic}
Well, we rock the mic and (We rock the mic well)
(1) for the treble (2) for the bass
Come on Ebony MC help me rock the place

{Ebony MC}
We be waiting, playing, anticipation
The next new rhyme that I be creating
For '89 I decided to fix, my rhymes
To make them fresher, to cook under pressure
To be on top and never be the lesser
I'm the animal, uh the hunter
To go getter of a guy
I am the best of the west the beast of the east
Some people call me lazy, but that's alright
I like to lie around talk around, fun around
Sleep, get comfortable and even relax
'Til my sleep meter reaches the ultimate max
To live without my waterbed would be ?????
'Til the party roles around my...
[Maestro]
Well, I'll never be a peddler, never be a bagger
I'm not Jimmy Walker, but I'm not a Swarteneger
You know I got the build of a regular man
I'm not a J.J., but not no Conan
Just Maestro, not second or third
I eat at Burger King 'cause I'm not Herb
And if your name happens to be Herb
Just say {I'm not the Herb you're looking for, Word}
I hate to meet mothers, hat e to meet fathers
They all want me to marry their daughters
It happens to me almost everyday
A girl will take me to her crib and this is what she'll say
'Mom and dad this is Wes' and I'll say hi
Ma will pinch me on the cheek like I'm mom's apple pie
Dad says 'I'm pleased to meet you, I'm Mr. Jones'
'You the most decent chap Janine's brought home'
'Would you like to have a beer?'
No thanks just juice
'Grandma woke up, we'll have to introduce'
'Oh, by the way call me pa, we love to make you our son-in-law'
See what I mean they won't leave me alone
I just wanted to jump in Janine's pretty little bones
Janine said 'grandma, this is Wes'
Grammy said 'hi' I guess she was deaf
I said, hi my name is Wes, 'did you say Fresh?'
That's right Fresh Wes, I drank the juice and I left
{Ebony MC}
Well I was walking downtown and I saw this whore
She had a body like a two by four
She came on over, asked for my number
I said, no ho, all you want is my lumber
No, no baby I won't be doing that
You won't see me stroking no street corner cat
'Cause I'm an arcade junkie, my rhymes are funky
My beats and rhymes rocked Humpty Dumpty
MCs want to thump me, girls want to jump me
My face is smooth and never ever lumpy
   (*Laughter*)
[M] That was good, that was good
{E} Yo, Wes drop that Snow White story man
Go ahead, drop it

[Maestro]
Check it out
I remember a story, when I was small
About Snow White and the seven Dwarves
Well, if you ask me, I know that couldn't be true
If I was one of them I knew exactly what I'd do {What, what?}
The story that was told was totally wack
Snow White was a freak and the dwarves were black
She lived in a house, you could probably figure
What she be doing with a bunch of horny niggas
Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy
Come one, come on, come on she was sleazy
Happy, Sleepy and my brother Bashful
Made sure Snow White got her mouthful
{Ebony MC}
Well I'm the cutest looking guy, I like to say
Conceded you call me, but that's okay
I've often thought about posing for ceterfolds
The girl designed me and they broke the mold
Part of the creation, what can I say
They even made up an Ebony playmate
You know I always keep the body looking fine
The dimple, the smile, nothing out of line
No dirt in the dimples, I keep the face neat
No sugar in the body, I eat the Shredded Wheat
I use the eye drops to keep the eyes clean
Hair so fine I use Ultra-sheen
The buttock firm, the girls enjoy that
No need for exercise I don't collect fat
The feet are large and the jewels look great
You could try to change but you're late get laid
Wish you were me but that could never be
First of all your name is not Ebony MC
[Maestro]
Well, I'm not too big, not too small {Average}
Not too short, but I'm not that tall {5'9" 5'10"}
I'm not a heavy guy and my head ain't bald
As I drive the girls up the wall
I had a girl and her name was Judy
Judy had a super dope big fat booty {Big fat booty}
Everything was cool and everything was okay
Until I met this freak named Shebon {Shebon} the other day
Shebon had a shape like an hourglass
Real fine legs with ... {let's just pass}
Although she looked young, she was an older girl
Thick like Judy with Malaysian curl
Judy had night school onec a week
So that would be the night I'd rock that freak
Well that night I went over to Shebon's place
And to the bedroom we quickly laid
Then I rocked her, oh my, and took a rest
I saw a picture of a child on her bedroom chest {Easy}
I took a good look and I felt so bad
'Cause it was a portrait of Judy at her Grade 8 grad
Torn between two lovers {It's okay Wes, It's okay}
Feeling like a fool {Don't cry man}
I just fucked Judy's mother, and Judy's in night school
Like Keith I make the ladies Sweat
What yo learn about women, I'm trying to forget
I wrote a love jam, now the girls are drooling
I play like Heavy D boy, (just coolin')
Like Laverte, I'm the love expert
No time for casanova but I clock 'nuff skirts
To be blousing, my rhyme arouses
Like blue violets and red rouses
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
{We rock the mic} we rock the mic {Well}
We rock the mic and {We rock the mic well}</pre>
