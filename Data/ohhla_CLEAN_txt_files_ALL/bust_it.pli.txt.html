[Intro]
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby

[Verse 1]
First time we had sex, it was like a movie
Both of us fell asleep, both of us woozy
Love how she say my name, love how she do me
Gained feelings for her kinda quick, kinda blew me
Found myself thinkin' bout her, shit kinda spooked me
Mo' time we spent together, mo' she got attached
I love bein' 'round her, seem like the perfect match
She ain't blow my phone up and she never hack
She knew her place, played her role and she was cool with that
"What you doing" "Where you going" questions she don't ask
She took my mind off the streets, she helped me relax
She wanna V.I.P. her face, she put me on my back

[Hook x2]
Her sex game crazy, body so amazin'
Kiss like she cravin', walk like she taken
Attitude mistaken, fiendin' for her daily
Care about her greatly
Why she my bust it baby

[Verse 2]
What we did last night got me wanna call her
If I wasn't real homie I probably stalk her
From the hodd, when she get drunk she talk proper
Got kinky with her, told her dress up like a lawyer
I was the judge last night, I gave her all the orders
Worked it real good, turned her 'round dog and spoiled her
Told her if I gave her anymore I'ma have to charge her
Felt the vibe in the room, the feelings gettin' larger
Took her from the bench now I turned her to a starter
Taste like sugar, smell like water
Now she into goons all off what I taught her
What I do to her make her care about me harder

[Hook x2]

[Outro to fade]
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby
She my bust it baby, she my bust it baby</pre>
