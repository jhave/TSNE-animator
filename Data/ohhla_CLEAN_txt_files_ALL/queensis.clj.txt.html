[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Uhh, Yeah, Yeah, Uh huh, 'Cord this shit
'Cuz I'm bout to practice this shit
I'm here to crack ya cat's skulls open
Fuck ya head up, more than that bullshit ya smokin'
Niggas buzz you in the door, but I blew it open
Ya rhymes is trash, that verse aint worth the token
Try to hop this, monotonous, murderous thoughts
When I'm plottin this, overthrow the government
Burn the whole metropolis
Lyrical warfare, hip-hip apocalypse
Strap devils to the chairs
Start shockin shit, Q U, I chew through
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue
Flex could take one, too
The wait, I'm supplyin'
My crew pop they iron from ?HTM? to the peaks of Mount Zion
I'm ready for the showdown
Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down
I blow through your clique like hurricane Floyd
Keep rappers paranoid, kept your bodies in the game
Is something I can't avoid
Shit get tricky like Zigfried and Roy
I seek and destroy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Uhh, turn me up a little
I'm a blaze yall niggas and represent queens
Run up in ya cribs, fill ya tubs qwith gasoline
Smash ya plaques, tie ya arms back
What's ya worse nightmare, Black? I'm beyond that
The mic how I strike it, got 'em dialin' psychics
Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it
With niggas that's invited without recited ignited
It burn madd slow and that's why - easy to light it
Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited
Your ass looks stupid tryna fight it
You wanna get your ass smacked up
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up
But when my Queens niggas flashed, then you backed up
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up
It's the L nigga dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head, Be
And the rappers you idolized, that idolized me
I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea
And Todd sharper horrors, we battle to the death
Tonight there's no tomorrow
I'm out for revenege, like rebels in Nicaragua
But I can take it farther
Travel back in time, fill ya baby bottle with lava

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Fucker, yo, aiyyo
This is how we put it down, this is Veteran's Day
We work hard so we can play hard and push them big things
Persistant, we keep comin' like some nigs
Droppin albums, every few years we rich
We the best, we the vets
We do this for the love, we thirst for that street shit
It's P, nigga, check my record, it's flawless
Do the knowledge to the chorus
Yeah ya fuckin' right
While I was raised on my fuckin' life
I did my time on them corners, now I lead the fuckin' life
Large dollars, guns and ice
Is nothin' you know my weight and the price of it
You know how the Q dogs do cousin
We don't follow trends, we set those, so get up on it
(So get up on it)
*click*

[Chorus]
