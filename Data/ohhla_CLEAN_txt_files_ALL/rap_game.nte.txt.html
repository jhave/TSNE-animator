(*talking*)
Uh, doing our thang (bounce)
Still independent nigga (taking over this shit)
We up in there, know I'm saying
Big Shot Records D-Red, C-Note out that Botany
We keep it crunk (in the hizzle) block to block
Stay crunk at all times, overseas

[Hook - 2x]
It's so strange, in this motherfucking rap game
It's so much, like the motherfucking streets mayn
It's all the same, in this motherfucking rap game
It's so much, like the motherfucking streets mayn

[C-Note]
Now we out of town, doing these shows
Freestyle flows, fucking with hoes
Back in hit the city, move three kilos
Now I'm in and out your do' in the studio, the studio
But it's strange, out this motherfucking rap game
It's so much, like the motherfucking streets mayn
Niggaz don't, wanna see you come up
Next thing you'll blow up, now they all on your nuts
And niggaz trying to fight, just to get to the top
Just to be the next artist, to rule Hip-Hop
Just like the, motherfucking streets
We bust on these niggaz, like we bust on these beats
And these niggaz wanna play, the fucking CEO
Niggaz stealing my money, you's a CE-Hoe
Nigga best to come off, my fucking do'
Or I'm laying everybody, on the fucking flo' nigga

[Hook - 2x]

[D-Red]
We got street fame, street game a street name
Botany out the Hooker, you know the set we claim
Cloverland is the spot, and yeah we keep it locked
And we bouncing through this thing, fifty deep packing glocks
Be bout your cash mayn, and make it last mayn
And from the streets mayn, you know the rap thang
And on the smash for the cash, and man we got to get it
Gotta lick for ten feathers, and playa we gon split it
Nigga be flicking water by my set, hit your corner
Fifty round shots, aiming straight for your daughter
But enough with the bullshit, stacking up platinum hits
Keeping it hood rich, serving the real shit
Botany is the block, that's crunk at all times
Stepping in Adidas, fa sho we got to shine
Well playa check the stilo, fucking with C-Note
D-Red nigga Chino, Botany for your heroes

[Hook]

[C-Note]
Niggaz trying to steal my grands, steal my fans
Just like a dope fiend, trying to steal my grands
But I'm still catching out, on twinkie-4's
And my flows be cold, like an Eskimo
And I'm wearing Air Forces, when I hit the cut
DEA Task Forces, trying to hit me up
Look at here officer, I made a big change
I'm making millions, deep off in this rap game

[D-Red]
Here I go again, stack a few ends
Me and cute friend, set a few trends
Hit the big Benz, sipping on the Henn
Dubs on the spin, blue light lens
Baller-itz's style, but only buck wild
Hit the spot twelve o'clock, popping Cristal
But in the mean while, we gonna ball dog
And you can put that on the Clover, Big Shots forever dog

[Hook - 2x]

(*talking*)
Know I'm saying, I know these rappers
Know I'm tal'n bout, uh if you from the streets
You know I'm tal'n bout, you know I'm saying
Or maybe you don't
Cause you ain't from the streets nigga, uh</pre>
