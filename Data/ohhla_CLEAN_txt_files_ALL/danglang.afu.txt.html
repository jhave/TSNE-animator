[RZA]
Give me the sign
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh

[Afu-Ra]
Yo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo
Ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo

I float like a butterfly, sting like like a bee
Muhammed Ali can't groove smooth as I be
High karate, enhanced thoughts with kimosabi
No mixing me up, I might rock all day
Gots to the rim, fight for my kin
Like the X-Men, my sense will be simile dressing and visually
Pounce my flows round the rings of Saturn
Gore-texxing, next section, jet-settin'
My key code kept alpha-numeric
Ready to set it, payin' the bills, you couldn't get it
The blemisher-finisher, finish too sinister
Or do you want the asiatic, acrobatic, chiropractic
Merit through the backflips
Supersonic, chronological, logical
We will inwobble you, ill specifics
Power flows through it, knowledge ready to rip shit

We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Di-dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

[RZA]
It's the big double dancer, extravaganza
Zodiac: Cancer, who's the boss?
Tone dancer? No
Bob Digi son, I lodge fifty
Shots to your mouth, buck, and dodge swiftly
City crisis, I roll with po-lices
Ain't known to slap dick on all mighty ices
As I bathe in the jordan
Collect calls, from the comission of Gordon
Cult class when I play with the organ
Now I'm a free, black man like Morgan
Knock your head out the park as if I'm Joe Black
Walkin through the halls with bat showin no heart
Zig Zag put your ass in the shit bag
And steal the show from the thief with a black gag
You can run from the gun but you get tagged
And I'm back at my lab humming fat bags

[Afu-Ra]
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Di-di bodododododo)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

One time in the place to be
I'm on the mic, and you know I'm straight rippin' it, G
Check, one two in your face you see
Afu-Ra transform to electricity
My esoterics lyrics, I said it, you're synthetic or sympathetic
Rock timbies in peetree dishes
Watch me set it, yo
Microscope and you transmit through the local news
Even though I spit to youths, got to spit the truth
I'm insane with the jingle
I'm biggin up my knowledge, the rhmyes, the beats, they mingle
I'm gettin busy with the lingo
Now you don't want it, they don't want it
Crack that ass like a Pringle
Peginistic with symbols and visuals
Adults flock like sheep need miracles
It's simple to see, that you holdin with the fairies
Thinking of a rap name, you're straight imaginary

We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this
We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

[RZA]
Dodododododododo

Bob Digi....Afu-Ra....splashing you....straight up

Wisdom cypha, cypha wisdom

We can't, we can't ignore the ryhthm

True Master on the track, and you might slapped the fuck back, biatch
