Song:   Jet Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus 2X: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this jet ho
Talking jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life
Jet life to the next life

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Club couches, gold digging hoes hounding
Wishing to wake up in one of our houses
'Cause we got it, they want it, high end shopping on Rodeo
Bags, boxes being carried, they wishing we was married
Yacht party, I suggested she wear no socks with her Sperrys
Choppin vulgar and proper over vodka and cranberry
She wasn't offended, she was all the way with it
Said she rolling with me 'cause she know I'm going for the millions

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Let's go, hold it in and don't let go
Diamonds frozen up, pockets swollen up
I been rolling up since I was old enough
Niggas wanna talk about us, nigga what about timing
Niggas wanna talk about luck, nigga what about grinding
I'm baking wherever I want, I'm paid so my trunk in the front
Make in a day what you make in a month
Got a lot of cash so a nigga gon' stunt
Spend it on grass, Spitta rolling one up
Yea we live fast but the main thing is trust
TGOD, keep gin in a cup, get in where you fit in, I'm winning

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Twisting up sour, living in a tower
In a double S Impala, horse power
Girls follow, recognize and seek guidance on counting dollars
High on top a money mountain, never coming down it
Looking for a G, capital, well you found it
Green back, stacks, overseas his accounts is
She know all about it, mama ain't stupid
She know this her time and she about to choose him

[Chorus]

[Outro: Curren$y]
Bitches who tryna move up be quick to choose us
Wanna run with us, well you gotta lose them losers

Bitches who tryna move up be quick to choose us
Wanna run with us, first you gotta lose them losers</pre>
