Song:   Get Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Here I go back in your face
comin at you with some sweet shit that you can taste so
check me out drown your doubt if your feeling what I'm given
let me hear you shout (Hey) that's what I'm talkin about
got the whole crowd kicked up from inside out
in other words I just slatuerted the mic
and you can blame the holy water cause it got me high (for real!)
I'm a professional so its best to confess I'm untestable
people say that I'm out of control
cause I'm so abstract when it comes to my flow (my flow)
I'm hotter than a space heater give the world scholar fever
just to make em all believers (all believers)
call me a face you can trust if you ever need a crazy native ready to bust...

[Chorus]
GET DOWNN.... Lay Lowww..
[x2]

Breathe... tell me how you feel? you looken winded I suggest you chill.. (cha cha chill)
get out the game if you cant keep up
just because you think the underground place too rough (too rough)
I been doin this.. Native funk so I ain't new to this I'm an old school cat
but I'm.. young at heart with a brand new axe (chop chop) just enough
to do what I do when its time to clear a path to make some room
(man look out!) push a bitch boy straight to the back
its savious that a good time is what they lack
abusive cause they mind is close its like they all got
infected by a haters cold put em in they place for real
and if they make a fucken move then you know the drill

[Chorus]

Bare Knuckle Give it all you got pop a blood sucka if he munchen on you knot
(Bitch) Get down like you suppose to do
and grab the world by the balls and try to pop them to
let em know who they fucken with
I'm drunk slash weed head lunitic
king of the mountains so I'm wearen a crown head
huntin through my life and I ain't fucken around

[Chorus to end]</pre>
