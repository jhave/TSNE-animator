                    {Hook} (Petey singing) [Petey rapping]
 I told y'all (I told y'all)
 It was 'bout to happen, but y'all wouldn't listen to me
 (I told y'all) Now you see it's poppin' off
 Got you in he club, dancin' your ass off
 (I told y'all) Break it down Break it down for me
 Break it down Break it down Break it down for me
 (I told y'all) Break it down for me
                                    [Verse 1]
If y'all ready get your lighter and put your fire in the air
'Bout to blow this up (oh yeah)
(Is it?) It's on now 
Petey Pab' done graduated
Broke 'em loose 
Shook 'em off
Twist the game
(Chooga Chooga Chooga Chooga) train comin'
Full speed!
Aint nothin' stoppin' this muh'fucka
Puttin' it down (Ch- Chooga Chooga Chang)
In my hometown (My niggas keep pickin' me up)
I got it rockin' at the show 
All year a motherfucker stompin' in the flo' (boom boom)
Losing control! (eyes closed)
Hands up (bob in the dome)
And you can call it what you wanna (if you wanna)
But you better keep your eyes on it
I done told ya over and over 
I don't feel like talkin' no more
It's about to go down (Just like I told ya)
                            [Hook]
Move over
Makin 'em diesel 
Fueled up
Jesus
Mmwaaa!
Clear the road 
Block it off
Hold it back 
Make a path for it 
I'm a creeper
Carolina street sweeper
My brother keep her
You better believe her 
Good as a bag of Afghanistan reefer
I can't fuck wit me and y'all can't neither
(Hear me rap) You'll need bulletproof speakers 
(My impact) Will kill 79 people
(Hah) The levels start to jumpin' on the needle
Then sparks start to shootin' out the speakers
DJ just just can't catch the needle 
Clubs call the beaver for the flavor of the Petey
                            [Hook]      
When they ask me where I'm from I say
Greenville, and Raleigh
Durham, Chapel Hill, Greensboro, Charlotte
Fairfield, Rocky Mount, and Tarboro
Pine Tops, Lil' Washington, Farmville
New Bern, Kinston, Snow Hill, Falkland
Please don't get me started
I could call 'em out til' tomorrow
Carolina's list alone is 16 malls
I'm bout to make a role call
Calling all out COULD TIMBALAND PLEASE REPORT TO THE OFFICE!
You can't miss kickoff
Watchin' these niggas get they shit off
Sending adrenaline rush through the whole park
Dust to dawn 
From the club to the barn 
Port to port
(Nigga!) From yard to yard
I done brought it from the far beyond 
Stated claim 
Got a name, got it painted and framed 
MOTHERFUCKER!
                        [Hook] 2x
