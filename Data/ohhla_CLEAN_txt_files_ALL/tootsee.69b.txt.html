(Verse 1) 
I don't know what you've been told 
It ain't the butterfly, it's the Tootsee Roll 
A brand new dance SO,
Grab a partner and get on the dance FLO'
And work them hips a lil' bit 
Then do that dip a lil' bit 
Oh yeah, you got it, now whip, baby, no buts about it 
And you over there, with the long hair 
Keep rollin' that derriere 
'Cause it ain't hard 
Just a brand new dance for the 199Quad
69 in the place to be
Hey yo, 'Ski!  What we came to see? 
Cotton candy, sweetie, go,
Let me see the Tootsee Roll!
