Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
This, this, this, this one of them ones
Yeah, Tech N9ne!
Turn me up a little bit more Ben so I can rock this the right way brother
If you got 20/20 vision
You can see me now handling this music with precision
If not, then it's fine with me
Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see, Yates

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
How in the hell can you miss me
When I'm counting me mail? making history
Trip the splits be that 50/50
So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly
When the trash, mail and pizza man see me
They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy
I'm easily beast and my hand is in my belt
What? I'm independent and I'm feeling myself
A flunk I won't be
I bumps the trunks see
The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey
They want to flaunt me
My songs be funky
Steady getting that cheddar forever
But some acting like the don't see

[Chorus: B.o.B]
I'm top dog, something like a CEO
I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio
But they don't really see me though
But they don't really see me though
All night, life like a video
Prime time, something like a Super Bowl
But they don't really see me though

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
With contact lenses say he don't smoke
I'm rolling up and let the contact get them
He even choked
My approach was to never to be broke
Kept my real niggas close
Now the player turned to coach
I hear people saying why so many changes?
Why so many watches? Why so many chains?
I'm mixing Kush with all these different strains
Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain
So much knowledge I came up on you as a Hollywood insider
The inside of my crib look like a gym
Speaking of gym, I'm in a gang, you're just a bench rider
You ride the bench that mean you ain't playing
You understand, hella fans,
Bunching hands, hundred grands that's the plan
Wizzle Man!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I'm truly blessed
I do request for all of you people to listen
I do see checks and movie sets
And never been a stranger to vixens
Pick up my pen and tell my [?]
When I got a motive and a minute with a mission
You know what I'm a get it when I dip into it
I've been through it, I've been a fighter with a vision
You can cover your eye, brother but why?
Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber
So you utter replies with a tougher disguise
Cause my payday just caught the nose of your lady
I'm at the beginning of my hay-day
Y'all better recognize like Â¡Mayday!
I don't know why jokers just won't let their eyes notice
Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that I'm doper
And I choke ya if you lift the Nine's flow so
So by jokes you know [?]
Couldn't see me with bi-focals</pre>
