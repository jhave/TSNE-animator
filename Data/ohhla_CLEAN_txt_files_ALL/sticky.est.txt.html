[Hook - 2x : Ric Rock]
Sticky fingers is the one I love
I love him, I love you

[Tray Deee]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Sometimes I just look at how you buy me things 
Before I split you wide open and I take a whif
You so fine and now that you mind, it's that time
I'm holdin' on you close, can't wait to be kind
Slowly dig you out and spread you 'cross the sheet
Run my fingers through your hair, 'til you soft and sweet
As you clingin' to my fingers, time to get you hot
Wrap you up real tight, then I lick the top
Got you properly positioned to consume you whole
But I know as we together I'ma lose control
Any way I spark the flame and the games commence
As your aroma take over I get faded quick
See you fill me with a feeling so fulfilling it's thrillin'
That without you it's about to be a reason for livin'
I spend my last cash, even chose to fight
But yet I would even share if the mood is right
Let's get high

[Hook - 1x: Ric Rock]
Sticky fingers is the one I love

[Goldie Loc]
Where my grinder at?
Where my grinder at?
So I can breakdown some Colombian black
Can't find my tire, so I use my 'tibs
Twist it up in some chocolate, now hit this shit
... And hold it in for about 20 seconds
Now how the hell you'd get "Mary Jane" naked?
Watch me light the cigarette up, I bet it burn out
Now hit some of this shit nigga, it get you turned out
Make you wanna jump back and kiss ya'self
Solo blunt to the neck, I don't need no help
But if I run to a bad bats, it's just anotha dollar loss
In time to pop my coller, 'til I pop a coller off
Situation sticky, no need for being picky
Don't touch ya face, the crystals make you itchy
Who's the theif that stole ya keef?
I had to smash on the teeth, right down the streets
You know why?
