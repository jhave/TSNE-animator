[Marley] Yo we should get a funky beat and redo it man
[Markie] Yo, I'm I'm bringin it back out
[Markie] It's gon' be called, "The Return.. of the Biz Mark"

[repeat 16X]
Go Biz Mark!

[Verse One]
I'm the Biz Markie, I'm known for beatboxin and rap
And now it's time, to bring my funky dance back
And once again, puttin you in a trance
In case you all forgot it it's called the Biz Dance
A movement by the body that's made like a puppet
I'm here to bring it back, and party people love it
So everybody knowin, and those who wanna learn
Get up and move your body as I return

[Chorus: Biz Markie + sample]
[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..
 [repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!
[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..
 [repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!
[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..
 [repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!
[Biz Markie] Wit the Biz Mark, Biz Mark..
 [repeat 4X] Go Biz Mark!

[Verse Two]
Well I'm here to show you like a dance that never dies
That's put inside within yo' TV Guide
A movement of the body that can't be beat
It's like done by the creatures on Sesame Street
Now I can move my body when I'm dancin at a party
Like a ballerina that's drunk on Bacardi
I start to think of pop-and-twist
You think James Brown is wild - ah - bust this!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Now, this is dedicated to everybody out there that know how to do it
And those who wanna learn, this how you do it
You gotta get FUNKY!  You can't get funky you got to get SILKY!
You can't get silky, you got to get DOO DOO!
And this the way you gotta do it, a little somethin
You gotta like, swing your hips like this and jump
And then you gotta throw your hand up to your head
And then your leg gotta hit your ear
And then your hand gotta hit your head
and your leg gotta hit your ear and jump
And this the way to do it
Say one.. two.. one, two, three

Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!
Go, go, go Biz Mark!  Go, go, go Biz Mark!

[Verse Three]
Now all the party people that's standin still
Get on the dancefloor and let's all get ill
Kick your legs 'til the right is into the left
And do a dance that is known as the DOO DOO DEF
Because to this day, it's still kickin live
And if I dance with y'all I will revive it
It is of the words and isn't goin away
I will make it come back like Sugar Ray

[Chorus] w/o Biz Markie</pre>
