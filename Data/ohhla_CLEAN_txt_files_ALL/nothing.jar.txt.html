Song:   Nothing Remains
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames

[Verse 1]
Yeah!
Can you stitch back a ripped heart
Or when it's gone is it torn apart?
I feel allured by the dark like Damian
Crashed on another planet just the lonely alien.
Trying to get these motherfucking doubts out my cranium
I know I'm a make it but this pain's got me caving in.
These industry niggas I've developed such a hate for them
Swear I want to kill them but my momma told me pray for them
Waiting on the day when me and my niggas rocking stadiums
But we've grown apart now I cannot relate to them, nah...
Uh! Now who the fuck says life's fair
Niggas turn their backs on you when you need them right there
Grandmama told me stress'll give me white hair
I can feel something evil lurking in the night's air
My dreams seem distant but they right there
Pray my kids don't grow to inherit my nightmares

[Chorus]
Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Blow an O with that L.A. weed
Feeling stressed cause' I fucked up with L.A. Reid
Plus I got to share the bad news with my scene
Niggas looking at me like I won't succeed, damn!
And it was all good just a week ago
Hope these pussy ass niggas decompose
Turn the stereo up and let the speakers blow
Trying to block the bullshit out blowing reefer smoke
I need to find a shrink to confide to
Why worry knowing God walk beside you
God told niggas I'll advise you
Don't sleep on Jarren, he's creeping right beside you
So how you balance hip-hop and family
I swear to God I think my wife don't understand me
Her music used to be therapeutic
Now a nigga going crazy about to lose it.

[Chorus]
Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames
