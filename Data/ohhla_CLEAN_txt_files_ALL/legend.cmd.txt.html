Master P:
Yo, C
I'd like to mourn the dead (Kevin Miller)
And acknowledge the livin'
Know like they say
You can tell a nigga 
How you feel when they here
This is for all those livin stars out there
The ghetto legends (real niggas)
Niggas thats really doin the hustlin on the corner
(love these thug niggas, ya heard me)
Know what I'm sayin, makin it happen
Niggas in the rap game, changin their lives
Silkk, C-Murder, Master P (haha)
And all the other real mutherfukin ballers out there (freedom)
Motherfukin rookies to the veterans
This is all the real niggas makin it happen
Bitch check it, ya heard me

C-Murder:
Nigga back in the day i used to dream about fortune and fame
Jump in the game and you expect my life to change
I looked up to all the ghetto superstars
Shit, I used to trip when they call a female a bitch
I'm just another lost soul in the world
Destination unknown, Tryin to make it home
And Three strikes, a nigga gone
All alone in the muthafukin end zone
On the football field with my head down
I can't see but I'm tryin to make a touchdown
Damn, will I ever see the other side
I'm this close from doin another drive by
Now I don't really want to make another mother cry
But these niggas, they playin with my fukin pride
Now why, they wanna put me in this gangsta shita
Cause all I wanna do is sell a million discs

Chorus:
Wha wha, I wanna be a livin' legend
Will they let me, I wanna be a livin' legend
Will they sweat me, get paid like the president
Now put my name in the hall of fame
(x2)

Master P:
Say my name
What bitches screamin for
A little skinny nigga learn to hustle and ball
Grew up in the projects
Ran with killers and dealers
No Limit Soldiers keep in the family, no nigga
Don't hate me for planting seeds
C-Murder got the gifts
I got the hennesey and weed
We only run with ghetto stars ???
Like Big Boz, Hot Boyz known for 1-87
2-11, Real niggas made it out the hood
Word seven bigger figures
And you know its all good

Chorus:
Wha wha, I wanna be a livin' legend
Will they let me, I wanna be a livin' legend
Will they sweat me, get paid like the president
Now put my name in the hall of fame
(x2)

C-Murder:
Livin' legend, livin' legend
One who'll raise on top against all obstacles
No matter friend or foe
And we kick it, Ugh
