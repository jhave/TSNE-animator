isolation elegy

our dancer has disappeared into physical therapy
my assistant works invisible regular hours we hope
he never shows for radio or video or other work
arrangements are a thing of the past
his interest is that of a mortician
my musician friend has disappeared
he took the hard drive with him and we live in silence
the brilliant ex-student is on the road
supposedly we're collaborating but he never showed
a show at the university arts center never happened
our tenant flaked out on the pittsburgh tour
so much for moving out of the choking city (new york)
the dance department head has disappeared as well
performances at the local club fell through
work in the three-dee cave seems impossible at this point
{ our principles on the nsf grant are wonderful and busy
we meet and write and go our separate ways }
we had a bad storm last night hurrah hurrah
now we spend days talking to the cat and ourselves
we work at home approaching and withdrawing from the machine
the machine dominates our lives in utter silence
our closest hometown friends have disappeared
we're outside the potential well of the real
we're floating in plasma the consistency of jello
our voices are muffled and disappear according to x^1/8
i listen to other lives on the scanner whispering day and night
we're on automatic trying to leave the big city (new york)
we've no destination in three worlds and ten directions
i've done all i can to decorate this one
buddha stays silent all of them 
and oh what a beautiful sunset i say to azure
oh yes indeedy she says in response
and maybe we'll go down to the lab and dance a little dance
or i'll work on the phenomenology of filters and watch tv
tv is our friend but it never seems to listen
did i mention nick and nick have never called
i wonder what it's like to have breakfast in omaha
i seem to recollect we left our voices there
columbus ohio will do just as well
sometimes i'll pick up a guitar and make my noise
i build small walls around a massive depression
grey goo isn't nano but a condition of everyday life
i can't see the forest because of the trees
we're tired of poverty and isolation
i'm tired of stress and headaches and twitches and pains
bad eyes going worse i can't see the boring world
did i mention the second life performance seems canceled
the curator has disappeared and we're left holding the avatars
it's not much of a stretch to drop objects on the ground
but in second life i'm just a noisy visitor
and where was the show going to happen in the first place
anyway no one's ever there so it's like our house
i'm waiting for the mail and someone to check the electric
she might come this week or the next or down in dark september
that should be as exciting as boycotting the olympics
we couldn't watch the olympics but china's our future
don't forget people here don't believe in evolution
and set out to do anything to disprove it
i've always wanted to say "if you've read this far"
but if you've read this far you're just about here and now
there's nothing else going on but clumps of letters
i think i'll stay awake a few more hours

Reverse excavation and installation of materials for Second Life solo
exhibition, The Accidental Artist


It's difficult manipulating since the Nikuko avatar flies blind; it's 
impossible to see around the body extrusions. Mouse-view only works so far 
since nothing can be done except looking when it's open. Ctl-Alt-D, which 
changes camera viewpoint, helps a bit, but not much. The prims are so many 
and so complex, it seems that the world is close to overload; at one point 
I had set most transparent, but the ray-tracing gets too complex for 
slower machines. There will be three video streams, twelve sound sources 
with ten-second samples, and a continuous source, as well as these 
sculptures and other images on the wall. Sugar likens it to pinball. Even 
with a small avatar body, moving about the gallery is difficult. Most of 
the objects are impossible in physical space - or at least would require a
lot of Plexiglas support. Most of the images on or within the sculptures 
are external body, some imitative of internal organs. The images are 
distorted and have to be perceptually disentangled; they're either tiled 
or awkwardly wrapped. The affair is a gaudy circus one. It's a stage for 
performance (by Sandy Baldwin and myself) as well; moving about the space 
in alien choreographies will be just as difficult for as as for the 
spectators. I can easily imagine a dancespace filled, as this one is, but 
with phantom or invisible objects; the avadancers would find themselves 
and the rest of us among the absent ruins. Here however garishness is the 
premise and the promise of the virtual; there's no reason for camouflage 
in an airless space.

But it's difficult maneuvering in an eyeless space, literally flying or 
walking blind, sometimes falling out of the gallery altogether, ending up 
wedged and lawless. Occasionally a section of floorboard appears like a 
vector; we (Nikuko and myself) might be headed in the right direction. 
Camera angles, when the avatar stills hirself, through a series of 
alternating rotations and translations, can approach just about anything 
within ten meters or so; beyond that, chaos reigns. While these images are 
somewhat hit or miss, they convey the sense of new physics, lost structure
and boundary within the space. Now Nikuko hirself is at rest, in a realm 
as absent as the rest of us, until we log on together, momentarily, to 
work on installing sound.

My enemy the digital, why not to live


It's on the verge of something, on the tip of the tongue, something about 
the digital and its relation to truth and mass accountancy and the 
ability to harness languaging on an unprecedented scale, something about 
the evanescence or shadowing of truth, about dictatorial tendencies and 
the ability to spread and modify code across whole continents, that this 
isn't an academics but an unmitigated furor - and in this sentence the 
digital or any specification/speciation becomes a disease of separation 
and the wager of truth, that is to say a political economy of truth that 
relies not on facticity but on a market or gaming in which truth is the 
outcome, not the forerunner, of stakes. One doesn't stake on truth, but on 
an apparatus that produces truth vis-a-vis accountancy, the digital; it is 
this manipulation that permits staking in the first place. My digital my 
love, my digital my enemy; these inscriptions produce skein, structure, 
market: Every market is an inscription, every inscription a market. It 
becomes increasingly useless to survive, to the extent that survival is a 
condition of change or altruism; instead, the same old game repeats itself 
indefinitely, a game of strategy within which slaughter, dis/ease, anomie, 
become byproducts or residues of categorization. It was writing, the 
writing of the concrete and concrete writing, that began a slide towards 
miasma, no matter how much it was curtailed by that very same writing. And 
what a slide, because also a harnessing of miasma, withdrawal from the 
real; it's a miasma of the imaginary and it's within the imaginary that 
the market is the most violent: without bounds and gaming, truth appears 
both certain and purchasable, and is always, within the digital and 
accountancy, infinitely alterable, without tethering. Without tethering 
there are no bounds, the world is boundless and frontiers are infinitely 
mobile; with infinite mobility comes exponential consumption of resources 
until asymptotic limits are incoherently named and approached - while the 
rich get richer, their class rapidly diminishes and dissipates. There's no 
end to all of this pseudo-fecundity except defuge, exhaustion, extinction, 
and each hour we are all the closer to the chaos of the retrievable. What 
was canonic is nameless, just as genre dissipates into an absence of 
meaning leaving organism without a _not_ to stand on; sure slow death 
results - no one notices, no one has the capacity to notice, all that 
accountancy grounded in backup is lost, the files topple, electricity cut 
off for longer and longer periods, finally none at all.

I think of Hitler and all those records, arms marked by integers, bodies 
cut out, decomposed elsewhere, increased complexity of coding, Auschwitz, 
sludge...

Haptic


The Hapticmath program was written at WVU for a Phantom2 haptic stylus; 
move the stylus, and the cursor can 'feel' the graph of a mathematical 
expression as a groove, which is also visible on a screen. In the 
following series of images, the program is demonstrated and applied to 
equations with anomalous curves. The sin(x) - a sinewave - maps simply, as 
does tan(x) - the tangent curve. But the latter goes asymptotically to + 
and - infinity, and the stylus can't connect at the juncture. This is a 
well-defined vertical line. Of greater interest is sin(tan(x)), which has 
an anomalous region; most of the images are of that. The expression was 
biased to fill the screen, i.e. 3*(sin(tan(1.5*(x+3)))). While dashes are 
visible, nothing connects with the stylus, which tends to disappear, 
become absorbed in the region. The visible haptic anomalous region, in 
other words, becomes a paradoxically indeterminate haptic surface with an 
invisible cursor. Metaphorically, touch has been compromised and absorbed 
in a virtual space barely hinted at. As with my other work, this indicates 
an informal limit where other phenomena appear, and the usual extensions 
of the body, as well as body image, cannot be taken for granted.

Avatar Man with Dream Woman

I've become imaginary
Disappearing in the movement
I've become contaminated
Raster of clock time

Avatar Man with Dream Woman
Don't listen to me, Dream Woman
Don't listen to me, Avatar Man

***

This avatar package
Already dead inside
This building is condemned
We know nothing's alive

You can look inside
He says
You can do it
Avatar edge
Shooting out to infinity

Limits of the world
Images of lost fecundity
Fragility of good things
We're doomed to novelty

You can look inside 
Dream Woman
The imaginary rides
No world
No limit
No grid
Nothing

Our male likes death
It excites him sexually
We know meat in his absence
Gamespace economy

You can look inside
She says
Death meat body
Hierarchy
Not holarchy


Dream woman enters a hole
Twisting through forbidden space
There's no moment to her moment
Hair fluid across face

You can look inside

Hemisphere eye
Prim edge
Geek construct
Linden brain

I have done my work here
Return us to ourselves
The imaginary leaves us
As nothing ever will

Nikuko, others, performing


http://www.alansondheim.org/odyssey.mp4

High compression... this is from the workstation viewpoint... it's hard to 
see around the avatar which is enormous and glowing. Lucian Iwish came on 
later with a structure that enveloped the whole building... but with the 
show, the avatar I use is perhaps twenty-five feet high... Sandy's is both 
larger and smaller, variable, ghost-like... We had a few people the first 
night, a crowd the second (afternoon) who spoke mainly Italian. This sec= 
tion is from the first night. Live instruments included flute, chromatic 
harmonica, sampling keyboard. Sandy's texts flew amazingly, were from our 
theory writing on avatar and the like. My texts were paste-ins from the 
Jennifer, Nikuko, Doctor Leopold Konninger, Julu plays. Sound is from a 
number of simultaneous sources under the control of the viewer. You can 
talk or make live music in Second Life. Time of the recording was set to 
midnight. Second Life beyond the traditional physics (which can be 
countermanded to some extent by creating objects without physics) is 
incredibly malleable; a building roof can exist without support, marked- 
off territories may have no concrete barrier markers beyond the luminous 
floating signs; bodies can be modified at will; flying and teleportation 
are comment; one exists without breathing on land or sea; set carefully, 
one penetrates rocks; you might or might not see through your avatar's 
body; for that matter, objects may glow or be transparent; touch at a 
distance is possible and common; you may construct on land, in sea, within 
air; you normally disappear when your character logs out; environment and 
time may follow Second Life time or be set artificially; one might talk 
with one's voice, through internal instant messaging, or through chat; 
your avatar body may be distorted by others; everything depends on Linden 
corporation; Linden may well be able to hear any and all private conversa- 
tions; beyond Linden there's the horizon of bandwidth; particle emissions 
are quick and contain just about anything; buildings arise and fall in a 
twinkling of an eye... The time is midnight, the objects glow, intersect; 
I believe, without proof, that they are sliding in a fourth spatial dimen- 
sion through some flaw in the software; there are some bodies and some 
objects I may fly through; there are some I am held by; there are some who 
hold me; there are griefers and hackers; there are some who hold me... Who 
am I but avatar-Nikuko, Nikuko-avatar; she speaks through me; asserts her- 
self; possesses a literally uncanny insistence; turns towards withdrawn 
sexuality; is always waiting and awaiting, as I am always waiting and 
awaiting here. Flying through configurations, she settles on a certain 
appearance or style or look; I am back beyond the screen; she controls 
objects greater than any I have controlled; she is adroit. I am back 
beyond the screen; I'm blinded by the objects; for the most part I can't 
see ahead, only slight glimpses to the left and right, slight glimpses of 
the floorboards beneath her feet. There, beneath her feet, are the vector 
guides that somewhat make a mapping. I have three choices: stay within her 
body, breathe her breathless air, or fly her everywhere which gives me the 
slightest vision above the objects, or use mouselook, which allows me to 
see through Nikuko's eyes, gives me her sight, or scent, her touch, her 
perfume. But mouselook takes over the screen; the configuration menus and 
controls disappear; you're only there with her, in her, as she is in you; 
everyone else is present, easy to see and touch; you might run or swoop 
with delight; you might stay absolutely still; but your bound within her 
as your bound within Second Life as a Life, that is, as a being-in-the- 
world which gives you no escape, no meta-processes to fine-tune the 
process. You can't build that way; you are sunk in Nikuko's body, part of 
her avatar-flesh, sheave-flesh, sheave-mind, Linden-mind; your swallowing 
is her swallowing, your food her own. So in these performances, the more 
Nikuko gathers, the more I am flying blind, even building blind, speaking 
blind, dancing and yes choreographing blind, blind in this airless world 
with the trivial fact that it is I who see, dispersed-eye, not Nikuko who 
can only whisper through appearance, affect me through her slightest move- 
ment, walk and talk, sit and stand, nowhere at all. Yet there is something 
of a future here, not in Linden or the Corporation, neither in bandwidth 
nor in prim-counts, but in a peripheral and, again that uncanny insist- 
ence, that feeling that Nikuko is living, not as prosthetic or other 
device, not as prim, but perhaps as a not-so-prim woman or girl or neutral 
or male at the last or gender-ending moment of the real. For Nikuko has 
taken me, just like others have taken you into the unaccountable true 
world, with its lines of flight and inscriptions intensifications and 
dispersed gatherings of selves and bodies, the true world of scatterings, 
spews, emissions, radiations. And among all of this, Nikuko flies, swoops, 
cavorts, in nowhere, among an underground mathesis gone wild, presented 
for your pleasure or operating pleasure, for your frisson or sport- or 
spoor-world, for the spook or glow, fed by nothing, a picture for your 
pretty sight, a longing, for something, somewhere, languor ...


new bodies for old

http://www.alansondheim.org/ aabody series

after advanced/character/ menu produced male and female characters 
accouterments and refused to return all hir objects

Think of SL as an abstracted 4-dimensional space-time continuum: What are 
the built-in constraints? Fundamental forces like gravity have to be 
built-in; there's no _inherent_ reason for its existence. The ceiling 
instead - that which backgrounds the continuum - is corporate, and as such 
might as well be a corporate model for future-culture and cultural proc- 
esses in the 'real world.' 

The corporate model is fundamentally a tacit and leaky one. Tacit: because 
its operations are quickly treated as natural by body and mind (invisible 
prosthesis). And leaky: because it fills every space, construes every op- 
eration, colors and codes within and throughout the true world invisible.

"Corporate" is not restricted to either a particular mode of capital or 
power, nor a particular mode of governance - but instead is a basic and 
backgrounding mode of quantification, related in Second Life and for that 
matter, the older MOOs and MUDs, by the assignment of hierarchies, parent- 
child processes, and identification numbers within the world, world-build- 
ing, and worlding "in general." 

Given this constraint, what are others, and how do they relate? At least 
for the moment, one logs in and out of SL; inactivity logs one out and for 
the most part, when one logs out, one's body disappears (unlike a MOO, for 
example, where a body might be found somnolent in a "body-bag"). In other 
words, one's activity is _framed_ by a process of intention and/or tend- 
ing-towards, a process which requires a particular action on the part of 
the participant - which in fact constructs the framing of the very concept 
of participation.

One is constrained by the process of building, but this is also a matter 
of time, energy, money, and nuisance. A similar constraint exists for 
land-ownership - and within SL, ownership is both relative (in relation to 
the corporation and the continuous output of the corporation, in terms of 
finance, governance, capital, and power in general), and absolute: The 
land that is owned is purely and totally _intended_; it has no otherwise 
existence or mode of being, no wilderness. (One might designate or assign 
a region as wild, but this an intended act as well; it is neither obdurate 
or substance, "idiotic inert" no analog.) 

At least at the moment, one is constrained by three-dimensionality and its 
projection into the 2-space of the screen. Given that, objects may inter- 
sect and self-intersect and may or may not be "gravitationally" bound.

One is constrained by modes of behavior, coded and uncoded; by bandwidth; 
by one's terminal (therefore one's economy and one's relationship to class 
and corporate in any world); by one's health in the physical world; by 
one's ability to script and code. Where is the internal (not to mention 
external) history, per participant and/or login, of Second Life and its 
denizens? Where are the rolls of land ownership and usage? The history of 
SL's code and coding? The detailing of its proprietary software? (The 
world itself is closed-source.) 

(For surely the world as a whole may be investigated, as a book of nature, 
a supine woman, an angry man, red in tooth and claw, as God's hand and 
God's shriveled hand, as systemic coordination and mathesis, as semiosis, 
as subject and object of dissection, of nothing whatsoever.) 

One's steam runs out ...


Poetics of the Virtual

Second Life as a laboratory for phenomenology of representations of space- 
time: think of multiply-connected geometries and configurations, dynamic 
impossible behaviors, behavioral and object intersections and collisions, 
spews, and interiorities. We work concretely and theoretically towards a 
poetics and psychophysics of the virtual through Second Life; through 
abject and inconceivable topologies, we experience an obdurate alterity. 

The poetics of the avatar is dependent upon dissemination, dissimulation, 
and dispersion. One moves as a dispersion as well, moves through skein- 
and sheave-skin; time and objects loop, are activated, suffer through 
detumescence, collapse, revive, are always already potential. The world is

Parters


Convoluted intersecting configurations with tangled occluded textures 
and broken figures. Nikuko-avatar of convoluted intersecting skeins 
tangling occluded sheave-skins towards indecipherment of 3-space 1-time, 
skein-flesh, spew-tissue. Performance no longer insists on coherent body 
or work-body, skin no longer joins skin, cloth is absent substance. This 
is called 'getting there.' Solipsis and Indra come to mind.

Phenomena, Phenomenology, and Objects in Second Life


In the current installation, effectual boundaries are rendered problemat- 
ic; through the use of .pngs with emptied backgrounding, objects are by 
and large deconstructed into partial outlines. This is also extended 
thorough partial transparency. In addition, there are phantom objects that 
are totally invisible but 'felt.' It is possible to create an invisible 
non-physical object that is present but unaccountable and unaccounted-for. 
Particle emissions also deconstruct boundaries, depending on the strength 
of the emissions - number of particles, speed, size, frequency of release, 
transparent or default rectilinear boundary, and so forth. Can particles 
become physical? Can they reign/rain terror? Can they exist invisibly and 
reign physically as well? Where is the subject in all of this? The sub- 
ject, viewer, has two modes - standard from within or slightly behind hir 
avatar, and mouselook, from the position of the avatar itself, with or 
without the rest of the body visible. The viewer may or may not zoom the 
view; the view as such is set by default to a standardized visual field. 
Visually, if not physically, entanglement occurs a fair amount of the 
time, the result of object with partially-transparent textures whose 
surfaces render the normative boundaries problematic. Entanglement reduces 
the possibility of coherent movement. In addition, there are concrete 
issues of scale; the textures are most often panels or tiling of images of 
body or remappings of the body - the bodies most often, but not entirely, 
cyborg or avatar or sheave-skin. In other words sheave-skins are mapped 
onto sheave-skins; mobility is only in terms of the substrate, and that 
only if the object is physical, i.e. can be 'bumped.' Now what this tells 
us about the true world, the world of inscriptions within and without 
physical reality, the virtual, and so forth, is that perception in the 
broadest phenomenological sense is not only determinative in viewing and 
viewpoint but also struggles with an alienness that countermands the laws 
of physics as realized in everyday life. Further, it tells us that the 
three classical states of matter - liquid, gas, solid (never mind the 
other exotic states) - are also determinative; the world is divided just 
as the game 'twenty questions' divides the world. Particle emissions, in 
particular 'heavy' or geometric emissions, break this down, as do self- 
intersections, physical but invisible objects (with standardized weight), 
etc. The result is somewhat related to 'virtual reality sickness,' a form 
of veering as the world appears both imminent and senseless; even when 
sensed, it remains a struggle to get about. From the viewpoint of an 
emitting avatar, the situation is compounded; as such, without mouselook 
the avatar flies or moves blindly; even with mouselook, extensive particle 
emissions effectively block the visual. Think of these emissions as plasma 
and their condition and phenomenological apperception as that which is 
applicable to the fourth, and universally most common, state of matter; in 
this sense the very inscription (through scripting) of particle emissions 
contradicts, on the level of lived reality inscription itself; one has no 
space and no time to circumscribe or circumambulate them - they appear 
everywhere - their source is anomalous - they respond to invisible weath- 
ers - they seem to be a form of 'stuff' or 'stuffing without containment' 
- they're close to the phenomenology of brute or idiotic substance. Thus 
they compound and confound space from above, as it were, just as the 
broken or partially-visible deconstructed objects compound and confound 
space from below. Now the museum or gallery within and without (on the 
grounds or precinct) that presents and contains all of this - and hardly 
contains as emissions escape through walls, viewpoints move underwater, 
the building itself appears to falter - is a representation of what has 
been termed liquid architecture, or at the very least it holds within it 
the semblance of liquid architecture. Think of this as malleable space; 
with the use of slowed emissions and teleportation, it is also malleable 
time  always already vectored, as time is, both within and without 
Second Life, i.e. within the true world. For one is framed by logging-in 
and logging-out, the emissions are vectored and controlled, they respond 
in depth to a universal clock or clocking based simultaneously on the 
speed of the viewer's computer and the speed of the servers and cycles of 
Second Life itself or themselves. This is in other words, all a setting 
and background - malleable space governed and governing + and -, as well 
as malleable time governing +, feed-forward. One can quickly see how 
functions may be applied across these, for example f(t), t > 0, which may 
or may not get us anywhere; certainly with emissions, for all practical 
purposes one is reduced to statistical analyses of fuzzy and intersecting 
(if not interacting) ensembles. So we might say that the digital always 
moves forwards but spatially may or may not occupy any conceivable con- 
fluence, as well as a confluence of the plasma which psychoanalytically is 
related both to abjection and defuge; in other words, within the human 
organism at the very least, plasma exhausts and 'ruins' - corrodes, or 
dissolves, or decays, or corrupts, and so forth. Here the masquerade of 
the coherency of the subject is called into question as it is in Lacan and 
elsewhere; here the very exact and astute boundaries that constructed, 
through code and protocol and software, Second Life itself, are psycho- 
logically 'ruined' as well - it's as if one looked at mold and the coding 
of mold on a molecular level and phenomenologically or culturally tried to 
conflate the two (which of course is possible but a difficult extension). 
So in short we might think of the space or spacing within Second Life as a 
laboratory of sorts, software and hardware (issues of bandwidth and memory 
internal and external to the viewer and the viewer's computer and connec- 
tion) in relation to psychological and psychoanalytical issues, again in 
conjunction with clear or fuzzy considerations of code, the sensorium and 
the vast but problematic and most likely fictitious masquerading of the 
regimes of the analog/ic and digit/al themselves. 

Eidetic reduction? - impossible, too parasitic, noise. Quietude - gone, 
emptied space - non-existent. Emptiness, replete, fecund emptiness. The 
natural attitude - always within reification processes. Too many signs and 
insufficient generators. To mean is to speak. To speak is to speak among 
local sound sources; others speaking or listening; overarching sound 
configuration. Everything is slot or slotted; slots are mobile, futile, 
fuzzy. Psychoanalytical entities are dispersed from origin; there is no 
thing seeing, no thing looking or looked at, a theater which is always a 
mess, never has been anything but a mess - a theater which is under the 
sign of masquerade or constriction, because it is only with constriction 
that plot develops, that characters speak, that one lives in the true 
world, that one inscribes or is inscribes, creates and exhausts meaning, 
tending always towards abjection, defuge, death, almost in that very 
order. The blanket origin of death puts an end to it all; it's on the limb 
or hinge of death that Second Life carries on, and who knows how many are 
logged in under how many borrowed or originary names?

http://www.alansondheim.org/project.mp4 gives a summary of the above in 
terms of a traveling camera; unfortunately this is an untoward or large 
file but at the very least it conveys what otherwise remains in text and 
oddly stillborn. (It uses H264 compression; some of the darker scenes are 
messed paralleling their content; skip about the room, dance w/ them.)

God coming down there to the ground

And God came down to the ground, right down to the ground, and he said, 
Dont for a moment think Im a woman I havent a cunt I want to speak to you. 
And God said what do you have to say. And I said nothing because I had not 
an idea what this would want me to say. And God said no one ever talks to 
me wah wah wah no one ever says a word. And I Nikuko have that word that 
is never said. But I would not say it. And God said I am begged for it. 
Still would I say nothing. And God said and I am thanked for it what I 
have not and will have not given. And I Nikuko showed my cunt to God. And 
God said wah wah wah I have smelled this smell and I am on another planet 
far away. And I Nikuko now I said no you are here. And God said Because 
you have a cunt you speak to me. And I had nothing to forgive him for that 
because he said that. And God said wah wah wah I am very lonely. And God 
said Here is this tiny spot of whispers. I did stand away from that spot. 
I Nikuko did stand away from that spot. And I did hear nothing. And God 
said I havent a cunt and you stand away and yet you hear nothing how do 
you hear nothing from that spot when I have spoken and you did have 
knowledge of that speaking. I Nikuko covered myself with blood. And God 
said you must answer me Nikuko because I have come down on ground to speak 
and wah wah wah. I Nikuko covered myself with piss and mud. God said wah 
wah wah I did love mud so why must I have had to make a man with that 
dirty thing. Why must I make a man to piss that dirty thing. Still I would 
say nothing. God said I am always thanked and I do want a thanking no 
little means never any more. I Nikuko covered myself with shit and it was 
my shit and my blood. And I Nikuko covered myself with piss and it was my 
mud. I did make mud. And God said wah wah wah I havent a cunt I will make 
water I will call rain. And God called rain forth and called rain ruin. 
And God said that rain will make water. And God stood in his water. And I 
Nikuko saw that God hasnt a cunt but God has water and shit. And I Nikuko 
stood in Gods shit wah wah wah. And I did anoint my cunt with God. And God 
came down into it. And God said I must want you to have talk with me. God 
did say that to someone perhaps it was me Nikuko. I did say nothing. And 
God said I am a dirty thing. And I Nikuko did say to what is that. And God 
did say that is to me Nikuko. And God did say I am the bind of it. And God 
was the bind of it and I was not. I Nikuko was not the bind of it.

The Different Roof


Julu Twine dances around while God's busy redoing the roof.
They they take a look at prim depth.
Julu's happy that the thing spews different.
God redoes the outdoor prim with glow and texture of breasts.
Julu thinks the whole thing is over-ripe.
God thinks it's fecund.
Julu thinks God's fecund.
There's no end to it.

God and Second Life


"Just read it, and you will find, about the twenty-third verse, that God 
caused all the animals to walk before Adam in order that he might name 
them. And the animals came like a menagerie into town, and as Adam looked 
at all the crawlers, jumpers, and creepers, this God stood by to see what 
he would call them.  After this procession passed it was pathetically 
remarked, 'Yet was there not found any helpmeet for Adam.' Adam didn't see 
anything he could fancy. And I am glad he didn't. If he had there would 
not have been a free-thinker in this world; we should have all died 
orthodox. And finding Adam was so particular, God had to make him a 
helpmeet, and having used up the nothing he was compelled to take part of 
the man to make the woman with and he took from the man a rib. How did he 
get it? And then imagine a God with a bone in his hand, and about to start 
a woman, trying to make up his mind whether to make a blonde or a 
brunette." - Robert Ingersoll, "Mistakes of Moses," in "Mistakes of Robert 
Ingersoll," J. B. McClure, ed., Chicago, 1879.

perhaps her great sadness, and video and image


 her great sadness which never ends, always i knew her
when she was abandoned or her heart eaten out, tonight a nightmare:
what were the dreams of my dead mother, surely they have died with her
and all those rich rooms and intense childhood scenes we shall never
have known, how sad, and how sad that sadness is cliche now, with all
of us and our kind and the kind and kindness of others facing extinction

Odyssey presents:

THE ACCIDENTAL ARTIST

Alan Sondheim

GO TO location: http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22

VIDEO PERFORMERS: Foofwa d'Imobilite, Azure Carter, Kira Sedlock,

Virtual Environments Laboratory at West Virginia University, Gary Manes, 
New York State Council of the Arts, NSF

WRITE HOME: ACCIDENTS HAPPEN! Poor little avatars hide behind poor
little avatars! Avatars ab/use! Avatars don't need air! You can't
weigh them! They don't know the meaning of the word! THESE avatars
don't know anything! They're weighed down by coordinates! They can't
fuck! Their prims bend, smash! Smashed prims are prims. Hello, hello!
Video and performance spewed from a laboratory of virtual
environments. IN MY WORLD, THERE ARE NO ERRORS, ONLY SEDUCTIONS!

The human figure's place in art gets turned inside out here in this
world of unfolded and refolded geometries. What remains of the body
in the domain of the virtual? What survives the transition? Could
this still be called a body? Where are we going in this crossing over
into bits, why are we going there/nowhere and what does it say about
the nature of human desire?  At what point does a beautiful accident
become a tragic mistake? Is there truly such a thing as a mistake?  

A pioneer in virtual worlds and networked environments, Alan Sondheim
brings his latest work to Odyssey http://odysseyart.ning.com/, an
international community of artists working on 2 servers in the
networked 3d virtual world called Second Life.  An autobiography of
Sondheim's career as an artist can be found here 
http://www.alansondheim.org/COMPBIO.TXT

This exhibit is being presented in the networked environment Second
Life on the Odyssey simulator. To view this work you must have a
Second Life account and avatar, which is free of charge and 
is quick to set up and learn the basic functionality. To set
up an account, go here: http://secondlife.com/ Once you are logged
into Second Life, click this link
http://slurl.com/secondlife/Odyssey/48/12/22 in your web browser and
the Second Life client will teleport your avatar to the location of
the exhibit. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate your
avatar through the exhibit and be sure to press play on both the
audio and video buttons located on the lower right of your Second
Life client.

Thank you!

underwater everything shimmers and boundaries are seen as they truly are
they move, there's no editing to them
there's no gainsay to them and once you speak they've ceased listening,
and once you speak they're already gone
