[Ja Rule]
Murda Inc, ha, ha
It, must, be the ASS - that got me like damn
If they get any fatter
Man the Rule gonna have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and the shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't it funny
It's been awhile since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me why ya want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind
See it never had to be this way
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kind of lame
Knowin how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny
Baby that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

[Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus]

[Cadillac Tah]
C-A double D, HA!!!
Double dose ma
Fly by, red line, Testa Rossa
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit 'em, get rid of em
And you know Tah get it gully
And ain't that funny
How they want me see me workin' with money
But Caddy ain't a dummy
What these brodies want from me
Cause all I got is G, J.LO!!!
And Murda I.N.C.

[Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your blingin' bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' why you play the fool

[Chorus]

[Ja Rul]
Baby, is that your girlfriend
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby, I've got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
