[U-God]
That's me, that's right, yo, the Wu in the place
Keep shittin' on me, til you blue in the face
Veterans chase, circulate the rat race
How the hell this dirt bag get on base?
Bang the 808, when he go ape
You just an eighth, I'm kilo weight
Let me demonstrate, when I squeeze the raw
I'm going for the throat, cup of season fall
Honey wit the hips, make me leave the floor
And it's blood, sweat &amp; tears, got her bleeding more
I'm a physicist, but I know what matters
I'm not a doctor, but I'm losing my 'patients'
I talk to the nation, with the deadly manuscript
Accurate long fire, mechanic grip
Make the Titanic flip, from hip hop tonsil
Head fly, head guy of the Jedi Council
Throw me the alleyoop, scoop you off your feet
You just a fluke, the proof is in the heat
Bang on the industry, walk the tightropes
Psycho thinker, a stinker, lyrical blitz
Mix the coke batter like it's Miracle Whip
Highly explosive, fire the wit
Deadly venom stick, to the walls and bricks
All I got is my dick and my balls, my last words
I might swerve, it's just the tip of the iceberg
Precise verbs, slice words, strike superb
Hawkeye in flight, nigga, like the bird
And I want it so bad, I can't fight the urge
When money get tight, yo the spider splurge
I'm on the urge, wit the killa crystals
Deep in the basement, building the missiles
The last one missed you, here sniff two
Big bags of Dopium, black top, jack mack tops
Open 'em, now I'm scoping 'em
Get your feet wet, I end this rhyme
Wit a one, two, three step, yup</pre>
