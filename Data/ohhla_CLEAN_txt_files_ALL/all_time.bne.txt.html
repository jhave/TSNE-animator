[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be chillin in a casket-
Than livin in this madness
Feelin like a captive
In prison, like a savage
Depression from oppression
Meet they modern day slaves, US!
This system was designed to stay paid, off US!
These are the Signs of the Times, critical
Hard to deal with
Lately it's been hard to live with
Mama got laid off, papa got laid off
I gotta make it happen
Get it crackin, and get paid y'all
I'm just tryina survive
Stayin alive, it's do or die
And I ain't ready to die right now
Is it the end of the wooooorld?
Must be the end of the wooooorld
So doomed, so gloomy
So dark, so shocked, so truly
Refuse; to get the Mark of the Beast
Never walk with with the beast
Because you fall with the beast

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since we've been waiting on that better day
Cause we don't really wanna remember the yesterdays
Release the stress from my chest as I meditate
And pray to God, to try to help my find a better way
Stop! Everybody, what's that sound?
Gun-gun blasts as the shells hit the ground
Look what's going 'round
Livin in the ending in this, as we speak, it's ooover
It's the revealin of the Revelation
And of the Great Tribulation, so it's hate from the nation
Cause, Babylon will fall down
You better believe it's goin down
It's all in-It's all in time
Can't get no satisfaction
Temptation bring me mad distraction
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We're comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction

[Verse 3]
I'm lookin at the man in the mirror
And everything's clearer
Now I can see the bigger picture
One I envision through the scriptures
I don't wanna fall in your hinder
See that's the Second Death, you're never coming back
Once you wander in the tracks of the devil
You need to be keepin your eyes on your prize
Stayin better, tryina make it through these trying times
The level, stayin in line, and even if we die
Don't sweat it, just help your blessings and the Resurrection
The world's passing, along with assabets
And all this madness, soon will all vanish
Over (Over)
It's almost over (Over-over-over)
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog
No more Magog-gog-gog-Magog-gog-gog-gog

[Hook]
At last, we are in time
We comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
At last, we are in time
We comin for the days of our last bread and wine (It's all in-It's all in time)
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction
It's the end of the world
And still, people ain't got no satisfaction</pre>
