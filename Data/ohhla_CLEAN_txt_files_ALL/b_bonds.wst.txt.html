It's what ya all been waitin fo', ain't it?
What people pay paper fo', damnit
They can't stand it, they want somethin new
So let's get reacquainted, became the hood favorite
I can't even explain it, I surprise myself too
Life of a don, lights keep glowin
Comin in the club with that fresh shit on
With somethin crazy on my arm, uh-uh-uh
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
 
We outta here baby {*repeat 3X*}
DUDE!
 
Fresh off the plane, konichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane my passport on pimpin
Ask for it I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it then he lived it, spit it, then he shit it
I don't need write-ers, I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I been a very good sport, haven't I this year?
They say "He goin crazy, and we seen this befo'"
But I'm doin pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doin pretty hood in my pink Polo
Nigga please, how you gon' say I ain't no low head
Cause my Dior got me mo' my dough head
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your fo'head
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's, you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's, you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you could get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a don, lights keep glowin
Comin in the club with that fresh shit on
With somethin crazy on my arm, uh-uh-uh
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
 
[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, we outta here baby
Well, well, we outta here baby
Ay Mr. West we so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy baby
 
Yeah, I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my ice so white like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I'm so fuckin +Good+ like I'm sleepin with Meagan
I'm all about my Franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall "hayve" them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you'll be sleepin with daisies
I'm such a "hayvoc"  oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the Easter rabbit
And I'm still +Cole+ like Keyshia's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cause I'm so at it
And I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice, and I don't lack shit
And you can get Barry to suck my bat bitch

Swag got a hundred comin baby
Yeah, life of a don, lights keep glowin
Comin in the club with that fresh shit on
With somethin crazy on my arm, uh-uh-uh
