When we come pass the grass and land in dirty water 

[Intro: Cappadonna (Jammie Sommers)

Yeah, uh, yeah, Hah! 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Yo 

[Cappadonna] 
These thoughts of fire, hot like sex 
Never fall off in the projects 
Original Don, rockin the world 
Catch in the palm, hold on to me 
Real rap shit, over here 
The Wu clap shit, fuck an MC 
It's all about me, raise the flag when I drop my G 
Mad love, give it to DC, all for the money, burn a sensee 
Chill with the hoes, and get lovely 
OTF, cases of bubbily 
Shake ya ass, don't trouble me 
We keep it real, Homocide Hill 
Off the meat rack, coke in the bill 
Gun talk, a ruffneck city 
Shake ya ass, show no pity 
Get the cash, fuck that kitty 
After that, it's time to get dough 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Gimme a track, I lace the flow 
I go to places y'all can't go 
Overseas, me doin the show 
Playa hate me but we got the Mo' 
Test me, that's a big no-no 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Uh! 

[Chorus 2X: Jammie Sommers] 
Fuck y'all niggas if y'all don't know 
If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go 
Wu-Tang, forever gettin dough 
All In Together, like at the show 

[Cappadonna] 
Love is still love, come on girl 
Give me a chance, I'll rock the world 
Shake ya ass, get on down (If y'all ain't wit us) 
We stay trippin, my part of town 
Sex on the beach, came with the piece 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
It's all good, you just like the beast 
Take ya time, ain't nothin wrong with the bump and grind 
Blunt in ya hand, dust on ya mind (If y'all ain't wit us) 
Enjoy ya cash, we all wanna shine 
Nine to five, not the part time 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Shake ya ass, baby don't quit 
Tight dress, yea you the shit 
Nice hair-do, heavy on the wrist 
Buck-head bounce just the twist 
Everybody do it, just like this 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
VA style, somethin you can't miss 
Wu-Tang, poppin the Cris' 
Down in B-More, ya name on the list 
Free for all, it ain't no pay 
Love for love, let's break day 
Everybody chill, it's time to play 
Shake that ass, shake it away 
Shake ya ass, I'll show you the way 
Uh! 

[Chorus 3X] 

[Cappadonna] 
Peace in the club, havin the fun 
Fuck all the hoes, not just one (Y'all got to go) 
Here with the dogs, we all want some 
Later for that, keep chasin the cat (Y'all got to go) 
Shake ya ass, bump in the back 
Live as a fam, don't smoke crack 
Summertime, don't know how to act (Y'all got to go) 
G-string, all up in ya rump (Never that!) 
Football style, brothers'll pump 
Pop that coochie, get in the front 
Ride that shit, do a little stunt 
Fuck these cats, is scared of the cunt 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Shave her ass, do it for a month 
FUBU city, nigga don't front 
Sweat to ya death, spark that blunt 
Whatever you do, never make war 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Wu-Tang niggas'll break that jaw 
Stay on the dancefloor, keep it real 
Shake it, break it, love the feel 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Sounds so good, it's sex appeal 
Cappachino put sex on the reel 
Shake it baby, you know the deal Uh! 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 

[Outro: Cappadonna (Jammie Sommers)] 
Yeah, uh! Yeah! You know the deal girl 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Uh! Give it to a nigga, uh! 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Do it, uh! Come on girl 
You to nigga, uh! 
(Wu-Tang, if y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Uh-huh, yeah! 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Chk-chk.. 
(If y'all ain't wit us y'all got to go) 
Uh.. {*laughs*} 

[Skit Outro: Cappadonna] 
This is only my sophmore project, man 
But I still feel like a freshman 
You know, so I got anger 
I'm comin in, I'm comin in like one of the new jacks 
Just comin in Elmira, wit the D-suit on and whatever 
All wrinkled up, niggas throwin piss down 
From the eight galleries or whatever 
You know, but that's me right there 
So what, I'm just comin to represent </pre>
