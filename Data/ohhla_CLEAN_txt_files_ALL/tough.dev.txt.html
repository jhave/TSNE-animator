Like most motherfuckas I find it hard to commit
Cuz a bitch ain't shit
They smart and they slick
Get ya heart split
Dead in the middle
Fuck a break up
Another brother cuttin in ya cake, enough to make ya
Wanna find a nice spot in the field
But from there you go to hell or jail
Or both
So you just say fuck em
Pull out your nuts and tell all them hoes to suck em
Cuz one bad peach will spoil the whole bunch
She tried to take you to the cleaners cuz you took her to lunch
Treat a woman with love and respect
All a bitch get is a dick shoved in her neck
It's a give and take
You live to make
Decisions together
And be in it for whatever
But some heifers don't even know that
They treat you like gonads
They'll never be ya hoe that

If you want me to love ya
Cuz it's gonna be tough love
If you want me to love ya
It's gonna be tough love
Tough love
If you ain't had enough then I
Tough love
If you want me to love you
It's gonna be tough love
If you want me to love you
It's gonna be tough love

Tough love, I know no other
When our business is just that, it shouldn't go no further
Things come to pass but nothing go in between
It's just us, so why let your friends know everything
And if we got a problem we have to solve it
Don't need another muthafucka to get involved with
Our shit, sniffin our dirty draws
Together we objective we correct certain flaws
I'm hurtin walls and jaws with this dick of mine
You get with any nigga with a smooth pick up line
Will only make matters worse
And have us fightin with words and sayin stuff that'll hurt
It won't help, but only keep us farther apart
Puttin out a flame that no other can start
Love is like a maze and you might get stuck
We can go through it or we can just fuck

Cuz if I'm gonna love ya
It's gonna be tough love
If I'm gonna love you
It's gonna be tough love
Tough love
Tough love
If I'm gonna love you
It's gonna be tough love
If I'm gonna love you
It's gonna be tough love

{*men talking*}

If I'm gonna love ya
It's gonna be tough love
If I'm gonna love you
It's gonna be tough love</pre>
