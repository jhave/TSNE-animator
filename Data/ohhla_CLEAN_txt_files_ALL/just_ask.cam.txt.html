You know it G
First of all let's make it clear, I'm a strong young man
Takin no shorts ya see, yeah
So if you plan on makin waves, it's just a waste of time
You should face reality, yeah (check this out)
I don't want you to think that I'm, afraid or shy (uh-uh)
Naive I will never be (you know it G)
I just want a friend so I can hold her hand
Come on baby, and get with meeeee, yeah

(Just ask me to) Just ask me to
(I'll be with you) I'll be with you
(And ohhhhhhhhhh, so much as your friend)
(If you walk with me) If you walk with me
(I'll walk with you) I'll walk with you
(And ohhhhhhhhhh, so much as your friend)

(Forget, those people talking trash)
(Just jet up and just leave)
(Girl it's not too late) It's not too late it's not too late

(Baby, take Tevin by the hand)
(I'm sure you'll understand) I'm sure you'll understand
(Lady this is fate) Ohhhhh, ohhhhhhhh

(Dooooooooooooooooooooon't, be afraid) T.C. one time now

I'm not here to goof around (so zero that thought, hehe)
You should understand that G (aww yeah baby)
You can make all the times the way that you want
but I won't let you play yourself, no not for me, yeah

(Doooooooooooooooooooooon't) Don't (be afraid) be afraid
(We've got, it made, we do) We've got it made we are
(It feeeeeeeeeeels, so good) So goood
(That you know, we have, nowhere, to go)

Check it out
Yo check check, Atomic Tevin, I know you really feel like
you're in heaven your grill's a 7 and your bio reads 11
(What you mean G?) If you really wanna see, don't pretend
to be all cute, she knows you got loot
Not Al B. can convince me that you're naive
The squabs will perceive..
.. your position, rationalize who you are
Tevin Campbell get souped, you're a star
She said, "Can you tell me where we're going to?"
To my crib for a few
Don't get sexual, sexual means have
If she's on that program, that's what
your staff is for, she mighta been around the world
and I I I I (what?)
You might find your baby, and if not
you can come to my crib, I'm Chubb Rock, peace
(Peace)

(And ohhhhhhhhhh, so much as your friend)
