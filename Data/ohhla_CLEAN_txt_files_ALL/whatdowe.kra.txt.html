Song:   What Do We Want?
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The birds outside my window
Want to drive this stupid song into my head
I wake up in this empty bed alone
I guess it's somethin' that I said
I tried to open up a door between us
But I guess it was a wall instead
And I try and I try
And it tears me all up inside

Tell me your dreams
What do they mean?
And what do we want from each other?
Where do we go?
Nobody knows
And what do we want from each other?

Seven forty five
I got a flight
But you're still mad about last night
Tear apart Pandora's box
I try to open every lock in sight
And I try and I try
And it tears me all up inside

Tell me your dreams
What do they mean?
And what do we want from each other?
Where do we go?
Nobody knows
And what do we want from each other?

Another Sunday mornin' comin' down
But I'm tryin' to see the bright side
Another cold and unforgiving dawn
I wish I was on your right side (right side)
I wish that you could understand
That words can fail the best intentions, ma'am
And I try and I try
And it tears me all up inside

Tell me your dreams
What do they mean?
And what do we want from each other?
Where do we go?
Nobody knows
And what do we want from each other?

Tell me your dreams
What do they mean?
And what do we want from each other?
Where do we go?
Nobody knows
And what do we want from each other?

And them birds outside my window
Wanna drive this stupid song into my head</pre>
