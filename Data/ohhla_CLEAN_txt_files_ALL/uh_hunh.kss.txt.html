Errrr, here we go again
Uh, un-hunh
Uh, un-hunh
Uh, un-hunh
[DMX]  Yeah, yo Kiss
[Jada] What up dog?
[DMX]  These niggaz running around here like they controling this shit
[Jada] No doubt
[DMX]  Let's show these niggaz how to take hold of this shit
[Jada] That's what I'm talkin about baby
[DMX]  For real baby
[Jada] Let's get it on

[DMX]
I only gave you the crown so I could shoot it off your fuckin head
Yall niggaz fuckin dead, you heard what the fuck I said
I talk shit cause I walk shit, start shit, New York shit
The hawk shit, spark shit, the dark shit
And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
niggaz is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit
Why the fuck you fucking with X? You must be fucking with X
Go catch a chicken, fucking with me you gon' catch a whippen

[Chorus: Jadakiss &amp; DMX]
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again
Un-hunh, here we go again

[Jadakiss]
Look don't try to apologize on your two way
Sympathy don't amuse me, go get your uzi
And let's make a real movie
Play bad guy and good guy til the hood die
Toast yall cowards
Now I know the reason why Pac ain't really like most yall cowards
Im'a show you how to swing the chrome for real
Dog this year we gon' bring it home for real
What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you
I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall
Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl
Put it all up her stomach til she earl
Yall niggaz ain't nice ya lucky
So fuck it Im'a sell dope long as the price is lovely
And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death
DMX and Jadakiss nigga guard ya chest

[Chorus]

[DMX]
When is they getting off our dicks, them niggaz is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down
Like 'face said, last of a dying breed
For stomach and I feed still trying to eat
Lead by greed that's when you fuck up
Yall niggaz gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up
(What what?) What's up?  Fuck a nigga yelling
Y-O motherfucker for real, yo 'Kiss tell 'em

[Jadakiss]
Shoot to kill, stomp niggaz out boot to grill
I'll give you a reason why I'm "The Truth" for real
niggaz can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggaz and since you so richeous
Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker
niggaz gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
