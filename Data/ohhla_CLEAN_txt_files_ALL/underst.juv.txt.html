Ain't bout to let nobody fuck over me (ya understand)
I don't need ya playa hatin' on Juvey (ya understand)
Don't be talkin' about what you gon' do with me (ya understand)
I'll ride everyday of the week (ya understand)
Ya get ya issue when ya playin' with me (ya understand)
I'll crawl at the spot that ya sleep (ya understand)
Get with my niggas from the block and we creep (ya understand)
Load it up cock it back and get ready (ya understand)

We gon' go in there and blow the bitch up (ya understand)
Soon as we get 'em we gon' all get the fuck (ya understand)

Chorus: Juvenile (repeat 2X)

Shhhh, be quiet
Tonight is the night that we ride
30 camoflauge Hummers with niggaz inside
with choppers, doin - surgery on bodies like they doctors

Juvenile:
I know when to get my ass outta Dodge (ya understand)
Look them people ridin' I'm gonna hide (ya understand)
I'm a wait until them bitches slow down (ya understand)
Cuz I ain't tryin' to be jail bound (ya understand)
It ain't over till the fat man fall (ya understand)
I'm just waitin' on the right phone call (ya understand)
You know them hoes gon' let me know where they at (ya understand)
Nigga got me I'ma go get em back (ya understand)
One by one they all gonna drop (ya understand)
Right here is where the foolishness stop (ya understand)
I'm tryin' to get the bullshit over (ya understand)
Cuz  I wanna go and chill in the 'Nolia (ya understand)
We need to get some more ammunition (ya understand)
Cuz somebody's bout to come up missin' (ya understand)
Now everybody hop in the truck (ya understand)
And when ya see one of them bitches ya bust (ya understand)

Chorus

Juvenile:
Fuck jumpin' out I'm a slang me some iron(ya understand)
When I catch them niggas all of 'em dyin' (ya understand)
Nigga listen up to what we gon' do (ya understand)
I'm about to give the game to you (ya understand)
That's the reason why I came to you (ya understand)
Cuz playin' ain't the thang to do (ya understand)
It ain't that hard I did it before (ya understand)
U just gon' make sure let nobody know (ya understand)
I'll bet ya them boys wanna rep (ya understand)
They tryin' to get the shit off they chest (ya understand)
It ain't over lil daddy be cool (ya understand)
Nigga tired of the nigga we through (ya understand)
You know you better stay pretty cool (ya understand)

Hop out the car and let that iron ring ya understand)
