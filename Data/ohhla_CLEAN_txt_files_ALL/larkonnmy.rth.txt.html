[Verse 1]
Sitting on a truffet, puffing on the best cut buds
Trying to get butt from Miss Muffet
Me and Teddy Ruxpin sturring up a ruckus
Egging all the houses, smashing all the pumpkins
Suck a dick butkus, chumps can't funk with the punk kids
Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins
Any Tim Duncan, spur of the moment
Let the whole world know I run shit, jump ship quick
Tell a friend that I'm dumb sick 
Spit fungus that'll grow from a dumb trip
Twist to a front flip, son that was some trick
Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this

[Verse 2]
Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty
Pass me a blunt and some Captain
Chillin with an Ashley, heading to the mall
Sitting in the backseat, getting jerked off
Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador
Door-matted whore with your words, heard that before
For metaphor, pedicure, get your feet fixed
Walk in my shoes for a few, you gonna need it
Yeah, get your Wii Fit to practice your freeze with
Need a few weeks before you can compete with
Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp
You can take Kapowski, I'ma take Lark On My Go-Kart

[Verse 3]
Ugh, yeah
Mario Kart skills are outrageous
Play me anyday and I'll be the best racist
Wait, no, erase it, meant to say racer
Traded in my cell phone for a new pager
Take off your bluetooth, now dot com
I'm at the grocery store with hot moms
Bout thirty five with at least two kids
We can make out while my friend baby sits
All up in your fridge eating left-over shit
Tuna sandwich, butterscotch, crimpets
Cheetos be my choice of chips
I enjoy for a bit, take a sip from my Simpson and split

[Verse 4]
Roll that J up, is it rolled?
Yeah, roll it up, ugh
Hair like a troll doll, basketball shorts on
Yeah, I'm a dork but I'm still holding court
Ball up, baller, yeah I'll take too long, get dolled up
Give a fuck if I look like I just woke up
Who am I trying to impress? Honey in the sun dress
With the breasts luscious just sent me a text
O-M-G, your the B-E-S
If your trying to have sex, I'm the best at it</pre>
