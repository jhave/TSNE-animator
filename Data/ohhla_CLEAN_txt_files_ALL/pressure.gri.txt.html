[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been breathing out of an exhaust pipe
On the job site, with a fist full of brittle sand
Should have seen it coming
A mile away from the little hill in which I'm making a stand on
It makes a man of me (doesn't it?)
And if it never kills me then I get a pass
Wish I could've opened up the air around me
Just a little bit so I could take a gasp
Who the hell is watching?
Put a notch in my belt, keep it on the tracks
Shoulda woulda coulda never made a difference
When you're playing chicken with your only chance
But it made a man of me, right? Mad man
That gotta dance around and play his sounds
Wish I knew back then what I know now
Yeah, look at me now!

[Chorus]
Dodging forever
Spending a fortune to figure it out
I don't believe it
Never learned how
All of this pressure is driving me wild
Look at me now
[repeat]

[Verse 2]
I'm starting to feel like it's stacking on my shoulders
Another soldier with little patience to see the dawn
Fought a lot of odds, in the name of cause
Put em in a box buried in the lawn
But I learned a lesson from it, didn't I?
And if I didn't who the hell is gonna teach me?
I've been looking for answers
And none of em ever offered a lesson that'll reach me
Who can see me?
Losing personal relationships like people do they house keys
I've been outside, looking inside
With a shadow casted all around me
And they doubt me
Try to throw a little part of me away with every frown
Just wish they saw what I know now
Yeah, look at me now!

[Chorus]
Dodging forever
Spending a fortune to figure it out
I don't believe it
Never learned how
All of this pressure is driving me wild
Look at me now
