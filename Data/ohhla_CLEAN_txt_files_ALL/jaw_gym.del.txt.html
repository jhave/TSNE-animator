[Del The Funky Homosapien]
Check it out
Uhhh
Del's back, go get ya life preserver
Aquaman with the flow you might get murdered
You get caught in the slipstream
When I was fifteen
I was ripping
You were shoplifting
My accent on rap is smashin'
Emcees be past tense
Didn't make the draft pick
Come get ya ass kicked
You awful
And slothful
I'm grease lightning
Hit cha with shit that's uncalled-for
Leave ya jaw broke
Tryna simulate
Gimme a break
You rhyme purely functional
Merely fills the gap
I'm a rhymin' mercenary
I'ma kill the track
My brainstorm cause a cloud bust
Bring forth a rhyme like childbirth
Style search
Tearin' out the whereabouts of lyrics
Somethin' you don't care about
I eviscerate your mental state
Into strips of steak
I'ma situate barbituates to get you baked
Your feminine image is far from intimidating
Cause my style you're imitating
That's as sin as Satan
Your corny insubordinate rhymes are like a porno flick
Prepare to Edgar Allan and spread ya talent thick
You gotta problem with balancing
Ya equilibrium is givin' up
Ya symmetry is imagery
Your videos are pretty dope
Big budget
But my poetry you covet
Mega-destructive
You can't fuck with
I'm loony wit language
This artform is truly endangered
So I change it, never doing the same shit
I'll make a profit off of oxygen
Phenomenon wit no homonyms
Hit'em wit a sonic boom
Eradicate ya naniploom
Procure of insert a word wit hypodermic earnest
And leave ya burnin' like a furnace
Poetry protagonist
Leave you havin' strict
Advocate of whatever I'm imagining
That's what's happening
Party-goers call me Yoda
I use my force with fortitude
Just sure to groove
And support my crew
Hiero
Vital
Components in the lineage
Of Hip-Hop heritage
Where we go is limitless

(Chorus)

Let's follow along with the rhyme y'all
I bet some of y'all get lost and can't find y'all
Just on a mission to let you know that I'm raw
With the Jaw Gymnastics verbals for your minds y'all

[Casual]
I'm the difference between Hanna Barbara and Hanibal the Barbarian
The metal stiletto ghetto cesarean
Word carryin' clarion
My drum kicks got blood on a steel toe
Nasty like crud on a dildo
For real though
Bram bisque gets bust and break a baller for his billfold
Better beware boy before the shoddy make ya body prostrate
Huh
Before they dope make ya eyes dilate
My rhymes'll gyrate
Irate
Liquid spills covering nine states
Liftin' crime rates
Shiftin' earth plates
Casual amongst the ranks of greats
Bitch niggas get treated and took out like dates
They lightweights
Have dat ass beggin' for another day like Nate
Your hard
Boulevard facade'll get you scared
Get cha shit served preserved
Banned, canned and jarred
And labeled as a fable
Ya unstable
My methods on the mic make money under the table
Pay-Per-View, Digital-TV, or Cable
By cell phone, via satellite, or right at cha label
Hell, you can even send an email
I rip that ass in 500K detail
Use a seasheall
In an ocean of emotion
Periless notions of my delicate delivery devotion

[Del The Funky Homsapien &amp; Casual]
Minimal effort make are shit sound phat
Delvon
And Smash Boogie
We gets down like that
You know I grab the mic
And hit cha tit for tat
Delvon
And Smash Boogie
We gets down like that

(Chorus 2X)

[Casual]
