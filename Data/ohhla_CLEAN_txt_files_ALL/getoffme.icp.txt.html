Get Off Me, Dog!

"Yo, 2 Dope, man, check this out, man
You know what the word on the streets is, dawg
The word on the streets is that you a bitch
What's up with that, man?"

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Motherfuckers tweek, gotta tweek while ya tweek
Golley guy's rhythm, cuz me on mic, my on meek
Get off me, dog, before I sting your chin
I let my nutsac flap in the wind
Cuz I'm 2 Dope, clown loco G, 
And it's one chop, two boing, boom chop three
In the melon, in the back of the melon
One black, two black eyeballs swelling
Always back with stickin, taking back what's more to lordy
Sippin on the blunt, puffing on the 40
Or the O-Z, muthafuck me
Fuck Stuart Frankie, they call me 
Jelly jello boy cuz my nutsac jiggles
And when it's cold out, my nutsac shrivles
And crawls at my booty all warm and snug
And gets chased out by the booty ho bug
Goddamn, I ain't who I am
I'm always fucking fat bitches named Pam
Nineteen years of breathing smog
Has got me mental
So get off me, dog!...

[Chorus (14x)]
Get Off Me, Dog!
