Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
You filthy animal

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I can turn your girl into an eater
Pineapple Crush by the liter
O.T.F., follow the leader
Man I'm off the shit, smoking reefer
Go and tell them boys, follow the leader
A lot of nigga's really want to be us
Got the whole city wanting to be us
Go and tell them boys, follow the leader

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Nigga's mad, we up, turned your bitch to an eater
We Cole, no Keisha, east side, raise E's up
Pussy nigga's better ease up, that mac can have them screaming Jesus
Polo horses everyday, different Ralph I'm G'd up
Flash got me geeked up, ask Victoriouz, Stack or Starve
Bitch I'm off the meter, I get money, I go hard
O.T.F. free my niggas, Tell the judge fuck a charge
Religion nigga's act true, nigga's know they live a fraud
Glock crackin, I'm out here, Ain't no nigga safe out here
Nigga's say I'm a nightmare, all black like night gear
All that real shit start here, check a bag like nike air
Check a bag like nike air, that real shit it start here, L's

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Riding around with one-hundred's and fifties
They riding around saying we did it for the city
Riding around with my hammer cocked
Stacks On Deck, we on top
And me and Lil Durk won't stop
Riding around, screaming fuck the cops
Other finger screaming fuck the ops
S.O.D. we on these blocks
V.I.P. we go boss
V.I.P. with yellow models
S.O.D. and G.B.E. the motto
O.T.F., 300 the motto

[Chorus]

[Soulja Boy Talking]
Lets Get It!
That Money Nigga!
