(Hook, Akon)
When they tell you that you'll never get over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion

(Verse 1, T.I.)
See the web site's lyin
Tryin'a block my shine
Don't you know you never gonna stop my grind
In a drop top flyin like I don't got time
Got everybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo mind? Keep me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin
Gone with the nine, see I just keep walkin
Before I have you suin' sendin lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all, that's why I don't like that shawty
A couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag, and a brand new 40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation wide move, nigga, yeah you saw it
Shawty need a body gaurd for his body guard, don't he?
Tip fallin off, sound kinda hard don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball
Take it up with God, homie

(Hook, Akon)
I can see it in your eyes
It ain't hard to tell
They watchin you
They just tellin you lies
They want you to fail
They plottin on you
Soooooo
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
Just tell them you're number one
You're a champion</pre>
