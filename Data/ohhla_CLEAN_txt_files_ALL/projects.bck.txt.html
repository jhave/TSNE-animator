[Tony Yayo]
Yeah its murder nigga
Tony Yayo nigga
G Unit South
We in the 'Ville right now nigga
We 'gon do this shit like this man

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
Theres plenty ladies in the projects
Sugar babies in the projects
Some got love, some hate me in the projects
Its real in the projects
They steal in the projects
Me, i'm tryin' to make a mill in the projects
Swing soft in the projects
Sling hard in the projects
Cause ain't nobody got a job in the projects
And ain't nobody tryin' to starve in the projects
And ain't nobody tryin' to starve in the projects

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Nigga I am the projects
We move grams in the projects
We use scales in the projects
We get mail in the projects
Shoot Glocks in the projects
My pops died in the projects
The cops ride in the projects
Until we had to stop 'em
Homie come visit my projects
See how we live in these projects
Don't get killed in these projects
Cause niggaz
We put work in these projects
You might get hurt in these projects
I put on earth in these projects
Nigga you ain't from my projects ho

[Verse 3: Lil Murda]
We got Crips in the projects
we got Bloods in the projects
Shit everybody shiesty ain't no love in the projects
Got killas in the projects
Got thugs in the projects
And we all tryin' to eat you want to grub in the projects
Its alot of fake daps and mean mugs in the projects
Nigga better hold your own or catch a slug in the projects
Theres haters in the projects
But we major in the projects
How many niggaz you know that done made it out the projects?</pre>
