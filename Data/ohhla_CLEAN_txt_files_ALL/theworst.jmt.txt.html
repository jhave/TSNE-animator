[Verse One: Vinnie Paz]
Don't be scared- Be prepared for the worst
Before I let a round of shots burst
You the opening act so rock first
Trust me, multiple shots from Glocks hurt
And I think there's been enough said
'Cause your body's gonna leak like a mothafuckin dust-head
Burner love to see the blood red
And you pussy-clout rappers can't sleep until a thug's dead
But I don't plan to die
Until it's my time
Soldiers keep playa hatin from the sideline
It's divine rhyme
Jedi Mind time
It's rap cyanide
Study the guidelines
Yeah on my last few twelve inches
Walk around with a long knife-twelve inches
That's real sharp for cutting ya skin
Tie you up make you watch while I'm fuckin' ya kin

("Don't get scared, be prepared for the worst" *scratched 4X*)

[Verse Two]
Yeah
I have an iron force
Robbin' you on the iron horse
I'm a lion that's relyin' on the Mayan's thoughts
I'm spittin' iron darts
Until there's more dead
Then I'm seeing triple sixes on your forehead
I don't wanna die anymore
I don't wanna cry anymore
Lie anymore
I just want y'all to be dead
I just wanna get rid of all these sick thoughts in my head
I stay ready on the frontline ("Anybody wants mine, that's when it's lunchtime")
And I'm a threat to the whole land
Man fear God
But God fear no man
That's the mothafuckin program
I could feel snakes just from handshakes from a cold hand
Time waits for no man
And that's word bond
Throw 'em in a ditch
Bury 'em the herb gone

("Don't get scared, be prepared for the worst" *scratched 4X*)

[Verse Three: Vinnie Paz]
This is war rap similar to Jacob's ladder
Walk around like Thor with a sacred hammer
Yeah you don't really want the guns out
We some vampire mo'fuckas
Burn when the sun's out
Y'all are traveling the bum route
Talkin bout whips standin on the strip with your thumbs out
But that ain't me
I don't care about a whip
Y'all are fake money just another counterfeit
While y'all are on the block thinkin bout your pipe dreams
I'm Slick Rick style thinkin how my ice gleams
Thinkin how I'm gonna make this money
Take a visit to the Bing and embrace my dunny
I guess this is just God's plan
Beware of the beast undercover in the marked van
If you a smart man
Use your voice to sing
Cause that's the only fucking way to avoid the Bing!
