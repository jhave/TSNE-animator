And lookin so fine I love it when dem shake di behind
And dip and a wine I wonda if dem gal have spine
Hail di a Mr. Lover lyrical refined
Uh! I love it when yuh put yuh hand through yuh hair
And, I see you over there a dip and a stare
And, now ain't it time for you to be in my ear
And, stand up and shake that rear

[Chorus: Will.I.Am] (Fergie)
I said hey (Hey) you (You) standin over there by that wall

[Bridge: Fergie &amp; Shaggy] (Will.I.Am)
Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Shut up and dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Shut up and dance)

[Verse 2: Will.I.Am] (Shaggy)
And you hippity hop, my name is Will.I.Am put the pop in your lock
We could make a circle and your girl could watch
Push back nigga cause the crown I spot
And I'm doin my thang, shabba dooba dabba I ain't sayin a thang (Right)
You know we rockin it man, do it till the mornin and I do it again

[Chorus: Will.I.Am] (Fergie)
I said hey (Hey) you (You) standin over there by that wall
Get (Get) up (Up) do your thing on that floor
Don't (Don't) stop (Stop) party till the break of day
Are (are) you (You) ready, shut up and dance

[Bridge: Fergie &amp; Shaggy] (Will.I.Am)
Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Shut up and dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Dance) Let your feet just go, who needs to think when your feet just go
(Shut up and dance)
