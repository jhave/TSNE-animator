Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Been a long time
You were born one day you were gonna die
Oh...
When ya' clocked in, can't remember what you've forgotten
So...
Let me tell you how it is here
To exist here living on this sphere
Hey...
There was something called emotion
And sensation
And they feel this way
You can build and play
You can lie and scheme
And while your children say
Pretty much anything
Others will arise,
Colors will become cold
And they call this time
And it makes you old
It accelerates slowly, then faster
Then before you know
There is someone to look after
Share laughter
And of course you grow
Be aware you can hurt them
They can hurt you
It can make you scream
And understand you're a person
Give birth to new ways to dream

And it's not just you
We are all about
And we feel it too
And we're called a crowd
And we have the tools
So we sing aloud
And we stand up
And we all fall down

Ahh la da da la da da ba da
Ahh la da da la da da le la da da da da
Ahh la da da la da da - la ba da da da
Ahh la da da la da da ba da

The road is done
We had our fun
And so it ends much like it begun
With a gun shot brightness
Noise I'm frightened I'm fighting
Then the silence hits
I collect recollections
And echoed reflections of moments of loyalty
And defection and measure my essence
A servant or despot, storm or a tempest
Word or a sentence, was I heard or never mentioned
And did I hurt whenever men shunned me
Or another in an instance ruling by inches
A student of illness to see where the real went
Grown the strength to deal with the feeling of new skin
Just as the noose was loosened I let go and saw the two ends
Felt the weight lift of these heavy feet and realized I could have been anything

The road is done
We had our fun
And so it ends much like it begun
The road is done
We had our fun
And so it ends much like it begun
And it's not just you
We are all about
And we feel it too
And we're called a crowd
And we have the tools
So we sing aloud
And we stand up
And we all fall down

Fall-ah da da la da da ba da
Ahh la da da la da da le la da da da da
Ahh la da da la da da - ba da da da
Ahh la da da la da da - ba da
Ahh la da da la da da la da
Ahh la da da la da da la la la la
Ahh la da da la da da - ba da da da
Ahh la da da la da da ba da</pre>
