[Chorus]
I go to Jacob wit 25 thou, you go wit 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my wall right now
You got your first gold single damn nigga, wow

[Verse 1]
H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Yall niggaz want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin y'all from Chi-town, how your wife gon say
She never sold drugs a day in her life, but she still wanna pump the 'Ye
And y'all mad cuz y'all not knowin, cuz these canaries so yellow
When y'all pull up whether to stop or keep goin
I got G's, rock Rock n Roll tees wit no sleeves
Tats showin, tucked in strap showin
How he get seven tv's in that 'lac 'lac
3 in the front, 2 in the back, 2 in that back, back
While you in that hatchback
And tryin to sell work and don't get shit from them packs back
And try to rap, the studios wont give you ya daps back
And try to get publishin, all you get in your ass capped
And that's that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Magazines call me a rock star, bitches call me cock star
Billboard pop star, neighborhood block star
Chi-town go-getting pimps, we mob-stars
Gingerbread man even says "You're a monster"
Remember that, uh-huh, that's that trek shit
Remember back in '92 niggaz used to catch reck shit
Remember that track I tracked for you bout 3 months ago
Uh-huh that's the one, now cut my check bitch
And I ain't feelin that Lexus or that CLK
See me like damn "A C L K?"
Yeah that's how we eatin and, keep us looking peace and then
I ain't kno we rap as good as he do beats and then

[Chorus]

H to the Izzo did 3 thou spins in a week
You get a thou in a month, wow
Yall niggaz want credit but y'all need to slow down
Kanye to the killin y'all from Chi-town</pre>
