Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T

Am I a player? Shit, up early in the mornig
Tryin to stack me up some paper
That Platinum Soul got me throwed, can't you see
&gt;From these beats I be makin for your jeeps
And your slabs and your creeps
Who Am I? I'm Double D, I roll with P-A-T
You might know me from puttin it down with Lil Ke
I'm havin big thangs, big brains, ain't no plexin
&gt;From Arkansas to Texas, I'm rollin in my Lexus
Blowin on big kill, got hundred dollar bills in my briefcase
(Wreckshop)We all in they face
Because we third coast born, that means we Texas raised
My whole click gettin rich, yeah we gotta stay paid, yeah
So do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
I know it's plain to see, your gal jockin me
Cause maybe I'm a player and I'm real with the streets

Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T
Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T

Yeah, do you like what you see, mister mister in the play
Diamonds and gators up on my feet
Slidin through the club and it's all gravy
Snatchin your girl, burnin out in my Mercedes
On buttons, say nothin, gangsta struttin did it all
Watchin me when I hit the door and started to ball
All along I knew, what she wanted to do
She said she knew me from flowin on that screw
And when I came through her homegirl's house
And ever since then she wanted to know what I was about
And what mader scream and shout, and kept my name in they mouth
So I showed her what Sugar Daddy was all about
How I turned her out, it was so throwed
&gt;From the back to the couch, down to the floor
Let everybody know, that sugar daddy go
&gt;From north, east, south to the west, I'm knockin with this pole

(say what, say what)

Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T
Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T

Baby, let me jump in your brain
As I slide down Main with a fist full of grain
Green grain from the top from my ben low
Twenty inch Lorenzo, as I turn some mo, mo
I'm a glow like my wrist and my neck
Slide my rolex ten or set baguette
Pieces with marquises and creases up in my slacks
Done the private plane to the wide body 'lac
I'm a stack and act a mess 'cuzzi down the bed
9-8 Clarion laid in my head rest
I rise in my estate, caddy corner by the lake
With a glass fireplace, next door to Chevy Chase
Valet up in my gate is a brand new hummer
Forty inch anaconda and a school of piranas
And a bitch in my sauna, waitin on me
Let's look eye to eye and tell me what you see

Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T
Do you like what you see
Tell me what else you done heard about me
Is it strange to see, that I be's a G
So take it how you want it, take it from that P-A-T</pre>
