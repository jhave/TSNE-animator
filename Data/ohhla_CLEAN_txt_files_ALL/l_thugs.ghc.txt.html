[C-Murder talking]
All I can do is sympathize for the blind &amp; pray for the weak
Bossalinie &amp; the Ghetto Commission
Representin' every ghetto, inner city in the nation

Chorus [C-Murder]
Reminiscin' bout my lost thugs
(Some niggas die on the battlefield)
Reminiscin' bout my lost thugs
(Some soldiers die that's hard to kill)
Reminiscin' bout my lost thugs
(Damn I thought this nigga would never die)
Reminiscin' bout my lost thugs
(Genocide we're killin' up our own kind)

[C-Murder]
Some niggas wanna kill me
Some niggas they gonna hate me
They wanna see me fall why can't these niggas congradulate me
I'm just a rider
Tryna maintain in a world full of hatred
An greed &amp; betrayal
Watch yo enemies
Don't be deceived
by these imitations of smiles turned to frowns in the end
Then it's to late to retaliate on your foes
welcome to heavens doe's
Kevin Miller tatted on my arm cause all I'm left wit is a picture
Still can't believe they hit cha' nigga
An can't wait til' I'm wit cha'
In the murda cap. I sympatize with every lost soul in the ghetto
Of over crowded cemetaries
Damn this world is hella scary
An I'm trippin' on how Lance died
An my tears still ain't never dried
Makes me wanna commit suicide to get away from these tryin' times
So much pain got me sufferin', contemplatin' evil thoughts
An conversatin' with the devil cause my soul done been bought
An I'm caught between murda one &amp; distribution of drugs
Or death
But I'm reminiscin' bout my lost thugs with my last breath

Chorus

[G-Spade]
So much drama in my city so I'm countin' my blessin's
I thank the lord for every hour, every minute, every second
Now I know I done alotta wrong &amp; I know one day it would come back on me
But I shoulda known not to keep my lil' brotha so close to me
It was this nigga I jacked along time ago for a quarter ki
Shoulda been knocked his head off &amp; the situation wouldn't be
I let him slide
But he didn't let my brotha slide when he drove by
I lost half of myself when younger brotha died
You know what my reaction was
Go spill that mothafucka blood
Caught him slippin' in front the club
Then proceeded to fill his ass wit slugs
This is for my fallen soldier
My fuckin' brotha
Reminiscin' over you cause I'm gonna always love ya

Chorus

[Vallerio]
I'm reminiscin' on my lost thug hopin' you restin' up above
An if you hear me, feel me from me to you dawg it ain't nothin' but love
No explanation needed I know you didn't want to be here no mo'
It was like you were puttin' a pistol to your own head
How you was on that dope
You was bored with life I could tell by the stupid things you would do
Make the spot hot by killin' a nigga just to see the shit on the news
You was Lucifer suduced when you let loose as if killin' wasn't real
Pull the trigga then grin
Just so a nigga could see the shine on your grill
You was a could blooded killa but you was my ace
my dawg, my round
Ain't a nigga that could take your place
Me &amp; you have a bond that could never break
to my big brotha til' we meet in that restin' place
(I'm keepin' it real)
