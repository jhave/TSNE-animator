[D-Shot]
Hey now baby, how you be doin?
You been doin fine?
You know you called me last week
I got your message but I was outta state, yaknowhatI'msayin?
        (Now I comes through, just like the hog I am)
It seems you need a little bit of excitement in your life
        (All up in her bedroom, til Renee humming my tune)
I'm here for you, don't sweat it
        (She's got an attitude, I'm just her man)
How your man be treatin you?
        (She needs me to get her in the mood)
I know
        (I had to hit her, I'm never stairy I'll be yo huckleberry!)
See you can call me any hour, that's how we do it

I'm in and out, and partner you ain't knowin this
She loves you goodly but she's all on a player's tip
Cause you ain't givin, somethin that she really needs
And that's that good ass lovin, partner can't you see
She's bored no trust, she sits in the house all day
While you out there ballin, tryin to have it the kingpin way
She gets no time, your schedule way too deep
You leaves out the house everytime you get a beep
To all you ladies, sweet dark and lovely
See players like me, I likes to taste the Easter bunny
I likes to lick you down, give you self esteem
I'm the playboy you want, on your under team
Yo' huckleberry, mackin fast Shot-ty
One of them type of ballers on the same level as Gotti
So all you tenders, it's all to the good
So page me on the under and I'll creep through yo' hood

        *chorus*
If you need some lovin, lovin girl
I'll be yo' huckleberry, berry
And if you need someone to talk to girl, talk to girl
You can call me on the under, under

[E-40]
Lookin at my oyster perpetual Rolex, browsin through my Rolodex
Baby done left a verbal, want me to hit that girdle
Come through on a tuck, while he's in the shower
Get in on the ease with robbin him, after hour
Slumpin gen-a-talia, regulatin
Cheatin in next room, fun-a-catin
Demonstratin, new and improved moves
Legislatin, perkin drinkin booze
But when you plug it, baby see you soon
You say one day, we gon' jump the broom
It was seven years, and G is faithful for ya
But did she love ya, or was she used to ya
It ain't my fault you got too attached
But don't check me partner, check yo baitch
Wanna know my name, call me 40 Pop Cherry
I'll be yo huckleberry

        *chorus*

[D-Shot]
I'm on yo mind, twenty-four seven
When you at work, you calls me at eleven
And that's cool, cause my number won't be on yo' bill
Ohh baby girl all we wanna do is keep it real
No hesitation, we wanna play this game right
But if you feel me, we gots to have our game tight
So we can smob to the beach and pain n all
Rub you down to the canvasol
One hundred miles away, while your man think you at work
That boy Shot, is all up in these skirts
If there's a bluebird on my shoulder should I hit him
I turn him around, then from the back that's when I kill him
But hittin it from the back ain't always what I wanna do
I got ta do you hard, so you can tell your crew
That that boy Shot knows how to... tuck
He got you givin it up
And you ain't done that in years
That's right
And you ain't done that in years

        *chorus*

        Keep it on the under, on the under, no one has to know
        It's between me and you, take my pager number
        You can call me, call me, all times of the day...</pre>
