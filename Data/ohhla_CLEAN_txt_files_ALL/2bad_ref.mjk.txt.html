(Wyclef)
No Mercy
This is officially a Refugee Camp Remix
Home with it.

I'm right back where I wanna be
Told me that you're doin' wrong, (oh my, zippin' through)
Word out shockin' all alone (no)
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hand (yeah hey)

You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Ah, look who just walked in the place (refugee camp)
Dead and stuffy in the face (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Look who's standing if you please (yeah yeah yeah)
No, though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it


Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

(John Forte)
You say John Forte
Like the major holiday
I met with MJ on the ranch of seven fey
Flowin' to them g six, that's how you saw them remix
Blast off a cramp while I laugh at yo re-six
T double O B A to the D
You just double A
Small town battery
Buffet
You can't eat of them floor we bend
Word like the power lunch of the four seasons
Too bad.

What do you want from me
What do you want from me

Tired of you haunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face (refugee camp)
It's dead and stuffy in the p</pre>
