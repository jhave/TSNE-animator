[Chorus]
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we pimpin' all over the world

[Luda Talking]
Sing It Hoes
(Wooorld, The World, The World)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine
But I'ma start it at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh)

[Ludacris]
Hey girl how you doin'
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya
Can you gimme ya name
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (Heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you would'nt mind
If I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet
And many places to see (Heyy)
I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin'
When you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned
That you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty
Heads pausin' so fast (Heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
You hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D
I'm takin' you places you only see on T.V
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know
Can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the auto-bind
Swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Maki'n sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (Heyy)

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me their chest (Heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to masha tucks, I had
Sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (Heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
Til' I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Carribean every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago(ugh)
Oh yet and still
You would'nt believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at)
Ain't no need of even askin brah
The best women all reside in Africa
And that's real

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
Sing it Hoes

[$Money Mike$ Fading Out]
Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air
Now ladies look around with me, let's see if
We can weed some of these niggaz out
Cause it's no way that all these niggaz could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin'
In shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga "put your hands down"
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please "put your hands down"
Now look up at the pinky fingers that
Are still in the air, if you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands and lotion three quarters of his body
Please say "put your hands down"
If your spinnin' rims
Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what?
You guessed it. You are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
"Put your hands down"
Now look down, I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok
You see the nigga with the white socks
NOT PIMPIN!
Sorry unless you part of the "Beat It" entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on...</pre>
