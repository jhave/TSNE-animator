[Chorus]
Foxy lady, why you actin' shady?
I know you ain't trying to play me out
With them vibes, what's that all about?
Foxy lady, you drive me crazy
Why don't you just be straight up
And tell me what you want, so I can give it to ya

Since I broke with my girl, how I'm feelin' is wack
Convinced that every female living's either schemin' or slack
A meaningless pack of people good to pin on their back
Now every skeef on my roster's either Indian or black
From other races I ain't separate, they happen to be my preference
So any lady interested, write this down for your reference
The butterscotch complexion, curvaceous in the right sections
Authentic in her reflection is what's visual perfection
Straight up, a brother cried when he heard Aaliyah died, cuz bredren
I know for once there's truly an angel in heaven
But most girls are unleavened, see they looks don't match
The qualities that make me want more than to jook that snatch
Humour, intellect and honesty during our long chats
But I need a bar graph to map the vibes y'all brauds have
You feelin' me or not? You got a nigga in doubt
Lookin' for Coles notes about you, tryin' to figure you out

[Chorus]

What up love? Still lookin' ruff? Yo, thanks for the rubs
You gave me on the dancefloor, not to mention the hug
You gave me when we parted, I thought "I want more of that stuff"
I picked you up in a club, so what you think I'm thinkin' of?
I've heard it all before previous to tonight
Let me guess, you've never talked to a brother this height
Or somebody with dreadlocks or who's skin was this light
Or who had videos that everybody swears is hype
Anyways, I'm amazed I could hold you for days
There's no rush so say, by my third visit, we blaze!
You got a boyfriend? What you mean that I should have asked?
Based on what we've been doin', I figured it wasn't my task
Where you hidin' your flask? You must be drunk talkin' that nonsense
What up with skeefs and they half-assed conscience?
As if stoppin' now would make it better if he finds out
That I'm the reason that you always on the other line now

[Chorus]

C'mon girl, how much more you gon' pretend with lies?
I mean so what if practically all of your friends is guys
I should exercise my right to excavate through thighs
Besides what was all that talk about me and my sexy eyes?
What kinda dude would actually wanna remain platonic?
Same one who calls you now that you're single, ain't that ironic?
Yesterday you was on it, I had you down to your panties
And you said waiting to do it next time would put your mind at ease
How so? I 've seen you with your titties out yo
And you gon' lick me up and say you don't go down low?
If we friends, after the beep, when I say "I must now go"
What the hell you make that rude kissin' your teeth sound fo'?
Sexual innuendo in every single conversation
You done told me you're with it, so what's with the complications?
I'm tryin' to be calm and patient, there's a lot to resist
Wait for what? My dick don't get much harder than this!
