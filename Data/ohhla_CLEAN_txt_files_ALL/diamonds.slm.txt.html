[Chorus: sample from UGK]
Diamonds pressing up against the woodgrain wheel (Haa)
When you see a pimp shining bitch tell me how you feel (I got the)
Diamonds pressing up against the woodgrain wheel (Yeah)
When you see a pimp shining bitch tell me how you feel (I got the)
Diamonds pressing up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shining bitch tell me how you feel (That's right)
Diamonds pressing up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a pimp shining bitch tell me how you feel

[Slim Thug]
Now who other than Slim Thugga, still tippin on fo's
wrapped up in gator boe's closing them candy doe's
Drank poe'd music slow how I roll when I'm flossin'
Trunk cracked in the back I'm in my lack big bossin'
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
When you see a playa' shining bitch tell me how you feel
I'm tryin to chill cause pussy niggaz ain't real
Gon' make me drop 'em with the hands or pop 'em with the steel
I'm the dirty south boss them other suckas is clones
Misrepresenting Texas with them weak ass songs
Screens showin' trunk glowin' while I flip through the hood
Big diamonds, shining, blinding, while I'm grippin my wood
I got the..

[Chorus]

[Slim Thug]
I got the diamonds pressin' up against the woodgrain wheel
Butter top dropping on the candy Coupe Deville
Cup full of drank man we poppin' pint seals
The candy trunk bangin while I drop the fifth wheel
Riding so low I got my hand up on the steel
Them jackers tryin'a plot I bet the glock'll make 'em chill
I'm straight up outta Texas yeah the land of the trill
When you see a pimp shining bitch tell me how you feel
Had to bring back the foe's made them put away the choppers
Got the candy blue shining while I'm swangin on the boppers
Keep straight through stop signs fuck if the law stop us
Screamin' free Pimp C to the motherfucking coppers
I got the..

[Chorus]
