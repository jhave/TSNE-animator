[Bushwick Bill, DJ Ready Red, Juke Box]
Yo Bushwick, you know what I'm saying?
Word! yeah, that's it
If I was rocking that jam, boy that's it
We came correct, we came correct
Ghetto Boys came correct on here, you know what I'm saying?
Word! Red, that was done, that was done
Word! word! that was Jeff, right Johnny? 
Dig that (Yeah!) cause I'm about you know what I mean..
Yo Joe, no more problems man, it's over man
There's a problem though man
So what's the problem? - problem with this album man?
No! it's not with the album
Problem catching all the fly ladies
No! it wasn't that either
Going on tour man, what's up?
Is it because I'm too short to take shorts? - what's up?
No! man, it's not no problem man
The problem was we lost some homeboys, you know what I'm saying?
Whose been making these records here
Oh! yeah, but that's been taking care of man
Word in life, man
Still one on, still one on
There ain't no problem no more Red, what's up?
I said another problem though!
What? what? what is the other problem? 
Come on man! - what's the problem man?
I'm.. I'm too short for a long conversations
I'm tell y'all the problem, man
So what's the problem? - why you're holding back?
Alright! alright! alright!

There ain't going be getting with them girlies
There ain't going be doing whatever
We're going to be doing what making this record, you know what I'm saying?
That's all been said and done so come with it man, no future in fronting..
Y'all want to know what's the problem going to be? (Yeah!)
What's the problem?

[DJ Red Alert adds Dialogue excerpted from the 1983 'Scarface' Movie]
But what to do with all the fucking cash?! 
But what to do with all the fucking cash?! 
The fucking cash! - The fucking cash! 
The fucking cash! - The fucking cash! 
But what to do with all the fucking cash?!
