[B.G.]
You know me can't get caught without my chopper
Lil' weak wit 50 I'm itchin' to see I got cha
B.G. labeled as a bust back nigga
Can't let yo chrome put holes in me, fuck that nigga
If you don't hit me up and I get another chance nigga
That's dat ass nigga, and you could trust that nigga
I put it on my first bomb like 50 states
I got 50 rounds to split yo motherfucking grape
I hope you don't think you could get away
because I ain't gon let you get away
and you can ride deez

[Lil' Wayne]
Load it up pull it back then aim
Bust and release 50 flame in hang
Bullets slang like crack cocaine
50 niggas always riding wit Lil Wayne
My rees string up bo's fall halfway
I'm jumpin out a tree with a camoflouge AK 
I spots my target and let'em go in the wind
Bullets fly by cha cha blow in the wind
One afta' another and another
How they come slippin out the clips 
see 'em flip and hm hum

[B.G.]
You see how Hot Boys play it now
When we coming for yo issue wodie lay it down
cause if you don't you done piss me clean off
Ya history dog believe 50 shots gone set it off
Me, Wayne, Juve, and Turk coming show you through
Four niggas with 50 shots that's 200 at you

[Wayne]
They burn ah ah on da real
They damage fa' flip and turn ah 
Face be on a bandana fa'
Niggas scattered like sand
Cause I got sluggs up in my hand
50 marching like a band
Niggas crumble like cans ah ah hold yo horses 
I gotta K with 50 choices ah ah chose one
I set it off to bruise one

(Chorus) Set it off 50 shots gonna set it off (10x)

[Turk]
Killing you niggas ain't no thang
I'm quick to let dat chopper rang
Beef keep frozen but when it melts
I do my thang 50 shots to set it off
Real quick bitch niggas get left 
where they can't be found fuckin with me 
I got some niggas on my side that will ride or die with me
Craig, Ron, Randy a ride or die with me
They will bust a head with me from the scene they fled with me
My fucking rounds when I drawn down they gon draw down with me
I acts wild when I come through no time to watch out 
50 shots with no doubt, blood gon' rush out
Niggas could run up and get done up if they want
Think I'm gon' hestiate nigga I won't
I tear it down yo whole block
With the chopper chop down your whole spot
You thinkin I'm fake nigga you better not
50 shots to set it off, you get flopped off the top

(Chorus repeat)

[Juvenile]
Welcome to Magnolia norm soldier with bombs
Mama knew I would blow up cause calm for so long
For the present that be the evil, that got me bust'n at people
Fuck if this shit's illegal, I gotta fix up my regal
For the shit that apply me, send apologies but I got 50 niggas
Loyal to die for me, look what the devil done to me
Runnig the beef under the streets
Na we each gotta knock of da leash
A bunch of empty shells
Walking no talking plot'n for power
Going riding in sour foe herion, rocks, powder
Tommorrow not promised
I got so much niggas behind us hungry peronas
with intensions of bein' tymers
Fuck sitting around for the revolution to jump off
Look I'm bout my issues 50 shots gon' set it off

(Chorus til end)</pre>
