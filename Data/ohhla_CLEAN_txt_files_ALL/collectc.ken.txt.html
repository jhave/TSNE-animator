[Intro: Kent Jamz]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this motherfuckin block off
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Never get through when I go through withdrawals
Say who told you that I wanted this door
to slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
ask you if you can give me your rent for
a attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah every rack is yours
Commissary runnin low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K-Dot wrote me sayin Marcus got killed
If you know me then you know how bad I feel
Keisha prove me wrong and never came to visit
And I heard she fuckin on some other nigga
And my niggaz left me in the dark, blind
Momma just get back at me this last time

[Chorus: Kent Jamz]
Men lie, w-women lie
Men lie, w-women...
Men lie, w-women lie
Men lie, w-women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this motherfuckin block off
What's on the date one day I take the block off
Pulled up and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talkin to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run?
I was racin, chasin dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation sayin that the same report
from a witness just might testify in court
D.A. say I take a deal or take a loss
I ain't built for all them God damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me momma
If you can't then open up the phone lines
Momma just get back at me this last time

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I can only help but do so much
Betterin yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No it's not neglection, I have just accepted
your fate and what it's gon' be
'Member all the nights that I cried
thinking that my only son just died?
Peeking through the window, kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

[Chorus]
