Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Money coming soon, nigga..
I'm on the come up, chill nigga, don't run up
A yellow nigga finna rise and shine like the sun up, (yea)
My mind on that paper, I ain't tryna wife a slut up
I'm dying for this cake and I ain't tryna wipe a crumb up
They ride with the gun up, kill you and light the blunt up, (uh)
Don't shed a tear, for a nigga might get done up
But just say a prayer for a nigga might confront us
Cause his life is summed up, the medics wipe his lungs up
You coming to the ville, you gotta get a license from us
City on my back, I feel like I'm holding Big Pun up
No pain, no gain, my nigga, I just numb up
I blow brains, go bang a nigga if he jump up
With no shame, don't blame a nigga if you shot up
This is cocaine on flames, baking soda and water
And if you feel that, then I guess I sell crack, get it?
Fall back, man, a nigga feeling crazy
Shitting on niggaz, like a nigga was still a baby, (uh)
Carolina nigga, shout out to the ville, it raised me
So many hoes whipped, you woulda thought we still in slavery
And niggaz still sleeping, they feeling lazy, (uh)
A killa? maybe, you make me, I will (uh)
Cheat me on my scrilla, I'll send you to meet Dilla, (uh)
From them NC streets where beef they deliver
And the clip is on 'E' cause your chest got a filla
A nigga like me just getting head like a pillow
Bred like guerillas getting bread
So long as my momma and my niggaz getting fed
Fuck what a niggaz said, (man) I'm Fayettenam bombing
Cause hatred is flattery, you bitch niggaz is charming
Who the fuck you harming? Boy y'all niggaz is Charmin, (uh)
And I'm on it, waiting for a target
You fucking with the best, like Common
Ah shit, pardon a nigga for departin'
I'm just getting green like a yard or a garden
A nigga finna blow, while you niggaz is false alarmin.' (uh)
And just think though, I was raised on Ramen, (uh)
Chicken noodle soup, now I'm filet mignon.'
I promise my momma I was coming to make this money
And I swear I'm a kill the nigga that try to take it from me
Yeah

That's real talk, nigga!
It's J.Cole, nigga, Therapist
Whatever fuck you wanna call me, don't matter
Make y'all niggaz understand, man
Yea!
Know y'all can't believe yourself right now
Yo this nigga from the south, naw
He can't spit, how the fuck is he so good?
Hahaha
Open your eyes, motherfucker
Can't see?
Niggaz on top! yup!
On top, yup, yup
On top!</pre>
