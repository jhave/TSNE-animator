[Verse 1]
You're trapped on the dance floor
It's locked there's no escape
There's no eat no drink cant take a break
No seat to sit down you gotta stand up
The record on the wheel reacts like a handcuff
Your in a cage and this groove will bound you
People in the club like bars around you
The doors open up and the people are boarding
Here are the prisoners the DJ is the warden
Your mind is useless instinct takes control
Jam to techno
Groove to soul to soul
You been arrested
Now your being tested
The beat is a sex fiend, you're being molested
Stead drum kicks like pistol in spinal
You gotta dance and get round like a Rhino
The DJ cuts with a knife like a surgery
Sayin that the slice aint nice that's perjury
The music infiltrates you mutates you
Grabs you holds you moulds you and let you
Do things you wouldn't a otherwise done
Like shake rattle roll pump twist and then some
Ain't no law here you can't protest this
Stop looking around it ain't no oasis
You can't leave till the man pulls the needle
Take that as a warning
Take heed or I'll quicken the pitch and make you dance faster
The drum is the whip, bass line is the master
The temperature's a 100 and yet you still want more
You're a slave and your trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus]
Oh oh I'm trapped like a ???
I can't get out
Can't you see I'm trapped
Can't you see I'm so confused
I can't get out

[Verse 2]
Now your wondering lost in a jungle
You came in hyped up but now your humble
Bringing out sweat in your silky wet clothes
You scream for help, blend in with the ??? and hoes
You try to sit but their ain't know spaces
The floor is a desert, a party oasis
I know your on the tip for the rhyme I just did
And here's a little taste of my homeboy, El Sid
Ay a prince it's the El Sid's version
I'm a raid on the track, I'm a hip-hop surgeon
The floor is jam packed get away from the bar scene
The strum of the drum has you trapped like a sardine
You try to move no form of escape
The heat brings on sweat, stick on like tape
Party's like a ???
Girls slim and trim on the floor
Don't try to shoot for the door
This ain't the gym
The party goers every night had a scene
This mic try to respond but still trapped like in Venus
Aint a spiff or a spoof
Boy you better not goof
You about to cave in although you ain't on a roof
The rhythm track from offside's to angles
Playing the wimp fight resist ... strangle
You can't escape until the DJ's fingers up
So play like a phone or coat and just hang it up
The speakers pumping out sounds and hip words
Lines between the rhythm designed to equip nerds
You better jam we don't care if you hardcore
Cause we got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3]
Me and prince got together just to kick our lines
No trouble at the party cause we're strapped with nines
Dance floor secure, don't bother tryin to get out
You looking for the late AM this man pull red out
Nobody cause killing is mean
Got ya dancin' in the dark and dressed like Springsteen
Razzamatazz a pasazz about to rip the flesh is my man Jazz Fresh
Soon as I worked through the door
I got trapped on the dance floor
See this girlie that I never saw
She was looking raw
Came a little closer
Then I opposed her
Then I drop the fox trot so hot that I roast her
??? planes in the damn chain
hard to explain
I did it up like I was straight outta Soul Train
Listen as I discuss this yo bust this
Like a hammer before me you cant touch this
Trapped on the floor like a vulture
Part of my culture
You may even thought I was drived to faulter
Get live like a ???jack that fives you the window main???
Add a little mic and janet you cant understand it
Cause ??? thought I was from another planet
Way of whipping and dipping
And sliding ??? of what I'm providin
Other dancers go and hide
Like Charles ???
I'm prancin
I keep the dance all night until
The party's over the party's over
Like a cowboy at a rodeo
From mister mister dosie doe
Around the dance floor
Steppin the new hardcore
I'm Jazz Fresh and I'm trapped

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Max up to step up
just to keep this rap up
the time that he possesses the best in a contest
Jeff with his right and left like Jazz Fresh
No other than the brother the lover Jazzy Jeff
I'm the one dance floor at the station
??? time around quarter to ten
times work hard
the customers scarred
your tickets to freedom
yo you ain't gonna need em
your sentence is 25 years to life
a ??? is your husband and wife
trapped behind the steel
the steel of the wheels
don't come to the party if you don't wanna know how business feels
I walk strong carry a big stick
Sell myself all packed and thick
When they sound the drum you know its time to roll
Might as well have fun there's no parol
I set a trap and caught you like a mouse
For times ahead no chance for a halfway house
Pump the bass in all sections
Prince, sid, and jazz my officers of correction
Cant' escape the floor cut the crime out
??? wall ain't no use tryin to climb out
cause I'm running this show and it's live in here
you try to escape another five years
I got you trapped and I'm your savior
You dance real hard you might get out on good behavior
But if you don't I give you more
'Cause DJ Jazzy Jeff got you trapped on the dance floor

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
