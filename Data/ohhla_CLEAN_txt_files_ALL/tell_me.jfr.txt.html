Song:   Tell Me Why
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Mary J. Blige]
Whyyyyyy, whyyyyyy
Whyyyyyy, whyyyyyy

[Chorus: Will Smith - while Mary repeats in background]
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

[Verse One: Will Smith]
September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin my time awakin, turnin my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said "Daddy now we killin 'em back," right right

[Chorus] - repeat 2X + (Mary J. Blige ad lib crooning)

[Interlude: Mary J. Blige]
Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)
Evil plaguin he rewardin
Hate surrender (hate surrender)
Love exaulted! (Love exaulted!)
HOPE ELATED! (HOPE ELATED!)
Negativity DESTROYED AND..

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin the last word
and why, did her uncles have to molest her
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the {*BLEEP*} can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

[Chorus] - repeat 2X as before

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy
But for me I try to see the button side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin to hide
or tryin to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God
