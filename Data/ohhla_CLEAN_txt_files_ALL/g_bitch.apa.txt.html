[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I want a (gangsta bitch) I need a (gangsta bitch)
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse One]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Goin to the movies packin his and her nine's
Wearin Carhart and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty, confidant, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes
This goes out to all the gangsta hoe pros
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train hoe

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Two]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, aiyyo Jeep kid
Drivin down the street pumpin, "Apache you ain't shit!"
Snappin on niggaz, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand..

[Chorus: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Verse Three]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MC's injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed tears when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

I need a gangsta bitch, yo! (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna "Gangsta boogie!" with my (gangsta bitch)
I need a (gangsta bitch) I want a (gangsta bitch)

[Apache]
Yeah, yeah.. (a gangsta bitch)
This shit goes out to all the gangsta bitches Uptown (a gangsta bitch)
All the gangsta bitches in Brooklyn, Long Island (gangsta bitch)

Mount Vernon (a gangsta bitch)
Chilltown J.C., Naughtyville E.O. (a gangsta bitch)
And Newark to Brick motherfuckin City (gangsta bitch)
(a gangsta bitch) (a gangsta bitch)
This goes out to all the gangsta bitches, hehehah (a gangsta bitch)
Every-motherfuckin-where (a gangsta bitch)

I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch) (a gangsta bitch)
