[Phife]
L-Y-R to the I-C-S
Niggas still fussin' 'bout who be the best
When Diggy Dog bounce through I put all that to rest ..
.. anyone try test I put two in they chest
Quest or no Quest I leave venue's a mess
Don't ask me to colab', me and you don't mesh
I stay fresh from the fresh, never frontin' or fess
In the name of J Christ all mics'll get blessed
Peep how I posess flavor, style, finesse
Microphones, honeys, two things I caress
To all you fake jiggy niggas, still not impressed
Queens, I rep' it to the fully, you'd think I own the Mets

*****
What, know I'm Phife, Phife nigga, what
	You know how I know you ain't Phife?
	You'da said you own the Knicks or somethin'
Listen man I'm sayin', it's sports it's what I'm just doin'
I'm sayin', it don't matter, that's not the point
	That shit is wack, impostor yo
I sound like Phife</pre>
