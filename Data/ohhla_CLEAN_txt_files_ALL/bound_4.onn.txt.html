Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload

Ah
I've been shot
I don't believe this
Can everyone stop getting shot

Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Mister DJ give me that reload

Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Mister DJ give me that reload

Diggy diggy down..

Ah
I've been shot
I don't believe this
Can everyone stop getting shot

When I say you say we say they say make some noise
When I say you say we say they say make some noise
When I say you say we say they say make some noise
When I say you say we say they say make some

Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Mister DJ give me that reload

Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload
Mister DJ give me that reload..

Swing badda badda badda badda swing
Swing like a birdy
Swing badda badda badda badda swing
Swing like a birdy
Listen my sing

Bound 4 bound.. 4 the reload
Bound 4 the bound bound 4 the reload...</pre>
