[Intro - Classified] (Scratched Sample)
("Kill, kill, kill all the cheap talk") ...
("And there's nothin cold as ashes")
("After the fire is, after the fire is gone")

("And there's nothin")
Nothin you could tell me
("And there's nothin")
Ain't nothin you could tell me, yeah
("After the fire is")
Yeah
("Gone, gone")

[Verse 1 - Classified] [Scratched Sample]
They want to say that I'm a cheap skate (yeah), grindin 'til my teeth ache [gone] (ha)
But please wait, let me speak over this beat break (Class)
I won't ever Jackpot or win the sweepstakes [gone] (nope)
I'll jack pot when I steal it from your weed bags (haha)
Smokin marijuana 'til I can't see straight [gone]
But these days it takes more for me to seem blazed
For Pete's sakes, I ain't tryin to be a mooch [gone] (what?)
You ain't tryin to share, quit tryin to be a scrooge
Kid at lunch break always bummin for a dime [gone] (yeah)
Pissin people off, always buttin into line (yeah)
Takin what I can, always get in where I fit in [gone] (right)
Tight with my cash 'cause I rap for a livin (ha)
Not a greedy cat but a pretty cheap cat [gone]
I know what I'm about, you can keep your feed-back
Record label hate me 'cause I talk like I'm broke [gone]
They try to build my image but fuck 'em, what they know? (oh!)

[Chorus - Classified] (Scratched Sample)
("And there's nothin")
Yeah
("And there's nothin")
Yeah
("After the fire is gone, gone")
("Kill all the cheap talk")

("And there's nothin")
Nothin you could tell me
("And there's nothin")
Ain't nothin you could tell me
("After the fire is gone, gone")
Yeah
("Kill all the bullshit")

[Verse 2 - Classified] [Scratched Sample]
And I ain't tryin to hear you, I'm tryin to smoke this, move off [gone]
Plus I'm in the middle of this 12 pack like 2Pac (ha)
And don't get all offensive (shit), cool off [gone]
Oh, now you name callin, I'm a bitch and too soft
I've been labeled everything, every name in the book [gone]
I've been dissed by many man but I'm stayin here put
Y'all ain't sayin shit to me, 'cause your word don't get to me [gone]
Givin lip to me, 'cause you want to live through me
Oh, jealousy it'll get to the best of 'em [gone]
Funny I ain't shit, but they think it's a step for 'em
They listen right now and think it's addressin them [gone]
Think you hit a nerve?  Motherfucker just guess again, and
("And there's nothin"), nothin you could tell me
We "Perfect Strangers", shut it cousin Balki
I ain't a sucker, ain't nothin you could sell me [gone]
Class won't be taught, then I'll pass on your offerin (yeah)
Cheap skate, growin up a hockey player [gone], had the cheap skates
Try workin out but only usin free weights (get it)
This mind frame keepin me paid [gone]
I'm in the game like EA, so bring it back DJ

[Chorus - Classified] (Scratched Sample)
("And there's nothin")
Yeah
("And there's nothin")
Yeah
("After the fire is gone, gone")
("Kill all the bullshit")

("And there's nothin")
Nothin you could tell me
("And there's nothin")
Ain't nothin you could tell me
("After the fire is gone, gone")
("Kill all the cheap talk")

[Outro - Scratched Sample - 4X]
