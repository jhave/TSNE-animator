Have you ever felt were writing something other than what writing, that
the was beside itself, couldn't ground it in any thing at all? This piece
is a mess. If God exists, and I mean all sincerity, kill me now.

That yesterday also It's an absurd belief lists of letters or numbers,
[[a-b][A-B][0-9][-_.'",]] etc. make for interesting reading. Yesterday's
incomprehensible, reworking installation log linux on this machine. The
only interest all it's full install Fedora. And so what? section uncoded.
Here's where I admit failure. I've been wringing everything could out
so-called 'Internet Text' (a title hate; used when still child) over 10
years now. How often can have anything to say? anyone?  milked just about
every format think of. cauterized myself; philosophical content work, my
real interest, lost among thousands pages nonsense. Meaning, value, good
and evil - reside within human heart, require frameworks presence
function. There nothing without framework. 500 AUTH not understood.

beginning an exploration of 4-dimensional images, starting with very 
simple inverse and exponential approaches (however it is clear that some 
are coupled with trignometric functions).

i will continue to add to these. software is calculon on zaurus pda.

years ago i worked meditatively on imagining the imaginary of the fourth
dimension. now i see the fruition held in my hand.

i am very very proud of these. they took a great deal of my imaginary

Boojum Carter


feline, aged 13 1/2, four years after our mother's death, biopsy diagnosed
as follows:

Microscopic: MAMMARY MASS ONE - This mass is demarcated and has a well
localized appearance. It is comprised of a collection of neoplastic
epithelial cells that are forming tubules. The tubules are separated by
variably thick connective tissue septa. The neoplastic cells have ovoid
stippled nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate is low and ranges from 0-1 per
high-power field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins. There are
scattered aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the
growth MAMMARY MASS TWO - This is the larger of the growths evaluated.  
There are several large cysts. There is a proliferating population of
neoplastic epithelial cells. The cells are organized in the lobules that
are forming occasional tubules. The central areas of the lobules are
degenerate. Neoplastic cells exhibit invasion. One or two layers of cells
line the tubules. The cells have large round vesicular nuclei with
multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, scant and cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate ranges up to six per high-power
field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins.

DIAGNOSIS: MAMMARY MASS ONE- MAMMARY GLAD ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR, LOW
GRADE MAMMARY MASS TWO - MAMMARY GLAND ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR CYSTIC

PROGNOSIS: Guarded

COMMENTS: Feline mammary malignancies should be considered capable of
metastasis and warrant a guarded prognosis at best. The first smaller
growth evaluated is well localized and is not exhibiting invasion. This
appears to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The second growth is
exhibiting invasion and this growth should be considered as having
potential for metastasis. Lymphatic invasion is not identified with any of
the sections evaluated. These growths appear to be excised.

Comments by doctor: Guarded. Felines tend not to recover. She might live
six months, several years, or less. There is no way to tell. She needs
immune system fortification. The doctor wishes her news would have been
better. The question is whether or not the tubules remain within the body.  
The cancer could spread rapidly or even go into remission.

Comments by writer: Boojum is named after the Boojum tree in Baja
California. She is thirteen and a half. She exhibits no signs of illness.  
She has been my companion and is highly sociable and nervous, She has the
personality, if not the skills, of a brilliant writer. At the moment she
is sleeping, recovering from the removal of her stitches. She travelled
with us to Miami, where she encountered, even indoors, new and interesting
forms of flora and fauna. Azure and I pray that she will live forever.

Comments: That cancer is always the same, disordered, disorderly, a tough
go whose treatment is violent and invasive as well. The well-defined
structure of the body begins to collapse as tunnels are formed through
highly-organized tissue.

Every organism is a world of miracles, and every creature dissolves in the
fury of cancer and creation. Azure and I are beside ourselves, and Boojum
Carter dreams now, not of death.

Playnt

I'm selfish and I'm tired. When I die I'll sleep an eternal
sleep. I'll have no choice but to sleep and sleep and sleep. I'm
selfish, I keep waiting for my due, for my books to appear, for
Marjorie Perloff to pat me on the shoulder, for a MacArthur
grant, for Katherine Hayles to realize I have something to say,
for something that might get me out of debt. I help everyone I
can, and there are so many people who don't like me, precisely
because of this, my incessant posting, my whining, my obvious
depressions, my aggressions, my acerbic nature. At the last few
conferences, I've been in troubles, sometimes I think I'm
invited only out of guilt by someone or other. All I can fall
back on is my work, and what does that amount to, if I'm in
everyone's kill file, if I'm not in bookstores or Kim's video or
Target? I keep putting out trash-work, hoping someone will see
the value in it. I think I should disguise this playnt by coding
and recoding cleverly - as if my own works had any significance
in the first place. In any case, as soon as I'm dead it will all
disappear. Look at the fury of the world around us. We keep
placing ourselves out 'there' for no reason at all. Even
rebellion is stillborn, the enemy has literally billions to push
its way through our hearts and minds. So my own quibbles mean
nothing in this regard. But I want to present my work in a clean
and proper way, I still want, at 61, to teach a class in media,
in experimental work, I still want, at 61, to receive my first
grant for my work since 1976, to see my book on a bookshelf in a
nice store with someone looking through the pages; I still want,
at 61, before I can no longer think, to find my soundwork at
Kim's Video or Target or Borders, my images in a wonderfully
prepared and printed book, my audience not one I have to force
myself onto; at 61, I'm so so tired, bone-tired, death-tired,
fear-tired, sick-tired, of self-justification, self-explanation,
self-critique, self-theory, ugly and useless self-promotion, as
if this narcissistic hole-in-the-wall is all there is

collaboration

la the enemy, espionage, each reading the other, of public arrive at
everything through collaboration, discussion, lb you'd be surprised
collaborative work series into a hypertext collaboration  list or
co moderate or begin or end collaborations    inside of me it /*in*/
where i work alone  i collaborate badly  i bristle  my thoughts 
lc among my jews, collaboration
     ld among my jews, collaboration
   prolegomena   against collaboration  
   collaboration  take it or leave it  
   collaboration  take it or be taken  
   the violence of collaboration  
   collaboration as 'grappling'  
   collaboration with the enemy  
   because one is a collaborator and one's hair is   
   a role is  always  a collaboration  
   in the sense of  collaboration with the enemy  
   collaborative exchange is void of value  
   value in its limits
   the emptiness of collaboration   pure labor  
   collaboration is always better than working  
   collaboration sublimates   subsumes   desire  
   structured collaboration has its limits  
   indeed, this is collaboration with the enemy  

collision collusion maybe collaboration maybe colloidal
collaboration
collaboration between two dying writers
collaboration on the lam from the law
collaboration marching from kosovo
collaboration wounded in east timor
collaboration of iraqi dead
collaboration beneath earthquake
in free fire zone, collaboration
in mountain fire zone, collaboration
collaboration among prisoners
collaboration between rival gangs
the last breath, you against the light, collaborating
collaborating with friends
collaborating with the enemy
to collaborate among the ruins of the atomic bomb
insistent on the lyric after auschwitz, collaboration
among my jews, collaboration
among my neo nazis, collaboration
collaboration in the last words ever spoken
collaboration among the last tears, the last sigh
collaboration at a loss for words
war time and collaboration
and of great beauty and moons wheeling, collaboration

 s the book really dead  
another world,  'd love to collaborate with you on a creative work where
its precisely because other people are setting up the collaborative 
making substitutions all over the place,   and   have collaborated 
                                         i     i

chorus

http://www.asondheim.org/chorus.mov

the silent chorus moves quickly through the shuttle
we all behave the same with ropes and signs
swollen and melting are one and the same
the stars in their degrees distend the body
your place or mine your death or mine
watch this very short film 
you will live inside it with everything you are

the 5d


http://www.asondheim.org/5.mov

what was some separate images and aren't
i'm too ill but these use time jittering with echo and posterize
from four to five but it's all lies
mathematics isn't mathematics is the only truth
representation is an other thing all together

ruined.mov and DANCERUN.MPG are going down soon so please get to them 
quickly

you won't regret it

butterfly fugue

http://www.asondheim.org/deathfugue.mov

this is the mating that triggered the war that killed all the people
the silent wings stirring up anguish, no one can take the blame
we are all innocent in our lives, we are all wounded
we will not eat we will live to do as much injury as possible
we will bring everyone to their knees, how dare they
we are the fury of the righteous and the violence of the lord
we are christ's burning, yahweh's drowning, allah's stoning
how dare we speak in the name of the truth
we are the murderers' fire and water and stone
one with annihilation
one with the world
