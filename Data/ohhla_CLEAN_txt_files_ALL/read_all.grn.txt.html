Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, Im not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, ohhhh

Nothing to hide
Stifle or smother
Suffered and cried
Strife made me tougher
Never mumbled or shy to
The trouble, I rise above all
Expectations forget rep
Aint never begged yet
When I wanted to get pence, hustle
To be, Im exactly what my neck says
That sket said I tried to cash in on my dads death
I wanted to vent stead I said nothing at all
After all you were never kin to me
Family is something that you've never been to me
In fact making it harder for me to see my father was the only thing that you ever did for me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, Im not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, ohhhh

Dear dad
As a kid I looked up to you
Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do or how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think, I used to blame me
I wondered what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wished you would have reached out
I wish you would've been round when I'd been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, Im not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it, ohhhh

I write songs, I can't listen to
Everything I have, I give to you
And every one of these lines I sing to you
My jobs more like public service
My life just became yours to read and interpret
If you heard it itd come across a lot different at times
I throw fits when I read how they word things
You've seen me smile
Now youre gonna have to see me hurtin
'cause pretending everything is alright when it aint, really isnt working

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, Im not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it

I aint censoring myself for nobody
Im the only thing I can be
All that is good, all that is bad, all that is, me

I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers, Im not afraid
They can read all about it, read all about it</pre>
