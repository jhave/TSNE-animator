Album:  Bone Brothers
Song:   No Rules
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com

Yeah, E-M-T (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus 2X: E-Mortal Thugs]
Throwin flagrants you fakers keep fakin, usin 'bows
To keep off you haters as the penalties create injuries
You niggaz be killin me with this negative energy
Sack you niggaz like quarterbacks, send you straight to surgery
(It ain't no rules!)

[PD]
I'ma step when it comes to the game, slip, I'ma dominate
Fuck ya, if ya wanna hate, injure niggaz that's in the way
Rules I never heard of them, use 'em and I'm still hurtin ya
You's a small area, whole area, I heard of ya
You gettin neglected plus rejected so expect some chin-checkin
If you bring it you'll get total disrespected
My squad is the money man, Layzie and the henchmen
Mo Thugs the fam, hot damn like a Van Damme
Y'all best know, who you dealin with, niggaz on some other shit
We come to get it, move over, we runnin shit (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Lil D]
I'm star stu-stu-stuttered like Ruben Studdard
Keep a German Rueger when I move through public
Assets with baguettes, I mean you dudes should run it
Glasses with two tecs, we laugh; a casket, who want it?
Given distributin them speedknots
Headlocks, ribshots, leg locks, head shots, follow my plot
I'ma pop it, feelin my profit, today's topic, cocked it and popped it
Fuck it, stop it, in my category that ain't a option
Constantly boxin knockin opposin opponents unconscious
Turn your blue suit to a red suit and use you as a sponsor nigga
(It ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Stew Deez]
Aw shit, y'all niggaz done bust y'all up
All of y'all niggaz finna get fucked up
We throwin 'bows at you hoes, ain't no rules so anything goes
We Bobby Boucher'n niggaz, my hobby be sprayin niggaz
My motto "No playin nigga" so fuck what you sayin nigga
Up out your mouth you get knocked out
from the first damn round it's goin down
Like Iron Mike Tyson nigga, we knockin your jaw around
I'm knockin you black and blue, E-M-T is smackin you, Lil' Lay is jackin you
for everything you got, so give it up or get shot, nigga
Cause when it come to these streets my niggaz roll, we roll deep
With SK's and AK's up in the front seat (it ain't no rules!)

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
So many melodies, better be 'bout the cheddar cheese
Layzie, E-Mortal Thuggin like criminals is the felonies
Y'all better be watchin y'all back, off the rip, I come with gats
Bang bang, do the damn thang, I'm a O.G. nigga handle that (buck buck!)
With a scandal that I will murder y'all
Ain't no rules, I ain't heard of y'all
Line 'em up nigga knock 'em down, fuck 'em all nigga serve 'em all
Bone Thugs to the Harmony, Mo Thug is my Family
It's real in the streets, you feelin me?
We the rawest clique on the planet see
Forever a menace so put it in Guiness, you better go check my manuscript
(Motherfuckers) Yeah (c'mon) you better go check my manuscript
