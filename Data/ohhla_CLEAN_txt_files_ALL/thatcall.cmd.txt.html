That Calliope, That Calliope
That Calliope (Take it outside) That Calliope
That Calliope (Take it outside) That Calliope

[C-Murder]
Knuckle up nigga, knuckle up nigga
I'm a Calliope nigga now what nigga

Get the gat, get the gat, get the gat nigga
Ain't no nigga like a Calliope nigga
Cuz a Calliope nigga is the shit
Ain't no nigga like a no limit nigga
Don't start no shit won't be no shit

Bounce trick bounce, bounce, bounce

Jump nigga, jump, jump, jump

Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where my 3rd Ward niggas, where my 3rd Ward niggas
Where they at, where they at, where they at,

I'm a no limit nigga so fuck ya niggas
