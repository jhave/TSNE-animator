Artist: Three 6 Mafia
Album:  Last 2 Walk
Song:   Intro
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Straight out the streets of Memphis, Tennessee
The robbery capital of the U.S.
The Three... 6... Mafi-uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse One]
Because of they +Mystic Stylez+
They +Lived By They Rep+ 'til the end
Causing +World Domination+
And +When the Smoke Cleared+, they still was +Unbreakable+
Being the +Most Known Unknowns+
But after winning the Oscar only some would last due to pressure
And be the last man standing
DJ Paul and Juicy J, the +Last 2 Walk+

[Chorus]
Smoke it up - what you do, what you do
Drank it up - what you do, what you do
Snort it up - what you do, what you do
Pop it up - what you do, what you do

[Verse Two]
I can hear the cries
Wishin they could turn back the hands of ti-i-i-i-i-i-me
Ba-a-a-a-a-a-ack...

"Hahahaha! Aww man, get the fuck outta here
 Your CD ain't messed up man
 I had to fuck wit'cha a little bit
 cause I'm gone and I'm lit
 But we fin' to give you some bump!"

{*scratching*} DROP THAT SHIT~!</pre>
