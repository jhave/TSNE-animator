Hey, this song is dedicated to the girl Brenda with the big breast-eses
In the ass like the black girls, I love you Brenda...

[Chorus: TQ]
Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma, when are you gon stop acting dumb?
Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma, when are you gon stop acting dumb?
You told me that we was going to the tele
I told you when I pull up, be ready
Now you said you can't find no one to watch your kids
But why can't you just get a new
Are you gon give me some?

[TQ]
What's wrong? what happened? You told me it was crackin'
I got my prophylactics, and why you trippin' on me?
I'm tired of playing games, its been a couple weeks
Hey ma I'm feeling you, you say you feeling me
I just can't understand why we can't get our love on
Girl I want it and quit, I want you to groan
Lets go to the Mo tonight, and lets sip a little mo' tonight
Girl don't say no tonight, you need to give me some

[Mannie Fresh]
Its 2002, what you gon do?
Your hot in the ass, so let lil' daddy come through
I've been hangin' with shorty for one whole week,
I'm trying to pressure you, its time to freak
Now I've been holding in, and you've been holding out
So why don't you be a nice girl and (Put it in yo mouth!)
Now things don changed, why you actin' strange?
You lettin' that other niggah get in yo brains?
Life is like a movie baby, stick to the script
I'm Dirk Diggle and its time to hit
I ain't tryin to take your man place, hes alright
I'm just trying to stick it to you baby just one night
Well I gotta buy something just for you to try something?
Yeah I'll let you get something just to let me hit something
Now I know your alone when he don't come home
Pick up the phone, now I give you the bone
When the kids asleep, then we can creep
I've been waiting to see you naked baby, one whole week
Time for you to give it up, let a nigga hit it up
Take in on or spill it up, swallow, don't spit it up

[Chorus: TQ, Wolf talking in background]

Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma, when are you gon stop acting dumb?
Oh when, oh when, oh when are you gon give me some?
Hey ma, hey ma, hey ma, when are you gon stop acting dumb?
You told me that we was going to the tele (Yeah, you act like you don't 
remember that though)
I told you when I pull up, be ready (Uh-huh, uh-huh,uh-huh,uh-huh)
Now you said you can't find no one to watch your kids (Mmm, mmm)
I think you just scared cuz you don't want me to leave (Thats what it is)
Are you gon give me some?

[Wolf]
Now I've been fucking with you for far too long,
And if I don't hit tonight, I know something is wrong
You've been duggin' and divin', just running scared
Like you committed a crime, and I'm the fed
Calm motherfucker over the phone,
But a scary motherfucker when its time to get it on
You be saying freaky shit, really turning me on
Like you swallow n' spit all over the dick
And you be bragging about how them niggas is strong
But the word is out, I'm seriously hung
Right now I'm ready, cuz I'm full of that juice
I'm ready to get you in the bed, and knock something loose
And after that, the balls in your court
We can leave it alone, or we can go back and forth
But first things first, Ima admit
Ima tear your ass up when you let me hit

[Greg Street]
W,B,I,T,E,C,H, ain't that a bitch radio
Yo check, thats the new jam of the day
The Big Tymers featuring Wolf
Yo Wolf don went from the the keyboards to the mic booth

And thats why you got your ass back in child support court too

You can't go to court with no punk defendant
Why you need Johnny Cochran, you rolling with them Cash Money Millionaires

This of uhh cases that concentrated titty milk
And big shouts out to all them ladies

Yo check, if you not ready, stay your ass out the club</pre>
