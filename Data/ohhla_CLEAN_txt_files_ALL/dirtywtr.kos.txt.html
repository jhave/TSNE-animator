[Chorus - K-Os]
I don't know where I'm coming from
Only know where I belong
There's dirty water in my bones
She... I know she will follow me
But she ain't got no sympa..
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got soul but no money
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got soul but no money
Alright, okay, yeah
Alright, okay, yeah
Alright, okay, yeah

[Verse 1]
At the age of eighteen
came on the scene clean
now I know what pains means
Spent time in the darkest places
beautiful faces in the dark oasis
Trying to take this to the full extent
Am I real heaven sent?
Clark Kent's my alter ego
Took that girl down to Puerto Rico
Now I find out that we're not amigos
Treated her foul never as an equal
Now I'm all sad just because my ego
Had a golden key, couldn't find a key hole
Yo, stop let the beat rock
conscious hip hop is gettin dropped
Wake up saw B and the little one
little son had b-phids done
Easy come, easy go
Everyone thinks they know
'bout the thing, high unknown
Put their thoughts on a throne
then they name it G-O-D
colonize, you and me
But I'm free, in the sky
me, myself, and I. Word

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm coming from
Only know where I belong
There's dirty water in my bones
She... I know that she will follow me
But she ain't got no sympa..
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee

Alright, okay, yeah
Alright, okay, yeah
Alright, okay, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was walkin down the mountainside
No matter what I did I couldn't hide
from all the things inside of me
Seems that I was living fantasy
singing, oh, how time flies, with crystal clear eyes
This life I know is gone
Oh, how time flies, with crystal clear eyes
This girl I like is gone, and now I leave home

She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee
She ain't got no sympathy, and I got something on my knee</pre>
