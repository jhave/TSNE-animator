[ INTRO ]
We was born in the streets of L.A.
Where the streets ain't safe at night
Between the beeper and the color of a rag
We have chosen the mic, right?
So the philosophy we learned on the streets
We now bring to this muthafuckin stage
And at this time we likes to unload
These lyrics like a 12-guage

[ VERSE 1: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Bail on stage with a gangster lean
Busters duck once I'm on the scene
Opponents went out the do'
The innocents hit the flo'
As if we started a war
Boo-Yaa! It means a cry from a shotgun
You want some of this, come on and get some
Feel that Boo-Yaa bass, it get louder
Only O.M.B. could provide that power
Power, from the brothers in black (ha!)
No radio can stop this track (ha!)
The Ridd, yeah, gettin rid of MC's
I get them before they even try to get me
If the enemy tries to mob
Get mopped by the Boo-Yaa hit squad
Inmates from the mad house, comin from the lock-in
Chilled with the rats ??????
You try to run, but you don't get far
Cause I spray your ass with the letter R

Gangsta Ridd - is what?

[ VERSE 2: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Comin from the mind of a criminal-ex
Out on a furlough just to snap necks
Once again -
Once, once, once again
Once again the rap criminal, known to be a loc
Since it's rated R (this is for the old folks)
Restricted for the ears of a minor
Lyrics like the sun, so strong it might blind ya
This jam was created for the ears of a realist
Get off my shit list (?????)
Murder He Wrote, that was my last jam
Like Michael Jordan with the new dunk (check out the new slam)
Here it is and you're beggin for more
A new slam, from the criminal lord
This jam is resctricted for the MCs that fear me
Everytime it play, they run when they hear me
Keep runnin, but you don't get far
Cause this concept is Rated R, the R

[ VERSE 3: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Wait up, get up, step up, I feel the fate now
Cause that Boo-Yaa bass is gettin too loud
But the louder it gets we get much respect
T.R.I.B.E.'s on your back, a bunch of insects
That's my job, puttin em on what
You don't wanna move, ??????
Smoke from my microphone still linger
MC's drop a dime to the one-time ?????
Sayin I did it, yeah, the Ridd did it
Now that I know you a snitch, I ain't with it
Buster Brown, you just a clown from a new town
Huffin like you're bad - you ain't down
Hold it, stop, wait a minute and don't move
I have a nation rockin to this groove
My mouth to the mic is like a clip to the Uzi
You see a Uzi spray, you gonna wanna use me
Keep runnin, but you don't get far
Cause I spray your ass with the letter R

[ VERSE 4: Ganxsta R?dd ]
Restricted for the ears of the mental insane
Lyrics like a drug, you're blowin your brain
Like the homie named Deathrow, Deathrow my bro
Had to go, he was next in row
He went solo, sold his soul to the devil
This I know, he had a tatoo on his elbow
Turn up the radio, this is what he showed
It read: 'life's goin too slow'
Hesitate, you're too late (yeah) the doubt in your route
Is that's what life really about?
This I know, Deathrow was a criminal
It was his time to go, life was too slow
Restricted for the ears of a minor
Make sure there's a adult behind ya
Cause if you're young and you try to get far
I smoke your ass with the letter R
