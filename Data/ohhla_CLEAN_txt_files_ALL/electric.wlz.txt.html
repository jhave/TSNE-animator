[Verse One] [C-Rayz Walz]
Out in the streets there's violent beasts
Helicopter birds, Rhino Jeeps
Scuffed up shoes from tyrants feet
(No peace when the wino speaks)
Mouth wide open
Beats be blarin' 
Beat Street wearin'
We keep hearin'
Made to be broke
You know the rules
And you know how Monster's do

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz] [x2]
We gonna rock down to
Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse Two] [C-Rayz Walz]
Drive to work like a soldier
The war for food
Ticket for parking
(The meal is you)
Propain gas
No name crash
Switch lanes fast
(Or feel the blues)
With no signal, fate takes your turn
(Grabs horns like pistols)
Make you swerve
Break straight lines or skate the curb
(Good God!)

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz] [x2]
We gonna rock down to
Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh no [x4]

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz] [x2]
We gonna rock down to
Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse Three] [C-Rayz Walz]
Bum rush bump in the line of the club
(Bananas peel for real, slip you up)
Glocks in the street
Shots at the bar
Real rock stars don't play air guitar
Sessions sorrow
Lesson's borrowed
Wild for the night
Arrested tomorrow
Conception perfected
Connection expression
Electric injection
Exit steppin' on down to

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz] [x2]
We gonna rock down to
Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Out in the street
Out in the street
Out in the playground
In the dark side of town

[Chorus] [C-Rayz Walz] [x2]
We gonna rock down to
Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Rock it in the daytime
Monsters in the night
Monsters in the DC sound set
Monsters in the BX for life</pre>
