[Verse 1]
Okay which way you wanna go nigga
Left, right, up, down, come on man
Just find it on yourself, man come on now
Pimp's probably a bit too much
Pimps went dead with this year's shit here
Man pimp pimp pimp pimp, you got chewed up
Lisa had a problem
She never realized that all the dick she was suckin
In the hood, she could have made herself mountains
But it's my fault cause she a ho and didn't listen to a pimp
So she writin you in the pen over and over again
See I believe in servin a nigga his papers wHen I knock his ho
Like a pimp did me on Beach Blvd, know
I got knocked, gon get knocked, de-knocked, re-knocked
But I'ma knick-knock my motherfuckin self, I'm Suga Free, ha
I, P-I,	oh my, M-P, oh I, for life
Knock knock for winter (ha ha), me too
Like a R-2 twin magnetic pimp response
Plus yo ass sweatin me like a cheap suit

[Chorus]
Just when you thought the pimpin was in you
Ah ah, it's just on you (I can't warn you)
What's wrong? Kitty cat get her nosebleed?
It's red ribbon week? It's just on you (you can't win)
Fire engines, and ????
It's just on you (you can't win)
And just when you thought that $500 was for another abortion
Gotcha, it's just on you (I can't warn you)

[Verse 2]
Now I, can't, believe, how, y'all, niggaz
Still, don't, know, how, a ho, go
They make more, pay more
A doctor or a nurse or a vet
They say a pimp walked on water, and he never got wet
See sometime it feel like the pimpin be dead
But that's a temporary condition too
A quota peep that he could be a ho
But he called back (cool)
And I can't believe how some of y'all niggaz
Let the glory pass you by
But steady wanna pick my brain about the game and ask why
And if it wasn't for tony
Y'all motherfuckers'd still be ridin around Pomona Gospel
Spittin like bitches to my homies

[Chorus]
A strong wind 40 days and 40 nights
Suckers, it's just on you (you can't win)
When she disrespect you in front of your homeboys
You are the weakest link, cause it's just on you (you can't win)
Man I mean she gon be either a stand-up ho
or a fall-down bitch, man it's just on you (you can't win)
Now you know you're with a square when Red Cross won't give her coffee

[Verse 3]
God said he wasn't gon put no more meat that I could stand
Ho it mean after you leave me I cop and blow
And be the chain of a man (Amen)
Here's a story about a pimp that they ain't took out yet
But died 8 or 9 times and ain't found him yet
I tell your man I just be sittin back lookin (lookin)
Listenin (listenin), learnin (learnin)
Pimpin (pimpin), and I don't see no difference
Peep, wolf disguised as sheep
That's how I stalk my prey
Every single day, I don't know no other way
Born again! Pimp different, hear different, feel different
Look different, Walk different, talk different
And the tricks you fuckin never try to keep up with him
That's what they do
Don't even think you fuckin her better than him
I mean the joint bout-it man will knock you straight on your back
Just like you got the Holy Ghost, feelin good, go like that
And to inquirin minds that wanna know
I got on Stains, fucked it up
Popped the pen, I left with my ho

[Chorus]
And outta all the pimpin goin on around you
It's just on you
I mean that a goddamn drop touched on you
See, it's just on you
Mean to tell me you mad at the pimpin cause
you don't see no difference? (it's just on you)
Just when you got a taste for steak in your mouth
She gave you bologna cause it's just on you
When she said all she did was kiss him
And you said okay that's when she knew it's just on you
Just when you thought that givin her all that dick
Was the shit nigga I couldn't warn you
Better get yo ass way from around here
I ain't playin (good morning)
Be good or be good at it
goddamnit, it's just on you
I'ma go in a worm but I'ma come out a butterfly motherfucker
It's just on you
Relax all your muscles (it's just on you)</pre>
