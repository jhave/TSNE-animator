[Verse 1: Apathy]
I feel energetic enough to jettison right off the planet
Come back down to Earth and splash in the Atlantic
Deeper than Atlantis and navigating the Nautilus
Im areonautic as NASA with data of astrologists
You can't swallow this I'll never be eaten
Defeated a beatin as long as I'm breathin I'm never retreatin
The street sweepin' heat seekin' beat freakin' deep being 
Got you weak creeps fleeing if you caught sleepin'
I slaughter slice saute' slay dice mics
Display nice tight lyrics whenever I recite
I damage your physical whether minumum or maximum
Spinnin 'em and spittin at 'em till my raps platinum
Pluck platinum plaques from walls 
And fuckin smash 'em into pieces so small
A microscope couldnt pack 'em in
I back 'em into corners from powerful forces
Devour thier corpses and carve 'em with corkscrews
Force crews to lose when I nail 'em like horseshoes
Better pay dues cause I spray dudes
Like Jeru's mind with rhymes so ahead of my time
8 planets rotate around the Earth instead of nine
Cuz I destroyed the Earth with a verse in the past
Which is now the present time so prepare for the blast
When it's all said and done all the emcee's is smashed
The Demigodz land as the last in they class

Chorus x4

Yo I'm every emcee
It's all of me 
That's the way it is 
Way it's gotta be

[Verse 2: Rise]
Every emcee can't match how I done this the wickedest flow
I'll be 90 with a young chick that's with me for dough
So fat I got a T-Shirt that's hanging as a curtain
And when they said your nice they meant only as a person
For certain you need someone to yell at ya crew
When me an Ap connect we make green like yellow and blue
Please tell me the truth you wish ya felony's true
Cuz you that kid in the class that kept smellin the glue
But I'm a rational cat I make insane choices
Rise I kill wack rappers and blame voices
They useless like my card when it's maxed out
I talk shit and throw stones at a glass house
I be loved by classy women and floozy's
Crowds love me like game like Lucy
I write loosely It's been a while I been raw
We started something you don't know what you in for
Rise'll make you practice wish you had tactics to match this
Talkin to myself in my ad libs
Access new you aint heard us before
The same name as the Germans in war
They wouldnt let us through the door so we came through the floor
Cut a hole throught the ceiling with the use of a saw
Now girls stare but alot of they heads are filled with air
Easy like the first question on "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"
Yeah the same girls denying 'em sex
Find out you signing some checks will have you signing they breasts
A foul cheater I tell wifey how much I need her 
Then I sleep with your girl and blame it on the way you treat her
Make her leave you than leave her in pain from the lies
She tatooed my rap name than I changed it to Rise
Access and Demigodz 2 cliques from above
We roll deep our cliques thicker than Mother Love

Chorus x8</pre>
