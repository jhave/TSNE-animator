Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Since when I ain't get no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?
Since when I ain't count no stacks? Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when I ain't fuck your ass? Since when you ain't suck me up?
Since when I ain't hit the club? Since when I ain't throw the cash up?
Since when? Since when? Since when? You lyin'
Since when? Since when? Since when? Are you lyin'?
Since when I ain't ball on hard? Since when I ain't sell no rock?
Since when I ain't count no checks? Since when young nigga didn't flex?

[Verse 1]
Since when? Turn up, turn up, turn up
Turn up, since when?
Since '91, I was gettin' it in
Countin' nothin' but them Benjamins
'09 in True Religion
You decided to do it in 2010
I decided to move it to Robin
You couldn't buy it, your pockets was hurtin'
I mothafuckin' do it
Walk up in the club rockin' nothin' but Louis
Y'all niggas flexin' 'bout the shit that you did
My nigga, we been, kickin', pimpin'
Codeine when we sippin'
250 for the lenses
CL drop, Benzes
Just went to the doctor yesterday
Told me chill on the lean for my kidneys
Laughed at him, said "You is silly"
Two bitches in the kitchen, water whippin'
But it ain't no forensics
Niggas try to rob me, I wouldn't risk it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Since when I ain't kill you with the Louis?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothafuckin' Gucci?
Since when I ain't kill you with the mothafuckin' Truey?
Since when a young nigga like me didn't do it?
Since when a young nigga didn't flex?
Since when a young nigga didn't count no checks?
Since when a young nigga didn't hit the mall?
Since when a young nigga didn't [?]?
Since when I ain't pull up in a Jag?
Since when I ain't pull up in a Benz
Since when I ain't fuck no foreign bitch
Then I fuck her twin
Since when I ain't smoke no gas?
Since when a nigga lighted up mid?
Since when [?]
Since when you see me in the club with designers on my [?]
Back then, I've been doin' it sense, [?]
It's in my blood, it's my skin
Ain't nothin' out here ain't did
[?]
Ain't have a kid cause I [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Since when a young nigga ain't do it? Since when my pants wasn't Truey?
Since when, might pull up with the Louis, and I'm pullin' up with the Gucci
Since when I pull up with that foreign coupe, look like I'm in a movie
Call me young Quavo, Tom cruisin', smokin' on the gas [?]
Since when I ain't take your ho? Since when I ain't make her my ho?
Since when I ain't put her in the trap? Countin' cheese in the bando
Since when my VV don't shine? Since when my bitch wasn't fine?
Since when [?] on the block and she [?]
