[Pumpkinhead]
Praise to the most high for blessin me with a seed
Now I gotta make it to the top with _Speed_, like Keanu Reeves
And when I bleed, I feed a million children indeed
With the knowledge and the strength that they need
Fuck the military!  Man beg my pardon
The only thing my dad got from them was agent orange
Cocksuckers experimented, on they own soldiers
I'd rather be in a coma than help fill in they quota
Give me a bulldozer, and before the world is over
I'll find Bush and his daddy and run both they asses over
The Bush's are trigger happy and wanna be in a war
Two people they're like raisin the taxes and killin the poor
I say I put the sword to they jaw, let it off
'til they jaw fall to the floor, and Colin Powell callin the morgue
You call him a hero but I call him a whore
Gettin pimped by the system that wanna see the end of us all

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It goes one grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin let it go it'll be the death of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin martyr before a soldier at war
Fuck the law, we gon' settle the score

[Pumpkinhead]
One grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin let it go, it'll be the end of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin martyr before a soldier at war
Fightin my brothers and sisters overseas for your laws
You stick your nose in everybody country business when yours
is the most corrupt nation, illumination blinding us all
You don't think they already got UFO's in store?
With technology to travel lightspeed past ours?
I guarantee, these lizard reptilian figures
Hidin under human flesh under they breath callin us niggaz
I pull the motherfuckin trigger, explode your liver for fun
And I won't stop 'til daddy and junior's kissin my gun
Slugs pop from a short distance, listen you're done
Your existance short-lived, now you live on the sun
Burnin for eternity, your skin lift off your bones
Now your skin is black like mine with a crispier tone

[Chorus]

[Outro: unknown speaker]
Yeah, you see my black and latino people
There are some truths that we have to face
And there are some lies we have to uncover
And there are some fake muh'fuckers out there talkin
And they talkin for us, but they not talkin to us
And they not talkin about us
They just speakin, as if it was from our perspective</pre>
