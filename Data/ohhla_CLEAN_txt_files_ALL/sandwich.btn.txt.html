"Get on down"
talking:
Yo this is the little lunatic youknowhatimsayin'?
Straight outta Buck Show fuck that. 

Psycho Les:
It's like this y'all it's like this y'all
I woke up to the wall and took a piss y'all
Nigga pop the beat right up on the panel
When you see beyond your shit don't fuck with the channel
Or the antenna, slap a funky moranna
On the ass cock back my cock and blast
Boom I juice they love the one I produce for 'em
I floor 'em donkey styles ? nigga be sleepin' man 
And they hoes go out if I catch the bitch alone (forget about) 
Punk now what you gonna do sausage 
When I take your bitch home and fuck her hard with my ostrich
Size dick bitch gets hypnotized quick
Then I flip her little ass like a side kick (word)
The names not Bond so come on and pass me the light
Or the hydro chron 
Bust it
I make bitches make me sandwiches and scratch my ass when it itches


Very nice. Did you hear the rhyme?
