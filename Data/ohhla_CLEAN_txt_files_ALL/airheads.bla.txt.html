Cookin' Soul

[ CHORUS: Yukmouth ]
We gettin high on the freeway, drivin with my knees
Kissin on my lean, nigga, twistin up the trees
I don't fuck with sticks and seeds, don't gimme no bammer weed
If it ain't them scout cookies then I fuck with OG
[ CHORUS: Blanco ]
And I'm higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on them cookies
Got me higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on that OG
And I'm higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on them cookies
Got me higher than giraffe pussy
Smokin on that OG

[ VERSE 1: Blanco ]
I break it down, start rollin like a Rolex
And then I flip it like a Rolodex
And this one here is to the neck
Cause baby, I just smoke the best
I'm the fuckin weed king
It's like I'm a human triple beam
Smokin joints, sippin lean
Yeah I'm ballin, so these bitches got me triple-teamed
And I'm just chillin with my stoner girl
Talkin shit like 'Baby, I'ma run the world'
Fuckin run for president
I'm spittin game, so you don't need to question it
(Shhh...) And ain't no second-guessin it
I smoke the best of it, y'all can smoke the rest of it
Good weed, I invest in it
50 p's a week, that's just an estimate

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]
I wake up and bake up to the finest kush
I took a TwitPic, hit my timeline and look
I blow designer kush, rockin with that Charlie Sheen
OG, Big Doh, I'm on the winning team
Po' a fo' of lean, my styrofoam frosty
Actavis got me noddin off with a coffee
With my nigga Jack rollin bags of that Barney
And my kush so loud it can wake up Bob Marley
Louder than a Harley bike, stronger than the X-Men
Smokeathon veteran, black Willie Nelson
Smokin AK-47 up in room 420, Coughee Brotha like Devin
Veteran, you niggas get yo weed from dispensaries
I know the grower with the tree, he let me pick the weed
Boss shit, I'm right there when they clip the weed
He say he smokin' mo' than Yuk - hah, nigga please

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Dru Down ]
I'm smokin cookies, got the munchies, milk and cookies
On the highway gettin head in a hybrid
It's like a cloud on the ground with some wheels on it
Leave a strong smell, when I burn rubber its's real, homie
Kush capitol from the Bay to the Big Apple
Like Snapple - the Best up on Earth
That's the slogan, cause the weed I smoke is so potent
High on the daily, so I won't have to go crazy
( ? ) I push, I'm in a Explorer Van
580, 880, a Town tour, man
So high like the sky, just call me fly guy
When it's time to go there come to me and know I
Burn them trees, I'm drinkin, got women flockin, they jockin
I'm not trippin, I'm high - and plus it's pimpin
So get it right, don't fuck up my high, hoe
Or just listen to the hook or catch a hook

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 4: Richie Rich ]
I'm into clippin clones and usin different phones
Started just blowin sacks, now I be smokin zones
Some niggas call 'em zips, we used to call 'em O's
I'm under heavy stress, that's why I got to blow
Drop 7 in a zag, call that shit Michael Vick
Just got out of jail but I'm back on my shit
Just do a Hail Mary, a ten pack of grapes
Got niggas catchin my passes in mo' than 20 states
I'm high as ( ? ) pussy, smokin that drippy stem
Them girl scouts is out lookin for Richie Rich
My bitch bought a box, I told her shut the do'
I smelled the bud, ran outside and bought a couple mo'
I'm into blowin kush, I like to smell a dream
Purple's my favorite color, but OG kush is green
You see me in the traffic, just know I'm movin mean
High as giraffe pussy, and that's on everything

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 5: B-Legit ]
I gets deeper than a dolphin off the blue dolphin
And I don't do it often but the cookie got me coughin
I probably need a coffin, some narcos and oxycodones
A bad bitch to roll the bela while the B-La ploddin
A Cali state of mind, oh yeah I'm doin fine
Don't waste no time chasin paper, nigga, paper mine
This bitch fine and she ask could she ride and laughed
I told her hell yeah and broke her off the other half
Now here my autograph, a body like a dancer
Plus her head game is sick, call her brain cancer
She addicated to this dick, call her Nohanna
Plus I'm higher than a plane, I see you in Atlanta
Bosses do what they do, them suckers what they can
I stay stokin on good with Jane and Mary-Ann
Might even roll in yo hood with that contraband
I'm wet as Aquaman, B-La get it poppin, man
