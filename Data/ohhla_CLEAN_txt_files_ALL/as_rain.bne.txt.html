[Chorus]
As the rain slowly goes away 
You got me wishing for a better day 
As the rain slowly goes away 
You got me praying for a better day 

[Verse 1]
You ask me how we do this the way it's supposed to be done
I'm out here tracing my steps 
for the people that gave me a place to sleep
And food to eat before faces of death
Thanks for the help and all the support lend me a g when I was in need
My pops was unsure and I was in court
Somebody out there had to believe
They gave me the go ahead to keep movin' on
Keepin' with faith wasn't easy at all
Dealin' with the haters dodging these laws
Who would of ever thought Easy would fall
Now what's left to do got to chase this paper by any means at necessary
It's a hell of a load we got to carry
Man this struggling shit is temporary
Every year got to bury one more nigga in a cemetery
This life be wicked and scary
So I bust this shell in yuh yearly
Yeah you rest in peace Carrie, Wally, Easy, Terry and Vu,
Baby Boy, Uncle Charles, Biggie and 2pac remember I'm with you
Got shit to do so you blowin through top drop bumpin' the dub
Y'all my niggas y'all my fallen angels and you livin' now what

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Let me check the time on my rollie like it's moving far from slowly
And if you don't know me by now I guess I'll be marching by my lonely
Nigga got shit to do got shit to face from place to place
And it ain't no way in the world go 
that say you might tis well stack your plate
If you get down how you live then you alright with me
But if you fake and tellin' lies nigga you ain't tight with me
Only hungry niggas eat they don't ride with steel
And only phony niggas cheat ain't got no time to real
Cause when you real in the field oh you a man cause you kill
But nigga you'll squeal on your partner cause you can't please be still
If my gas tank empty I'ma fill the bitch up
And if my 45 full guess what I'ma drink the bitch up
I'm in the cut with some niggas that ain't scared of shit
And since are struggle all the same we taken care of some shit
We thugs and playas and shit
All men claim realage you'll niggas don't know show business
Y'all niggas better get some business

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And as the rain drops keep fallen' on my window pain
I just keep blazin' up my endo remain the same
Nigga that's established
and I'm out her to get this cat got's to have it
Nigga been chasin' the mathematics how to stack it
In a position where he's facing so much time
did he want to commit that crime
I really don't think so but it's only time
And I'ma be here when you get home
Put that on the bone
Whatever ever it was whatever it be I'ma always stay strong for yuh
I'ma always stay strong soldier

[Chorus to Fade]</pre>
