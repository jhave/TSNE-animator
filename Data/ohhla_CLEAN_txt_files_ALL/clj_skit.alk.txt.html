[J-Ro]
Yo whassup whassup yo?
Yo we got, we got Cool J in the house
And you know, Ladies Love Cool James
So yo yo yo yo, ay man
What do you suggest I drink when I'm just chillin with a girl
and I wanna get her open?

[Tash]
Ha ha hah HAAAH, yes!
I know you know!

[Cool J]
You probably wanna smooth her smooth out with like some ahh
but first of all you gotta understand on the Alkaholik level
they, they don't wanna get Absolut-ed out
and hit they head on the headboard but that's another level
So we'll go ahead, umm
You wanna hit em the chillest mango tangerine flavor fruity beverage
Smooth em out, real silky, knahmean?
Cranberry, yo some cranberry orange juice
That's all you need
Cause your game gonna finish the rest (with a little gin)
We got you, knahmean?  You the gin man (yeah, yeah I got you)
Do your thing
You wanna get some goosepimples, it's all good (and it's like that)
AIGHT?</pre>
