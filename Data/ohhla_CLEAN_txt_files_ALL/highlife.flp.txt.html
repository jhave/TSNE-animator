Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm high (so high), On life on life
I'm high (so high), On life on life

Everytime I'm feelin' so blue I get you in it
Then my skys change from grey to blue, uh huh, you did it
So I'll keep you by me and I'll let you stay
Long as you keep makin' me feel like a summer day

Then I let you (Get down on it)
Then I get you (Hot like on it)
So don't crowd me just let me do what I do

Let me do my thing, can you let me do my thing
Cuz it's my time, my life
And right about now I'm feelin' like

I'm high (so high) on life on life
I'm high (so high) on life on life

And sometimes I don't have a clue just how you did it
Got me strung up on you and (ooh) baby there's no limit
(?) more of everyday
Cuz you get me seein' this life in a different way
Right about now, I'm feelin' like a dream
Cuz you got me doin' these crazy things and
I don't care what other people think cuz it's my own life

Let me do my thing, can you let me do my thing
Cuz it's my time, my life
And right about now I'm feelin' like

I'm high (so high) on life on life
I'm high (so high) on life on life</pre>
