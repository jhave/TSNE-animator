[Too $hort]
You know, it's a hard pill to swallow
When they tell you you strange
You ain't hot
Then in the blink of an eye
They got on what you got
That means I'm a boss!

Uh uh... watch the beat go..
Uh uh... watch the beat go..
Uh uh... watch the beat go..
Uh uh... watch that beat go..

[Kelis]
I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

Ooh lemme slow it down for ya so you can catch the flow
Screw it up make it go extra slow
Real girls get down on the flo (on the flo get down, on the flo)
Ooh I gave you a taste you want some more
Touch down on it like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, icicle
Ooh from the 6-4 hefers up in crenshaw
The money makin playas up in harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

Ooh (i bet I bet I bet) I bet cha neva heard it like this before
My baby be cruisin them phantom doors
Got the bar poppin this that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh I'm drinkin blastin the crowds it's all smokin
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls we stay fly and we love to stay high
Ooh from the 6-4 hefers up in crenshaw
To the money makin playas up in harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I'm switched up the beat of the drum
That's right I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the chick y'all love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch debate
I'm back with an 808 cause I'm bossy

[Too $hort]
It's bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin, she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt em
Don't back that, you gon work em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What chu want girl, you gettin mad now
That's how you do it, huh?
Well I'm the coolest one
In fact, it's in the back bring 'em to the front
Tell that man you's a boss
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss
I don't think he understand you's a boss
Get some help if you can cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash mayne
In your benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin, you say "how much it cost me?"
About a million dollars playa, she's bossy

[Kelis]
I'm bossy
