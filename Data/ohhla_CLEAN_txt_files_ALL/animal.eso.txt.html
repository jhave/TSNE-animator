Typed by: AZ Lyrics

To the kingdom of all creatures
you have risen spirit soar
Don't turn back now, hear the sages
It is time to reach the goal

Yeah, yeah, yo, back in this bitch I'ma kick the door down
Down right dirty like shit in your mouth, nah, just pullin your leg
And all that shit talk, mate, I'ma put it to rest
Yes, you know what this is, hip-hop and new-o linguistics
I'm real, I don't rap for the dough
Tell it to a friend, bitch, act like you know
I'm a dedicated motherfucker livin my dream and
I'ma keep them comin like I'm flickin their bean
Set the kitchen ablaze then take to the stage like Ricky Gervais
Tell it like it is in a world gone mad
I'll paint the town red like a girl on rags
Got three blunts like tree trunks, you know who it is

Big macka, doin the do, with an open mind and beautiful view
I said mate, chick right there is rough as rugby
stand back I'ma fuck this pussy

If you want it I got it, and since you need it, let's get it
I got a chainsaw wrapped around a baseball bat. I said, "Bitch."

Do the hoo-hah, hoo-yah. You know what it is
My coop flies blue skies, on them southern dames, like oo-hah, woo-hah
My eye glides up the jungle of my mind like, "Bitch don't kill my high, bye."

And that black bat, out the cave like Gotham
Change my lane when I aim my conscience
Move from rap, I was raised by Compton
Put him in a cage, make a name like Bronson
It's all gold when summer hits autumn
this my trip and there's nothin this awesome
And they call us sayin build ships or Bill Hicks
hold this engage from Hunter S Thompson
Caution, Jonathan's mind's like a spaceship
Tryin to hide from the pryin eye of the Matrix
I've lost my marbles, hell it's fun though
I left my knowledge in El Segundo
Boo-yah, I don't have time for the hoo-ha
Martin massaging my ears like woosah, hoo-ha
I've got you all in check when I bust a rhyme up on the set with a jaw cracker
Bob smacker, with his hunger in built to life I saw it after
The best thing I've ever had like any movie star, been chewin on a wall cracker
Shit it's all after

And right now I'm more ready than I've ever been
It's a zoo I'm ready to see some elephants
Shit, the wolf pack is back on the map
with a crew of cats riding a semi full of pelicans

Do the hoo-hah, hoo-yah. You know what it is
My coop flies blue skies, on them southern dames, like hoo-hah, hoo-yah
My eye glides up the jungle of my mind like bitch don't kill my high, bye</pre>
