He was once a thug from around the way

(Slim Thugga, Muthafucka!)

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
(She say she wanna)
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(She lookin' for a) Thug from around the way

I represent the H and the bottom of the map
And I was born and raised in the bottom of the trap
The number one rule is ya gotta stay straped
Cause any given minute you can take that long nap
I roll with gorillas, dealers and the killers
Cause when I'm on stage that's the only fool spillers
Real Trill niggas, let me see ya hands
But I do this for the streets, I ain't try'na make ya dance
Roll solo, I don't need no friends
Still flip that lac, I don't need no Benz
And Harlem throwing money, I don't need no Zen's
Matter fact I be back, I need more to spend
She say she wanna

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
(She say she wanna)
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(She lookin' for a) Thug from around the way

It's white-T, Nikes, when I hit the club
They say I can't get in cause I'm dressed like a thug
Fuck the dress code, we bout a hundred deep
And they goin let us in, or get they ass beat
Boss Hogg Outlaws roll like the mob
Errbody paid cause we stays on our job
Drop in G-T a blessing from the Lord
So haters don't be mad that we blame it on God
I'm coming out hard, them other boys soft
So I'm a hold it down for that H and the Nawf
Brand new jewelry look what I brought
Still running from the feds, I ain't never getting caught
She say she wanna

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
(She say she wanna)
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(She lookin' for a) Thug from around the way

Ya say ya man ain't fuckin' ya right
Ya lonely and depression need a thug in ya life
Well come on over here, I can feel ya appetite
Take ya back to the crib and beat it all night
She say she love a thug, cause Thugga beat it good
Her man pay them bills, but Thugga keep it hood
And I ain't gotta stare, that's already understood
I take ya for a ride, you can slide on my wood
I pick her up and shake her up and down like dice
Sweet like cake make me wanna take a slice
I ain't try'na take advantage, but take my advice
Take a break from the fakes, get a thug in ya life
She say she wanna

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way
(She say she wanna)
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(I'm a) Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
(She lookin' for a) Thug from around the way

Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from a, Thug from a, Thug
Thug from around the way</pre>
