[Master P]
Yeah, it just done got more realer y'all
Ya boy Shocker back
All the real ones stand up
All you haters can remain anonymous
You ain't gotta smile or clap or nothing
So if you with me, let's go

[Chorus: Pops]
My whole click full of thugs, we got it on lockdown
And when we get in the club, we got it on lockdown
And when we throw our hood up, we got it on lockdown
Man you don't wanna get buck, we got it on lockdown
Whoa Move around, we got it on lockdown
Whoa Move around, we got it on lockdown
Whoa Move around, we got it on lockdown
and if somebody tripping, then his bodies being found

[Silkk the Shocker]
Some of y'all niggaz is so gay, plus you know what
Acting like little kids and shit, nigga, grow up
You catch the top off the grey benz
and I came to make money motherfucker and not to make friends
You know what I do to haters
Have 'em stomped out on they lawn like they was trying to reach for a newspaper
I give y'all 50 thousand reasons
they ain't wanna see me 50 plus in the bank, and I ain't talking thousands either
If it was left up to them, they wouldn't even like me breathing
I don't agree but I understand, I wouldn't even like me either
Cause you see the cars, the jewels and the crib
Every day I wake up and ask myself who the fuck you think you is
This is not a movement y'all, it's more like a takeover
I been gone but the boy back home, the waits over
It's nothing, I just stay focused
So get your pens and pads out and take notes to the rap version of Beethoven

[Chorus]</pre>
