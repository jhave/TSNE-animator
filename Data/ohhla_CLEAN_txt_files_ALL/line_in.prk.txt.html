Song:   A Line in the Sand
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind, like every other time
But little did we know...

Today, I look for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came, like fire from below
Your greed led the call
My flag had to fall
But little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
And face your fraud
You're gonna give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

I ain't never been a coward
I ain't never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
Couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
Or you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling
Yeah! You are gonna get yours!

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
And face your fraud
You're gonna give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
You're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine!

Give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine, give me, give me back what's mine!
What's mine!
What's mine!
Give me back what's mine!

Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind, like every other time
But little did we know...</pre>
