[Puff]	Yeah, here we go
[Mase]	Uh Uh
	Let's party again, let's party again
	Let's party again, let's party again
[Puff]	Can't be stopped (Uh huh)
	Won't be stopped
[Mase]	Let's dance again, let's dance again
	Let's dance again
[Puff]	Don't know how to stop
[Mase]	Let's dance again
[Puff]	Refuse to stop , All Out, Bad Boy, come on

[Mase]
Yo, everyday I wake up, sick of the homeless 
But other than that I'm a Bentley consumer 
I get pain, yo' I cry like you 
I get sick, I could die like you 
I used to hate my broke days with a passion 
Now when I get big money I stash some 
See a watch I like, I just grab one
Party and bullshit, book trips have fun (Come on) 
Get paid, get money, get dough (That's right)
Get laid, get honeys, get low (Get low)
Platinum status what I live for
Sold four million now I want six more
Never satisfied just like my mom 
With 10 mill' sitting' in the treasury bond
When I roll dice just respect my arm 
You can't put me on the level
Cause I'm level beyond

1 - 	It don't matter what you do to me
	I can handle what you send my way
	No matter what I do today 
	You'll still have something to say 

 	It don't matter what you do to me
	I can handle what you send my way
	No matter what I do today 
	You'll still have something to say 

I be M.I.A and M.I.A.M.I 
So am I the kid who be so appealing
Live a lifestyle so revealing
Love them M&amp;M's, the multi millions
So y'all could spit it out, me I live it out
Y'all cats lay away a month then get it out
I'm the first cat in the club all izzy-ed out
Rock iceburg when you thought it was Mickey Mouse
So sit me, I'm pourin' Cris to the curb 
All I got to do is just give a chick a word
Her whole team, you will see a chick with a bird 
Messing with Mase you'll get what you deserve (That's right)
A buck 50, nah, take a buck 60 
Extra 10 good for thinking they can mess with me (Uh)

Repeat 1

Yo, you the type in the movies cuddled up 
With a groupie hang by, buttered up
I ain't getting with you, yo' love her in her gut
That's the reason why you can't even bubble up (Come on)
You get your team and huddle up 
And come back with enough cream to Double Up
Until then I'mma still be here cooking 
Anything I'm pushing, 20 G's a cushion (Uh)
Why prove this kid is the smoothest
When there's people that pay me to do this
Pretty color cars is what we cravin'
Six star tele's is what we stayed in (That's right)
Any man with me must be made men
We just buy cars, we don't trade in (Nuh uh)
I don't need ten statements see what I'm saving
No need for a manager I need an agent (Let's go)

Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

(Come on, come on, come on)
