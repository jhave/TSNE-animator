(Juicy J)
Should I 
Come with a style that you niggaz love
Gangstas on that green and that white 
Buckin in the club showin love 
To the Kaze clique
Cause we in this bitch
Juicy J and Paul got some sounds that'll make a thug rich
Stickin to the plan 
Mayn I'm pervin off this hennesee
North Memphis South Memphis
Orange Mound Tennessee 
One Town
On this one fool
We in our own world
Eight golds in the mouth
Chevy thangs
New gold pearls
Runnin round and round
Niggaz can be walkin star shit
Fuck with those who only down with me
And we aint barn shit
Tickin like a bomb
Full off ammo 
And I'm gonna let it go
On the fuckin way 
On trick that think he betta flow
Throwin up yo sigh
If you feel you aint the best
Watch what you do
We shoot to kill you betta have yo vest
Chasin other nuts
When the glued to you like some glass
Soldiers try to stuck
All the blood trick up out yo ass

(Chorus)

(Scan Man)
Yeah 
It don't stop nigga
Kick yo feet 
Throw your arms in the street
In the club 
Nigga what
It don't matter where you from 
Southside Northside Westside Eastside
Down to start a fuckin riot if any bustas wanna try 
Hoody Hoo 
Yeah bitch
Creapin with that heep of breeze
It's the Killa Klan with the mike inside they hand
Yeah all we want's to do is get buck
Tear Da Club Up with the Mafia
Sense prophet posse hypnotize runnin this
With the third world thugs 
And they buck with the devil clique
They said 
Cause the Kamakaze's movin the crowd
Gettin them loud 
Gettin them pumped
Cause the Kaze with the microphone
That will bust your fuckin ear drum 
Make you silly suckas wish you neva came to get some
Fo this
Memphis killa nigga figga figga 
Makin you move 
Move a Muthafucka

(Chorus)

(Mc Mac)
We Killa Klan 
Killa Klan fear no muthafuckin man
Watch these niggaz get buck
Representin they sets by they hand
We Memphis bound on you clowns that be tradin that shit
You think you buck 
But you aint buck
They the ones in our clique
So take a hit catch yo hi
Throw yo hood up in the sky
Start a riot with the other side
If them bitches wanna fry
If you got it 
It don't matter
Shouldn't fucked with Mc Mac
Kaze thugs show no love
When we armed and ready to attack
Hoe ass nigga in the club up shootin now
Lettin you other cities know
The originators of this game
Well we came straight from Memphis
Full of pimpin and them drugs
Well with the glocks on us and start a fight up in the club
Don't give a fuck if you with the Kaze on the dancin floor
Got these local DJ's hatin don't wanna start no more
If you hear it then you fell it 
If you snooze you just loose
Killa Klan and Prophet Posse making muthafucka's move</pre>
