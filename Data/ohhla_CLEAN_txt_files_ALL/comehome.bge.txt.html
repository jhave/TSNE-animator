[Big Ed]
Throw your hands up if you gettin down tonight
Throw your hands up if you gettin freaky tonight

Now don't be shy see you twirkin over there baby
The way you bouncin work your hips drives a man crazy
Now you can get real freaky still be a lady
So bring it over here, over here, right here baby
I see you slide across the floor with that look in your eye
I'm tryin to get to the center of your creamy thighs
Cause I'm a playa, I do what the playas do
Why don't you come by my house and bring your homegirls too
So we can have a pool party, bikini's and skins
Alazay's, moet, who got the hen
Let the party begin, all over your body
Rowdy rowdy party, everybody gettin naughty

[Big Ed (Mo B. Dick in background)]
(Can you come home with me)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Yeah, you come home)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Can you come home with me)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Yeah, you come home)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight

[Mr. Serv-On]
Say that, I like that, you know that I want that
Believe that, in fact you know me
Mister hit em up, I love to get em up
Baby doll if it's personal between us, 
hold your breath, I might lick em up
Sike, hold your flesh tight when I approach ya
Lil Kim couldn't coach ya, leave you with your legs shakin
I love slicin cake, take it blow my candles
Don't let the handle on my S-4 provoke ya
I'm like Oscar De La Hoya
Boxin in your water like Biggie Smalls
After tonight, you wanna have my baby
But slow your roll lady
And ride the tank, I'm a do what he can't

[Big Ed (Mo B. Dick in background)]
(Can you come home with me)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Yeah, you come home)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Can you come home with me)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight
(Yeah, you come home)
Do you wanna come home with me tonight
Get down, get freaky with me tonight

[Big Ed]
We can do it in multiple positions
I'll outscrew any other competition
Beat it up like a boxer in submission
Leave you lyin like you need a mortition
Bring your girlfriends hun, I got plenty to go around
I wear hundred bone, got beats by the pound
Aint no use in frontin cause you already know
Your homegirl told you, I'm a actual pro
I love you long time cause I'm on the ginsing
We get on the floor after we bust the bedsprings
I'll make you sing, orgasmic screams
And when your fantasies, I'll fullfill your dreams
