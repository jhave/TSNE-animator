Typed by: Lbwnumba1fan@aol.com

My Name is 
B-O-W
This one goes out to everybody all around the world
Dog to dog
Girl to girl
I need yall to help me spell my name

[Chorus]
B, Bad
O, Outstanding
W, everybody know I'm the wickedest
Wow, that's what the girls all scream when I pop up in the screen, and 
proceed to get down

[Verse 1]
Ha ha, doggy bag
Everybody listenin'
Beats still pumpin
and mickey still glistenin
Around here we take ballin around to the next step
On them 22's back seat in the concept
I take full responsibility of infire
I wont stop rockin till I retire
I'm so in the mix, so so sick
I know just what to do, that's why they so in love with the
B, bow
O, outstanding
W, everybody know I'm the wickedest
Wanna get close, so they can kick it how I'm kickin this
hat to the back, pants down low 
Gotta keep it G-H-E-T-T-O, huh
Uh, I been with Destiny, Jessica, Madonna
I'm at the tippy top, and I ain't never going under
1 shot nail it, now every body spell it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ya chain might be thick, but mines is more thicker
might know how to run. but I'm a whole lot quicker
Got so many ways to you, it's a shame to me
And ain't none of yall out that can hang with B
Young, old, I don't care what you is
The name of your label, or the place you live
You betta recognize a real dyme when you see one
Sippin on a shirly, hollerin at your girly
One full pocket stay fatty
And I take it to the house so much they call me young Trick Daddy
And that's how it is when you dealing with a dog
I might lick you in your face, or bite your head off
After death I'm the under boss ain't no secret
Got everything lock and that's how we gonna keep it
Bandaned up, braided, still actin a fool
Ha, still the hottest thing in high school, I'm the

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I came through the door blazin
Hotter than them California raisins
Back in them dayz when they was a lick
My money play is to hit you with the down and out
Look around everybody tryna go my route
And I don't drop no duds, I only drop burners
The game is mine, and I don't even gotta learn it
Can't drive but I can keep a party live
Both folks say I remind them of the Jackson 5
Cause I only make hits
While yall make record
I'm the deli as the homie with the full blown package
Cant leave your girl around me
Cuz I'm a true playa for real ask my homie JD
I'm the

[Chorus]</pre>
