[Mike Jones]
I'm back on the track, I'm bout to rip it apart
40 carats on my chest froze up my heart
I'm Mike Jones, Who?, Mike Jones Jones
That'll hit the block with all of my rocks and won't leave til' my rocks gone
Lemme slow the beat down
And give you hoes this free sound
Mike Jones, Fat Bastard and Tum-Tum we now
About to take the game over
Change lanes in a Range Rover
They say my trunk drunk cuz my 5th had a hang-over
T-Fast and Magno
Pullin' up in that jag slow
Double T behind me, freakin' all the jazzy hoes
Hold up, where Big Tuck?
He pullin' up candy buck edition, flippin' Expedition
Stack it up and leave slimy sluts
D-Town, hold it down
Holly Hills, after clown
Well Who Is Mike Jones, my solo album comin' round
George Lopez, DSR
SwishaHouse we up to par
We on the scene, lookin' clean
Droppin' screens, sippin' bar
Who Is Mike Jones?, that's the name of my album
I ain't got gold lil mama I got platinum
Big Watts, he make the beat chop
My 4 18's hit the block and made our hearts drop
Mike Jones for the summer
I might flip 4 Runner or a Hummer
I shine like Baby but I ain't a #1 Stunner
I keep it real, you ain't know?
I use my skills to get dough and pay bills, you ain't know?
And that's real

[Chorus](Repeat 2x)
Cuz we grippin' grain, switchin' lanes
Fuckin' hoes and stackin' change
DSR and SwishaHouse if you ain't know we off the chain
We on the scene, lookin' clean
Sippin' lean, droppin' screens
DSR and SwishaHouse that's what I call a perfect team</pre>
