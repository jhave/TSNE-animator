[Verse 1]
Niggaz try stoppin me fulfill him like a prophecy (oh yes)
While them hoes watchin me and while them hoes jockin me (what yall hoes want)
Feds tried to rocket me and knock me out properly (they said BAM!)
I was on a robbery my gat sung operaly
500 dollar bill teach 'em bout Monopoly
Mansion wit the bed in it models lay on top of me
Niggaz tried droppin me them slugs bounced off of me
Murder niggaz softly the judge still walkin me
Hoes get chunked off bitches can't talk to me
Catch a nigga crossin me they gotta get the law for me
26 possibly I sang to 'em gossiply  (oh Lord)
I'mma die awesomely with grands on the top of me
Mockin me I'll turn ya chest into podomy (blaow blaow!)
Everything mafia growin up Gotti G
Four 15's in the trunk I got a lotta beat
How could these niggaz be Dro? They don't know how to be

[Chorus] 2X
Dro (niggaz swear they know about)
Dro (What they say they smokin man)
Dro (hey I think y'all niggaz playin)
They don't really know about they don't really know about
Dro

[Verse 2]
First I let my chain glow y'all know how that thang go
Put them colors in my rims now Im ridin rainbow
Hood nigga fuck 'em all I'm at Charlie train po'(???)
Orange Daytona me and Kuntry ridin mango
Umbrellas pop out the Phantom do' when it rain though
Polo that fresh like I'm Carson but I ain't lame though
NIggas say I'm fly wit the rappin but I can sang though
What you know bout Hightower Ridge and Delmar Lane though
Tech jump out when I'm bustin but I can aim though
Make a hundred thou if you touch it you get yo brains blowed
M&amp;M Regal the fuck is you in my lane fo'
Nigga you don't see these goons and what they bring war
Water paint Chevy lil buddy said thats my rain car
800 Benz lil cuzz this ain't the same car
Danger anger Herne  Home ranger
I was sellin dope before Jesus was in a manger

[Chorus] 2X
Dro (niggaz swear they know about)
Dro (What they say they smokin man)
Dro (hey I think y'all niggaz playin)
They don't really know about they don't really know about
Dro

[Verse 3]
Dro you can smell me sell me hail me
Nigga come short on that gram you gotta scale me
Young Dro postseason wit bald head L be
Right by auntie Rachel where Teetee and me and Lanelle be
Y'all ridin 24's I ride February
28 inches try to jack and you'll get buried
12 gauge shell heat I ??? don't like to bury
Knock a nigga teeth out his mouth for the tooth fairy
Baskin Robbins paint on my Chevy my whip berry
50 bricks shawty man we blew them thangs every week
Last week my Cutlass was blue but it change every week
I be in the club brand new in that thang every week
Haters in the club I shoot two of them lames every week
Y'all game very weak ain't nothin you can tell me
Pull up in a pearl V they be like "how the hell he
sittin up in the Phantom on Simpson eatin a 12 piece?"
Thats

[Chorus] 2X
Dro (niggaz swear they know about)
Dro (What they say they smokin man)
Dro (hey I think y'all niggaz playin)
They don't really know about they don't really know about
