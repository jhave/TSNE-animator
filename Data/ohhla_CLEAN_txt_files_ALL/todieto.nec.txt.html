[Verse 1]
Ya dead kid, now ya just meat for preperation
Ya brain smeared all over the street like defecation
Pull a gun out on a star
Ya ain't to famous on Hollywood boulevard
Ya get run over by a car
Big saws the size of the teeth of Jaws
Chop you into jig saws, pop you with a sig saw
Starin at death like a 9-11 jump
Or Anti-Christ superstar
Drop the spine of a Reverend in a dumpster
Brutal accidents, and axes leaving dents
In ya skull commiting access to ya mendula fragments
A bullet rushes at ya like a pirahna to kill
And the slug cuts clearly threw ya skull like Dahmer's grill
You can tell Im satanic from my evil beat selection
Your autopsy's like wall bounce meat section
Kid ya didnt survive a stab to the chest
Unfortunately medical science can't always have success

[Chorus]
Ya don't like listening to death rap, well I do
There's nothing like beautiful music for you to die to
You can't stop pain, how long will cocaine last
A coltrain's blast, will leave you with no brains fast
Dont rap, stab yourself to the beat instead
Dont impress me with your raps, impress me by being dead
I'll be impressed when your bleeding red
Cause atleast you can say you done somethin I havent done yet

[Verse 2]
Trying to be spiritual so you can get closer
You'll have to choke on ya blood so ya can be kosher
Its a fact, everything I put out will come back
Like cats, in the slums with crack, catchin' slugs in the back
Its a cycle and nuff' humans are addicted to the thrill
So now that your fuckin' dead, we need someone new to kill
If I tried to stop rappin like this I couldn't
But if I could I wouldn't
Smash the door down, fuck kickin my foot in
Gamble with ya life, I think ya out of luck
Dont act rugged if ya not, cause when we bring it you'll be fucked
Ya safe in ya crib, with ya organs adjacent to ya ribs
I pump with so much poison, not many more days ya live
You look fucked, you look like you pukin' gook up
It looks like the rest of ya life should suck
When I said it, kid, ya get beheaded with a knife
By the most sadistic mothafucka you ever met in ya life!

[Chorus]
Ya don't like listening to death rap, well I do
There's nothing like beautiful music for you to die to
You can't stop pain, how long will cocaine last
A coltrain's blast, will leave you with no brains fast
Dont rap, stab yourself to the beat instead
Dont impress me with your raps, impress me by being dead
I'll be impressed when your bleeding red
Cause atleast you can say you done somethin I havent done yet

It's beautiful

It's beautiful to demons

*sample*Beautiful music, dangerous rhythm

Death is only cause you fear it, it's beautiful to demons

Stop the pushin, pullin, and screamin

*sample*Beautiful music, dangerous rhythm

Its beautiful

Stop the pushin, pullin, and screamin
death is ugly cause you fear it, it's beautiful to demons

*sample*Beautiful music
