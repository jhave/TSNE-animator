(Intro)
(Shaquille O'Neal &amp; Loon) 
Clockworld
Uh-huh, uh-huh 
Shaq dog, T.W.IsM.
Yeah, Big City yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh nigga
(Heat it up)
Yeah Brick City ya don't stop, uh
Brooklyn ya won't stop
Heat it up
Uptown ya won't stop (wha-wha-wha)
Clockworld ya don't stop
Come on

(Shaquille O'Neal)
My game is tight people know my name ya right
Money I hold and the tight things I like
Name ya price I'm the type that'll change your life 
I got money to persuade your wife 
I'll be in the game seven-one three inch of change
See me I'll be in the range me in the rain
Doin it up on a highway doin the buck
Certain things you can do in a truck
But I hold my water so ya better hold ya daughter
Shaq'll be on her back like news reporter
Crews get slaughter so ya better get the rules in order
Fore you mess around and loose this quarter
It's crush time and I'm tellin you one time 
So therefore your metaphors are punch lines 
Don't hold no weight if you ant got no cape
Shaq is back so don't make no mistakes (heat it up) 
 
(Chorus)
(Nneka Morton)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)

(Loon)
Now I'm holdin things float like poles in spring
Flash cash like Golden rings 
I'm about to show you things y'all ain't even seen before 
Cause I ain't ever had no green before
I'll be the ?Leans? George cause my life's a thrill
Deputy thrills spent the year in Beverly Hills
Not in the game but anything that's to say my name 
Leave another to burn in the flame
The spot get hot there's more hot than drop
And I cock the glock mess around rock your knock 
Shit has got to stop cause you messing with big shots
Still getting money delivering as zip-lock 
You don't know about the street so keep your lips locked 
Fore I rob you and find out what this chick got, uh
It be a mystery to Albert Hinchcock
You better start fronting and stick to Hip-Hop (HEAT IT UP) 

(Chorus)
(Nneka Morton)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)

(Shaquille O'Neal)
Yo it's plain to see it's not a game to me 
So I'd advise you guys not to play with me 
I'll scheme the plot with the little green I got 
Twenty-six been around the world seen a lot 

(Loon)
Scene is hot cause I just copped the six 
See me in a club straight thug popped the crisp
Pockets thick see me with a flock of chicks
While you in the background there popping sh

(Shaquille O'Neal)
So I gotsta flip on all your new comers
I've been doin my thing for about twelve summers 
So now my crew wonder why I cop two hummers 
Got a new number chicks all over my cucumber 

(Loon)
It ain't loving me down funny how money can pow
Funny style chicks wanna be in love with me now 
All of a sudden got girls rubbing me down 
And haters hate it cause me and Shaq are putting it down

(Chorus w/ variations)
(Nneka Morton)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up) 
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
Heat it up (yeah, playa haters in to give it up)
Hhhhhhheeeeeeeeaaaaatttt it up (I love the way you heat it up)
