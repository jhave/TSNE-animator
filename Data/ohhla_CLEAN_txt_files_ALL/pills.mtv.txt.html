[Man's Voice]
Well the first thing I want to say is:

They say real recognize real
The dollar bill will exercise our ills...E
Frauds is thoroughly camouflaged and fatigued in the field
Be careful who you believe, the pills
Is dealed like flaccid, proceeds go towards the buying of Caprice Classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon stepping off into traffic
Like, check him, tears roll down the eyes
Of the rides inside of a funeral procession
Here lies, with X's in his eyes, the unguided misdirected
Squad cars roll past and laugh

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

They say the streets is a demon in a dress
Wit dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath (UH!)
Scantly clad, no panties, deep throating in an alley
Aging badly in sunglasses she pretty
Slain boyfriend names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinkling greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a Philly
Hennessey tears, ass will bring ya enemy's here
Flirt wit her flaws till you run up in her raw

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears, Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers, a system for a heart
Rap music for beats, heroin for a son and it's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps
Just spies, wit dice in his eyes
Loves life cuz he likes when it dies
Wit a baking soda soul, he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
He knows, he's clever, jealous his house
All the liquor that's poured out, goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet;
Wit prostitutes, pimps, dope dealers and killers tied to it to pull it
A TV in his head, stripper slides down his legs
And he's known to ride around wit feds, and he's out there

[Chorus (Sample)]
Out There
Out There
There
There
There

But, righteousness is a father teaching his kids
That what's better than wealth is the respect in itself (Out There)
A pistol packing old lady standing up to the dope dealers
On the block making sure her presence is felt (Out There)
A teacher teaching that thinking is cool
Listen before you mention "not letting school turn them into fools" (Out There)
Keeping god first, Lupe is here
F-N-F Up, homie I'll see u out there (Out There)</pre>
