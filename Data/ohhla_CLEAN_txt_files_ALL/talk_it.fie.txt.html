Fiend(verse 1):

I'm from the city where they ride around town
Windows half down
Pissed and disgusted ready to blow a half pound
Bodies been to lost and found, around wantin' my crown
Gun shots sounds evil faces and ash mounds
Problems how nigga saw with 38 that revolve
Give a fuck how smaller talk, wouldn't go through it all..bitch!!!
I'm dirty as I wanna be and nobody harming me
Honey, money, got ...these niggas steadly swarming me
When the fuck will my hustle stop, oh now dog you don't know
Just kill yo-self and invite me to your funeral
I'm microphone charmed, the coldest thing born
Come at me wrong givin' reasons for your family to mourn

Chorus:

Thats why I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The life I live some niggas are scared to walk it

So I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The life I live some niggas are scared to walk it

Verse 2:

I hit the block when the coppers leave
Walking the ghetto passed out marijuana(?) tree
Follow me, going to get a ounce of coki-ana leaves
See the beef(?)
Whats up with cha carin' the boys done started stackin'
Cause all I wanted was money bitches and cars
Cuz I've gone to war, with niggas from different checks and boulevard
Representin' my ward, my brotha's made me hard now
Ain't scared to live or scared to die
Got niggas that been jailed for years
Don't ask me why
I'm 265.....For the pride, niggas are rimmed high
And screaming killa you could see it in my eye
My kind don't testify, get on the stand and cry
I bring it were u lie, keep a bitch for an aliby

Thats why I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The life I live some niggas are scared to walk it

So I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The life I chose some niggas are scared to walk it

So I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The life I live some niggas are scared to walk it

So I talk it like I bring it
Bring it like I talk it (whomp)
The path I chose some niggas are scared to walk it</pre>
