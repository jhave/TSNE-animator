[Lil' Troy]
Lil' Troy, a superstar, choppin rocks on your block
Representin Shortstop!
Sellin rocks, oh, see four point gold
Shortstop, double platinum SOLD!
Tell my momma, she don't have to work no mo'
I pay the bills by the flow from the studio
And I was out in the game by old players and G's
Hollerin 50 G's, LP's to CD's

"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"So raise up off of me, I'll show 'em I'm a dope man"
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Boy they're fuckin with me Troy man I done told em.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Nobody crosses me, especially in this dope game.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"You try to school me you'll get served, with no regard" -&gt; Scarface

[Yungstar]
Uh-uh, excuse me, remember me?
And I be swangin and bangin biggin and bangin with the E and G
And as for Yungstar, I've been in the game
I've learned the game I've peeped game now I'm get a 50-a mayne
to rollin riches, the G is licksin, for a lil rotation
Don't need it for the placement
They call me tyke ignition, in a blizzard, Shortstop baby
They can't fade me, talkin Mercedes
That's how we ride, SouthSide nigga
How the fuck you figure?  We some H-Town bout it type niggaz
Leavin this bitch, sick, three piece pitch, hittin licks
overseas, overseas, with bricks, trick

"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Boy don't test me I'm gettin tired of teachin lessons.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"So motherfuck you and that bullshit you stressin.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"South Park, night falls, over the streets.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Boy they're fuckin with me Troy man I done told em.." -&gt; Scarface

[Lil 2-Low]
Peep game, peep game, straight 'caine
Feelin five and thirty-six, huh, I can't explain in mayne
I never use lower, to blow the dope up, to be load up
The girls show they ASS when I roll up
in Benzoes, five double-oh, you never knew
the trunk fizzo, I carry it on the low-low
like the cheese, from the F-E-D

[Lil Will]
So I'm back up on the streets, slangin G's
Over the years, I stacked mo' G's than trees grow leaves
I've been in the industry, since nine-three
My so-called dogs, haven't paid me no royalties
Lord please, SouthSide G's from fo's to threes
Cook up ki's, watchin out for the enemies
They can't fuck with me, I'm a ??
Straight up G, cleaners keep me creased
Middle finger to police, Grim Reap meets to slay the beast

"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"So motherfuck you and that bullshit you stressin.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Shit ain't nothin but the money flow in this camp.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"So watch your back and prepare for the hit man.." -&gt; Scarface
"I started small time, dope game, cocaine.." -&gt; Scarface
"Pushin rocks on the block, I'm never broke mayne.." -&gt; Scarface

[Yungstar]
Get yo' paper, watchin out for them haters
Dressin up in gators, takin flights to Vegas
Rollin Navigators, on the seven acres
I'm a money maker dough baker bitch breaker
never ever be a faker, try to make a hit like Anita Baker
In the rap, in the dope game, tryin to make some hits mayne
Fo' sho', gotta let the people know how the game go
Shortstop break a bitch and gotta let the world know
Who back with the tracks, I guess I'm the junior mack
Hell yeah, I'm rollin 'llac, Shortstop paper stack</pre>
