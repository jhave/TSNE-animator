(oohh, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah, oh oh) 
2000, Jon B y'all, N-A-S y'all
To the death y'all (ay baby)
Come on, get it right

Look at them brown nosin'
My click pullin up with purple roses
Purple diamonds, pinky rings, purple douja
Heaven had to mold'er, look at the earth she bangin
Gucci purse, wonderin what ghetto that she came from
She gangstah, from her head to her feet
By birth I'm a soldier, bet the pearl come sweet
And I felt the world wet when we met
She felt like, somethin i'd never forget
Somethin you had to witness, perfect physical fitness
Alerted all my five senses, I said my name is Nas love
And whos the girl next to ya, this my man boogotti
I'd like to introduce ya

[Jon B] (Nas)
Well if I wasnt alive
somethin we feel just might be real if we try, if we try baby
I know I'm giving you love, but is it really enough for you to be satisfied?
Whoa, yeah. you always know that you're beautiful
Do you see the beauty that I see inside, (do you see it baby) inside you
Somethin I wanna do, is travel the world to find the girl for sure was you 
(all around the world, til' I found you baby girl)
Where can I show you the finer things, the finer things in life
The finer things in life baby, all for you
Mami just you and i, hit you with some love tonight
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
But if I want some your life, everything you want to feel is real in my mind
Got your own mind, like making love to you right
Your body's telling everything I need to do it tonight, oh no, whoa
Baby, they said that you could stay a long time
Please say that you could spend another night, with me
What up with the house on the beach?
You gonna sip a little apple martini
I want you to just lay back and let me freak (uh uh, how it feel baby)
Your insecurities

[Nas] (Jon B)
If I was ya man, your knowledge would expand til we both the equal
Chillin on islands where the sand and the ocean is deep blue
Theres three things that I got on my list
You qualify, you my miss, I count em down like this
Number one, you gotta be real (yeah babe), dont lie to me about managomy (yeah babe)
See hun' get out of my grill, love me, if I'm locked up or I'm out on the peel (feel me babe)
Keep it tight when I'm in it (ooh yeah), ask me how does it feel
Number two, easy to do, be who you are
Be with me a real G (you got, yoou got), with every beat of your heart
And number three, last but not least
Give me peace, and ill show you the world most girls aint lucky to see
Jon B!

[Jon B] (Nas)
What if show you the finer things, the finer things in life
Mami just you and i, everybody needs love, hit you with some love tonight
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
What if show you the finer things, the finer things in life (would you like it, like that girl)
Mami just you and i, everybody needs love, hit you with some love tonight
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
(Like it if I lay you on your back girl, would you like it if you do it from the top girl?)
(Would you like it if you do it from the side girl?, could we do it in my ride girl?)
(Could we do it on the floor, to the bath-tub, on the studio, could we do it in the pool?)
Mama just you and I (could we do it in the ocean, could we do it in some projects?)
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
(Could we do it in the motel, could we do it in the shower)
Make you say ooohh ohhh ohh
(Could we do it in the rolce royce, on top let you ride girl, cuz you my girl, you a fine girl)
I'll make you say ooohh ohhh ohh
Hit you with some love tonight, hit you with some love tonight
Make you say ooohh ohhh ohh, oooh, ohh oohhhhhh..
(Just you and I baby, just you and I baby, hit you with some love tonight)
(Baby girl, imma hit you with some love tonight, could we do it)
(Show you finer things, you forget about the minor things)
(Can I show you, can I show bout the finer things, forget about the minor things)</pre>
