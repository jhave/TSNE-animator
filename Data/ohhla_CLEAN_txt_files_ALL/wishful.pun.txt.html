[Chorus]
[Fat Joe]    What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Kool G Rap] Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
[Big Pun]    First I get the money then I get the power
[B-Real]     B-Real of the hill eliminate the guitars

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Thinkin' of takin' a plane 
to take a flight out to the red light
and smuggle 10 pounds of weed
make it home tonight
be the number 1 smuggler in the area
got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier
erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated 
state to state and over seas gettin' faded
buddah king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
niggaz lets get high in the sky hit the blunts
and the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggaz don't stop
fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board
yo what would you do if the world was yours.

[Chorus]
[Kool G Rap] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Big Pun]    Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[B-Real]     First I get the money then I get the power
[Fat Joe]    Joey crack twist the caps enemys I devour

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yo it's only a dream 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's
lying penance with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with avengances
having blocks on in the lava parts dome
my mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep
but momma single be mastera heater on city streets
in the east I be known as Don Cartegena
claimin' the (?) like (?)
lacin' the china wit Menida
to seller need repeater or be a leader 
like a preacher or presume a steeper
peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons
come on I be the top extortionist 
adopt adopted foster kids right out the muthafuckin' orphanage
yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof 
all my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth.

[Chorus]
[Big Pun]    What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[B-Real]     Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Fat Joe]    First ya get the money then you get the power
[Kool G Rap] G Rap bustin' the gats slangin' last by every hour

[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
No doubt, 
I be the crime story of all ghetto territorys
soldiers at war be blowin' up niggaz like glory
with pharmasoticle lavatorys
major to chemistry, PHD in streetology
degree in drug industry
combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
rest it through molecules scatter 
launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
mind bitin' an arm starts a crime
G equals and MC dat aint near the square son I gets mine
but yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
and holy steel, a nigga keep it real
you know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab
I got's to have, stack all the cabbage
from constructin' a drug traffic
police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in
Aramians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
this flame of fury to the D-A and the jury 
100 grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man.

[Chorus]
[B-Real]     What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
[Fat Joe]    Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
[Kool G Rap] First ya get the money then you get the power
[Big Pun]    Big Pun's the same son bustin' my guns for the Dollars

[Verse 4: Big Pun]
Yo, I'm walkin' waters
spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs
idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the guards
be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol
pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'm out the pitfalls of life entice with nickle plated nine
it seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare 
[Fat Joe: Hell Yea!] I wish I could, I wish I could
never forget this whole damn world aint shit I'm just a hood
yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
and physical abuse, give her back her best years
grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content
repent and vow she be forgiven 
how could we be proud to live in a world 
which condems man, child, to women
child to women.</pre>
