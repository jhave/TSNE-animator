"This one is hot and shizzling!"

Dilla
(Verse 1)

Get up in it....(What!)
Start her up....(What!)
Get her washed dogg, primiarmourup! (What!)
Big wheels, cadillac grilled up...(What!)
Keep your Esc cause daddys got the Dilla....(What!)
Custom, plus them.....(What!)
22's but you say whats them? (What!)
3rd row, square 10's.....(What!)
I let the bass hit so they wear in...(What!)
So loud,(What!) roll out....(What!)
Tint the windows with the of hydro cloud..(What!)
Big trucks, best when its cold out....(What!)
Hear me pulling up in front of yo' house....(What!)
When I hops in, it gets to choppin'
All jeep nigga's keep it knockin'......(What!)

Dilla
(Verse 2)

(What!)

Yea, come alive nigga's, ugh

Better get my nuts , my sac...(What!)
Whether in my truck, my pad...(What!)
My live thug nigga's no what I mean...(What!)
A live bitch thats what I need...(What!)
And I ain't about to spend no money on her...(What!)
Nothing mo' than a hundred on her....(What!)
To the stripper and runnin on her.....(What!)
In a minute I'll be cummin on her....(What!)
Thats it... like that quick...(What!)
