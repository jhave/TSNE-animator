[Intro - Classified - talking]
Let's show 'em how we do it
What?
Come on, let's go

[Chorus 1 - Scratched Samples] - w/ ad libs
"We do it our way"
"Each and every day"
"Y'all know my occupation, I'm puttin in the work"
"Neck snappin back and forth, 'bout to break that shit"
"Bre-break that shit"

"We do it our way"
"Every single day"
"Y'all know my occupation, I'm puttin in the work"
"Neck snappin back and forth, 'bout to break that shit"
"That's to show you how nice I am"

[Verse 1 - Classified]
In a matter of rhyme (yeah), I step out and shatter your spine
Half of the time, I spit just to rattle your mind
Laugh at your kind with your weak battle design
You must be out of your mind like tryin to travel through time
I'm too much for comfort, too much for one word
Can't be described, so I'm stayin Classified, get it?
I'm over your head kid and I'm ready to deport you
You like George Bush, your own country don't support you (haha)
I get ridiculous, sick with it, you can't see? Picture it
Do it with no guarantees, it's hit or miss
Run off initiative, I don't dream, I'm livin it
My whole mind frame, there ain't a chance you can get with it
My last album, how am I supposed to top it?
Only problem with it was not enough people copped it
If it's hard kid (then follow logic), support the project
Big up to all the heads who heard my product and actually bought it
I'm white trash, bald head, skinny, pot head
With a love for this rap game until the day I drop dead
You hand fed MCs are gettin ran out
So go back to the drawing board, draw another plan out

[Chorus 2 - Scratched Samples] - w/ ad libs
"We do it our way"
"Each and every day"
"Y'all know my occupation, I'm puttin in the work"
"Neck snappin back and forth, 'bout to break that shit"
"That's to show you how nice I am"

"We do it our way"
"Every single day"
"I'm puttin in the work"
"Neck snappin back and forth, 'bout to break that shit"
"That's to show you how nice I am"

[Break - Man - talking]
And there is but one man
A man who has won more battles than he has fought
A man who has the confidence of his people

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Go easy on emotion
This kid break beats on backs with backup to battle everybody boastin
on my coast, I'm still fresh as hell, of course I know the ropes
You can take the safe route, I'll keep puttin tapes out
But don't show your face (no!), from Vancouver to Saint John's
I still make songs for these haters to hate on
It's hip-hop and everybody got a cocky attitude
If you ain't let 'em know, no one else'll do it for you
And this is straight true (yo)
Everybody want to step but hold your breath there ain't no way you gon' play Luke
I stay in plain view, out of sight (then out of mind)
So I'm stayin busy 'cause I'm quickly runnin out of time
And I ain't the star type, I don't have the 'it' factor
Ain't a pretty boy, I'm a beat maker and sick rapper
I'll flip the game backwards and change the guideline (back up)
It's my time, so watch Classified shine
(Canada), step up, come on we know it's past due
We need to make a permanent mark on this game like tattoos
So slow your roll, you ain't ready for the cold
You ain't ready for this enemy endin your whole flow

[Chorus 2] - w/ ad libs

Two thousand and (*screech*)
"That's to show you how nice I am"</pre>
