(C-Murder talking)
Ya'll niggas know one thing out there
This rap game is just like the dope game
P told ya watch your friends
But i'm tellin' ya to um

(Chorus 2x)
Watch your mother fuckin' enemies
And you might live a long time
Watch your mother fuckin' enemies
Stay strapped cause the ghetto is so wicked now

(C-Murder)
I watch my mother fuckin' enemies, even watch myself
I know these niggas wanna test me, but it's bad for they health
My motto is, if you ain't TRU
Then why the fuck you up on me
I can tell by your look that your bitch ass is phony
My brother said C you know these niggas gonna test ya
But only real TRU niggas don't crack under pressure
Ever since I could remember I been TRU to da game
And now the mother fuckin' media wanna know where I got my name
I'll start it off bitch, I ain't even rap tight
I smoke weed all day and sell dope at night
No Limit Soldier tatted on my arm best believe
Cause if it's life or death nigga, somebody gonna bleed
I got a tank full of hard niggas, from front to end
But still I watch my enemies, and I watch my friends

(Chorus 2x)

(Magic)
I been hustlin' from the beginning makin' cash to a million g's
I hope you niggas feel me
See every time I step on the scene I hear you niggas call me
Jealous cause you like my style you bitches wanna ball with me
But I trust no nigga, whether he's friend or foe
Not tryin' to step on no toes just let you bitch niggas know
My adversaries have died for fuckin' around with me
I know you niggas can't believe that I got C-Murder down with me
Boss niggas so believe there could be no tighter crew
No TRUer 2, they gotta kill me to fuck with you
I'm an assassin known for kickin' ass
Show me who them niggas are, and watch me start blastin'
It's Mr. Magic, known for causin' havoc
As long as i'm on your side, see there's no need for panic
I got your mother fuckin' back for eternity
So when you slippin' i'm watchin' all your enemies

(Chorus 2x)</pre>
