Get outta your mind!!
Fuck that shit, get outta your mind!!
Get outta your mind!!
Get outta your mind!!
Get outta your mind!!
Fuck that shit, get outta your mind!!

[Lil' Jon]
I'm a semi truck, no fuckin brakes
Outta control like a bull out the gate
Get drunk, I'd get the FUCK out the way
We get bananas like a group full of apes (HOO!)
I done lost it, you flossin
I'm over here with my niggaz in a mosh pit (YEAH!)
Throwin elbows, scuffin shell-toes
IS THAT NIGGA DEAD?! Who the FUCK knows!!
Shake them dreads like a motherfuckin rasta
Go dumb like a motherfuckin monster
You an imposter, you drinkin water
We drinkin Patron and takin it wit vodka

[Interlude]
...FUCK IT!

I DON'T GIVE A FUCK! FUCK IT!
...FUCK IT!

...FUCK IT!
LET'S - FUCKIN' - LOSE IT!!

[Chorus]

[Redfoo] (Lil' Jon)
Grab that bottle (WHAT?!) Twist that cap (WHAT?!)
Hold it in the air then tip it back
I'm drunk as hell (WHAT?!) I'm on Patron
I really don't dance {BUT I'M IN THE ZONE}
MOVE, BITCH~!!! Get out the way
I'm runnin over niggaz like a runaway train
I grab my beer, you do the same
SHAKE THAT SHIT and MAKE IT RAIN!!!

[Interlude + Chorus]

[Sky Blu] (Lil' Jon)
Flip cup, tip cup, beer pong, SHOTS

Bar-ten-der, gimme whatcha got! (WHAT?!)
I'm dancin on the table like a nigga smokin rocks!
HAH - Get OFF me!!
I'm checkin motherfuckers like a nigga playin hock-ey
Yeah, I'm in the penalty box
I FUCKED up, I'm takin TOO MANY SHOTS!!!

[Interlude + Chorus]
