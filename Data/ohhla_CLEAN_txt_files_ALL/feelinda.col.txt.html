Two, three, four
When I walk up in the club they watch me stroll
Hey Mr. DJ, do you got that Paula Cole
Oh, I'm so sure, it's gon' rock
Give me these knots and make sure it's under rocks
Now, I'm gon' drink till I'm drunk
And if you say please then I'm a give you what you want
Get on your knees like you bout to marry me
Then open your mouth and let me see what you're about

You make me feel like a sticky pistil, leaning into the stamens
You make me feel like a mister sunshine himself
You make me feel like splendor in the grass while we're rollin'
Damn skippy baby
You make me feel like the Amazon's runnin' between my thighs

You make me feel love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
You make me feel love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

You make me feel like a candy apple, all red and horny
You make me feel like I wanna be a dumb blonde
In a centrefold, the girl next door
And I would open the door and I'd be all wet
With my tits soaking through this tiny little t-shirt that I'm wearing
And you would open the door and tie me up to the bed

You make me feel love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
You make me feel love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Lover I don't know who I am
Am I Barry White, am I Isis, oooh
Lover I'm laced with your uncoscious
Ooh baby
I will be your Desdemona, ahh

[Missy]
I know you wanna tie me to the bed, I'm feelin' nice
It's gettin' hot from the spot that you touch
Boy yeah I'm horny and I need a bag of ice
So I can cool off cause I'm feelin' a bit much
When you kiss my back somethin' make me feel stiff
And I got the liquor so you drink more than a sip
Cause when you take me to the sky up above
You make me feel the wind and I make you feel this love</pre>
