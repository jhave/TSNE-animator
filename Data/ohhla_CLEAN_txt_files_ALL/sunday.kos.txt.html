[Chorus]
Everyday is Saturday night, but I can't wait for Sunday morning, Sunday morning

[Verse 1]
It's the same thing, back in the cold
People know people come and go it bores me
Same thing
Seems like I'm trapped in the world where the servants they serve time
Time waits on no man
So when people fall like me
I

Chorus (2X)

[Verse 2]
Walking down blocks
Pictures don't stop
Pictures inside my dome
This is not me
I'm just afraid to be here all alone
Hurry up, wait
Quit it don't stop
I'm drowning in the self
This is not me
Where is my revolution, but
If you want to own me
I am not concerned
If you follow me
I know that I can learn
You might be the greatest thing I've ever seen
All I know is music
All, All I've ever known

Chorus (2X)

(Let's go! 4X)

Chorus (3X)
