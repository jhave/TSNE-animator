I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player
Yes, yes

I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player

Yea, you dealin with a nigga that never gave a fuck
Play the game, try your luck, I'm comin for bucks
Talk shit to the God, you can catch the bus
I got real nigga blood, what you lack is trust
Seein is believing, I back it up
Keep dope, stash it up
Niggas don't know I keep the pack
I'm smacking up
Check this, a swag you up

Yea, the war been started, actin up
Niggas know I tax you up, put lean in the cup
Treat my bitches like grapes, turn em to wine
Got bitches on my line, gon love they God
Can you survive a train? Laid back in the survivor game
Niggas, can you survive my lane?

Yea, they came to see me
It's Lil B, never be Beezy

I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player
Yes

I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player
Yes

Glassface

Gangsta ass niggas do gangsta shit
I donated money to them cancer kids
Livin for that knowing, mack in the spil ho'in
Somebody gon show him
I turned somebody to a legend
I see what you can't see
Wutchu wanna be?
Niggas know I got dope that's waitin for me
I'm a bully on the block, I'm a take your money
I got served on out, I serve on niggas
Mr. Serve on, 4-5 with the turb on
How you want it? Real shit, I go hard
I got credit in the hood, swipe a gold card
And I gotta pay debit, shoot 'n' text
We'll talk man, fuck the rest
Seen bitches turned fake, that's a fuckin...
I stay with your jewels open
Yea

Dope to the greatest
Come on, yea

I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player
Yes

I'm a snort dope right in front of the mayor
Fuck what you think bitch, I'm a player</pre>
