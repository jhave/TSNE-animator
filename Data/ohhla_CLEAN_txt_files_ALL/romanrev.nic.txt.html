[Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin
I'm startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
RAHHH RAHHH, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzin 
So fuck I look like gettin back to a has-been?
Yeah I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
Ha ha... plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki!" Asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars.. sentencin
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt!
Forced trauma.. blunt
You play the back, bitch I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin it
Nicki Minaj, is who you ain't fuckin with
You lil' braggart I'll beat you with a padded lock
I am a movie, camera block
You out of work, I know it's tough
... But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon 
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Ra-rahhh rahhh, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Eminem]
I ain't into S&amp;M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin pencil for a frame!
You don't like it then peel off bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you slut so wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin, spin the wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie rod
Quit hollerin "Why God?" He ain't got shit to do with it, bygones
will never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin my wad
I ain't finished blowin it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blond white broad
with fake tits and a bad dye job
who just spit in my fuckin face and called me a fuckin tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
and caught her stealin my music, so I tied her arms
and legs to the bed, set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is life's treatin you like dry sod
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why bitch {ask why not}
The world, world, is my punchin bag and
If I'm, garbage you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it!
Like a {rahh, rahh} like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Nicki Minaj]
I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-is this the thanks that I get for puttin you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a Thank You note, you little hoe
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"N-N-Nicki, she just mad cause you took the spot"
W-w-word? That bitch mad cause I took the spot?
Well bitch, if you ain't shittin then get off the pot
Got some niggaz out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear the mumblin, I hear the cacklin
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on ME? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, VROOM, motorbike
Now all my niggaz get buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin me MANNING, Eli (Manninnnnng!)
Ma Ma Ma-Ma-Ma MANNING, Eli (Eliiiiiiiiiiii!)
These bitches callin me MANNING, ELI!

[Eminem]
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make strait-jackets BEND
Yeah, look who's back again bitch, keep actin as if
you have the same passion I have
Yeah right, still hungry my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids {eyelash!}
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's world's clash when {high class} meets {white trash}

[Chorus]

[Outro: Nicki]
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady, what's going on?
They'll lock you away, they'll put you in a jail cell
I promise, take your mother's warning
Roman pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeease
Back to bed, run along
Let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap boys {*echoes*}</pre>
