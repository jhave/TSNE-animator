[Verse 1: Freedom]
It's goin' down
He on fire
Ya'll talkin'
He still walkin'
The nigga's here, so hoes beware
Haters, bustas, betta fuckin' get prepared
Coo Coo's here, to lay it down
The nigga from Milwaukee County lockin' shit down
Wit the Infinite 4-5 niggaz, Big Hank on the sounds
Black Mafia in the mutha fucka holdin' it down BITCH!</pre>
