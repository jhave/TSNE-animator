[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
DJ Kay Slay The Drama King!!!! 
In the hood where I come from, we didn't give a damn about no rockstars!!!
It's about being a blockstar!!!

[Chorus: Ray J] (Plies)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!! (Kay Slay! Kay Slay!! PLIES!!)

[Verse One: Plies]
Growin up, I ain't wanna be no fuckin rock star!
I wanted to be like the d-boy wit the nice car
I wanted a motherfuckin chopper, not a guitar
The biggest thang in my hood is a blockstar
My role model doin 35 years, boy
He wrote me and told me stayin real bring joy
Wit'out the blockstars, where would the hood be?
I don't believe half of that shit I see on TV
The streets and the ol' goons what raised me
Seem like the feds always come when you're on E
The streets fucked up, they took away the loyalty
The music business all fantasy if you ask me

[Chorus: Ray J] (Jim Jones)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
(We hustle for that money, check this out though)

[Verse Two: Jim Jones]
Where I'm from we was taught to blow the cash
We was pullin out knots of money when the photos flashed (Cheese)
Gamblin then re-up on our cars we blow our last
Had a Panoramic Roof screen fallen on the glass (Thunder)
Baby mama screamin how long will it last?! (Fuck her!)
Need to slow down cause I'm goin too fast (Slow.......down)
Too fast summertime doin wheelies (Uh)
Blowin on that Color Purple like my name was Celie (Hey)
Silly, all we did man was hustle for it (Hustle for it)
Stay fly pray to God we not cuffed up for it (Thank You God!)
My man facin time tryin to cop up
I keep thinkin about all the cars that he had hopped out (Jones!)

[Chorus: Ray J] (Busta Rhymes)
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
(You already know Busta Bus got 'em!!!!)

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
While you all busy tryna be Metallica, nigga
I'm in the hood whippin the Battlestar Galactica, nigga!
Smolov the {?} wild lookin shit with insane shine
A spaceship, strange and beautiful at the same time
Breakin them corners while I do the dip up on the cop car
The hood love whenever I pull up on the block, pah
No need to question the dos' that I did
Huggin the block and spreadin the money, a park for the kids
You throw a mil up on the stones, you see how we do them rings?
(You sell drugs?) Who me? NAW, we don't do them things
Now to the block. I bring the Phantoms and the maybachs stay wit 'em
Pull up and park front of ya and let the children play in 'em
Go abroad, international, rep the hood non-stop
Though I proudfully rep my city, I thoroughly rep the block
And I'm probably next to really just come and be blast the pop off
THROW IT UP!! - and let me SEE my fellow blackstars
Yeah!!

[Chorus: Ray J] 
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
This is what we do, this is what we do, from the block to the radio!!!
I'm not a rockstar, I'm a blockstar!!!
