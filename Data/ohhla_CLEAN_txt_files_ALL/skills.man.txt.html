[Verse 1]
See the light or get knocked off
I don't talk a lot
I drop it hot modern day psalmist topping charts
Get me in my comfort at a concert
For child hurts merging in the city clubs and outskirts
Power the verse from the words of God dialoging
Keep walking proceed behind the line of caution
It's just in I heard them men's talking
He ain't the same dude changed afraid he came to pay dues

[Chorus]
It used to be about skills
Now it's about bills
You don't know me and you can't hold me, yo!!!
I'm still true to my game
Where I put my name
No I won't change your all fake 

I wanna run away from where I was found
And bring me one step closer to where I am now
And every time you try, breaking me down
I'm gonna get right back up, and stand my ground

[Verse 2]
I run up in your set with black con's and a skate deck
Throwing hockey pucks blowing speakers and mic check
One, Two, what you gone do when I come through
With a team of crazy Canadians rocking skidoos and snow races
You can call it whatever you like, won't have an affect on your life, Right
Tell me people never listen to the words
Well watch the reaction I get when I drop this verse

[Bridge/Break Down]
Step into this game man, a lot of punches being thrown at you
I've fallen down I don't know how many times, you just got to get
Right back up
Move!!!!

[Chorus]
It used to be about skills
Now it's about bills
You don't know me and you can't hold me yo!!!
I'm still true to my game
Where I put my name
No I won't change your all fake 

I wanna run away from where I was found
And bring me one step closer to where I am now
And every time you try, breaking me down
I'm gonna get right back up, and stand my ground</pre>
