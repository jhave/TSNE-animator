[Lord Finesse]
Y'all sweatin the next man, cause y'all think he's live
Cause the gear he buy, or the car that he drive
He's out your league, meanin not your equal
You're idolizin some knucklehead who can't teach you
So get yours like you first intended
Go out for self, that means be independent
Word up, stop sweatin that brother
I don't think he got his dependin on another
But y'all wanna cling and be under his wing
Brag about his things like his chains and rings
How he's livin fat, buyin this and that
Y'all wit him everday, but y'all ain't makin jack
Y'all gettin played like Nintendo
He's not showin y'all how to be large like him though
You could be PAID, strivin out, gettin things
Hangin with him, you can't afford two chicken wings
You're better off goin out solo
Cause stickin with him, you're not makin no dough
So stop hawkin and holdin out your hand
Get yours -- and stop sweatin the next man

Nowadays, things are lookin critical
Y'all sweatin a brother, females are widdit too
A man that's paid, that's what the females are seekin
That's why they dress up and go out every weekend
No doubt that some of these, females are wannabees
Sweatin every brother with a car over 20 G's
You break your neck, to run after him
He know damn well that you can't do jack for him
He got game, so your head is all psyched
He's the type, to get the sex the first night
So you get with him, you run and tell all your crew
"I love that man!"  Yeah, sure you do
Your intentions was to jerk him and scoop the cash
You didn't know he was too smart for your stupid ass
He knows you're not makin no dough
Wearin the same outfit three weekends in a row
Everytime you see him, you're broke and empty handed
Then wonder why you got fucked and left stranded
Went all out to please and impress him
Now he's gone, you wonder why you can't catch him
Check it out, to end off the segment
You're confused, you fell off - plus you're pregnant!
Got caught out there, that wasn't part of the plan
"Finesse what should I do?"  Stop sweatin the next man

If a person's out your league, then let him go
He might be cool, but you don't have to sweat him though
I don't care if he's drivin, or he dressed GQ
You deserve just as much respect, as he do
What you wanna be - a loaner or a borrower?
Owner or employer?  Leader or a follower?
The next man is not here to help y'all
He can't put you down, you can only make yourself fall
But y'all sweat him cause the shit is down pat
He's livin fat, yeah the brother's all that
Out of all the fish in the sea, y'all think he's the head shark
Y'all sweat him so much, y'all givin his dick stretch marks
So don't sweat him cause y'all think he's a big shot
And stop scheamin on what some other kid got
You could use your skills to gain wealth and respect then
you could be just as large as the next man
Listen to me -- and I'll bet you
when you get paid, the next man'll sweat you
That's today's plan, and tomorrow's move
is to get paid, and make other brothers follow you
And let em know, to take they stand
and get theirs -- and stop sweatin the next man!
