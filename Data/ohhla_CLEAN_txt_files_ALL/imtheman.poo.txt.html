[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah... er'rywhere I go, they be like "AIY-YO!", eh-heh
I be like, "Naw, you ain't talkin 'bout me, right?", ha!
Then they like, "Aiyyo Rapper Pooh, you ain't know?!"
Ha.. yo..

[Rapper Big Pooh]
I done been around the world, been around ya girl
Had her 'round Prince singin "Diamonds and Pearls"
Been around Goose bottles, been around Earl
Been around Jasmine, been around Cheryl
Know a few rappers, one or two actors
Think I'm dyslexic, got that last line backwards
Know a few actors, one or two rappers
It's all entertainment, funny shit, ain't it?
Been around dealers, been around shooters
Been around fiends, been around scenes
Rated X, Rated G, everything in between
But out of few records, been doin my thing
Been in the VIP, been pop bottles
Been throwin money, been knowin models
Been on the major, been independent
Been tryna stack dough and not hafta spend it
 
[Chorus]
I'm just sayin uh, that you the man ("Now you the man!")
I'm just sayin uh, that you the man ("Now you the man!")
That you the man uh, I'm just sayin uh
I'm just sayin uh, that you the man 
("Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man")

[Joe Scudda]
Uh, I done been around weed, been around coke
Been around cats in the hood that sold dope
Been around my folk, mudslingin
Drinkin homemade wine, look how my cuz leanin
Schemin, on the best bitch, cause my next bitch
Don't mean nothin like my ex-bitch
I done been around that psycho, no more issues
Been around more chicks ass than wet tissues
More like maxis, been around more these streets 
than yellow taxis, PLEASE don't pass me
nothin but the good, been around more 
ignorant shit than I should, yes I know that
Still I go back, been around cameras
Somethin like Kodak, tell 'em they can hold that
Been around family, been around jerks
Been around oxys, xanaxs, perc's
HA-HA! I'M FUCKED UP~!!
