Home man.. hey.. let's turn this house into a happy home
This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Let's turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Let's turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw.. look

[2Pac]
Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
it's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 

[2Pac]
Goin through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally got to live the good life, inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 

[2Pac]
Happy home

[singers]
All these problems got me goin
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally got to live the good life, inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Turn this house into a happy home</pre>
