Song:   See It to Believe It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip

Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I'd rather be, not even Oprah's son
Momma's youngest getting paper like the oldest one
We living better guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggaz in hoopty', but we still bag hoes and them
These niggaz give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we doving them
Ass fat so when pinch 'em (pincher) like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What's your name? Where ya from?
Ya got a dream? I'll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won't stop, won't stop
Hey and don't stop
Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

and don't stop
Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

There's so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I'm blessed nigga, I'm blessed
When I'm all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn 'em into poems, they worship, I'm the best
And though I'm taking long, they fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggaz to rest
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)
Unimpressed with you niggaz
You the shit only cause I digested you niggaz
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top

Won't stop, won't stop
Hey, don't stop

Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it</pre>
