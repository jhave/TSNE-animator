Chorus: [x4]
Hold you down
Hold me down
Hold you down
Hold you down
(My people)

Verse One:
You thought I bombed
False alarm
I got charm, no flaw
My flow is sick
Now there's no lip, like Tom Brokaw 
Aww,
You thought I wouldn't be nice but that would be wrong
And maybe, luck you could call it
But I wouldn't respond
A voice like an arm
I speak, I reach and touch you
Shake you for tryin' to sleep
What sheep you up to?
I'm the incredible
Nay thee inedible MC
When they say
"The man's holding it down", they mean me
See we
Dream but stay up
Go as far as your pay stub
But with bars you're smart
Til you're hardly a make up
The space that I take up
Excludes my frame
A wise man knows nothin' and he tries to explain
But y'all don't here me though
Like I walk on my tippy toes
Flow flexible
Limbo with pole really low
People hold hands
Make a big human chain
And I'll tell you where to stand 
So it spells out my name
And I'ma...

Chorus

Verse Two:
I wait like the little pig who built his house brick walls
Niggas say, "Rise, we wanna hear you on some hard shit...pause"
Relax
I beat records
My name is up
Must maintain the cut unless your fame gets rushed
So we Aim
Impact, while you miss the brush
The fight is like fist-a-cuffs
With your wrists in cuffs
I hold me down
So low I go outside
You'll never hear me cry wolf you'll hear the wolf cry Rise (Owww, Rise)
I play, like it's not a game
An indivisible name
Don't cut it short or abbreviate it
Rise, simple and plain
The rhymes
Neither of those, it's hip hop he don't get it
He heard the roof is on fire, ran for the emergency exit
I leave food for thought for my soldiers to munch
In a rush, I had juice and ambrosia for brunch
Get over humps
Hump in front and rap get in that ass
Pass, but you're already lapped
I put grams on my track
And I'ma...
