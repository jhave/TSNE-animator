[Tech N9ne]
Yo, wassup baby?
How you been?
It's been a long time since I talked to you last
I got a question, you still with homeboy?
Y'know homeboy don't matter to me
I'm interested in you baby
We can creep
Y'know what I'm sizzlin'?
Just think about it baby, I'm tryin' to get with you for real

[Chorus] - 2x
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Tech N9ne]
Wassup?
This ya boy Tech Nina
It's good to hear ya, but it's been a minute since I seen ya
Fox demeanor
Gots to dream ya
Cause you stay blocked and locked with hops between ya
I know you got a man
I know you got a little on the side
But I was thinkin if you down for creepin then we can slide
You's a hot one
And you look like you need a top notch one
Ya boy couldn't win it with Johnny Cochran
I know he with you when it's cool
But I'm still tryin to get you to cruise
That ill behind and your lips and your boobs
Come get with a fool
We can take any trip that you choose
Forget that your dude is waitin while you twistin in the nude with this
Boss villian ghetto true mafia
Feel you from here to Czechoslovakia
What's stoppin ya?
I need it and I don't think that I can deal without it
Strictly being real baby tell me what you feel about it

[Chorus] - 2x
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Tech N9ne]
I know you got time with dude and I'm new
But I'mma true
and I'm tryin to get into you
I know he probably give you big love
But I don't trip cause
Dude's cool, I met him at the strip club
Ya he's good for you
He keeps you grounded
While I pound it
Soft and wet is how it sounded
Leave you astounded
From the tongue dancin around it
That's the angle
Search for an angel
and then I found it
Right between those eyes baby
I know it gets heated at home
But your homie Tech Nizzle can hear your cries baby
I know it's hell, I put out fires with this
Got him cussin on your pager and slittin tires and shit
You don't need that
You need positive feedback
Lift you're skirt up and throw you on the counter and eat that
L-E-G's back
Pull it out and I tease that
We release that
Have us a drink and repeat that
What you think?

[Chorus] - 2x
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Tech N9ne]
Yo, yo, check
I need a hardcore chick who can chill
On the rap side
Love, money, and keep her scratch-tied
So when your homeboy don't act right
Just remember my face is a permanent sittin spot for your backside
I'm just tryin to kick it
Make up your mind you want N9ne to stick it
I'm diggin you because you fine and wicked
Don't want to miss it
I'm psycho sick wit it
Dig it
I slop you like a biscuit
and I'll hop ya like a cricket
This is a - decent proposal don't ever hate on it
When I see somethin I want baby I'm never late on it
You ain't gotta answer now you can merinate on it
But before I go I got to throw this serenade on it
It goes
When it rains and when it thunders
If he treat you like a cheap and he runaway from ya
You can call me on the under
When you need someone to run to just dial my number

[Chorus] - 2x
Might be some fun to runaway
This game is one I wanna play
I'm done, he's gone and run astray
No fun, the sun has gone away

[Tech N9ne]
So what you think baby?
You think you can do this?
You think you got the borders to do this with me? (Hehehe...)
You know you're thinkin about it
I know you're thinkin about it
I see how you look at me
You and me exchangin looks over his shoulder at the restaurant, remember that? (Heh)
Ya, I know you remember that
Just creep with me baby, it's cool
We can kick it, y'know what I'm sayin?</pre>
