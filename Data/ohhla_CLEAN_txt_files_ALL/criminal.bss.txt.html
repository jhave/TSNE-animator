[Tyrese]
I've got a criminal mind
Ohhh oh oh

[Heavy]
C'mon, what what, what what, uh uh

1 - These days, I wonder if crime pays
    Blinded by criminal minded ways
    Smokin' on ya hay
    (Turn it up) Uh-huh

These days, cats be pushin' me places I ain't supposed to be
Money got a hold of me, controlin' me

    [Nichole &amp; Audrey]
2 -     I've got a criminal mind
    I can't help it
    I'm on my way
    To pick up the pieces
    It's the only way I see myself gettin' to the other side
    That's why I've got a criminal mind

[Tyrese]
City lights, diamond sky
What a beautiful thing, to be alive
Everything, is all that I desire
Paper's in my hand, a chance to leap higher

Repeat 2

[Tyrese]
Everywhere but felt your life's standing still
You want so much more than the world has to give
I can't see myself workin' every day
Makin' no money, barely getting paid

I should probably regret 
All that I've done, in the past
But as I turn the pages of my life
I see you ride up again

[Heavy]
Y'all still don't hear me?
Okay, check this out, yo
It's the D I
It's the D I
It's the D I G G Y, D A double D Y 
He be fly, all day
With a P I, G E, okay
Police got a freeze on my diamonds
Did 2 years in the pen, I'm back again
And this time, I got to win
I'm a theif by nature, steal your love
I'm a crook with a hook and a plan for thugs, uh-huh
Y'all don't hear me, huh?
Y'all don't hear me, huh?

Repeat 1

I'mma tell y'all somethin'
Y'all gon' still question my capabilities?
Are you stupid?
You sucka

Repeat 2
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

[Heavy] (Outro)
Y'all don't see me
How we get down, ya know what I'm sayin?
Whatever's necessary, we gon' be 'bout it
Cuz we 'bout it, for real (they know we 'bout it though)
(Man, tell 'em how you do it)
Listen man, I got to get what I get any way I can get it
Man, y'all hear me?
(I know that's right)

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
