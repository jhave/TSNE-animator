Murder mind like Manson, no expansion
Penitentiary chances cuz I'm scandalous, game deeper than Atlantic
Got em prayin like a mantis, but it ain't no hope though
Relentless bout this scrilla, these killas, we Mafioso
Regulate em like ho strolls, run em up off the Blocc
When the AK Poppin, I'm gone
Callin whoever I see, until I think I hear the cops comin
Mothafucka we run it, gotta punch it, got my blunt it
I'm sideways to the highway, can't be caught up in no punk shit
We run shit, from the West Coast, to the Midwest, to the South
Trigger happy like a B.G. put my streezy in yo mouth
Like toothpaste, kill em for actin two-faced
Backstabbin, they grabbin they pistols way too late
Murda 1 was the case
That they gave me, label me crazy, when we smash through
Wit a ???, leave em holy like a deacon leakin blood
Through yo teeth and meetin death, face to face, ain't no sunshine
Y'all heard the news through the grapevine
Gotta kill us all if y'all jealous G'z wanna take mine

Yeah my nigga, I heard you hollerin about you doin big shit
Fuck the complications, and fucked up situations
Bitch made nigga tactics, got these niggaz wrapped up in plastic
Facin they maker, fed up wit the most unpredictable
Want it enough, well it's time that we challenge ???
So nigga what?  We in the cut, without no way to be seen
I'm blazin up, unzippin my come up, made the getaway clean
I'm fleeing the scene, and I ain't got it all anyway so let's choose
Should I think about ???? breakin yo ass, so what you gon lose
I gives a fuck about the next nigga survive ??????
Nowadays niggaz is on other shit, so it's easy to plot
And I want it all, from the scrill to the bomb, to the stash in yo safe
You ain't even knowin what hit ya, you was flossin too much
Ya dividends must get touched, in all aspects I keep it real
Too much goin on in this killa field, so it's kill or be killed
Now who'd ya figure, was behind this trigga, bodyin ya cash
So I'mma smash for mine, and blast for mine
Without a trace, Murda was the case

Murda, professional, untestable, so lethal with these weapons
Pickin em off like interceptions, causin havoc in seconds
I'm dumpin and punchin and leavin the po-po with no lead
I'm jackin and stackin and actin a fool, when it comes to my money and weed
They call me greedy like the Grinch, watch you flinch, soon as they see me
Post up wit Sicc in the cut, we hittin em up like graffiti
My money be funny, my bitches be vicious, I'm livin my life wit a grudge
Wit wicked intentions, I'm representin these G'z and these thugs
That ain't afraid to kill like Holyfield, I break em all off
No trippin cuz if the pistol ain't official I got the sawed-off
Crackin and packin, a marked-man like Sadaam, I do it my way
Runnin til my dyin day, I crush, pushin 100 on the highway
With no L's, watchin out for them jealous peepz
Gotta strap and a zip of hydro-weed but I don't need no felony
So I clear the house in 5th gear, thinkin about my young bitch
Ask these niggaz who run shit
K-I-L-L-A-T-A-Y, all day nigga
