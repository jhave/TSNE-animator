(Busta Rhymes)
Yes y'all, in the parTY
I be Busta Rhymes y'all
And my nigga Ramp, The Last Boy Scout
Showin you what we talkin bout, HAAAH!
Feel me out, listen to what I say
Listen to what I talk
Listen to how we walk
Hey, check it out, listen to what I do
Yo bust it out, yo, what, hey yo yo yo
And Busta Rhymes coming in live
Some of you niggaz had me knock shit down for nine-five
[I'm ready to set it nigga] Yeah yeah yeah
[Check it out check it out]

(Rampage)
I told you last year that I burned you in a flame
Now this year, I'm wreckin average niggaz in the game
A lotta niggaz got two albums I can't explain
How they maintain to keep the same migraines
I can't help it if my brain is supersonic
The way I play the game you think I'm smoked by the chronic
It's the Boy Scout, stand for LBS from East to West
I'm still gonna bring it to your chest
My throat'll recoil as I bounce the ball, I can never fall
Now I got you open like the mall
With Funkmaster Flex boom bangin in your projects
To my niggaz in the Lands, Beemers, to the Lex
Now Busta Rhymes, what you wanna do
Represent for the motherfuckin Flip Mode crew

(Busta Rhymes)
Aiyyo-y'awwwwl, one more time I come
Knucklehead flow that make you act real dumb
Yo, I burn your food like Florence
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants
Shut your mouth nigga don't you complain
Fix you up, mix you cut like pro-caine
Ooooh, I be insane to your brain
Right on your subconcious I leave my shit stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like Ini Kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggaz just fall, keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like Quick Draw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Yo, everything remains raw
Outlaw nigga living right next door
When I step in the place I leave damages
Nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages
Yo, watch me bring the newest recipe
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy
Let me hit you with flows, that come various
Hahh, send you home and make you lie about your alias
Ha-ha, niggaz can't see my routine
When I round up my Flip Mode niggaz and get cream
Hey you, you know what the fuck I mean
Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like Mean Joe Green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam

[Flex blends this into the beginning of Mobb Deep's "Give up the Goods"]
