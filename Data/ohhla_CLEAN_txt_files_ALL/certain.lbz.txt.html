(Mr. Cheeks)
It's my first night in this spot
I can't front people jump okay it's rather hot
I'm with my brother, while roll he went and got the mole
He said he'll meet us at the party, yeah we just did the show
Now all my peeps is on the floor and they bouncin
The Lost Boyz is in the house, they're announcing (announcing)
We getting lifted with these honeys that we just met
They're dime pieces but ain't slidin with us yet
We gots to get our stroll on, hit the floor once
See eye to eye, he's on his way, he's bringin more pound
No need for my team to front in profile
Two shorties flirtin with Freaky Tah and B-Wild
I see my niggaz in suit, and he's chattin with
This genuine fine ass man (ass man)
Yo kid, I love it when my mind is in the right mist
If you with me throw your elves up like this
Everybody now

Yo shortie hop with the DK and Y all night
I think I'll walk over there and get my cry on
She playin hard to get, but when I get that
I'ma take it to the S's son I hit that
I can see it in the eyes, cause they don't lie
She's tryin hard to resist baby don't try
Now grab your drink come close to me
It's only right and that's way it's supposed to be
Now we loungin, chillin in the VIP
Got my nigga Ref and Bink with me

(Mr. Cheeks)
Now I'm wanderin who I'm goin home with
I got two chicks but only one is owned with
I got the whip down South plus some toe up
A favorite motherfucker safe from the floor up
Now the second one's hot cause she got class
See the first one's butt, she ain't got ass
Like she do, now you know how we do
We only fuck with the beat that will feed you
Now do I have to tell you what I did?
Grab my coat, cause shorties in a slid
to her diner, we got our eat on
You know my style kid; I got my treat on
So now we back at the last smokin Cannabis, Sativa
To the bone of the receiver
Put some sounds on as we end the herb
End and that, then again, this world

(Chorus w/ variations: Mr. Cheeks)
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night</pre>
