[Intro]
Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I am the one and only Queen Bee
After me there will be none, but you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as, Lil Kim the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up

[Verse 1]
This time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'
This time around it ain't like befo'
This time around I'm gon' crack ya jo'
The feds is watchin me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene my favorite color is green
I'm buildin a empire got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me
Music's my first love a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you

[Chorus]
I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

[Verse 2]
It's the real hip hop mami check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

[Chorus]
I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these bitches hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

[Verse 3]
This time around either your in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon' hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me
Don't get your life tooken I know I got you shooken
This Bed Stuy fly girl came back for Brooklyn</pre>
