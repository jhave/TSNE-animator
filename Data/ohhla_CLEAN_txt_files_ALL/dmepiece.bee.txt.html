[Russell Lee]
Oh, yeah
Baby, I don't get down like that

Chorus: Russell Lee
Lady, you'se a dime piece
And you lookin' so sweet
But baby, I don't work it like that
I know you got them other fools
Who be paying for your jewels
But baby, I don't work it like that
Lady, you'se a dime piece
And you lookin' so sweet
But baby, I don't work it like that
I know you got them superstars
Who be paying for your cars
But baby, I don't work it like that

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
Now you ain't lyin', you ain't lyin'
No reezy, oh yeah, you fine
And you got that supa dupa with the
Big ol' behind
You'se a dime, you'se a ten and a half, you so throwed
But you better check credentials, baby girl, I'm so cold
On top
The girl got degrees in computers
Off top
But she still golddiggin', workin' at Hooters
I ain't no peanut
So you can't put no salt in my game
You know how the chico do, I ain't gots to explain
Baby boo, On Tha Cool, you diggin' on me, I'm diggin' on you
We can have, our rendez-vous, and marinate, in a hotel room
Dinner and a movie, it's all groovy, I ain't trippin'
But you better stick with them bald players, 'bout
All them trickin', though

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Really, really though
Baby, you watchin' too many videos
Hangin' with them silly hoes
Got you where your fenced to go
Out the door, so fast, so quick
Even though you so yummy, you, uh
You so thick
Uh uh
I got
Rules and regulations
And guidelines
I'm in the game, you must wanna suck up from the sidelines
I ride for muscle, where I am 'bout to have
Near hundred
Actin' funny, tryin' push up on a hustle money
Even though I want ya
I really doesn't need ya
I guess you got to play the field to appreciate the way I please ya
And don't confuse me for a ca-ah-Captain Save A.
Yeah, you a dime, but baby, I'm 'bout that paper

Repeat Chorus

[Russell Lee (Baby Bash in background)]
We don't get down like that (Let 'em know)
We don't get down like that (Uh, let 'em know, let 'em know)
We don't get down like that (Let 'em know, let 'em know)
We don't get down like that (Ha ha)

[Rasheed {Russell Lee in background}]
Ugh
Aw nah
You golddiggin' breezes, what's wrong with y'all (Wrong with y'all)
Ugh
Aw nah
You golddiggin' breezes, what's wrong with y'all {Lady}

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash]   Hey yo, Hap', Hap'
              Bring that rhythm back
[Russell Lee] Oooh la la la
              Baby, I'm so high (La, la)
              Oooh la la la
              Baby, I'm so high (Ooh)
              Oooh la la la (La la)
              Baby, I'm so high
