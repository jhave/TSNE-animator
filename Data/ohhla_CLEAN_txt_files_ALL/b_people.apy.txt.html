[Verse 1]
The bigger they come, the harder they fall
When egos are big, the people are small
Pitiful, minuscule, nothing at all
No matter the money, they all wanna ball
Rock the clothes, the hoes'll jock
And drop some dough so hoes'll watch
Like "look at me, look at me," so insecure
Buggin' when Gucci don't go with Dior
Didn't get love? Run to the store
Get in the club, run to the floor
But never expect to find me there
With metro boys, with messy hair, it's...
The beautiful stars, beautiful cars, beautiful way of life, it's...
The beautiful house, beautiful spouse, beautiful seems so priceless
The beautiful bitches, beautiful riches, beautiful fascination
With beautiful evil, beautiful people, beautiful fabrication

[Chorus]
Hey little girl, think you're so damn cute?
Tell me..."What do you see?"
Tell me..."What do you see?"
Hey Mr. Trendy, in your fancy suit
Tell me..."What do you see?"
Tell me..."What do you see?"

The beautiful people, the beautiful people
Don't wanna be 'em
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
Don't wanna see 'em
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
Don't wanna hear 'em
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
Fuck them

[Verse 2]
Gellin' their hair, preparin' their make up
Beauty is not in their genetic make up
Watch it on TV, Apathy knows
The way they configure reality shows
Don't need to be psychic, with mental telepathy
To understand how they sweatin' celebrities
Watch and learn, prepare the children
Ashton Kutcher, Paris Hilton
Stand on stage and stare at billions
Break their hearts, they're resilient
Seen through the eyes of Jessica Simpson
Beautiful people are better at living
The beautiful way that they run from the camera
Complainin' they "Oh so stressed out"
The beautiful way they forgot where they came from
Then get upset, when they left out
The beautiful bitches, beautiful riches, beautiful fascination
With beautiful people, beautiful evil, beautiful bash your face in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Beauty's only skin deep, scrape away that thin sheet
Poppin that shit, like your shit never stink and I'll turn you into mince meat
Open up that magazine, US Weekly, People Teen
Popular people, the pompous and evil, abominable, I'm a fashion fiend
Tannin' booths, fancy suits, hairy boots, very cute
Say we let go, 80's retro, bitches tryin' to make me metro
Love their little recipe, to look like a celebrity
With tiny dogs and tiny clothes they use as an accessory, it's...
The beautiful girls, beautiful world, beautiful ass and curves and...
The beautiful flesh, beautiful chest, beautiful plastic surgeon
The beautiful science, beautiful diets, beautiful fluctuation
The beautiful bods, beautiful gods, beautiful "suck your waist in"

[Chorus]</pre>
