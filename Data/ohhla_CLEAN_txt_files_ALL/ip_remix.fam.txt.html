[Intro: Cappadonna]
Ironfist killas..

[Chorus: Crunch Lo and Cappadonna]
We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage

[Molly-Q]
We came soul conquer, Ironfist marching archer
Spark bullseye, clips for the starters
My heart robbers, cromadone flips from sex to village kids
We family drop kicks, caught in the death wish
My state as I regulate, ice cold like Bering Strait
Prepare what the genie gave, bloodbath Frank
Clean-up hitter, samurai swing, the head splitter
Talk litter, now your shiver in the Shao', kill a nigga!
Kick ass, fight tits, leave your money on these grits
Thin line between love and hate, ain't budging and ain't try calling you a snitch
But dug a ditch, what it ain't, RBs and black rose in advance
We always take the ransom, big source of racketeer
E.D.I. sing fear, got all that I ask
Came busting, I am in the struggle, Othorized F.A.M.
We had to bubble, stole face hard rocks, crush it down into rubble

[Chorus: Crunch Lo and Cappadonna]
We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage
We OTF, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage

[C-Wiggs (Crunch Lo)]
Shall be crooked from the bricks, banned from the streets
Monkey flip niggaz, tear ass with they cleats
Reach for the Ironfist Pillage, righteous fist killings
Villains, we thugs for the thrillings
(Bad habit, spilling into your lives
We taken your wives, big swords or butterfly knives
Go head and chop them, care about nothing
Straight off and rocked em, stalked through the dark and got to drop them
Jumped off, make me dumped off and checked out
Leaped from your torso, spit blood from your mouth)
We the block rockers, tearing it up from out the bang
(Inside murder) Iron Fist swang
(Kingpin call shots, we take over blocks)
And burned through the streets, and crashed like big stocks
(Give them everything, revolt like Kroatian
Zoom for the land (cuz it's ours for the taking)
Higher education, full violation
Third world niggaz cause havoc through migration
(Head to head confrontation) so never think twice
(Crossing through our path, you might lose your life)

[Chorus: Crunch Lo and Cappadonna]
We Othorized, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage
We OTF, The Pillage
Ironfist killas, The Pillage

[Lounge Mode]
Now it's the good side turning back
I play the hood like Bank and Thad
I run up in the gate and spanked the lab
Twist something, flip something, this fish shank your dad
The Mac-double-one in the stash, ready for blast
Talk is cheap, now that's why I keep it low with the heat
White boys, black boys running the street
Double guns (guns), I roll with nothing but the troubled ones
Ain't nothing sweet when you fucking with us
I play the elevator shaft with my finger ready to bust
First floor, territory turned raw
My Iron Fist out to hurt y'all, I got a crew called The Pillage
Watch how I fill it up in your skillet
It's Lounge Lo, Othorized F.A.M., we still building

[Chorus x2]

[Outro: Crunch Lo (Cappadonna)]
The Pillage, The Pillage!
(Pillage! Pillage!)</pre>
