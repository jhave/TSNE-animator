Close your eyes, he's undressin!

We're the opening act

High {?} through the door but I can't undress

What the hell's going on in here?
You're under arrest, get dressed

It's time to put the show on the road
(Time to put the show on the road!)

I'm dressin!

Well alright now
Meanwhile we find our opening act
Back in the dressing room
Discussing their room on the show when someone says
GET DRESSED! I want y'all
And then the drummer says uhh
A good show, starts in the dressing room
And work its way to the stage
Will someone give this young lady a backstage pass
while I work my way to the stage?

GET DRESSED! Time to go
