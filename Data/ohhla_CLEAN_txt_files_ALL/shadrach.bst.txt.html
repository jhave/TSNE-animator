[Verse One]
Riddle me this brother my brother - can you handle it?
Your style to my style - you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin and drinkin on a Tuesday night
It's not how you play the game it's how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin, and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost, but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Well who shall inherit the Earth? The meek shall!
I think I'm starting to peak now Al
And then the man upstairs - well I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
We're just three emcees and we're on the go
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego

[Verse Two]
Only twenty-four hours in a day
Only twelve notes well a man can play
Music for all and not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers
Got more suits that Jacoby &amp; Meyers
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
So I'm out pickin pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are damn frantic
I mix business, and pleasure, way too much
You know wine, and women, and song, and such
I don't get blue, I gotta mean red streak
Don't pay the band, your friends, yo that's weak
Get even like Steven like pullin a Rambo
Well Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego y'know

[Verse Three]
Steal from the rich and I'm out robbin banks
Give it to the poor and I always give thanks
Because I got more stories that J.D.'s got Salinger
I hold the title and you are the challenger
I've got money, like Charles Dickens
I've got the girlies in the Coupe like the Colonel's got the chickens
And I always go out dapper like the Harry S. Truman
I'm madder than Mad's, Alfred E. Newman...
("Never gonna let them say that I don't love you")

[Verse Four]
Well; my noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts
Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course
Smoke the holy chalice, got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Like Jerry Lee Swaggart, or Jerry Lee Falwell
Yeah like Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day we were born
And we love the hot butter SAY WHAT?! The popcorn
Sippin on wine.. and mackin
Rockin on the stage with all the hands clappin
Ride the wave of fate, it don't ride me homes
("Being very proud to be an emcee")
And then the man upstairs, well I hope that he cares
If I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire
Amps and crossovers under my rear hood
Because the bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood
They tell us what to do - hell no!
Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego</pre>
