	Bring it on!

[2Low]
Cover your dome or feel a motherfucking glock
The rugged child is in the house, I'm letting off shots
Biggity bagm biggity bang, hit the motherfucking deck
I'm down on this track and I'm abouts to get wreck
I'm coming like a hustler, never coming buster
Blasting on you hoes screaming "Die motherfucker"
Never showing mercy cause that shit is for the weak
I rhyme with my glock and knock a nigga off his feet
A young nigga, shorts as I figure
Step up with that bullshit, I'm a greet you with this trigger
Blasting on you hoes and let you know how it feels
Bucking with the 5th ward will get your motherfucking dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on

[Seagram]
It's the Seagster, the major leagster
Bitch deciever, nigga lie and leave her
Oakland hustler, never been a busta
Make way for the nine-trey, I'm coming motherfucka
Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doing more damage than the Exxon spillage
Uh, coward, and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flat
No rehabilitatin, take the nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the getto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70's
I'm hellbound nigga, my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahlmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga bring it on

[Too Much Trouble]
Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked
By some young niggas that's down to break a bitch
The Nickel Nut and the Band-Aid Bandit

Yes the Nickel Nut pimping ten different sluts
You've encountered slavery bitch I don't give a fuck
That petal turn tricks, a suck a lotta dicks
And come with my money or they get their ass kicked

Geto got hoes on the stroll making my bank roll
But ??? bitch, I run with foes
Cause all about the pen, ain't talking about the pussy
I'm talking about the paper, so bitch shake your money maker

It's the pimp pimp pimpin, you're simp simp simpin
Your bitch chose me now you're wimp wimp wimpin
Nigga you was wrong when you reached for your chrome
A slug to your dome, bad news gon beat you home
You think we was acting about making but you're wrong
We in a pizzimping and ??? bitches bring it on

	Bring it on, huh, bring it on, yeah (Repeat 2x)
	Bring it oooooooooooooon!

[5th Ward Boys]
Bring it on motherfucker, here I come with this damn thang
Boom boom boom, and I'm about to make freedom ring
5th Ward Boys coming hard for the nine tre
I'm down with them Geto Boys so make my motherfucking day

The 5th Ward Boys on the motherfucking set
Putting a slug off in your chest
Cause you didn't wear the bulletproof vest
Nigga ratta tat tat to your temple
Shit is real simple, busting up domes like a pimple

Jump if you want, nigga, and I'm a half to hunt ya
Murder after murder after goddamn murder
Yo I'm taking niggas to the promised land
With little Bushwick, Scarface, and the goddamn ??? man

??? stupid fuck is fucking it up with Double O, life is stuck up
For the ten flow, so what you wanna do, ho
Yeah, cause we're checking mo motherfuckers, parking mo motherfuckers
And killing more motherfuckers than any one of you motherfuckers

While your ho sleeping let's get it on
And get your fucking wig split, fool-ass nigga, now bring it on

[Odd Squad]
I can't see your ass bitch, so you'd better watch your bust or
Take that from a blind handicapped motherfucker
Smoking weed and steadily downing that Schlitz Malt Liquor
If you wanna step and get done, cause I'm that nigga

Well it's me that nigga D (Who?)
That fat square twister, the one who fucked your sister
I made her pussy blister, got a did in the side of my pearl white Lac
Keep my weed in the front and my brew in the back
And my heat up under the seat ready to put the lead on ya
So punk motherfuckers try to test me if you wanna

	Cause we're smoking that weed, feeling fine
	Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime  (Repeat 2x)

[Ganksta NIP]
A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies
I'm the one that told that nigga to go insance in that ?Loobies?
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming "Somebody slaughter me!"
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schitzophrentic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, claws can't keep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like the recreation of Malcom X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sickness change quick, a 40 of holy water

	Bring it on, huh, bring it on, yeah (Repeat 2x)
	Bring it oooooooooooooon!

	DMG bring it on

[DMG]
I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for delf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killing and slaying some shit
You fake on the two, you find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it, first I walk up on him like I know him
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they 
business
He's peeping out my missle as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get zound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

[Lord 3-2]
3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my glock, I make it go "pop," it's a 17 shot
So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop
You heard me roll a fatty
Now I'm at the window of your cocksucking caddy
So what you wanna do? It's about that time
Pop pop pop goes the weasil in my nine
Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang
Cause we can get it on ho, it ain't no thang, uh
Mo murder mo motherfucking merrier
Cause I be one of the roughest niggas from the hardcore area
So quit running your mouth, bitch, you know you can't fade this
Rap-A-Lot south shit
It's the 3 the motherfucking 2
So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

[Big Mello]
Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass everytime
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on

[Scarface]
It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize that nigga that you up against
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once the rifle starts spittin
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down I shut em down I shut em down
Screaming for vengance I swear that I meant this decended
Surrender suspended cause niggas I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home motherfucka so, uh

	Bring it on, huh, bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)
	Bring it oooooooooooooon!</pre>
