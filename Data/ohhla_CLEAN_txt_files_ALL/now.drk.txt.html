[Intro: Drake]
You could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay, you could thank me now
Uhh, yeah, well alright
Here I go... uhh

[Drake]
Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinkin like there's a message in a bottle
Aloha's to women with no ties
to men that I know well, that way there are no lies
You could thank me now for all the info, I give to you niggaz
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggaz
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggaz
I must've been hard to watch, what a year for you niggaz
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditatin
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Livin out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
And we just wanna party, Pat-ron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
O.V.O. clique, Red Wing boot gang
Yeah, we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'da thought the route we chosen would ever end up this scenic?
I could relate to kids goin straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike but gotta A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we wanna be them, and they wanna be us
Yeah, so on behalf of the demanded
And the entertainment that you take for granted
Y-you, could thank me now, and oh my goodness you're welcome
You're welcome; at this point me is who I am tryin to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them, get back to where they fell from
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggaz that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's goin down
In case another chance never comes around

[Chorus: Drake]
Y-you could thank me now, uh, go 'head
Thank me later, yeah I know what I said
But later doesn't always come so instead
It's o-okay, you could thank me now
{*harmonizing*}

[Drake]
Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimmin
I think I'm spendin all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love and knowin me I miss it
Cause me dedicatin my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
over double-pump lattes and low-fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missin what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watchin so I'm tryin to make 'em proud
Searchin for the meanin, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feelin like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors'll open up soon as you find the missin key
It's probably why I'm in this bitch shinin
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry; poolside drinkin, margarita rounds
Shoutout to my city though, I hardly be in town
I'm the +Black Sheep+ but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facin down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position

[Chorus]

[Drake] It's o-okay! {*echoes*}</pre>
