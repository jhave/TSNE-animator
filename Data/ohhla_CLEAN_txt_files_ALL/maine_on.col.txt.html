Song:   Maine On Fire
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Maine on fire
My empire be higher
Than an octave on Mariah
You niggas should worship sire
Your crew holding dead weight like a fuckin' hearse's tire
Meanwhile I'm like the flow diversifier verse is flyer
Gave you truth at a time when niggas prefer the liars
I was David promising the world that ima serve Goliath
Then I swam with sharks
Made it to the land and part
My dick in bitches
With intentions sick as satan's worst desires
Hell of a intro speedin' through this life at a hell of a tempo
Get my head out the window
20 k in my pocket
As I'm feeling the wind blow
And I ain't have a wallet since nintendo, comprendo
Orchestrating these capers watch my paper crescendo
I used to wanna save the world
Now all I do is spend dough
Till I snap back like hov hat
Now I'm back with this big black strap like hol' that

[Chorus]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch I ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar

[Verse 2]
We collect a hundred thou
Getting over on promoters might as well say run it now
I was such a cunning child
The one your girl mama wish she brought back home instead of you
The one your mama glad you hung around
Cole a charming nigga that can harm a nigga
Chest out in your hood like I walk around with armor nigga
But its just me and all my nigga's and we fuck the baddest
Bitches on the planet witnesses this is
Hustle at its, finest cause while you nigga's chase vaginas
We just let the paper blind us
While vaginas chase behind us
Take notes make money don't make jokes
For the master grab his rope and make us all scapegoats
Real shit but if the world really bout to end
We might as well let my nigga Craig out the pen
Pain so deep the words bled out the pen
And maine don't sleep nigga I win then come again

Huh

[Chorus]
Maine on fire
Top down bitch I ain't no liar
Henny on the rocks and plenty on the watch
Middle fingers to the ones who say we can't go higher
Maine on fire
Every week can see my name on flyers
Henny by the shots many bottles pop
And if she say that she ain't let me she a dang on liar</pre>
