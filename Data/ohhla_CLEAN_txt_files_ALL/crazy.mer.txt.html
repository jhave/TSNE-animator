Master P (Mercedes) talking:

Mercedes Mercedes I'm home boo
Look what I got for you baby
(Look get this up out of my face 
I told you I don't want anything to do with your dirty money)
What?
(I'm telling you, you need to change your life)
Man you trippin on me? and I'm out here trying to have something for us?
(Cause when it all boiles down it's gonna be me crying)
Man you aint gotta worry about that   
Oh you think your better than me now?
I'm outta here girl. 

Chorus (Mercedes, Ms. Peaches)

I'm going insane without you, I'm losing my brains without you
and I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'll do anything to see ya, and I slay myself to feed ya
I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you

Verse 1 (Mercedes) :

I'll never forget the first day we met, I was so crazy about ya
I beeped you all the days just to here you say, someday we will be together
You know you made me have this funny feelings, 
I guess I just love me a thug
You know how to push me down and take it from me
Show me that real type of love

Verse 2 (Master P) :

Ugh
The feelings I have for you, it's hard to explain to you,
I would do anything for you, girl I'd die for you, 
I live my life for you, so crazy about you
just give me a chance and I promise never to lie to you
I would be the best for you, complete any task for you
any wrong doing, I swear, I'd do the time for you
I could feel your pain that's why it's easy to cry for you
so please don't leave me cause I can't breath without you

Chorus (Mercedes, Ms. Peaches) :

I'm going insane without you, I'm losing my brains without you
and I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'll do anything to see ya, and I slay myself to feed ya
I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you

Verse 3 (Mercedes) :

Who took care of the situation when you got caught by the feds?
and I was waiting on your every phone call lying alone in your bed
my people tell me your not worth it, but it is so hard to explain
and just the thought thought of you on top, 
makes my nature hot, i want no other man

Verse 4 (Ms. Peaches) :

Who kept everything fresh for you? The best for you?
Who counted all the figures for you? 
Continued the buisness for you?
Who ran away those niggas for you? 
It was me that paid the bail for you, collected all the mail for you
Who do you trust with your life? Who can't wait to be your wife?
That is I Ms. Peaches, the one you love tonight
I'd be the first girl to fight about ya, so please don't leave 
cause I can't breath without you

Chorus (Mercedes, Ms. Peaches) :

I'm going insane without you, I'm losing my brains without you
and I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'll do anything to see ya, and I slay myself to feed ya
I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you

Verse 5 (Mercedes) :

I'm going crazy, about my baby
no one could ever take your place 
with all the memories we share, nothing else can compare
so I'm hiding my pride, what I'm feeling inside, 
I know that I can't hide

Chorus (Mercedes, Ms. Peaches) :

I'm going insane without you, I'm losing my brains without you
and I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'll do anything to see ya, and I slay myself to feed ya
I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'm going insane without you, I'm losing my brains without you
and I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you
I'll do anything to see ya, and I slay myself to feed ya
I just can't help myself, don't want nobody else, I'm so crazy about you</pre>
