(Intro)
I know a black guy!
No, no, no, it's true!

(Verse 1)
Oh yeah, I know a black guy
Knowing a black guy makes me cool
But I better watch out, what I say around him
If that one word accidentally slips out, he'll probably shoot me
But, I'm so excited, I know a black guy (I know a black guy)
He loves hot sauce, must have hot sauce
He'll eat hot sauce with whatever it's on
Especially some chicken wings (Chicken wings)
He loves him some clothes, must have new clothes
He'll buy a coat for whatever it costs
And wears his pants around his kneeees

(Hook)
He got some gold teeth
And drives a Hummer
He says "My white friend, won't you come commit a little crime?"
He says we're homies
He calls me brother
He is my black friend, felon seven times
I know a black guy

(Verse 2)
Ohh, when he tells me about all the times his ass has been locked in jail
All you crackers better watch out, because I know a black guy
And he owns a Nextel too, cause he's gotta call his bitch
He says I gotta keep sleepin around, but I can't live without her
And he loves him Jesus, must have Jesus
That's that one dude who's dead on a cross
And his bills are paid? Nevermind
And he loves him his gun, must have his gun
He takes a gun with, wherever he goes
Cause cappin fools ain't not no crime

(Hook)
He got a gold piece, and loves some trouble
He knocks out white kids, cause he's tryin'a do a little time
He says we're homies
He calls me brother
He is my black friend, felon seven times
I know a black guuuuy

(Verse 3)
And if a girl is white, don't worry he'll bone it
And everything that he's got, best believe that he stole it
He gon' steal my car, ain't no doubt about it
You know, ain't never got no weed
He always askin me for weeeed

"Know what I mean man? Real talk man!-
I don't mind smokin you up once in a while-
But every time I'm in the kitchen, you in the kitchen smokin my pot!-
Man, wassup!?"

(Hook)
He got a gold piece, and loves some trouble
He says "My white friend, won't you come commit a little crime?"
He got some gold teeth, and drives a Hummer
He is my black friend, felon seven times
I know a black guuuuyy
He fucked my motheeerrrr...</pre>
