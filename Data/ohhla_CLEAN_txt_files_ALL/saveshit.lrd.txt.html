[Lord Finesse #1]
Yeah, what's up Finesse?

[Lord Finesse #2]
Aw yeah! What's up, money?

[LF1] Just tripping on how girls used to be flipping last year
[LF2] That's understandable
[LF1] Then I came out with the record, making a little papes
[LF2] So what be going on?
[LF1] So you always got girls saying "Finesse, remember last night's action?"
      You know what I tell them?  I tell them to...

	Save that shit! (Repeat 7x)

This is for the females that think I'm not the same
Y'all think I'm different because I got a little fame
I remember y'all laughed and teased me
I wanted to make records, no one would believe me
I admit it was hard from the beginning
I used to strike out with the women
You know the females that be fronting and jiving
Don't wanna see a brother until you're paid and striving
You know the fly girls, the bad looking hotties
The ones that think they too good for everybody
Girls used to leave me and go because I had no dough to show
Now I'm paid, told you so
Now fly you see, some girls be eyeing me
Hoes who used to diss me want to all say hi to me
Now I'm straight, making crazy papes
So they all be asking "When we singing on a date?"
This is not welfare, you gets no help here
So keep walking and take your ass elsewhere
I remember you dissed me a year back
(I was only playing) I'm not trying to hear that
Always fronting playing hard to get
(Finesse, I'm yours) Don't give me that shit

	Save that shit! (Repeat 7x)

I knew another girl who used to walk all proud
Could never say hi, she had her head in the clouds
I used to see her every day out the week
She was mute cause the hoe would never speak
Didn't know things like "Excuse me" or "Thank you"
Sporting crazy jewels with extentions to her ankles
She wanted me to treat her like she was a damn star
Always fronting, driving her man's car
It was all about her, 24-7
Driving around calling everybody Kevin
She had good neck and kept all the girls panicking
Playing in town showing off like a mannequin
Brown sugar complexion, fine-looking figure
Always winking and smiling just to fuck with a nigga
I asked her what's up, she fronted and fessed
Playing like she's too good for Finesse
She acted like she was all that on her high horse
She used to diss me, roll her windows up and drive off
Word up, she was known for acting stuck up
Now I'm paid, she fell off, that's fucked up
I remember how she put me through hell
Her man's in jail, she crashed his car, oh well
Look who's the star of the picture now
Things are opposite, or should I say switched around?
(Do you call her?) There's no need to
Se be calling me saying "When can I see you?"
I guess she don't remember how she treated me rotten
Talking and laughing like everything's forgotten
She used to be teasing, now she's hawking
(Finesse why you fronting?) Look who's talking!
You used to diss my crew, said I looked pitiful
(Come on Finesse, you know I want to get with you)

	Save that shit! (Repeat 7x)

I met another girl, the fly side of them all, G
Had it going on plus a job on Wall Street
Finally met a female I can claim all mine
Problem was she never had time
When I used to call her she said "I'm busy honey"
Was it that she was busy or I didn't have money?
That does it, which one was it?
Cause on her free days she used to hang with her cousin
And on the weekends she used to like to rollerskate
I could never catch her, she always had to motivate
Never had time, she went out for self
Told me one day I should find somebody else
Yeah, she's right, that's what I too figured
Come to find out, she cut me off for a new nigga
I was hurt, things got hectic
But my man put me on and I came out making records
Got a little fame in the industry game
I seen that hoe again, you know that bullshit changed
Running up saying "Finesse please listen!"
Would you believe the hoe? (I'm a born again Christian!)
Bullshit! The hoe was trying to hide
She lost her man, plus her 9 to 5
Telling me sorry, no hard feelings
The girl fell off like cracked paint on the ceiling
Nappy extentions, looking all bugged
Trying to catch me at all my shows at the clubs
Telling her friends "Finesse? Sure, he's hype"
(He used to sweat me) Yeah, sure you're right
Her best bet is to chill and stay home
Instead of always beeping me from the pay phone
Tying up my line, always interrupting me
Calling every hour just to say what's up to me
Told her about the days when she acted all evil
(Finesse I used to like you) Sure, I believe you
(For real, can we be lovers to the end?)
What about your man? (Come on, he's just a friend)
What about your job? (I didn't like it, I quit)
Why is you lying? Save that shit!
