Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
It's like no matter what I try to do I just can't make her happy
See every other day it's like she throwin new shit at me
A constant petty complain 'bout every single thang
Hard to swagger maintain, shorty drivin me insane
In the beginnin I'll admit it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I felt you did me wrong girl I was copin
I guess a nigga was hopin, thinkin 'bout elopin
See I just call it focused, but some might call it open
Yeah, it's like I'm compromisin everything I stood fo'
I'm breakin rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself; two, never play yourself
Three, it don't matter girl, I'll throw 'em out the window cause for you

[Chorus: Avery Storm]
I, I-I'll bend over backwards
I'll, do anything you say
I, I-I'm here for you baby
Don't have to worry 'bout me
A little bit goes a long way
If I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three?
Yeah, they say a little bit goes a long way
But if I gave you one, would you want two?
If I gave you two, would you want three more?

[Nelly]
Somebody said relationships should be like 50/50
How come I feel I'm givin mine but not receivin any?
Why must you make it so hard to play the part?
I'll put you in the light but yet you leave me in the dark
And every time I think we're movin forward you pull back
And every time I think our train is straight you jump track
"Oh who the fuck was that?" You always doin that
Let me turn that shit on you and let me see how you react
Oh yeah, it's like I'm compromisin everything I stood fo'
I'm breakin rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself; two, never play yourself
Three, it don't matter girl, I'll throw 'em out the window all for you

[Chorus]

[Avery Storm]
If I gave an inch, would you want a foot?
If I gave that foot, would you want a yard?
If I gave that yard, would you want a mile?
And if I gave that mile would you walk the town?
I wanna give you everything you want
I wanna be everything you need
I'm right here for you baby girl
Don't have to worry about meeeeeeeeee...
