Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2: Young Scooter]
I done been through so much shit
I done been through so much shit
I gotta keep going
I done been through so much shit
I done been through so much shit
I gotta stay focused

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
My life been up and down like a seesaw
I gotta thank god for making white raw
Some days I stack the bricks and then I pray on them
They say I'm wrong for sellin' dope my niggas know I ain't
My momma sold dope so why the fuck I can't?
My daddy wasn't around I'm focused on the bank
But thank you for that nut you birthed a millionaire
I done been locked up without no bond fair
I know OGs that make plays out the wheelchair
Transformer cars break down like folding chairs
Me and Money Mitch we on a paper trail
On every beat I rap I leave a paper trail

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Phat]
I gotta stay focused for niggas [?] in the pen
Yesterday I went to prison to visit my brother Kenison
It's been like three years since I seen my brother
Walking back to this free world, dear lord
I just wish that you would free my brother
Thuggin' in that south side
In my mouth got [?]
Full of them pills like [?]
But we caught 'em you remember
All of the times we slung hands dawg
We had fun with guns, respect my nine
Take the hit, pay the bills
Hit the gas, burner steel
It's Freebandz and Trel, Scooter tell 'em what it is
I'm full of mud, on them Zans
It's still smash on sight
They tell me to chill I'm like that's my fuckin' life

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
I know niggas from the hood like E
That live the same life as me
Y'all niggas ain't from these streets
Y'all niggas ain't touched them corners
Y'all niggas ain't seen them pots
Y'all niggas ain't ran no block
Yo trap ain't never been hot
Y'all niggas ain't drop no top
Y'all niggas ain't bought no watch
Yo clique ain't got no guap
Freebandz we swaggin' to the top
Y'all niggas don't wanna get shot
G4 I'm taking off
My whole clique bosses
No workers in my circle
But everybody workin'
We do it for a purpose
Count up, wrap the bales in curtains
Me and Roc, riding in a Maybach
Drinking behind the curtain
Get a ten million dollar deal and won't stop serving

[Chorus]</pre>
