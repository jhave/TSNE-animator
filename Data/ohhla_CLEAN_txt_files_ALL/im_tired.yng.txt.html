[D-Roc]
Walkin' round' town like I'm lost, sittin' in da house like a log
Nigga had to find somethin' out, playa wanna shine das all
Don't help to twine wit' mine so small
Nigga nigga nigga nigga please, hataz all around me let a nigga breathe
What a nigga say at the slip of the lip?
Man fuck dat bitch need to quit, talk about a nigga like a hoe
What they wanna hate me fo? 
When a nigga step through da doe' conversation get low
With these type of niggas I don't need no communication
Cuz' playahation das so irrelavent next motherfucker that hate
I'm thinkin' bout' writin' a letter to da president
Swimmin' in da land of da lost, nigga don't sleep too good
Nigga tired been all off from stress dat can will, would, should
Probably could make a nigga ass go insane
Stay smoked out all day mary jane, niggas be tryin' to make me
Strain, hataz wanna put a chain on my rang 
Get a nigga mind off track and worry bout' you givin' my shit back
All ova hea need to stay ova dea, you got yo' own stay outta my hair
Niggas and bitches is both da same they lie, steal, cheat, fuck, suck,
Trick, and all dis then they in yo' face wit' dat I love shit

[Chorus]
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Fake booty, boot busta ass niggas all around me
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Hoes, hoes, hoes is all I see
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Won't chall get da fuck on and leave me alone
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Niggas get gone uh, bitches get gone uh (x2)

[Kaine]
Muthafuckas come around my face, mouf got a bad ass taste
Why the motherfuckers wanna hate?
Need to get out my way, let a motherfucker come through
Do wha tha fuck I gotta do, dis don't concern you
I'm tryin' to handle my business, get on da good foot
You need to jump on da band wagon and not stand backin'
Cuz' errbody tryin' to get rich, buy a new house and shit
Make our way out da hood, like everybody should
But you up to no good tryin' to bring a nigga down
Spreadin' lies around town nigga like a fu-ckin clown
It only make you look bad, errbody jokin' yo' ass
It just make me laugh, make a nigga move on, made me write dis song
Now I'm in the fuckin' zone, tha list goes on and on
But they say two wrongs dat don't make no right
It just make it worst, I addressed it first
That's why I wrote this verse, probably say da truth hurt
I'm bout' tired of dis shit, ya need to let da shit go
Quit actin' like a fuckin' hoe, yeah it's time to grow
If you do it will show

[Chorus]
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Fake booty, boot busta ass niggas all around me
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Hoes, hoes, hoes is all I see
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Won't chall get da fuck on and leave me alone
I'm ttiiirreedddd
Niggas get gone uh, bitches get gone uh (x4)

I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd


I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd
I'm ttiiirreedddd</pre>
