[Announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, checking in for No Limit it's Silkk the Shocker!

[Silkk]
Yo...yo, yo, yo, yo
I love this game so much, like it's my own
Every city I visit, it's like it's my home
Stadium packed, make my way to the back
And the players go straight to the rack
Chill in the stands and wait for the snacks
If I ain't watching I'm playing a game of NBA Jam
With the Lakers, yo playing with Shaq
But of course I know it ain't nothing but love
So close to the coach I could tell him who to sub (Put him in)

[Hook]
I love this game
We love this game!
Nothing gonna change, always feel the same
I love this game
We love this game!
Always feel the same, nothing gonna change
I love this game
We love this game!
Nothing gonna change, always feel the same
I love this game
We love this game!
Always feel the same, nothing gonna change
I love this game

[Silkk]
Watching my team dribble down the court
What's this my favorite team down by four
Point guard stop hogging the rock turn around and score
If you gonna get blocked, pass the rock
Come on we gotta get down and score
I been thinking to myself, I could come back if I was them
I wasn't a player just a witness next thing you know I was him
The ball was in my hand and all I heard was we will rock you
People waving their hands saying Silkk they can't stop you
Had a three, passed it up and I shot a two
Cause my team's about to make a comeback, guard who gots you
Should I pass, should I drive, or something worse
Put on my P's that when I skied, went for thirty-five on em'
And won it, next thing you know I woke up back in the stands
Damn, it's like I was right there
That's why I love this game, playing it all the time

[Hook]

[Silkk]
Yeah, yeah
Shouts out to all my dogs, all the ones that play ball
You know D.A., Marbury, Chris Webber, Outlaw, Penny Hardaway
Randall Jackson, Ricky Davis, Tyrone Nesby, Isaiah Rider, Kenny Smith
Paul Pierce, Randy Livingston, Percy Miller, Kobe, and Shaq
Eddie Jones, Vince Carter, Kerry Kittles, Iverson, Kevin Garnett
Rodman, Jason Williams, Bonzi Wells, Tim Hardaway, Jalen Rose
Gary Payton, all y'all who ball, even football
Shouts out to Ricky Williams, everybody who make it happen
NBA, CBA, college, high school, junior high, it don't matter
I just love basketball
If I wasn't a rapper, if I wasn't a thug, I'd be a hooper, ya heard
What up, what up, what up, what up, what up
This is brought to y'all by Beats by the Pound</pre>
