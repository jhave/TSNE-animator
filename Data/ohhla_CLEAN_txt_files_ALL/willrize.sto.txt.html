[Chorus: Val Young](x2)
Will I Rize again you don't believe
I'll make you see watch me
Will I Rize again

[Verse 1: Storm]
Blame my mother's inner meeds for the way I be
Perceive me bastardly but fear me tactically
Engaged in the bitter sweet life and enemies
Death is destiny'd so I prepare for the after me
Which will it be my soul's fighting valiantly
Evil means for eternal peace
God help me I been callin' to you black jesus
Ya ground warrior 2pacalypse is now feel em
Watched him bleed thru his hands and his feet
Immortalized and multiplied now prepare for me
Can it get any better before this hellish earth
Embellish me in it's evil work sometimes I think I'm cursed
Whisperin' to the dirt flaggin' hearses
Come take my birth cause see it hurts to live in sin
My patience's wearing thin I'm wonderin'
When will it end no sufferin'
Can't even escape thru my slumber state
Dream demons rapin' my soul is it to late
Can I pray thru my hatred will I make it to better days
Lost in a cruel maze searching for my final fate
Will I Rize in the morning, Will I Rize in the morning
Will I Rize

[Chorus: Val Young](x2)
Will I Rize again you don't believe
I'll make you see watch me
Will I Rize again

[Verse 2: Storm]
Stuck in time it's to intense to reminisce
Aint got no hope in future tense the present's evident
And they wonder why my mind is filled with hate themes
My body's bleedin' killer genes I'm screamin' in my night dreams
Satanic in my pipe dreams
Picture scenery the revelation of a thug nation
How long will I last before assassins fear my conversation
"Aint afraid to die, see I fear no man but god"
My thug angel replied as he attained his higher stripes
Conquered the game cause life is just the go between
Capture the prize by any means
Prophetic energy flowing thru my weins
Keeps me steps ahead of my enemies
As my final breath inhaled by my successors keep them guessin'
Thugs never leave cause after he I'm next
Surrender quietly or violently depart with pierced hearts
I write my words in stone a soldier for the cause regardless
Immortal legacy is callin' me Will I Rize to see him
Say life is death then let me live it freely
Tell me what's the meanin' feel my soul leavin'

[Chorus: Val Young](x2)
Will I Rize again you don't believe
I'll make you see watch me
Will I Rize again

[Verse 3: Storm]
Shed so many tears till I've died inside
Got nothin' left but battle cries
Silent with piercin' eyes underlyin' violent ties
Forgive my future crimes
Will the morning give me another day another chance
To bend my knees and pray cause aint no way I'm gonna stay
Been knockin' at the gates
Was heaven made and hell bent ever since
My short lived innocence gave me inner strength
To face my shadows with a vengeance
Now I'm in this game runnin' to meet my endin'
Won't stop until I'm winged and winded
Last remains descended bury me a godly sinner
And let my soul go don't try to judge what you don't know
I see my life before me and how the story's told
Thru weepin' eyes and jealous lies
They can't get me to glory live the life put down before me
This world couldn't hold me couldn't control me
Give me my destiny and carry me in memories
These words that I say as I lay down in conscious sleep
Will I survive the night rize to see the daylight
And if I should die before I wake will I be alright
Just let me rize...

[Outro: Storm]
Will I Rize, Will I Rize, Will I Rize
Will I Rize to see the morning
Will I Rize, Will I Rize, Will I Rize
Will I Rize to see the morning

Listen everybody...
