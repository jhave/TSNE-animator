Song:   Where's the Fun in Forever?
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Where's the fun in forever
Swimmin' in a sea of time
If we only knew beginning
No end in sight
To feel a love

Where's the fun in forever
Would you love so hard
We're just tryin' to be better
Cause we have come this far
Oooh oooh

Have you ever stopped to think about how it'll be anyway

Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate

Ooooh
Ooooh
Where's the meaning in tomorrow
Where's the lust?
Where's the angst?
Never feel like time is borrowed
Cause it's all the same
Ooooh

It's kinda sad to think about the way that it would be
Thank goodness that

Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate
Hey

Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
You gotta celebrate

[Alicia Keys:]
Where's the fun in forever
Gotta live it like it's your last
Got to toast for the moment

Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate

It's a crazy thought to think how it would be
Thank goodness that

Tomorrow's just a day away yea
Tomorrow's just a day away
Tomorrow's just a day away
Oh tomorrow's just a day away
And tomorrow isn't promised
Where's the fun in forever
Celebrate </pre>
