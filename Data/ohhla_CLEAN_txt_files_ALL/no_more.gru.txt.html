[Guru]
Aight, aight, don't be yellin yo
Calm down man, can we talk like civilised people?
I can't take this no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

[Guru]
I'm out the door, I can't take it no more
Things have really changed, it's not like before
I mean the vibes between us nowadays are quite shaky
And lately, I ain't been feelin you baby
Somehow you left my interest wander
And now I'm fond of someone else who's diggin me for me 
It's what I longed for
About our current arrangement I ain't sure
Cuz I don't think I love you no more
And yo I had a major effect on you I know
But sure you be showin disrespect to me, so I gotta go
You never gonna see it how I do
And I don't like your attitude and I don't like being lied to
I'm not a door you can't push my buttons
We tried to make it work still we've come up with nothing
So now my patience is thin, the fighting is a bore
And I don't think I love you no more

[Craig David]
I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more

Girlfriend I'm walking to the door
Ain't gonna see me no more
All you seem to do is bore
Me, since I came back off tour
See if I can take your ways
I'm walkin away from only bad days
I know there is no easy way
But there's nothing you can say
To change my mind, yeah

[Guru]
I wish I didn't feel this way, wish I was kidding
But another girl has stepped on the scene to put her bid in
I never would have looked in another direction
But you got a strange way of showing love and affection
So I told myself that I deserved better
You only came my way because you heard I had cheddar
And now you seem to me to be so immature
And I don't think I love you no more
And plus I know about that stuff you told your crew when we met
I gotta go somewhere so please let me jet
See you forget about my generous ways and my good heart
You never wanna admit you're wrong, but you should start
Let's put our differences away and end this peacefully
We haven't been getting along at all recently
I've been thinking about this since I came home from tour
And I'm sure, I don't love you no more

[Craig David]
Now I gotta explain that I'm loving and feeding you no more
Everything keeps sticking around since I came back off tour
So tell me why do I have to explain myself baby, ey
Cuz girl you gotta admit that there's nothing more for me to say
Ooh yeay

I don't love you
No More
Come I'll show myself to the door
I don't love you
Cuz I don't love you no more</pre>
