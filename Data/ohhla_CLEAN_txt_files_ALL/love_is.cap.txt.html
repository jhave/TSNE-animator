Intro:Raekwon(Cappadonna)
Remind me Tuesday I gotta go handle my business
Know what I'm saying?
Straight up
(Love is love)
Yo, don't play with them shits up in here
Them shits is dangerous

Verse 1: Raekwon
Hey yo
Hey yo
Hits Sally
Timbaland grand finale
Damn imagine bringing back Alam skin bally's
Glass of this
Leather dick down status
That's crabbage
Can't see the real so you average
Drip cammo
Who carry Van Damme ammo
Nike Airs Uptown put the Benz van yo
Chilling with niggas who real
Who respect real
Big us get your wig touched crib rushed
Record and command
Slam jams for my mans
Puff trees
Tuck these rugers in your lands
Cemented
Bent out of shape mend it
Represent Spin been through it god
Hold the Mac splendid
Time Balotti rap version of the black Gotti
Rob me God'll act ungodly
What never been done before
It's real son you gum it out
Run it in the gun store

Verse 2: Cappadonna
Everyday all day
Fat like Bob Rockaway
Dipped in the latest spot me right away
Wu Tang executive new Donna Jay
Darts in your area that's how I play
Nobody else shouldn't really have a say
When it come down to this Shaolin, USA
Represent fully give me your air space
Razor Sharp label keep coming out the face
Make room as I step up to the plate
RZA create sounds of earthquakes
Make no mistake kid y'all just faking
Cross-over cats that love to eat bacon
WTC rush like Regan
Crush your little song while you on your knees begging

Interlude: Raekwon
Who? That nigga right there?
Son he trust me watch this shit right here

Hook x2: Raekwon
We see y'all niggas in the back all treed out
Throw the heat out
Ready to stop all beef out
Play me
Maybe you will catch more gravy kid
We ill in the back feeling on your ladies

Verse 3: Raekwon
Dripped out dip promoter
Dead arm that nigga trying to get up over
Thinking he clever but he rolled up
fronting on the God yo
Acting like that cheese ain't right
Aight that night dunn rolled on the mic
Jumping out the Lex door suede Lugz on
Looking like he worth ten thousand on the arms
Cuban connect I had it smashed
This is Godville kid we real
Staring at his steel dunn ask
Jewels that he rocking
Bone bracelet
Had laced kid screaming on his neck lex rocking
Nigga had a fat lab
Hundred bag
Tools you had
Ohh little wifey had it all with a fat ass
What you wanna eat boo?
The rents due
Niggas wanna get you
You need to put a laser on your shit boo
Sat there bluffing
Saying nothing
Looking at bird pop shit
Acting like she bugging

Verse 4: Cappadonna
18 karat gold and fresh boots
Me and my team regulate to the roots
Big pockets
Blow mics out the sockets
Condeminium
Karl Kani denim
Where the honey's at?
We be getting up in them
A whole lot of dollars and real scholars
The Wu got knowledge
Represent 5%
100% pay attention
To the stretch Lincoln
Drinking Evian Don-Don
Stay calm under pressure
Break the sound barrier
Big Wu Tang trucks roll in your area
Wallabees for life
We too hype
One ring with the ice
Don't stress it
What? Love is the message
18 points on my brand new record
Dart clapper
Ran like a snapper
Watch out for Cappa
Make way
Y'all cats ain't ready for me and the DJ

Interlude with Raekwon talking and Cappadonna shout outs

Hook x2: Raekwon
We see y'all niggas in the back all treed out
Throw the heat out
Ready to stop all beef out
Play me
Maybe you will catch more gravy kid
We ill in the back feeling on your ladies

Outro: Raekwon
Du-du NUMBER 1
Dance hall storm
