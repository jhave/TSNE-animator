[Hook, Shannon lead vocal]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Diddy talkin]
Ya'll wanna be stars
I'll make you a a star
check this out

[Diddy]
I keep the hood of that Coupe warm, wrinkle free suits on
Her hand shake from me, a redeemable coupon
Knowing me will get you all the little perks
So you need to double back, throw that auto in reverse
It's pure beauty, can finally put a face to it
So never stop shorty girl, leak break fluid
Tonight pedicures, walkin on better floors
Beat it in your S don, Jimmy Choo, better stores
I been around the globe, my english is rusty
Trust me, you can hear that ocean when you touch me
I know you due for sale, you ain't gettin stepped on
Or overlooked, pardon me, forgive me, my name's Sean

[Aubrey]
Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yeah we superstars

[D. Woods]
Put in the keys, make that engine purr
3 in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin', 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy ride

[Chorus, Shannon lead vocal]
We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah

[Hook]
Bet you ain't never seen (hey), Chicks ridin' this clean (hey)
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it deadly (oh, oh, oh)
That's how we keep it poppin' (hey), make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us ridin', we call it show stoppin' (oh, oh, oh)
We show stoppin', We show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', We show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin' (hey), make sure that bass knockin' (hey)
So when you see us riding, we call it show stoppin' (oh, oh, oh)

[Aundrea]
We sittin' on 22s plus 2
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas, but we ride like big boys do

[D. Woods]
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my Bad Boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' 'til they lose they breath
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left

[Chorus, Shannon lead vocal]

[Hooks]

[Dawn]
This is for my ladies in the 280s Mercedes
In the H3, Baby Ranges, Bentley Coupes, my Esca-ladies
Say oh (oh), oh (oh, oh)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real show stopper

[Group, Aubrey lead vocal]
This is for my chicas with the Beamers A6s
'67 Chevys, Maserati, or a Lexus
Say oh, (oh), oh (oh,oh )
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real show stopper

[Yung Joc]
Hey shawty, please believe, you ain't never seen chicks like this before
Thousand dollar jeans with them candy 6 4's
Louis V sneaks, matchin' Louis V seats
See a swagger like no other, so them other's can't compete
Independent and discrete, check her VDS piece
Melt in ya mouth like M&amp;Ms, capish
She do whatever she wanna do, money out the ying yang
Blowin a dollar and the change, in the Rover switchin lanes
I'ma take her under my wings, I'ma teach her things
She say she got paper cuts from countin all this change
Tell her meet the parents, like Ben Stiller
Baby say she want them karats and them chinchillas

[Hook, Shannon lead vocal]
