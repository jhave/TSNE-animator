Push it up

Push it up
Push it up
Push it up

[Queenie]   Spreewells spinnin'
         My Spreewells spinnin' on chrome
[Baby Bash] The spreewells keep spinnin'
         And my trunks on pop
[Queenie]   My Spreewells spinnin'
         My Spreewells spinnin' on chrome
[Baby Bash] The spreewells keep spinnin'
         And my trunks on pop

Pre-Verse: Queenie
Spreewells spinnin'

[Verse 1: Queenie]
You know the
Ese keep right, I ain't playin' with that
Belly
Coup, drop down, why you see the Spreewells spin
Ese choppin' it up
Got the Henny in the cup
Clean white tee, {*guns*} tucked, and I ain't givin' {*a fuck*} (Uh uh)
Pink diamonds for the wifey, fifteen carots for the soldiers
Truck glowed to the {*white*}, two point two, pearly boulders
And I'm still sunned out
Moon roof
To the back, {*blunt*} fill a {*kush*}, blowin' it out
Rob jewels like electric guitars
{*Gang*} signs to the sky
Like I'm tryin' to shoot the stars
And when I say what I do, when I say, what I done
You don't wanna see me back the {*gun*}, ese {*gun cocked*}
And my

Pre-Chorus: Queenie
Spreewells spinnin'

Chorus:
(Queenie slowed down in background)
[Queenie]   Spreewells spinnin'
         My Spreewells spinnin'
[Baby Bash] The Spreewells keep spinnin'
         And my trunks on pop (On chrome)
[Queenie]   My Spreewells spinnin'
         My Spreewells spinnin'
[Baby Bash] The Spreewells keep spinnin'
         And my trunks on pop (On chrome)

Repeat Pre-Verse

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
Now that's some comin' with them Playa Made Mexicans
That's Baby Bash, on that ass, stackin' presidents
Some call it feddi, scrilla, cash, money, Benjamins
I'm in the zone, off that chrome, in your residents
Look like I'm skatin'
Big, ballin' and heavy weightin'
The trunk
Rattlin'
Look at that
The speaker's quakin'
And I ain't fakin' like half
The rappers in the nation
So many trees, look at the leaves, that I be rakin'
And like inflation, I'm bubblin' up to get the bacon
With a pound of {*dank*} and a gang of drank, why y'all procrastinatin'
I'm off the cover
Yeah
A fighter and a lover
You want some sauce, come see ya boss
About some butter

Repeat Pre-Chorus

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Pre-Verse

Hook: Baby Bash
Chop, chop
You know it don't stop
The Spreewells keep spinnin'
And my trunks on pop

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Lucky Luciano]
I stay ride and clean, am droppin' screens
Yell, "The diamonds all on my ring"
Keep some styled on my team
{*Heats*} are under my driver seat
Dabbin', spinnin', like my head
After I done popped a necks
Lucky, yeah, I'm from the wreck
Tell 'em folks to cut a check
Lights to get my floss on
{*Nigga*}, I'm a boss, hun
Ten thousand on chrome
Paper grew and got long
Ain't {*shit*} rented, boy I pimpin', been pimpin'
My rims pay for {*fuckin'*} A.O.B.
In H-Town, or on Richmond, gettin' chippers out a stripper
Mex'cans stayed throwed, and the game ain't free
Wheels spin like ceiling fans, woodgrain up in my hands
.45 to the sand, pocket full of Benjamins

[Chingo Bling]
You see those (???) tires (Chingo Bling, {*culero*})
You don't want no beef with mine and snap
Doo-doo-doo

[Verse 4: Chingo Bling]
This ain't no Bappin' Ape shoes, this is Chingo Bling boots
Your baby mama wippin' down my wetback with tissues
Bought a old school
Had to throw some orange on that hoe
Bought a eighteen wheeler, had to throw some birds on that hoe
Ese like that
Fifth wheel, on relax
Slangin' muscle like {*crack*}
Last name, on the back
Got the four fours spokin'
Candy paint soakin'
H-Town to Mexico
Backed up to Oakland
At night time, I'm loc'in'
I got my cowboy hat
Grillin' women, stove and oven
Maza, I'm a double that
They lookin' for me cause they don't like beaners
How much nalga can I pull, if I ride these spinners

(Queenie in background)
[Chingo Bling] Ladies and gentlemen

            My Spreewells spinnin'
            My Spreewells spinnin'

            And my trunks on pop (Spinnin', spinnin' on chrome)
