[Z-Ro]
I'm a Ridgemont soldier, state of Texas stunner
King of the ghetto, even when I was a new comer
24 hours a day, I be sending fellas under
If they people want revenge, I never worry or wonder
When my motherfucking beef coming
Nigga this Rap-A-Lot mafia, head-n-chief coming
Everybody claiming they got guerillas in they click, why they be lying
When automatics start bucking, they turn them monkeys on the vine
Trying to get away, from the drama
But my barrel be spinning, like a set of Yokohama
I gotta blame it on my messed up childhood, this how I turned out
Hotter than first degree burns, unable to burn out

[Hook - 2x]
Z-Ro, I think you fellas know my name mayn
Z-Ro, making these haters mad that's my thang mayn
Z-Ro, I'm real and I ain't gon never change mayn
Z-Ro, me and a piece of platinum that's the same thang

[Z-Ro]
We ain't riding on no horses, round here
We get it how we live, that's why it go down round here
We going through thangs, plenty plenty pain round here
I cheering a smoke ass, we don't play games round here
Everybody living wild, nobody tame round here
On they click em juice, with evil in they brain round here
Since the turn of the century, it ain't been the same round here
Must be a soldier or get voted, just to claim round here
Some people, say we a fashion show
Don't let the Screw tapes fool you, cause we be blasting hoe
This is what it sounds like, when we ride on our enemies
Houston Texas, we pulling negative energy

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Be all up in my face, when I be sanging that song
But when haters be up in my face, I be swanging that dome
Because patience is a virtue, that I don't have
And you a fool, if you thinking that I won't jab
I hate the world, is the kind of attitude I got
But I could justify reasons, for any dude I shot
So I never be watching my back, Jehovah do it for me
I'm not a criminal, just trying to keep t-bone in my tummy
I'm as good, as the best of them
Or as bad, as the worst
Lil' fella you can find out, don't make me have to pull my iron out
I do my dirt but I hide it, like a bottle of Zydine
