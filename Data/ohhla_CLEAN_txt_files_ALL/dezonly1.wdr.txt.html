Song:   Dez Only 1
Typed by: moshamosha@yahoo.com

[Sample]
Deep in the steaming jungle
The eerie sound of the voodoo drums tell us that
This is the night

[Witchdoctor]
My confess
We sinners lord
Dez only 1

[Chorus]
Book you got cooked (x3)
God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
(2x)
Book you got cooked (x2)

[Witchdoctor]
Check it out, uh
If in this life 
I strive to please Him
In this day and night 
I'm not always right
Even when I'm wrong 
You should be afraid to anger Him
Cause you could be gone
Him don't need us 
It's the other way round
Do you know what I'm talking about
When I say Him, clown?
You can't look at nobody 
And say that's Him
Cause He's invisible 
Yet visible, this is critical 
Relying on our own abilities you lose
You need him 
To help make your bumpy ride a cruise
Ask Magic about him 
Or any strong believer
He's the quarterback 
We the receivers
Catching blessings 
Better than touchdowns
I seek him when 
Niggas wanna buck me down
Him holds many holy titles
Him has many names 
Him has many bibles
The devil can't deal with Him, uh
He tempted me but you see 
I'm still with Him
Listen close
All brothers are men
Him is responsible for all colors and kin
I bust with Him
If only I can fully trust in Him
I'm glad to be stuck with Him
Rather have Him than money
I'm serious
He'll get you once you become curious
Lord, give me happy, long life
Real good sex with the wife
No traveling with bodyguards
It's just a real nigga godly entourage

[Chorus]
God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked (x3)


[Big Boi]
See
My relationship with the God 
Is kind of odd
The nigga the B-I-G won't part
Feeling the presence up in my heart
But never no chicken to the nigga
In on that style like that
Talking about the way the Lord
Be lifting these burdens up off my back
Better that I bust raps
The way that I cut that
Ho you couldn't
You trying too hard, you better find Him
I'm hoping you understood it
Could it be (What?)
The niggas around the way
Don't really be thinking about the consequences
Under the circumstances 
Until you pinch them
Then a nigga be one to listen (Why?)
Cause you woke that ass up
Yoke that ass up
Proving the man in the sky
That holds that ass up
But it's over now
He cut off
Some niggas done broke you clean off
But got to get on your knees 
And praise the only
Now your soul lost

[Andre Benjamin]
Now, OK, now
The sun shines 
The moon glows
The wind blows
The rain falls
But that aint all
My heart thumps on a rhythm y'all
And birds call
And two can fall madly in love 
Oh, I think grow
They stop and stare in awe
Because we in his likeness
Hoping and praying that one-day
In the lab they might just
Stumble on some kind of way
To create human beings
So far
Human kind is the only thing I'm seeing
Dez only 1

God sent you some warriors
Plus we tellers of the stories
Book you got cooked (x3)
