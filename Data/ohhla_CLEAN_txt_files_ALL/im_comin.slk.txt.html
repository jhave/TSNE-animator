1,2, You hear the clock tickin'?
Tick-tock, You about to stop livin'
Tick-tock, I want you to remember me
Tick-tock, but the day don't have no memory

[CHORUS]
I'm comin'!
Nobody could stop, Ain't nobody could hold me
Ain't nobody control me
I'm comin'!
I'm here to do my thang, I'm here to bring the pain
I'm never ever gon' change!
I'm comin'!
Nobody could stop, Ain't nobody could hold me
Ain't nobody control me
I'm comin'!
I'm here to do my thang, I'm here to bring the pain
I'm never ever gon' change!

Like Tropicana, I got the juice
Offer the lease to let the dog loose
Don't make me call up the crew
Now they gettin' scared when I call up my troops
I'm the One like Neo, cocky like T.O
Nobody could guard me like I'm shootin' a free throw
This is illegal, my flow is legal
And its me, there will never be a sequel
See, I'm fly like a pelican
And while I'm here, yeah, I'm gon' represent
If your sick, then I'll be your medicine
And you already know who I'm better than
No doubt, yeah, I'm a veteran
And when done you gon' think you got ran over by elephants
Since I came ain't been the same like ever since
And that talking, yeah, it better end

[CHORUS]

This is: My world, my way, my life
And if I gotta do it I gotta do it right
So everything I want, go ahead and gimme that
If ya girl with me just know that you ain't gettin back
Yeah, she want a bad boy
And I'm all about my cash boy
You see me all up in the Jag boy
I know that make you mad boy
But don't make me beat ya ass boy
So don't go there
Ya career's like a treadmill: you runnin' but you ain't goin' nowhere
Me, on the other hand
I can blow 100 stacks and bounce back rubberband
30 karats here, 100 on the other hand
I do me, I don't worry 'bout another man
I'm way past'em, got'em playin' catch up
I'll be right there if you ever mess up

[CHORUS]

1,2, You hear the clock tickin'?
Tick-tock, You about to stop livin'
Tick-tock, I want you to remember me
Tick-tock, but the day don't have no memory

1,2
Tick-tock
Tick-tock
Tick-tock

1,2
Tick-tock
Tick-tock
