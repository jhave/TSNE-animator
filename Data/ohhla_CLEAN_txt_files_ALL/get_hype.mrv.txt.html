[Chorus]
Yeah, get on my hype
Green big birds, yellow and blue Nike's
Money on the charm, Yellow and blue ice
Stone's on the arms, Red and blue ice
Get on my hype
Sideshow shit, the West on fire
If she ain't a piece I'll run right by her
On some hyphy shit
Sideways two tires
I'm on one homie but I'm tryin' to get higher
Get on my hype

[Messy Marv]
Ok, I don't play that pimpin'
If you ain't thizzin' then say that pimpin'
You know, it's stones on the wrist watch
Money on the Jesus
Skittles on the chick watch
Ma, put the grapes in the blunt
Sideshow shit I'll teach you how to stunt
Come on, get on my hype
I'm through the light poppin' wheelies on a motor bike
It's real, get stupid go dumb wit it
I don't want it if the orange juice don't come wit it
Uh huh, the West on fire
I'm on one homie but I'm tryin' to get higher

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Yeah
Pop somethin', break somethin', shake somethin'
Pop somethin', break somethin'
Get on my hype, yeah
Break somethin', pop somethin', shake somethin'
Break somethin', pop somethin'
Get on my hype

[Messy Marv]
Yeah, I keep the pepper on the waist
Blades on the scrapes
Stunners on my face
Uh huh, me and my goon's go thug
And get hyped out cuz it's work in the club
Minks in the summer
Air Force's in the winter
Green and blue pills wit the birds in the center
Yeah, it's on and crackin'
I hit the sideshow wit the system yackin'
Greg Scotch, you call me a thief
Just cuz I have a mouth full of gold teef
Damn nigga I'm so faded
The east on fire and the police hate it

[Chorus]

[Messy Marv]
[Get on my hype]
Red and blue lights on the ice work
VVS that should tell you what the ice worth [Get on my hype]
And I know I'm shinin'
I'm a factor in the Bay boy
They know I'm timin' [Get on my hype]
SS wit the chip in the front
Sideshow shit, I'll teach you how to stunt [Get on my hype]
I'm a hus-linaire
You can see a rainbow in everything I wear [Get on my hype]
We on some hyphy shit
In the party on some yellow and blue nike shit [Get on my hype]
Uh huh, the south on fire
I'm on one homie but I'm tryin' to get higher

[Chorus]
[Hook]
