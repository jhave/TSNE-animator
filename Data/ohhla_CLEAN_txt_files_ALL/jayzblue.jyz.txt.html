[Intro: sample taken from the movie "Mommie Dearest"]
"I work and work 'til I'm half-dead
 and I hear people saying, 'She's getting old.'
 And what do I get? A DAUGHTER,
 who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
 as she cares about ME~!"

{*Notorious B.I.G.*} "Uhh"

[Jay-Z]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes, truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatant ballin on HD
Mm, y'all need to step up y'all AV
Mm, life changed again
I was already takin off, my flight changed again
Slight change of winds {"Uhh"}
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me
Only hugged the block, I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby gettin chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww +Isn't She Lovely+?
Now I'm starin at her, prayin that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody
I need a joint right now, just the thought alone fucks with me

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
High on life - I could die from the fall
Imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order, to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me
Sort of like Daddy Dearest

[sample from "Mommie Dearest"]
"Don't FUCK with me fellas! This ain't my first time at the rodeo."

[Jay-Z] + {Biggie sample}
{"Uhh... uhh"} I dream filthy
{"My moms and pops"} mixed me with Jamaican {"Rum and whiskey"}
Uh, what a set off {"What a set off"}
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma it gon' be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know is we ain't speakin every day, I fuckin hate it
And, I don't wanna duplicate it
I done seen my mom and pop drive each other muh'fuckin crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me {"Uhh"}
I got his ego and his temper, all that's missin is the drugs in me

[Chorus]

[sample from "Mommie Dearest"]
"No... no, no... no, wire, hangers, EVER!!"

[Jay-Z]
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another, leave another
baby with no daddy, want no mama drama, I just wanna
take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on the terrace watchin the Eiffel Tower
and the Ferris wheel, yet and still nothin could prepare us
for the beauty that you be, Blue be
Lookin in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
without these back and forth thoughts? You too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanted to spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord, watch her take her first breath
And I'm tryin and I'm lyin if I said I wasn't scared
But in life or death if I ain't here
Apologies in order, to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me
Sort of like Daddy Dearest
