[Intro]
(Trials)
We have a whole lot of superstars on this stage here tonight
And I want you to know one thing, this is...

[Verse 1]
(Suffa)
Hilltop, that's where the blood runs
Thick, it's where kings bury there loved ones
Sick, kids guard their crop with a slug gun
From rips, move like Schapelle on a drug run
So quick, there's kids in the park waiting
These are my poison diaries like Mark Latham
So start hating, though you know in your heart
We've been owning this art since our flow in the park

[Verse 2]
(Mortar)
You can't serve me like Serena and Venus
Comparatively I leave you looking like the machinist
Cats know they've been hit, when I spike the mic level
And draw blood like intravenous
Without a pencil I'm hell bent
Leave dents in the condenser, you can tell when
Mortar's been in the booth to rhyme
I don't scratch vinyl, I scratch up the mic with my canines

[Verse 3]
(Trials and Sesta)
Mr Trials, young ladies jump in the sack
I never kiss and tell instead I fuck it and brag
I'm an angry drunk when I'm grabbing a rum
And skull shots till we fall from grace like Eric Clapton's son
South of the country, west of the city
Chip into that kitty if we're going to be drinking until the skank pretty
Will he attack? When he snap, got the track like
Bring it back, hear him rap? Isn't that Funkoars?
You can find us staggered in a cipher
Turning human traffic to a five car pile up
We leave them all for dead
I used to think big till it killed L, Pun, Smalls and Kev
Like bad move, got you looking like you're eavesdropping the devil
And T set the theme to send them to hell
Bet on it, you're never better, I tell them again
Seddy bury every adversary he put against

[Verse 4]
(Hau)
Fresh off the boat with an impressive approach
To writing rhymes like pressing your throat
The unquestionable dopeness, and oh yes
It's the one and only, in the house like the gun is on me
Got you gronks saying "blimey he's clever
He's brighter than that sun in the shiniest of weather"
Girls you want diamonds forever?
Well throw your hymens the sky if you feel the vibe

[Verse 5]
(Drapht)
None of gravities properties are on top of me
Can't hold me back from taking a stab like Chopper Read
Can't hold me back, I'm back around again like stalkers
My mic holds a force like a sword or a tomahawk
To Conan, walking with no man now
Cos you freeze when you spit like a snow mans mouth
Arouse with every word, first you've got to know this
We don't belong together like Rove and showbiz

[Chorus]
And we what?  Run with crew
Whose what?  Blood is blue
Through life's  Fucking zoo
And we might  Come for you
And we what?  Run with crew
Whose what?  Blood is blue
Through life's  Fucking zoo
And we might  Come for you

[Verse 6]
(Vents)
The saga begin, RPM drama again
My lung burn, dangerous carcinogen
Starving like Stalin in parliament in Prague again
In camouflage targeting
In Rock Creek Park, carve terror in the bark
Blueprint, build pyramids in the dark
The blood run deep, renegade creep
Hilltop connect bro, centigrade heat

[Verse 7]
(Muphin and Pegz)
Muph, some give me shit for my name
But I don't give a shit about you shit for brains
Been a long while so I know the game
It's more about music than your clothing range
We're here to overtake, setting the standard
Obese crew, we're the devilish family
Stand on stage accepting a Grammy
For the most incredible rapping since edible panties
Unforgettable pansies in a flickering fit
Knickers in a twist in a spiral of shit
Undeniable gift with decipherable spits
My fireball pit will burn you Muppets
True rugged, blue blooded dignitary
Crews love it when we do something visionary
Move up never lose touch, living ready
This is the hard road cargo hitting heavy

[Verse 8]
(Robby Balboa)
Robby Balboa bless the text
Deliver you ticket to death
Rivers of rhythm ripping the flesh
Triple your bets on the primitive pest
Selling sick smut from the cinema steps
It begins with a breath, a kid killing his pets
Just sitting in debt when I'm feeling a wreck
Life's a bitch and so we're wringing her neck
Fuck a metro in a pink shirt cos we're kicking the set

[Verse 9]
(Honz)
The Funkoars and the Hilltop, yes, we still rocking it
And I aint going near your bill unless we fucking topping it
I drink till I'm all over the shop like barcodes
And as far as rap goes, I've mastered my flows
Certified and we back again to wreak havoc
With these pads and pens so understand my friend
We about to take over just like Hove spit it
To the most gifted get them glasses up and toast with us

[Verse 10]
(Pressure)
Pressure MC, born with a mechanical mind
The talent of rhyme, instinctual like animal kind
Now I flow with the best, from east coast to the west
We live in the flesh like my raps sewn in your chest
You can't fathom the dopest flow, amateurs don't you know
What ever happened to a good old fashioned broken nose?
Don't become a casualty of my faculty
Damn I got spine but you'll never see that back of me

[Chorus]</pre>
