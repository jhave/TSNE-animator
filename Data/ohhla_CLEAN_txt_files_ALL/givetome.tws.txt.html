[Chorus One: Teala Chenae]
Oooh (oooh)
Do you like it when I take control?
Sic this kitty kitty on you (kitty on you)
In the kitchen, on the patio
It don't matter where we go
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, baby let's forget about love

[Twista]
Here kitty kitty
You wanna get up with a nigga from the Windy City?
I can see from your swag that you be feelin pretty
After the club then you gon' have to get it with me
Shorty might have a man at home
but tonight she want a brother that's buck, not a mule
She want somebody that cut like a tool
She want somebody that fuck like a fool
She don't want nobody that do it like a lame
She want somebody that'll give it to her like a thug
She got her shit that daddy got home for that
You better act like you know what to do with that gu'l
So I get down on the young and tender
Actin like a clown when I'm up in ya
You said we ain't makin love, just go on and beat it up
so I hope I don't offend ya when I'm in ya
Go

[Chorus Two: Teala Chenae]
Oooh (oooh)
Do you like it when I take control?
Sic this kitty kitty on you (kitty on you)
In the kitchen, on the patio
It don't matter where we go
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
We ain't makin looooove
You gotta give it to me, give it to me, baby let's forget about love

[Twista]
My boys don't give me drama but umm
I'ma have to tell 'em I want lil' mama to come
When I'm out in public I be the prominent one
But when we in the room she be the dominant one
Tellin me this ain't no time for no lovey-dovey thang
We don't really gotta get that mushy
Gave me the bomb on the knowledge
then laid back and told me to hit that pussy
She wanna be to handle my business
And gone 'head with all the sensual shit
She said "Pull my hair, baby grab my wrist
Let me turn around, I don't want a kiss"
So don't get up on the bed fo' sho'
On the livin room couch or the bedroom flo'
Baby it don't really matter where we go
Give it to her good 'til I make her go

[Chorus Two]

[Teala Chenae - repeat 2X]
Boy get over here, baby rip my clothes off
Music's in the air, let's do it 'til we doze off
I won't tell a soul, that you were such a freak
I can keep a secret, as long as you give it to me</pre>
