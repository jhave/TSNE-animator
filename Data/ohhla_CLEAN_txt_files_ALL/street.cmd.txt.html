Everytime I try to leave this game
These streets keep on callin' me (Streets keep callin' me)
Just keep on callin' me (Just keep on callin' me)
(x2)

Now, this ghetto got me crazy
And these streets got me trapped
Many times I've tried to leave
But this game keep pullin me back
In a circle full of crime
Bout to lose my mind
Shit, I wanna make a change
But I just keep wasting my time
Ain't no real future sellin' dope
Only few make it out
For a ghetto nigga like me
Got too many golds in my mouth
I can't get a job
Ain't nobody gonna hire a thug
And my rap sheet consists
Of 187 and drugs
And goin' in and outta jail
Everybody say I'm a fool
But even the President makes mistakes
Shit I ain't perfect to
I gotta do somethin'
Ain't nobody gonna give me nothin'
Got a mouth to feed
So I'm gonna keep these fiends jumpin'
On my block niggas
Shit I'm the man out of jail
I'm the jury and judge
So don't fuck with me cuz
It's like the Vegas Strip
These streets is always open
As long as the money roar
I'm gonna keep this city small

Everytime I try to leave this game
These streets keep on callin' me (Streets keep callin' me)
Just keep on callin' me (Just keep on callin' me)
(x2)

Now see the hood
It's all good
You ain't highly educated
So you just can't have shit
Cuz you will be playa hated
My boy just bought a new Benz
Now he's the man in the city
Now it was cool at first
But these niggas started actin shitty
I tried to go straight
But these fools just wouldn't let me
A nigga see me in the mall
So a nigga tried to sweat me
It was cool for a minute
Yeah, I thought I was free
But I knew I couldn't leave
Cuz these streets keep callin me

Everytime I try to leave this game
These streets keep on callin' me (Streets keep callin' me)
Just keep on callin' me (Just keep on callin' me)
