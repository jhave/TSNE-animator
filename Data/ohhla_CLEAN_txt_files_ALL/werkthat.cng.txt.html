Work that
Jerk that

Take that

Face down, tune it up
You want this money, then back it up

Pre-Verse: Chingo Bling
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa
Chingo Bling in the house, que te pasa

[Chingo Bling]
With a big booty thick girl jiggle like Playdoe
One eye closed and far away, she like J-Lo

(Verse 1)
She go hard, but that one go harder
Oooh Lord, must be something in the water
It's Chingo Bling, going hotten than salsa
Bout to run the game, playboy, you better boss up (Sweat)
Sweat til it smells like barcas (Sweat)
Sweat til it smells like patas (Sweat)
It's Sabado, ponle la bata
Habre la boca y taste this horchata

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
New skirt
Just got her hair done
What about the panies?
No, she don't wear none
Here my number
Call me long distance
Can't call Mexico? Buy some more minutes
Take a picture, put that on the wall
Cause them kind of boots, they ain't got on the mall
I'm V.I.P., we ain't s'pposed to be smokin'
But guess what, laws was meant to be broken
Wetback
Just like Gilligan
Worth a million, country like (???)
She got moist when she noticed the paint job
A pimp by night, but tamales my day job

Repeat Chorus

[Chingo Bling]
Vieja
Ponte la bata, es Sabado

Break:
(All in background)
[Chingo Bling] Horchata, jamaica, tres leches, tamarindo
               If you see la miga, you better tell Chingo
               Say chile con carne
[All]          Chile con carne
[Chingo Bling] Say you don't got no diamonds
[All]          You don't got no diamonds
[Chingo Bling] Say chile con carne
[All]          Chile con carne
[Chingo Bling] Cause Chingo tiene hambre
[All]          Cause Chingo tiene hambre
[Chingo Bling] Say gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
               Gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
               Say gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)
               Gimme what you got for a torta (Torta)

Repeat Pre-Verse

Repeat Chorus

[Chingo Bling]
All right, all right, all right
A lot of you guys don't know the real definition of manosa
Some of you manosas, don't even know you're manosa
A manosa is
Any girl that does nasty stuff
That shows her stuff
For some moneys
That's right
The pesos
The counterfeit
The cheddar cheese
Chalupas

Repeat Chorus

[Chingo Bling]
chingobling dot com sa la lavan, se toman la agua
Peace out!
Hey you manosa, pick up your money off the floor, you're making a mess
Stupid (Stupid...)</pre>
