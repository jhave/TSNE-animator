Chorus (2x):

You just don't know what you do to me
And I hope you know what you got

Master P:

I remember walking you from school and homies hate me
But I ain't tripping cause I knew one day girl you'd be my lady
Probably have my baby I know it sound crazy
But thugs need love and if you real girl save me
Your loyalty got me a sucker for love
And when I went to jail you sent kisses and hugs
And I could feel your lips through your letters
You said wait for me, 'cause you down with whatever
Now I'm out girl and we balling
Mansions, 600 Benzes, Lex Luther, trucks and Ferraries
Rolex watches and bracelets
Diamonds on your ears and taking trips in foreign places
Now we be hooked like drugs
But you been there from the beginning, that's why we call it ghetto love

And I hope you know what you got
You just don't know what you do to me
And I hope you know what you got

Mia X:

My thug love got the weight of the world on his shoulders
So every chance I get I try to grab him and hold him
Boo you know I care, I'm gone be there through the toughest of times
Trying not to ever stress ya take the pressure off ya mind
You my kind of nigga ain't nobody else gone do
I can't see being in love without you
Beside me, inside me, nothing can divide you and me
That's why them other broads know we gone be
I ain't tripping, although your ass be slipping sometimes
Running around and creeping but you know just where to find your true love
Before the fame the big names and the money
I was at the bus stop with you honey
That's why you got me pushing phat ass rides
With a swoll bank account living in a million dollar house, but don't doubt
If you gotta go back to the projects I won't diss ya
I'm coming right with ya cause I love you thug

Chorus (5x)
