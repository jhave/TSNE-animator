Get to the floor, aint no time run
Ying Yang in this thang, let me ya twurk sum' - (repeat 2X)
  
[Chorus 2]
Ying Yang in this thang, (Ying Yang) - (repeat 4X)
  
[Chorus 3]  
Pop that pussy like you suppose to to
Shack that ass like it - that's for Lou
Like 2 Pac all eyes on you
Make a nigga horny like 2 Live Crew

[Verse 1] 
Hoes get crunk for cheese, damn skippy
Like the bar kays and pay the little whippy
In they jazzy T's, bitches on they knees
Tryna make a nigga pay they ass to see a breeze
Hoes get crunk, for sho, for Gino
Steal from the strill, these bitches is on the pole
One on tope, but one down low
Ask them hoes if bout to to take it to the floor, HA
  
[Verse 2]
This one for the playas, this one for the g's
This one for the thugs that ride them gold d's
X's and O's, wanna fuck these hoes
Talkin bout they closed, you know how it goes
Hit the club just to see ya little ass
Every nigga in the club got cash
Smokin weed, sippin hin, gettin drunk
Pop that pussy and getta nigga crunk
  
[Chorus 4]
I say them niggas wanna hate, it's all in the game
We gon make them pop that pussy, Ying Yang in this thang - (repeat 2X)

[Chorus 2] - repeat 4X   
  
[Chorus 3] - repeat 1X
  
[Verse 4] 
You knew it all along, my pussy was hot
Everytime you licked the cat, it was like a fuckin hot
Now I cant getcha to leave me alone, 
small dick ass nigga, take yo ass home
I thought you could fuck, but I had no luck
Stupid ass nigga, you just fucked my day up
The way to make it better, all good and fat
get down on yo knees, and lick the cat
Spend some spend some (Come here)
Spend some spend some (Come here)
Hoodrats in this thang (Come here)
Hoodrats in this thang (Come here)
Hoodrats in this thang (Come here)
Hoodrats in this thang (Come here)
  
[Chorus 4] - repeat 2X
  
[Chorus 2] - repeat 4X
  
[Chorus 3] - repeat 1X
  
[Verse 5] 
Lets keep it real, lets keep it real, now heres the deal
Some hoes be pussy poppin for a fuckin happy meal
They phony, they direspect, they get neglect
They all up on the stage, it the mitch match sets
White top, pink drawers on, what in the fuck did they call you
Need ta go to the drawin board, you dont get the free award
What we like, juicy booty bitches, with the fat friends
Fake hoes get off the stage, and let the real hoes represent
  
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)
Twurk sum, twurk sum (Come out)
  
[Chorus 4] - repeat 2X</pre>
