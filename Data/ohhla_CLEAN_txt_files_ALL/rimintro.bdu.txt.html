1-  I wanna my rim shot, hey, digi, digi
    A rim shot, hey, c'mon
    I wanna my rim shot, hey, digi, digi
    A rim shot, hey, c'mon
    I wanna my rim shot, hey, digi, digi
    A rim shot, hey, c'mon
    I wanna my rim shot, hey, digi, digi
    A rim shot, hey, c'mon

I came to hear the band today
I ain't thinking about you
I came to hear my drummer play
Boom-klat-boom-klat
I am in love with you
Cause of the things you do to me 
When you boom-klat-boom-klat

Repeat 1

Give it to me, give it to me....
boom-klat-boom-klat....

Get your stick up against that drum
I wanna hear it
I want my rim shot</pre>
