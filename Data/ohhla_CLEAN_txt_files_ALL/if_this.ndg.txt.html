Typed by: SVswish@prodigy.com

(Chorus)
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world

If this were my world you know what I'd do
Take a million dollars out the bank, would you
give a half a million to the chronic man
Yes I would do it, cause I can
If this were my world you know who I'd screw
all the motherfuckers that be screwin you
Not that I'm trying to get elected man
I would set trip because I can
If this were my world the holidays would be
one for famous black folk and one for me
Just in case you dont know who I be
Make a holiday for the G-Funk king
If this were my world things would go my way
Every single day I'd have one more day
And if ever anybody got in my way
All I can say is first we pray - first we pray

(Chorus)
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world

If this were my world you could bet I'd clown
Have a mini mansion in every town
Fan mail comin in from all around
Asking me where did I get that gangsta sound
If this were my world it would only be me
Standin on the top of the industry
Bouncin like a baller over tight-ass beats
Remind yourself that can't nobody can bust like me
If this were my world everyday there'd be
another young brother claimin D.P.G.
Raised from the gutter taught to make money
Why do niggaz talk about what they can't see
If this were my world I'd take my gangsta name
Set it at the top right next to fortune and fame
Finally I got myself up out of them chains
If they lock you up don't let em capture your brain

(Chorus)
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world

If this were my world, you now what I'd do
Buy me a spaceship and a condo on the moon
If this were my world, I'd have a low low crew
We'd go roll your hood and do what gangstas do

If this were my world

(Chorus) x2
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world
If this were my world (If this were my world) My world</pre>
