Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	Yo kid won't you bust your little freestyle yo?
Say what?
You want me to bust a freestyle?
*chuckling*
I don't even know how to do freestyles main
You know I get paid to rap
	Bosko, bring the beat in main (aight)

I been rappin for half my life
I'm twenty-eight now sayin pass the mic
If you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool
I was born on the mic before you went to school
Talkin bout pimp game, you know whassup
I wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff
Now you're flowin like your name is water
But I'm ten years older and my game is harder
I'm not tryin to say you're out there dissin
I'm just tryin to say homeboy listen
Before you grab the mic and act wild
Bitin other MC's mackin styles
And it's all from head, passin round the mic
Never even care who you sounded like
You sound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach
Bit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest
And you gots no respect for me, is that right?
Well jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight
and keep rappin, I'm floatin past all the stops
In a clean ass Benz I have all the props
Don't need credit from a rapper can you match my Visa
I heard your girlfriend was a real trick pleaser
And a Too $hort fan, faithfully
When I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me

To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

Let me tell you somethin bout a playa named Short
Rappers always talk about the way I can't flow
But let me hit the mall with the same MC's
I be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's
While you walkin round broke, nobody knows ya
Lookin like you smoked a whole sack of doja
Outside in the parking lot in front of the cars
Standin in a circle with some wannabe stars
Freestylin, but you ain't original
Say you shootin everything when you sympin those
And to think you could hang with me
I never would spit this game for free
I'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-R-T
I rock all stages and any parties
Any my style is gettin bank
Gettin girls, gettin hella dank
I drop my top when it's hot and sunny
You can't talk about me you ain't havin no money
I set trends in the rap and don't doubt me
And care less when other rappers talk about me
I know all you suckers, heard me rap
So hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap
That's right, all night cause she's a damn good trick
Put them legs up high she couldn't handle it
I'm not a no good punk, I coulda dogged your mother
But Life is Too $hort, so I kept it undercover
Now you're all grown up, with your partners rappin
But old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened
To a fake MC, who tried to get with me
I ended his career, instantly

And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

*long musical interlude*

To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

Now ask New York, can Too $hort flow
Ask Detroit, they'll let y'all know
Then ask Philly, can I rap
South side of Chicago, who's the mack?
I never ever tripped when you slipped tried to rap about me
Everytime I perform, I make a lot of G's
Cause I'm paid in the underground rap world
Eatin good like two hundred pound fat girls
Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
in eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid til eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin don't fault the West
Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when the West coast laid it, we made it fat

And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
