I hate you
Can't stand you
Despise you
Detest you

[Chorus]
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise
When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

[Tech N9ne]
I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo ama so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer
I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G
I wanna sought ya, caught ya, and then offed ya
I hate what you become
Hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin your reruns
Hate givin you refunds
I call em how I see em
When I see scum
I free from
The legions
Cerebrum
I see none
See your just really dumb
Hate seein your whores
Hate cleanin your floors
Hate doin your chores
Won't be in your awards
Funk being your whore
Hunks being of course
You punks being endorsed
Chumps being assured
Dumped being divorced
To test you like a sickness
I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis
Built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate
It would be great
For you to skate
Off in a lake
A beautiful fate
I hope nobody is at yo wake

[Chorus]
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise
When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

[Tech N9ne]
We're livin in the cold age
Road rage
Dark no Sole
No way
Jose Cuearvo
There goes yo day
Every scare
Everywhere
Knows bogay
This life is too soft
Haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough
Hate you when you blew off
You coofa
Your crueler
So cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off
So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can underland in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my fam I slam you
Sammain
Champaign your family and you
I'm a monster when it comes to you
Conquer every one of you
Trade tours
Paid for
Your neighbor
Cause they whores
Pray for
Decor
Cause your state will create race wars

[Chorus]
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise
When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

[Tech N9ne]
I hate you when you destroy buildings
And kill millions
Of children
From black white Chinese Cicilian
I thrill
When you feel sin
Dealin drugs to billions
Awaiting your death
Miserable until then
I wanna put my Rebox
And get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus
Doggin is
Your botherin all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus
I hate what you stand for
Hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for
I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample
Yo
The world is very different now
No more hugs
Just shrugs
And Crips and Bloods
And drugs
Not see show no love
Never we be equal
My name is The Grinch
This song is dedicated to the evil people

[Chorus] - 2x
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise
When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise</pre>
