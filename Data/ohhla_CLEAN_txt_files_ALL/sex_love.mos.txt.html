Brooklyn,. Sex love and money, get up, come
Danger!!

You are now rockin with the best
Black darts exclusive, fire in the dark
Fire in the dark, ghetto let this spark!

[Verse 1]
Huh!
Freaky black beauty with the party pal
Where you work it out got me fiendin'--bam!
I hit the G ready for the street
Heavy, ghetto sweet breezing through the evening --bam!
I'm on the lounge path for the warm blast
Got the john shaft cocked back and loaded --bamm!
I beat it, word john! Body awesome
Is the way that you come that got me goin--bam
I'm on the back streets rollin
I'm playin back all the magic moments, don't front
You know I got'cha,know I got'cha
You sneaky freaky, but I know about'cha, know about'cha
You straight dope, I can't do without'cha, go without'cha
Lay back and relax you mind
I'm bout to; double the doses in half the time
Ha! Master physical, master mind
You play it quiet but in private that ass is mine, huh!
We body rockin the last of time
And then we, we body rockin the last of time
And then we, body rockin the last of time
And then we, her body rockin huh, her body rockin
Now shell on 1 deep it ain't nobody steppin
Honey shell on 10 deep it ain't nobody steppin
Thousand shell or hundred deep, I'm there the body rockin, come on!

I wanna show you in my ghetto miss I'm a star
I wanna show you luv, I just can't help myself
I wanna show you in my ghetto miss I'm a star

Freaky black beauty pretty purse and blouse
Where you took it out got me leanin'--bam!
I hit the streets easy in my seat
Lighting on my feet breezy like the evening --bam!
I'm on the lunch pack feel the warm blast
Boogie john shaft cocked and loaded --bamm!
Top and bottom, Body awesome

I'm on the back roads rollin (rollin)
I'm playin back all the magic moments, don't front
She know I got'cha,know I got'cha
