I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

[Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

1 - 	You can buy your hair if it won't grow
	You can fix your nose if he says so
	You can buy all the make-up
	That M.A.C. can make, but if
	You can't look inside you
	Find out who am I to
	Be in the position that make me feel
	So damn unpretty

I'll make you feel unpretty too

[T-Boz]
Never insecure until I met you
Now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me
Just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things
To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you
And then I'll get back to me, yeah

[Chilli]
My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Everytime I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
Can't believe I'm trippin'

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

And make you feel unpretty too
And make you feel unpretty

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
