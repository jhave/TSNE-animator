Song:   Can't Stop Me Now
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Money got ya tongue tied
It's a slow ride
Up til your going down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide
When
You
Wear
The crown

[Pitbull]
Give it to me!
Tell people that you sing on the radio (can't stop me now)
Same people you don't see on the radio (can't stop me now) [x2]

They Said I couldn't do it but I did it
Fought TBP ? beat the most attention
Met with all labels they didn't get it
Now I'm taken over
Fuck a with it
Time ta get flithy rich
Try ta stay not guilty bitch
They said they used ta handle bricks
I believe them when they projects are brick
All they rap about is crack n coke
Knowing they ain't never dealt crack or coke
Yea it's a joke
But thanks cause I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Haha

[Chorus]
Money got ya tongue tied
It's a slow ride
Up til your going down
Funny how your friends lie
It's a landslide
When
You
Wear
The crown

It's not how you fall
It's how you get back up- dog
Struggle, hustle, fight- hard
That's all I know is right- dog
Blood of a king
Heart of a lion
