Live each day like your last, one day you'll be right
Until that moment happen, I reach new heights
It's amazing how evil the world can be behind a beautiful face
Summertime murders, when heat get erased
My friends say MF you're in outer space
But I have to blast off, I hate this place
I mean I love it so much but it's going to waste
Mind control, people don't know what's real
Programmed to kill so we reach for steel
American Hunger, everyone is a meal
Fuck napkins, thieves wipe they mouth with sleeves
United States on it's own young it feeds
Born to starve because of others with greed
Trapped like lab rats causing the craze
But I want out this maze I say

This is for the trees (the trees)
The birds (the birds)
The bees (the bees)
The all-seeing eye, floating in the sky
A satellite named Horus
This is for the sun (the sun)
The moon (the moon)
The stars (the stars)
We are watched from far, by the all-seeing eye
A satellite named Horus 
This is for life (for life)
For death (for death)
Separated by one breath
Yes we're blessed, until all has left
Monitored by Horus

Tell me is there a way out?
I walk through the doors of Hell, it said stay out (I didn't)
Fell even deeper, trap floor was hidden
Programmed to eat fruit that's forbidden
Mankind don't live up to it's name
Not kind at all, devour their brothers
Crying at funerals, kiss their mothers
Backstabbing, for nines they're grabbing
Loyal to enemies, our lives they have 'em
I boil as a mic fiend, knowing I'm sensing
Feds do stakeouts at my concerts
Hoping I cross lines cause I'm a lifer
Corrected my wrongs, turned uplifter
Divine is comedy, from pain come laughter
With a clean slate I choose to die with
While in park, I look up at sky

This is for the trees (the trees)
The birds (the birds)
The bees (the bees)
The all-seeing eye, floating in the sky
A satellite named Horus
This is for the sun (the sun)
The moon (the moon)
The stars (the stars)
We are watched from far, by the all-seeing eye
A satellite named Horus 
This is for life (for life)
For death (for death)
Separated by one breath
Yes we're blessed, until all has left
Monitored by Horus</pre>
