Typed by: Sunshinez53@aol.com

Headin' for the south lands
lookin' for some fun
Down below that dixie mason
I know your the one
My tongue is chasin' my eyes are wide
I can see paradise
I been down here once or twice
but I never seen it look so nice
ahhhhhhhhh yeahhhh
ahhhhhhhhh yeah yeah
I like it with the grass cut low
Big mountain tops valley below
I love it when you scream out my name
Kid Rock, what you say?
Kid Rock, what you say?
Kid Rock, what you say?
Kid Rock Yeahhhhh
Cause I'ma bad maama jamma from Detroit city
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city
I'm raw and greedy, show me, gimme, I'll nick it
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand

From Detroit to New Orleans
I love the life but I never sold my soul
All them late nights, and early mornings
Let me show you what I learned out on the road
Let me show you what I learned out on the road

You know I've tried a thousand times and I've tried to explain
And I've cried a thousand times over things that I can't change
I've learned a lot you know, I grow each passing day
And I blame nobody but myself for mistakes that I have made

He's a bad maama jamma from Detroit city
Rock from southern Alabama back to Macanow city
I'm raw and greedy, show me gimme, I'll nick it
Gimme a slimmy and a jimmy I'll stick it
Pick me up lady or beam me up scottie
Late night shaddy let me slip it in your body
I'ma scramblin' ramblin' straight travelin' man
Spreadin' Moejo Sam, please understand

From Detroit to New Orleans
I love the life but I never sold my soul
All them late nights, and early mornings
Let me show you what I learned out on the road
Let me show you what I learned out on the road

Lord knows when your not here, I get so damn bored of me
And I've spent some lonely nights that did not have to be
And if you could only see, I swear I'd show you true
And although I carry a load out on the road,
I wanna come back home to you

From Detroit to New Orleans
I love the life but I never sold my soul
All them late nights, and early mornings
Let me show you what I learned out on the road

From Detroit to Carolina
I love the life but I never sold my soul
From London town down to China
Let me show you what I learned out on the road
Let me show you what I learned out on the road</pre>
