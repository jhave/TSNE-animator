[chorus 1]
Walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Buck at them niggas, they ain't no muthafuckin soldiers
Walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Buck at them niggas, they ain't no muthafuckin soldiers

[Verse One]
Can't get no ???
If you do better watch your bizack
Can't get 'em, catch that click-clack
That mean these Soldierz got a hizack
Gotta get that fo-fo, rahseeda, coalition up in this bitch
And we ain't takin' no shit, ATL done hit a lick
Old fake ass clown, don't even flex
You ain't no soldier, gotta wear your vest
Or you'll catch one, two, three, four, FIVE off in your chest
We bout to (DO IT!) We fixin' to break this fucker off
We gettin' (TWO WAYED!) That 404 ain't even soft 
We gonna (walk like a soldier), we gonna (talk like a soldier)
We gonna (Buck at them niggas, they ain't no muthafuckin' soldiers)
Muthafuckas better get your mind right, man fuck these foes
We bout to throw some elbows and put some meat on these hoes
BITCH!

[chorus 1] 

[Verse Two]
What? What? Now nigga don't talk the talk
If you can't walk the walk 
Rasheeda, that trill bitch buckin niggas who soft
And if I gots to bring that fi-fi, nigga you die
Fuckin with that 404, won't say no more, 
I beat that raw ho
Who keeps the club crunk?  See I just don't give a fuck
I shine it up, cock it back, and ask them what's up?
Cause I be droppin it, droppin it, poppin it, poppin it
Walkin it, walkin it, shit it ain't no stoppin it, stoppin it
Make them niggas say "damn," and hoes say "what?"
ATL forever bitch and we just don't give a fuck

[Verse Three]
AHHHH! WALK LIKE A SOLDIER!
Give me the ??, let me put em on
?? we'll take it slow, AHHH!
TALK LIKE A SOLDIER, "ATTEN-TION! PARADE REST!"
Reville in this fo-fo
That C-P to that E-P to that D-E-C
Lotta fuckin' soldiers want to march with me
Paper chasin' is victory!
Now you can tell that I'm a soldier by the way that I walk
And you can tell that I'm a soldier by the way that I talk
I stay tatooed down, I throw my soldier rag up
I gonna keep this thang crunk, now who in the hell wanna buck?
Look at me, look in my eyes!  Soldier boy, I'm ready to die!
Coup Deville, my D-A-N-K, 404 it's time to ride
College Park to D-E-C, ATL gonna follow me
East Point gunnin, Riverdale gunnin, 
Rest you soldiers get to runnin!
SOLDIERS!  ATTEN-TION! Come and march with me, I got
Something in my Caddy that your ass gotta see
Tech-9, banana clip, glock nine up on my hip
In my trunk, I got more, I got enough to start a war!

[chorus 1]

[Verse Four]
Layin back in the club, tryna stay cool
But you know I gotta keep it on real, tell you how I feel
Like a fake ass soldier thinkin that they hard like Bogus
With a fat chip on his shoulders
When you see the Chevy come around the corner
Betta cry, let your mama know its gonna get messy
Please don't test me, all that game you poppin at the club
Cause I'm really impressed, I see that
Alcohol got you thinkin that you really the king, 
Now you wanna go and grab the steel
But before you do anything, I think you better watch out for
The Cadillac Coup Deville with the lights off, and the mask on
Ready to blast on anyone who thinks they +BAD+ like Michael Jack-son
Face down, on the grass, son, that's how we laid you down
And when we took all your plat-NI-um,
That's what you get for tryna be a real killa
Drug dealer, nine millimeter, where's your skrilla?
Pop a nigga just to make your name bigger
Now how your punk ass wanna be a wig splitta?
Muthafucka betta holla now you wanna get up outta your predicament
That you got yourself in
Coalition come through like a tank 
That'll leave your body stankin right next to your best friend
Black nigga wanna be on my nuts, wanna be on somethin?
Fuck, nigga, be on these slugs
The whack, on the other hand, is out of control
I can feel them hollow tips fuckin them up
Streets off, wanna ride, niggas better recognize
Who the real Soldierz, fo-fo make you cry
Southside, whether not dumber niggas ain't tryna put a nine piece
Pop! Made them dumber niggas lay down</pre>
