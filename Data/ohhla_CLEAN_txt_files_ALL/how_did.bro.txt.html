I gave him seventy-five thousand and my...
	Told him don't cash it till Monday

But y'knahmsayin? But I guess the cheque cleared and shit

You know, it ain't all about cats that look at it and think that
You know, Gangsta Grillz is just all about
Y'know, niggas selling dope or clapping niggas or, or whatever the fuck
