Ay one two... (Yo we're recordin'...yo, come up on the mic a little bit)
Check, check check (a'ight)
Ayo, yo yeah bring in them keys real quick though
You know what I'm talkin about, yeeah
Eyedea and Abilities in the house, two-thousand and three
Bringin' you that DJ..MC...just some good hip hop music
Yo, you ready to get into this? (yeah)
Well drop that beat then...

Ladies and Gentlemen (EA, EA)
Ladies and Gentlemen (EA)

[Verse 1]
We bringin' it back to basics, situated under the basement
The nation is guaranteed to hit the pavement
You slept now you're bobbin' your head
So hard your left with a permanent injury to your neck
The turn of the century's way behind
We raped the time and she gave birth to the First Born drafted this design
What? You thought our second record wouldn't be live? Suprise!
Why'd it take you so long realize only the strong survive?
Without the need for compromise, no one's above us, in context
Your whole genre's elevator music playin' on the way up to where my songs sit

[Verse 2]
You sold a lot of records, but I got a question
How many endin' up back in the used section... all of 'em
Yeah Abilities' beats bang
but he ain't makin' nothin' for you, so stop callin' him
I had enough of these pretty punk emcee/DJ duos
pseudo-boy bands holdin' hands in public
Your candy-coated condom-flavored karaoke cover songs
Are no longer accepted so I suggest you exit *back*
Back on a mission to corrupt human brain waves
Unconcerned with circumstantial turbulence, we learn to aim straight
With every endin' there comes a new beginnin'
Listen we got to clue you in on just what you've been missin'</pre>
