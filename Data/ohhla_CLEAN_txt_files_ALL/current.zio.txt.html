[Verse 1-Zion]
Posted up on the block, kinda eyein' the spot
Late night city life got me twitchin' a lot
Kinda nervous, I'm sure that we under the watch
Cameras touchin' every surface, soon the drama gon' drop
Be it the cops, or just another government plot
Got a brother under surveillance, the harder you rock
The harder they clock, camouflage, I'm part of the flock
Feelin' 'noid 'cause they never caught who shot Tupac

[Verse 2-The Grouch]
Well, this beats makin' 'em bear, and so I'm takin' it there
Strip it to the core, ooh, primal fear
Men keep it iron, no tears
Don't know why your son came out a one-legged albino queer
Something's in the water
They wanna vaccinate my fate, ain't got enough dollars
It's not a mystery, True Crimes, white collar
In due time, what you find mind alters

[Hook-The Grouch (Zion)]
Current Affairs to thrill your mental
They want you p'noid boy, it's simple
We wide-eyed, ain't afraid to look
Hold your guard, don't get took
(Listen to me....Say somethin'
Can you hear me?...Say somethin'
Say it now...Say somethin'
It's goin' down...Say somethin'
Listen to me....Say somethin'
Can you hear me?...Say somethin'
Say it now...Say somethin'
It's goin' down...Say somethin')

[Verse 3-Zion]
Yeah, I feel my spidey sense tingling, signaling danger
The street is a beast and she's sleepin' with danger
We so scared, all we want is to change her
Waitin' for The Coming, baby, Mary and manger
I'm so sick, addicted, twisted with it
My Natural Mystic burn bullshit Hasidic
Still, satellites like a thief in the night
From the heavens for a sight, that's an alien flight, real

[Verse 4-The Grouch]
Meanwhile, back on the block, it's hot
People in the cold, holed up in a box
Watch my back young cutty while I let off my thoughts
My sixth sense tells me they set off a lot
My seventh sense says they lie and set five
To keep us in line, but I've got more eyes
More cryin' wolf, more dyin' need more lives
Them veteran sinners send college cash bribes

[Hook-The Grouch (Zion)]
Current Affairs to thrill your mental

Say it now...Say somethin'
It's goin' down...Say somethin'
Listen to me....Say somethin'

It's goin' down...Say somethin')</pre>
