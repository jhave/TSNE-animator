[Intro]:
You know alot of girls be
Thinkin my songs are about them
This is not to get confused, this one's for you

[Chorus]:
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best

[Verse One]:
Know you got a roommate, call me when it's gone in there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there
(Yeah!) I be over there shawty I be over there
I be hittin all the spots that you ain't even know it's there
Ha! And you don't even have to ask twice
You could You could heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin he met you in the past life
Sweat pants hair tied chillin with no make up on
That's when your the prettiest I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringin Drake along
You know that I'm workin I'll be there soon as I make it hooooooooommmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeee!!!!!
And she a patient in my waitin room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And till them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with cause...

[Chorus]:
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had

[Verse Two]:
+Sex, Love, Pain+ baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I coul pro'lly sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the iss-ue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial 
She call me the referee, 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiiiis-tle
Like the Andy Griffith them song
...And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin bra strap pop
All up in ya slot 'till the nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin...

[Chorus]:
Baby you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it 
You be up on everything other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we 'gon live it up
She made me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best,  you the fuckin best
You the fuckin best, you the fuckin best
You the best I ever, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you the fuckin best
