[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Woow, one day, they tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Dooown, way down

[Kanye]
We gon' last today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you evern wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggaz marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say "No habla ingles"
And everybody want to run to me for their SINGLE
It's funny how these wack niggaz need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Ask me from the heart, y'all all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel somethin

[Brandy]
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get ya
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let ya. They tried to bring me down

[Chorus] - 5X</pre>
