[Intro] [Mother talking]
Alright listen. You got 15 minutes to get ready. You're gonna miss the bus again. 
Did you hear me? Well, I got two options for you. 
Either you finish school or you find a job and help out around here. 
I don't know what you think you're gonna do living like this.

[Scratch Chorus]
"I'm feelin' another part of reality" - Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'
"Let's take a sec to think back" - Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'

[Verse One]
I'm from places where blacks live a block from the racists
You can go to hood to wood in twenty paces
Casinos and kilos of blow is how we famous
And Raekwon's song +Incarcerated Scarfaces+ is CT
860 to 203
Where you can come up pumpin' a few O.Z.'s
Tryin' movin', well respected, duh, you know me
A Doe Raker, always stay around a few O.G.'s
Who push substance
College kids tryin' to cop somethin'
Down at Grattin at the Naval base, hoes stay buzzin'
Run around, stay fuckin', always cheatin' on they husbands
Saw her creepin' at Mohegan even though she said she wasn't
Ask my man Mo
Them younger dudes in New London 
Been puffin' on that wet, get upset and start gunnin'
Me and Open Mic used to roll with Zulu in New Haven
Till we build with Alien Nation and made the seperation
That was '96
+Killin' Me Softly+ was my shit
I remember Louie flipped when he had a bad trip
Left school my freshman year, plannin' to rap
Thought I was dyin' when I started havin' panic attacks
It's like

"Let's take a sec to think back" - Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'

[Verse Two]
"I remember"
125th Street in '95
"I remember"
K-Superior taught me to rhyme live
"I remember"
Travelin' to Philly to record with Vinnie
"I remember"
Celph first movin' to New York City
"I remember"
Rock Steady's Anniversary was insane
Beatnuts, Fat Joe, Pun, Big Daddy Kane
Gang Starr, Organized Konfusion, a lot of names
But around '99 everything changed
The Internet blew up
Fans turned to rappers
Rookies swore to God they was microphone masters
Complete metamorphosis, a turn for the worst
I feel like a preacher man and someone burned down my church
Been all over this Earth and now that rap is my work
I don't love it like I used to and that shit hurts
I'm like '88 days
Smooth shit to rock
Gold ropes thick as tomb ships use to dock
It's like 

[Scratch Chorus] [x2]

"Let's take a sec to think back" - Crooklyn Dodgers 'Crooklyn'

[Verse Three]
"I remember"
Mayday's basement in the summer
"I remember"
Rockin' Hawaii with 8th Wonder
"I remember"
One important thing and it had to be
"I remember"
When my father told me to look up the word apathy

[Outro]
Yeah, uh. Curdy Cut, rest in peace. Yeah, uh, Demigodz. Yeah, uh</pre>
