[Chorus]
It's all hood, put him on the set...
It's all hood, it's all hood...
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
It's all hood...

[Daz Dillinger]
We from the West Coast... The City of Angels
Where we love to swang them thangs
Where we love to bang on you
(What up Diggy Daz?)
Man, I'm straight West Coast'n
The B-dogg's B-doggin', the C-R-I-P's straight loc'n
Eastside, Northside, Southside, Westside
Land of the set-trip, where we all ride
We don't die homeboy, yeah we multiply
Do this for life, the homeboys gettin' hood stripes
It's the nigga that ya love to hate, with a double dose
Dogg Pound bangin' nothin' but the West Coast
Throw up your set 'cause we love to ride
In the city where them young gangstas born to die

[Snoop Dogg]
If you're from the West Coast nigga  (Give it up!)
If ya love the West Coast nigga      (Give it up!)
If ya don't give a fuck nigga        (Give it up!)
West Coast niggaz for life, nigga    (Give it up!)

[Chorus]
It's all hood, put him on the set
It's all hood, it's all hood
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
(It's all hood) It's all hood

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' actin'
Niggaz do another video in the hood I'm straight jackin'
(Give it up) No more T-shirts with the khakis
For all you off-brands, gotta get a new tactic
It's a mind of distraction
Hollywood goin' back Hollyhood, nigga we blastin'
Askin' no questions, givin' you suggestions
On how you need to get yo' ass up out the West'
Cause we put niggaz on the set, slide up on him with the tec
Make a nigga run up out his shit
Havin' fun up out his shit, nigga come up out yo' shit
Yeah them West Coast niggaz is sick
I sent a lil' bitch upstairs
She played with it, layed with it, made a nigga say "fuck yeah!"
Thought you was a player or a boss
Lil' bitch on the twist for the chips, call her Kriss Kross

[Chorus]
It's all hood, put him on the set
It's all hood, it's all hood
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
(It's all hood) It's all hood

[Kurupt]
Nigga, let me just bang out on these
punk-ass motherfuckers tryin' to bang out on us
Ride out on 'em, slide out on 'em
Sock his ass nigga, inside-out on him
You take from us but you never give back
I'ma dump ya bitch ass out, nigga like that
I'ma bounce the Cadillac around and back
to the hood motherfucker, waitin' to get a sack
Try that, get bombed on so fast
Nigga watch who you with, watch where you at
Me and D-A-Z, we gonna watch where you at
Just in case we gotta pop up and squash where you at
Land of the .9 millimeters and K's
When we came to your town we had pies for days
You deliver us, we got high for days
Then we robbed all your homeboys and dipped away, nigga

[Chorus]
It's all hood, put him on the set
It's all hood, it's all hood
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
(It's all hood) It's all hood

[Outro: Kurupt] (Daz)
Yeah, Dogg Pound Gangstas
What you claim homie?
Yeah, bangin' out on these bustas, D.P.G.
Yeah, new millenium shit bitch
All hood... what can they do about that, Battlecat?
Daz, Kurupt, Bigg Snoop, Nate, G-Dub, what up cuz?
(My nigga Soopa-doopa') - fly... bitch!
(West Coast, uh
My niggaz out in The Bay, all the way down
Yeah, you know what time it is
Battlecat, let 'em know where we from)
Let's ride out, Daz

[Chorus]
It's all hood, put him on the set
It's all hood, it's all hood
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
(It's all hood) It's all hood...
{"L.A."}
It's all hood, put him on the set
It's all hood, it's all hood
{"L.A. - City of Angels"}
It's all hood...
{"L.A."}</pre>
