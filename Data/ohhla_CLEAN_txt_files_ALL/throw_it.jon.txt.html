[Pastor Troy]
The last nigga is the pastor
Ready to blast ya
You know I don't play no mother fucking games
DSGB you know the name
Wood grain in the mother fucking Dooley Truck
Got the black and red seats with the Georgia tuft
And I got my helmet hangin out the winda
Ready to  bust the head .of a fucking pretender
Nigga as soon as I enter
You know im making noise
Pastor Troy and the Eastside Boyz
AK bustin I ride the whole clip
I cock that hoe and let it mother fuckin rip
To sank shit is what I live for
Fuck him, Fuck her

Put some more Yak in my mug
So I can throw it up

In the back of the club my tommy gun

All white fuckin S fucking six
Young ass niggas I guess we filthy rich
My whole click ready to bust some heads

You know the routine 
Represent for the home team
