Finesse, now I'm smooth sensational
Educational, here to awaken you
On top of you, rocking you, here to get popular
Me fall off? Picture that with binoculars
Whatever's clever, here to reign terror
I get better cause I'm well put together
Nifty, wiser, a soul survivor
I stand higher, going out like MacGuyver
Terrific, not egotistic
To be specific, I'm greatly gifted
Commentator dictator created cause I'm greater
With the rhymes that are based on data
Or info, cause I rock a smooth tempo
And like that y'all is a funky intro-
-duction, my DJ is doing the cutting
So tought MC's ain't really saying nothing
I don't need to try and rap, cause I'm fly at that
So on the strength you'd better quiet that
Here to tempt you, 19 with dimples
Rocking fresh rhymes is funky but quite simple
Unforgettable exceptional, I'm intellectual
So incredible, one step ahead of you
Equipped for an emergency, don't try burning me
I get poonany plus keep the currency
So who has the audacity to come after me
And think about ragging me, that takes strategy
And I'm sly, eminent, skilled not an immigrant
Others are intelligent, but not equivalent
To me cause I'm treacherous, swift and impetuous
I'm a rap specialist, but I bet you this
Poet gets better, swifter than ever
I'm so clever, puting rhymes together
Microphone magician, I could do tricks with this
It adds on just like arithmetic
The man to examine, so outstanding
More perplexing than a game of backgammon
Mike Smooth, sqing this and kick this
It's your turn to come and get with this

	"Track the movement" - Cut 3x
	"Don't lose it"

Lord of deception, keep in step and
Pay attention to the man with the blessing
Cause I can rap smooth cause I'm that cool
A slick brother with a fade and a half-moon
I crush MC's but I'm not in a gang you see
And I doubt if other brothers could hang with me
I make 'em cross the border, those I ought to slaughter
And I guzzle MC's just like a quart of water
Wax and tax them down the hatch
And I sound so funky you have to ask
"Is he?" I throw my rhymes like Frisbees
I'm more fun than a date in Walt Disney
Quick and nimble, less than ?ten deep?
Rhymes I make, break, create, and assemble
Lyrical genius, mic defender
Those who don't surrender I crush and injure
Now that was hype, funky to rap to
MC's I tackle if I have to
Now bust a groove, I'm in a hype mood
Melt duck MC's like Ice Cube
Lord Finesse write rhymes at my rest
Do my best when I'm out to impress
So don't push or try me, play or defy me
Wax MC's from here to Hawaii
Out to cuff and snuff, don't sniff or puff
Rhymes I write is crazy extra tough
Now I'm the baddest, way above average
The funkiest MC out to do damage

	"Track the movement" - Cut 3x
	"Don't lose it"

I get wild like Conan, funky to a slow jam
Clap your hands and get down to the program
Cause I'm the baddest and I do damage and
On the mic I'm quite swifter than the average man
Think I'm funky? I'll be funkier next week
I kick the rhymes smooth on the technique
I'm a get hype now and rock the right crowd
You're so attached that it's hard to put the mic down
Crowd prestigous, and I believe it's
Quite hard for others to achieve this
Agree cause I'm top-notch, on time like a stop watch
Suckers jump on my tip just like hopscotch
I got a slick plea shape, a funky DJ
The crowd is always getting hype to what he plays
My man Mike is just the type
To mix the hits, while yo I just rip the mic
I'm like a samurai, he's like a shogun
Cause on the microphone I fear no one
Mike get funky, and let's start this
Cause we're going to get paid regardless
