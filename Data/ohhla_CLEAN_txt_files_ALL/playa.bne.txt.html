[K] All my niggas, my niggas, my niggas...
Killa, me killa, me killa, me killa, me killa

[K] Time after time after time
[F] Lord, why we gotta deal with the haters everyday?
[K] Why must I got the glock nine?
[F] Why we gotta deal with these haters everyday?
[K] Time after time after time, time after time
[F] Lord, why we gotta deal with these haters everyday? 
Come follow me down East 99, down East 99

[Flesh]
Nowadays, make me go to pack a pump
When I'm tryin' to stay thuggin it
In the way, playa haters see me, get a grudge
What's on they mind?
Nigga, that's sluggin' it
Got a feelin' to swang, hang, bang
Had a bullet headed to the top, drop
And the playa haters same old, Mo Thug, Bone
Nigga roll, strut these nuts, get a pap
Tossed in the Cuyahoga River slain
Test the Fifth Dawg
Slip the clip in, rollin' on
Yellin' off murda mo
Better jump in the ?,
Now we're (looted thugs, smug) here I go
Let's serve them hoes
It's on, niggas sick of this hater-ism
How my gat gonna try to keep comin'
Ain't it hard dealin', slangin' dope
Fill the block with the niggas here to run off the Bone
Well, here we go with the untouched feelin' rythym
Hoes feelin' a nigga to put in their eardrum
Every now and then fall into ?
Stand the post when the Bone ?
Runnin' through the one under the top lock
Gotta creep how we hoop
And shot the rock through the bomb-ass house party jumpin'
Look in the hood, last stop, and we won't stop
One got dropped, oh why deadly, oh so deadly
Throwin' these thangs in a Gang of people mine
Runnin' up on me, it'll be dreadful
Flesh come to be the boss with pride, no time

[Layzie]
You got the clout
You got the clout
So much clout, Mo Thug is what it's all about
And I'm livin' in a nation of abomination
Suppress the playa hatin' on a mission 'til the million see me
Sucka situation, should I be personally waitin' for 
These party poopin' fakin' muthafuckas mistakin'?
Play me like I'm loose, when ya need to get your shit right
'Cause I got my shit tight
Fuckin' with a nigga a thousand proof
And I'm raisin' the roof when I'm startin' this fistfight
Set it off, that's me, O
T-H-U-G, original thug
From the C-town, outlaw squad
You niggas can't touch me with a ten-foot rod (rod)
'Cause I'm rollin' with God
Peace be still, peace be still, make a move
And I'll have to hurt ya, dog
If  I got the time, then I'm a repent that
The devil wanna make me murda
Layzie, Layzie, lately my mind be goin' crazy
Save your soul
Oh, what can I do?
Tell me, what can I do?
Got me holdin' my gun with persistence
Show these judgin' niggas no resistance
I'm a hit you with a beam at a distance
In a instance, this shit is gonna change, and I'm in this

[Krayzie]
Nigga, gon' get pap pap and put in a coffin
Now, why must we playa hate?
'Cause a nigga crept on a come up
And brought all my niggas with us from day one they roll
Ya know, what a nigga wanna test me for?
Bless me soul, ? all, and that's for the jealous bustas
Who said that Eazywould fuck us
Everytime I pull up on the block
To smoke with my partners outta Red Dog
You got me some? Got some
Niggas is trippin' on your niggas spendin' cash, money
For the five-double-o-Benz's
And I'll bet that they schemin' to rob me
They plot me that 187
They got me all fucked up, fucked up
Krayzie be pinnin' when niggas be trippin' they down with us
Act like it, the money, the fame
And the weed and the drink
Nigga, let's sweat they thang
My thugstas spit ya game
Buck 'em all down with the fo'-fo' blows
They're so far away, kill em all, kill em all
Well, if I could teach the world to be (to be)
A muthafuckin' thug in perfect harmony
Harmony, harmony, harmony
In state to state, in state to state -
Everywhere they playa hate, they playa hate
Buck 'em, buck 'em, buck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em

[Flesh]
Take a look in the trunk
We got what all you need on the double nine
Better go with your heaters
Got killas to meet you, greet you
Y'all come creepin' through the cut
See the Bone, now me stick a lick up
Come up good when they stick you, waitin' for the day ?
So you done got me flippin' on coppers at all
Got a nigga frustrated
I hate it, got me aggravated, trip to Hell
And it's murda, my Lord
Tossed in the coffin for fuckin' with the Fifth
It ain't easy, seein' 'em wig-split up on the curb
Pump my humps on 225, when I kick the rhyme
That's five points on the Richter scale and a hell-a herb
If Flesh overheard you was hatin', talkin' not to my face
Better hope, pray, for me ready, I pick up place, spray the AK
Everyday be the same on a level, too, shovels graves
In the sight of a psychopath, TEC and lead 'em all dead
Than a mobsta Johnny Gotti with a tommy, try to gun
Then I blast, haul ass, kick up dust
Gonna rush when I bust had to get a little trigger happy
And I got a lot of my daddy in me
Got the genes of a soldier that man me, get it out
Ask me, and I'll be gladly to let ya know what it is, the deal
That's if you can handle it without turnin' playa hater
Later, so keep it real
Muthafuckas, that's on the real

[F] Why we gotta deal with the haters everyday?
[K] Time after time after time
[F] Lord, why we gotta deal with the haters everyday?
[K] Why must I got the glock nine?
[Fl] Why we gotta deal with these haters everyday?
[K] Time after time after time, time after time
[F] Lord, why we gotta deal with these haters everyday?
