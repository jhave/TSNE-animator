Check it, check it, check it, uhh
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And uhh, she got the hots for me the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh no, oh no, she got a man
and a son, doh'ohhh, but that's okay
Cause I, wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mami hittin
And in no time.. (no time) I.
I better make this one here mi-i-ne.. and that's for sure
Cause I, I never been the type to, break up a happy home
But uh, there's somethin bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma what's it gonna be?  She said
{You don't know what you mean to me}  C'mon!

[Chorus]  w/ Nelly + J.D. ad libs

[Nelly]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
I see a lot and you look and I never say a word
I know how niggaz start actin trippin out herre about they girls
And there's no way-ayy-hey, Nelly gon' fight over
(I ain't fightin over NO dame) no day-hey-ame.. as you can see
But I, I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his 2-seater
Now that's gangstah-ah-ahhh.
And I got special ways to thank yah-ah-ahhh.. don't you forget it
But uh, it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But uh, you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turn to leave, she said.. she said.
{You don't know what you mean to me} she said.. she said, c'mon!

[Ali]
Remix, Kelly, Nelly, J.D., Ali.
Now when I met her, she had on her Burberry sweater
Preppy college girl, graduated, drove a Jetta
Said she wanna go out but her man wouldn't let her
I said  damn ma, you could be doin so much better
And I  roll up a L on my way to go get her
Cause I  get what I want cause Nicky Sets' a go-getter
And I  took her to the Card's and Cubs double-header {Cause}
Then she left her man, I'd approach him with a formal letter like

[Chorus] w/ Nelly + J.D. ad libs

[Nelly]
Yeah, yeah
East Coast, I know you shakin right, what
