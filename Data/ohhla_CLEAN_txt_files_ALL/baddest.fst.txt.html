Song:   The Baddest Man Alive
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Dan Auerbach]
I can take the pitchfork, from the devil
Keep a super suit like I'm incredible
From the deep blue sea, to the dark blue sky
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll grab a crocodile by it's tail
Handcuff the judge and put the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman break down and cry
I'm the baddest man alive

[Chorus: Dan Auerbach]
I'm the baddest man alive
I'll take no measure, and I'll take no drive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
I'm the baddest man alive
I'm the baddest man alive

[RZA]
Not bad meaning bad, but I'm bad meaning good
Say my name three times, and you knock on wood
Candyman hooks, I'll terrorize your hood
Flashing macs on a cop, the way a gangster should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath, then I'll walk through fire
Bear hug a grizzly, suck milk from a titty
Take the sergeant hat from his head and use it for a Frisbee
Spit in a crocodile's face, have a menage a trois with two female apes
Then sleep in the barrel of butcher knives
I drink honey, straight from the bee hive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State, butt naked
Rollerblade across the Golden Gate, butt naked
With the baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
When the grim reaper come out, look him right in his eye
I'll bust off in the face in the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth
Hehehe, I'm the man who stole the golden fleece
And I'll date rape Beauty right in front of the Beast
The baddest man alive, and I don't plan to die
Come on, somebody

[Chorus]</pre>
