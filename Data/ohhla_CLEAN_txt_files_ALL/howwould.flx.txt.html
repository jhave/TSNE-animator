(Oh)
Ginuwine, Funkmaster Flex
In your earhole, whoo!
Drop a bomb to this, what?
Let's do this, listen

Saw her in the club
As she was about the finest thing I had ever seen
I was so addicted cause she was like a drug
And I was a fiend
I wanted to walk over
Imagining her body was calling me
I had to get with it and make it quick
I had to hit cause baby girl was a dream
I wanted to say

1 - How would you like it if I...
    Touched a little
    Felt a little
    Grabbed a little
    Could you handle if I...
    Licked a little
    Taste a little
    Ate a little

Repeat 1

Yo second verse
Kept staring at her hoping that she would see
And maybe call me over
I was gifted but my confidence wouldn't let me
So I sat back and thought things over
(What I get?)
Got a bottle of the Cris (Oh)
Got a bottle of the Mo (Oh)
Now I'm looking like a Don Juan
So I know she gotta notice me
Over all the others
Cause they be singing all the same songs

Repeat 1 (2x)

Finally walked over to her
Told her she was the finest woman I had ever seen
She told me why'd I take so long
Cause all night she was already peepin' me
She said she likes a man who knows what he wants
Never fronts and ain't scared to ask
She was down for whatever
So I took her to the floor, got together
And I tapped that ass, yeah

Repeat 1 (2x)

Yo Flex take em there
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

[Flex]
You know what I mean
Ginuwine, Funk Flex
Epic Records, shout to Pauly Anthony
Shout to Dave McPherson
60 Minutes of Funk Volume Four baby
Funk is back nigga

[Ginuwine]
Put your hands in the air
Could you handle it, oh yeah?

Repeat 1 (2x)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, Ginuwine, Funkmaster Flex</pre>
