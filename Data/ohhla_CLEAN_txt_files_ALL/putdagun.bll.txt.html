[Intro/Chorus: Jay-Z sample from "Threat"]
I'll put the gun to ya, put the, put the gun to ya
I'll let it sing you a song, I'll let it sing you a song
I'll put the gun to ya, put the, put the gun to ya
I'll let it sing you a song, I'll let it sing you a song
I'll let it hum to ya {*BLAM* *BLAM*}
I'll let it hum to ya {*BLAM* *BLAM*}
I'll let it hum to ya {*BLAM* *BLAM*}
I'll let it sing you a song, I'll let it sing you a song

[Bill Ray - Verse 1ne]
Yea, BLAT! But I ain't Bloodin or Crippin
That's for the next muh'fucker in this bitch trippin
Broads get to duckin, niggas get to dippin
Catch it in his neck and his back and his hip and
Shit, I ain't got time to run my lip and
Nigga, I'll throw the clip in, soon as a motherfucker think I'm slippin
Shit, I'll put a hole in a dude..
And his broad, and the nigga that's holdin the dude
Shit, one shot'll turn your brain into a smoothie
Known to make the niggas scatter, like the Superfly movie
I'm rich, bitch~! But a dead man can't sue me
So I spilt a nigga wig and leave him floatin like a buoy QUICK!
Or you gon' be the next nigga hit
When it's on, they +break fast+ like my grandmama's grits
I put cats in black suits, similar to Eartha Kitt
'Cause I don't open up my lip, I just open up my clip and..

[Chorus]

[Bill Ray - Verse 2wo]
Yea, rappers is crazy, they be beefin like it's somethin
Then you see 'em in the Source, huggin like it wasn't nuttin
Shit, talk about me up in the mag
I'll run up on your Jag, and turn a nigga fro into a shag
On the radio like he mad, talkin 'bout this and that
Catch him to put the barrel to a crab
Dog, Billy Ray be the truth
Play Bishop, the Juice, and I'll give your Caesar a sunroof (yeah!)
Man, I pop a nigga aloose, if his mouth is in use
That ego be chirpin just like a Boost {*chirp*}
See I touch 'em like a masseuse, put 'em up in the noose
And leave his ass hangin from the roof (on the roof, dawg!)
Soon as a nigga flip to us, we kill 'em like it ain't shit to us
I'll leave a nigga like he missed the bus
So he's best to hush! 'Fore your next man is under US!
All because...
