[Bahamadia and Rah Digga together]
Mediocre rappers gettin all this play
While the underground rappers stay around the way
Even up and coming heads gettin lead astray
But us female rappers gon' be OK
(repeat 2X)

[Bahamadia]
Yo, this is the orifice to mythical mindstate
I'm pure as opposed to the fakes y'all makin legends of
It's ridiculous, showin wack niggaz and chickens love
cause they playin in rotation and constantly gets buzz
but it's aight though, majority rule for this hype so
I play the background until it's my turn to blow
Never jeal', record it like I see it cause my vision swirl
minus the weave and nails you gettin rawness from Illadelph

[Rah Digga]
Uhh, I bounce the Reebok's, and smoke Hawaiian cheebas
with the ese's, with Pepe's, and the mida's, with Fila's
and come back to lay the vocals
Milky like Total, tighter than Krunch's
I showstop they homegrown like contraceptive sponges
with cutthroat raps, plus I'm fuckin with the SP-1200's
and 950's, when C-Low's fuckin with me
Loop kick snare link it up with the semi
I set warfare like when the doctor yell "Clear!"
Hits below the belt but no bitin on the ear
I'm worser than a Colt boy with punchlines trife
Battle 40 MC's and make em take they own life
Now what's this talk about a marketing scheme?
Nigga please, I crush all MC's ?sardi deez?
Dead or as they take em, you faker than Muslims eatin bacon
or growin some dreads, now you Jamaican (bwoy)

My thoughts lose you, in the logic that they glue to
Diverse channels they move through when I will spit influential
Workin on your mental sort of like sermons at holy temples
Neotepic and nimble when deeper than baby dimples
Style the vulture, I laced it so you could observe closely
These opuses unfolding insuring the heads quote me
Off the top of written each time I finesse it I be shittin skill
infinite, bask in the eloquence internet
You know the repoitoire, ghetto platinum rap star
Sixteen bars of inspiration from Allah rightfully God
and these Goddess poetics, reflectin off geocentric
720 essence promoted to Earth lesson
I shine like flourescent whenever I'm blessin it
Fuckin with these independents now and lovin it

[Rah Digga]
Yeah, cataclysmic, Rah Digga be the rhythmic
cutie who can shit raps, like government get kickbacks
Hit em overseas with the hellified remix
cause everything I hustle, like Blaj and Jay-Z shit
I want my videos filmed on location
Blow up the station if I ain't in rotation (yeah)
Knee deep in patients, on a cowboy ranch
Now I found a new branch, Golden Girl like Blanche
Out to take niggaz bank, make em walk the plank
Spot's yanked when I make it Big like Tom Hanks
Fuck East, fuck West, I'm comin from up North
Baby tryin to see Glory like the 54th
and I, even set it on all y'all she-rappers
Get out of line I make you look like Wee Papa, Girls
My MC skills are for building
Ship a million, shit squeal like Sicilian
