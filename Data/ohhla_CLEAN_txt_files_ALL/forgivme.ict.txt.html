"In the year 1982 a music was created.  It was given the title: Gangsta Rap
It had no positive messages, no redeeming value, hated and feared
By the establishment, it changed the course of the world"

(SLEJ)
Ride as my jabos, cocked my straps watcha back
You know where you at? You in urban combat
So stay alert, use the attack of the tactical expert
Puttin in work, and leavin your troops with wet shirts
Your casuality rate is high, I'm closin in
Prepare for your ultimate end, tell your family bye
Better cool like Egon, and shine like veegon
Pissin on your beons, for decades and eons
You squad has no muscle plus you, my new hustle
Fuck scuffin up my knuckles, rather buck you and watch you buckle
I can't stand a snitch, a switch real bitch
I got some transcripts to say you been runnin ya lips
Now its on, on site, if I see you I'mma sin ya
If I catch you in traffic I'mma gift ya somethin in ya
Letcha battle with death for the prize of life
I learned ta never come empty handed to a gun fight
My advesaries feel fright, his last sight
Was a flash of light, you said lightning could strike
From the same place twice, I have your head on my death
1500, tonights your last night gettin blunted

"The voices could not be stopped, it began to morph
And reinvent themself, I grew like a black blade
Moving like a tornado from the west to the east coast
Leaving behind a path of destruction and mayhem"

(Laquan)
Thick's ice fix ghosts infrared no remorse
And low from the exchange, psycho derranged
Playa lay no feel pain, killa cocka-main
I'm top framin the game, use muscle for the hustle
I zip duffle bags to muffle fags
Scuffle my knuckles bad on niggaz that think that they runnin shit
They feel the punishment, uh, blood bath, the wrath
Aftermath, at least the guns in shit
Too under fallin charum leads to send up on the earth
Mix things with daughters with men
Since poured from birth the worth for the others
Go to war with my brothers
I'm unstable like Kane did to Abel
I'm out the stable sinnin from the beginnin
Leavin daddy's little girl pretty linen bloody red
What's said in the book of dead is now all forgotten
My soul's rotten, still the blood's spilled I feel
Chills, I'm still plottin, I'm ill-norm
Take life forms like light storms I laugh at the wrath
Of the guys comin on, visions of the antichrist is risen
The question is now, am I unforgiven?

"Legends tells that the creator of this poison's name was Ice
Although, others have told different stories, no matter
Who or what invented the monster, their souls would be forever
Damned to Hell"

(Ice T)
Enter the death chambre, cash richer, leave ya nutless
Cutless with the raw scope, double ya dope
Feel my back lash, body cash your whole fam and media
Greedy shit, tag ya out the rag Jag, speedy shit
Look in the sky, the four horsemen bustin no discussion
No stoppin its apocalypse, lock and load ya clips
Gonna be rich and dead, copa said don't matter cats scatter
Suckas get touched, niggaz get rushed
Watch em transform into animal form, wicked Hell-born
Lord of the Flies, cry and ya die
Mechanama come masses soul snatcher, fallen angel
All angles covered for you fuckin God lovers
Possession, good suggestion run cuddle your funds
Double your guns, watch your kids grow, stay out my flow
Be wise, the magnificence, evidence, decadence mind
Seven sins, the abomination, I'm
That nigga, last nigga, street mack
Hot is my strap, wet is your back
Understand I never forgive, leavin bodies like seive
Clap gats til my fuckin shit's clipless
Niggaz bear witness

"Like any deadly disease, it has infected many men
From the east, west, north, and south, gangsta rap is now
Alive, God forgive me, God forgive me"</pre>
