[Ice Cube]
It's a man's world, but check the girl
With the Mac 11, 187
Hit the switch, front, back, side to side
Corner to corner, punk you a goner
Don't fuck around and get doled up
Cause we got the Westside sewed up
Ike and Tina, Marie and Donnie
Ashford and Simpson, Clyde and Bonnie
I don't know karate, but I know crazy
You'd better ask somebody
And when I do dirt, jerk
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

[Yo-Yo]
I'm the type of girl that's down for my nigga
I'll lie for my nigga, peel a cap for my nigga
See he don't mind me flirting, wearing tight skirts and
Cause when it's all over it's curtains
What they don't know won't hurt
Uh, they searching on him, I got the gat in my skirt
Yeah, just clowning fools
And my dude's giving the girls blues
My gat is quite fat, don't you think so, ho?
But come out those clothes, my nigga can fit those
You ain't seen nothing til you seen us both jacking
Pulling on the side of fools, straight ratpacking

	[Ice Cube] Got me a down girl on my team
	[Yo-Yo]    The Bonnie and Clyde theme, yeah
		   Got me a down-ass nigga on my team
	[Ice Cube] The Bonnie and Clyde theme

[Yo-Yo]
See every now and then my man had a plan
To hook me up with his closest friends
Take me to the bar, maybe mingle and kick it
Let him think he's getting over while I gank him for his riches
Robbing, stealing, killing at willin
Always on the go cause his shit was always loco
Giving up funky vibes to all you funky tribes
Stick together like us and hoo-rides
Like Bonnie and Clyde we gonna slide right on
Let my nigga take over, I'm taking my bank to the house
When we get to the house we straight celebrating
Giving up that gangsta ?triggeration?

[Ice Cube]
La la la, watch me par-lay
Hey, with the getaway car
Now here comes the Predator
I'm down with Yo Yo and everybody is scared of her
Hitting with the wicked shit
I'd like to dick a chick
But now I'm robbing quick and split
So give me that money, devil
One for the treble, the rhythm is the rebel
When you turn red
You get a hole in your head, a fucking hole in your head
Cause my freedom got an AK
Bonnie and Clyde equal homicide, yeah

	[Yo-Yo]    Got me a down-ass nigga on my team
	[Ice Cube] The Bonnie and Clyde theme, yeah
		   Got me a down girl on my team
	[Yo-Yo]    The Bonnie and Clyde theme

[Ice Cube]
Run run run from the ghetto bird
Cause I'm down and I got the third-
Five seven, pointed at your boys and hos
No one knows where the lead poison goes
Cause I'm in the ho checks
Yeah, come off the Rolex
If not, I'm a give Bonnie some
Film at 11 by Connie Chung
No regret, on man wet
Leaving the scene throwing up my set
Hit you up and then I'm out
Yeah, you're left with a dick in your mouth

[Yo-Yo]
See that gangsta mentality drove niggas to insanity
You wanna be down to kill a whole fucking family
You can lock us up if you want, don't matter
But give em a bail and we'll be right back at cha
Don't underestimate me when you date me
Got my clamp off safety, that'll make you hate me
Frankly, I don't give a damn, once again I slam
You'd better ask who I am
Riding all around town, everybody's looking round
Cause we're known and we throw down
Cause you know a nigga done got ganked for his mail or his dank
Yo Yo and Cube is in the house for 9-tre

	[Ice Cube] Got me a down girl on my team

Yeah you trick motherfuckers, you thought I fell off
Stupid ass... (laughs)</pre>
