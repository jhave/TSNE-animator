[Vents]
I can't stop till my mind's a mess
Spend the weekend trying to rest
The next week with the side effects
I'm terrified to die in the fiery depths
But more scared of life, anxiety, stress
I'm still trying to guess who you're trying to impress
Looking hard mate, haven't had your vitamins yet?
Get right up in step with the basics
Red pill, blue pill, nothing but party in the Matrix
Neo the one, reload the gun
Then blast at the agents, past information's
gone with a memory lapse
Seen a mate from the past and I buried the axe
Feeling very relaxed
In fact, it's like "Peace to you brother"
Never leave your peeps in the gutter, teach and discover
Reaching another like Telecom
It's the medicine, get it on like Lebanon

[Chorus]
Everything but the room is shaking, lose the bacon
Losing the plot from the biccies I've taken
Feeling like a vacant lot, I'm rollin' balls
and I like it a lot, you don't stop
When the room is shaking, lose the bacon
Losing the plot from the biccies I've taken
Feeling like a vacant lot, I'm rollin' balls
and I like it a lot, you don't stop

[Vents]
I got a bunch of old mates in the place, we bout to roll face
and a honey in the back that said we're soul mates
Put the record on loud and it sound incredible
Didn't even worry bout monday's medical
But don't forget it's a federal crime
to feel this damn good in a very short time
I'm "Born to Roll" like Masta Ace
You staggering, arrogant, plastered mate
Half a case, glass to face
Heard women love a bastard, gripping on her arse and waist
Nice fella gone basket case, on the alcohol
That's why the Vents stay down to roll
Sniffer dogs at the park jam looking for drugs
But I could drink till I'm lying in a puddle of blood
I could drink till I'm beating up my kids and wife
But two pills in your jeans is a record for life, alright?

[Chorus]

[Vents]
Yo, and I'm gurning, burning, piping hot
Going up like Everest, climb the rock
Teeth falling out my mouth cause I grind a lot
Even Suffa's like "Vents, man it's time to stop"
I pop biccies and rock cities, everywhere I'm touring
And I know it's bad, but it's better than the boredom
I'm forcing the love, serotonin to flood
in your synapse, no compassion without drugs
in your blood, nothing above, God is dead
So bob your head, you killed him, gone to bed
It's the sleep deprived with the bloodshot eyes
and a hole in my mind about a gunshot size
I'm facing out till I'm passing out
Anybody acting hard, kick the bastard out
It's the roller, told ya, nothing but an E thing
Two days without eating, rollin' balls

[Chorus]</pre>
