[Verse 1: Bun B]
You see the sun goin down and the moon starts to rise
The winds pickin up and it's lightnin in the skies
Everything darkens and the clouds start to form
That's when you see an underground king bring the storm
Settin out the bait like he's goin for the kill
With black leather gloves wrapped around the blue steel
All about the green give a damn how you feel
You got yellow down your back you can't rock with the Trill
Leave you red from head to toe, give you the blues
When I fix you with some light grey cement shoes
I rode trues and vogues, nice blades and pirelli's
On that O Six benx the color of apple jelly
It's a wrap for you pimpin, like a hoagie at the deli
You was the man back in the day but you Fell like Felly
Now it's a new king on the throne with the roar of the crowd
It's Bun B and while I'm holdin it down, you can't stop the reign

[Chorus: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door

[Verse 2: Papoose]
Do not disturb, the King usin the bathroom
The Queen's bathin his body the tub with the statue
My physical is pure, covered in no tattoo
Chillin in my throne the man's home is his castle
You only got a one track mind or what have you
I need a passport for my brain my mind travels
You don't know who's a snake till after they attack you
How do you identify 'em not all snakes rattle
Savages on DVD's comin at you
My concepts is too complex I leave 'em baffled
I'm so far passed you why would I have a battle
When I'm already winnin the war in the rotten apple
I never been selfish it's a non stop hassle
Even when I made peanuts I shed cashew
Try to stop the reign where the pump double barrel
Papoose I'm a bang it on you like Shaq do

[Chorus: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door

[Verse 3: Shaq Diesel]
CD's in the cockpit of a hot drop top whip
Livin Miami style worth of flocks and shit
The platinum plaque hanger, track stranger rim rack banger
Dominerical baller homey I'm no stranger
Diesel Dog Mafia dough propper
Flow alone got me spittin these hot flames with Big Poppa
And I still represent the Bricks
Just like dirt, like when they used to flood the bricks with bricks
From now on call me B.I.G.
No disrespect to Notorious B.I.G.
R.I.P. but damn when your lookin at me
You be like damn Shaq Dog do it B.I.G.
I got a Phantom same color as butter
When I ride by niggaz be like damn I can't believe it's butter
Believe me dog I ain't never gotta spit
Iced out grill that says Shaq O'Neil's the shit
Can't stop the reign I told you that man
Money Mark is my bullet Cousin Kenny is my gat man
Dog and Box got my back man
Kayslay, Corey Gunz, Main Street, Lil' Shaq man
That's my circle, try to break it I hurt you
Ain't no gettin out that, I doubt that
Classic maker, resurrect hits smash to bits
Can't you see I mastered this?
What's beef? Who gives a fuck I'm not knowin
Stop askin me 'bout Kobe, D. McNabb, Terrell Owens
The world is mine and you can't get with it
I'm a King not a rat, get it
And I don't pick chicks, that used to pay Deez a visit
Until I married somethin esquisite
I just gave y'all thrity bars, my garage got thirty cars
Four, five and sixes

[Chorus: Razah]
You can't stop the reign, you can't stop the reign no
When it starts to fall, when it starts to fall
There's no one left to blame, I said it's no one left to blame
If you locked that door, if you locked that door</pre>
