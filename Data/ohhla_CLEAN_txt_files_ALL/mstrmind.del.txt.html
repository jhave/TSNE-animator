Who fuses the music
With no illusions
Producing the blue prints
Clueless?
Automator - defy the laws of nature
Electronic monolith throw a jam upon the disc
The futuristic looper with the quickness
Hyper-producin' hydrogen fusion liquids keep your distance

First we coerce your brain patterns
Collaborate with time-consumin' re-programin'
I apply the flow cannon, the combo so slamin
Automically reconstruct the old canvas
His logic impress, a hypnotic effect
Ya latin patent you could call it a gift
Man he all in the mix nuclear physicist
Geneticlly taylored every bit of this stimulus

Psyonically bionically forget how you feel
Especially formulated the rest of you fornicated
It takes more to make this
He juggles variables
Unparreled propulsion to carry the load
Nueral surgeon the purest virgin conducting currents
Musical merlin he shines like sterling
Watch the Automator draw laser of a higher intensity
And instantly miss a beat create a symphony

Hey I know now, I know now repeat
Automator's on the planet earth  
and he's gonna stop the war of the worlds
Deltron Zero is here as well take the cut for real
He told y'all evil do'ers he is 
truly gifted in the matters of rhythm
Ya you got to give him that
In his infnite wisdom you know you got to get with him</pre>
