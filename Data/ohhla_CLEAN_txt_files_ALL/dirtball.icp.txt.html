Galacto Inspector do you read me?
Yes Captain.
Status?
Completed.
Your mission was to land on the Dirtball and explore it thoroughly.
You were to monitor the activities of a common life on the Dirtball,
And study peoples life styles.
Their general habits of living in their strange society.
Yes.
Have you done that Galacto Inspector?
Yes I have Captain.
Very well, may we have your report?
A strange place this Dirtball is
A lot of guns a lot of rich folks spitting on bums
A lot of hoodlums
These are just the bums that are really pissed off
Why? Probably cuz they been ripped off by the system
Cops, they ride around in little cars
And throw folks behind bars, like little jars.
They supposed be there just to serve and protect,
But they just punch faces a lot, and choke necks.
Then they got the higher ups they call judges, and they rule the land.
This I don't understand.
First of all they like to dress this bitch up in a robe.
On top of all that, "What?" he's mad old.
And he hates anybody that looks different then he did back when he was a 
kid,
But that shit was like 400 years ago.
Captain "Yes Galacto" I just don't know.
Any kid that was going to jail. Yeah?
He looked me dead in the face and said "Stale."
Then my cloaking device must of went dead. Why?
Cause the old ass judge looked at me and said.

(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

Very interesting, thank you Galacto Inspector
Now probes Data (Day-ta) and Data (Da-ta), do your read me?
Yes, here sir.
What information were you able to gather for us on your recent voyage to the 
Dirtball?
This is professor Data.
My transmission signal is weak and my communication is shattered.
We came in contact with several different specimens of life.
Everything has got a price even if it's wrong or right.
Upon sight people judge and stereo type.
Their forms of government and religion are glorified.
Purified as the waters that are now polluted.
Members of the flock recruited for duty, locked up, or instituted.
This is doctor Data I phase with the planet to see how they medicate her.
She's high off that cane.
Depending how you slang you can get most anything.
&gt;From a nickel bag of grain to a lucy worth of cane.
Maintain communication Data here again
Their leader is determined by the vote of many men
Although he's only human and slightly over weight.
He control's and manipulates their whole United States.
I call to the white castle.
Secret service on the phone giving me a hassle.
He said the information I requested was denied.
Before he hung up the phone he took a deep breath, stopped, and replied.

(Chorus x2)
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

Judging from the information so far collected
The Dirtball may not be the ideal place to land our craft
After receiving this information we'll make our final judgment.
Fleek are you there?
I'm here, but hold up captain cause this ain't good.
I'm getting chased by some fat rednecks in white hoods.
I think there trying to kill me "Well what do you mean?"
It seems they got a problem with the fact that I'm green
I guess on the Dirtball they all hate each other
If it ain't were your from, it's your skin color
Let me get my phaser tron out, hold up (buzz)
"What was that?"
I smoked 'em
But what really fuckin turns my tentacles is their relationships.
They swell each other's lips.
I see men that ain't shit in their daily life.
So they come home drunk and beat they wife.
She forgives him when he say's he didn't mean it.
You ask me they can both suck my petty lip.
I give up captain beam me back to Zelaloovy.
Another thing they love to watch horror movies.
But your not allowed to be scary on a CD.
They tried to ban this one group ICP.
I went to see 'em in concert J grabbed me by the head,
And then he took his microphone and said .

(Chorus x6) 
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
This is our world
So get the fuck out

(Chorus x4)
Get the fuck out
So get the fuck out</pre>
