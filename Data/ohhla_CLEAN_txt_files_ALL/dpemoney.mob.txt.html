Dope, money, and hoes {*9X*}

[Da$h]
Ain't write it, thought of this when I was drunk driving
Like I had a license, been swerving through the intersect
Just to make the bitches wet, breakfast: yac and cigarettes
Feds about the only threat, spit nasty like my throat is strep
She working at the pyramid, shake her butt for some bucks from Tut
Pharaoh to the marrow, Cleopatra roll my dutch
Double blunts they double stuffed, got a nigga stupid chopped
Used to squad these faggots' wives, the bitches that I used to pop
Where the shit I used to cop, respect your elders lil nigga
Ain't even of age to drink, I get your ho to buy me liquor
'Linquent shit, I live for it, they tryin but might die for it
These drugs got my brain, money got my mind finding fun in crime
Bitches love my rhymes, to be honest I love their mouth at campuses
Looking for talents just like I'm a college scout
Ask her what she shout, I'm mash her on the fucking couch

[Da$h]
Dope, money, and hoes, getting dope money from shows
She sniff her coke that she blow, fuck it, I don't judge it though
Sugar free, no love for sure, just put 'em on Sepulveda
Benefits and bank rolls, all a nigga really want from her
And when she bring it back, call my brother hit the trap
Invested in a couple packs
will probably see a couple stacks from what he talkin
Money hulkin like Bruce Banner
Panarama day dreaming, washing down my semen on camera
Life's in action, piping, smashing whatever you call it
Smoke a 'Port and I'm off but they think I fucking lost it
And my dog facing blunts while I feed my pups bath salts
Infiltrate my castle, take your face like it's a mask boss
Pass raw flesh and bone, money long like small intestines
{?} taking breakfast, long as getting checks involved A$AP nigga
Cause if you ain't know, AraabMuzik</pre>
