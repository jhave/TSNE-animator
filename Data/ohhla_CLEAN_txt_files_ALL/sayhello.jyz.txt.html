Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Uhh...
It's that Roc-A-Fella music, soulful

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Say hello, to the bad guy (hello) they say I'm a bad guy
I come from the bottom, but now I'm mad fly (say hello)
They say I'm a menace (hello) that's the picture they paint
They say a lot about me, let me tell you what I ain't (say hello)
They say I'm a bad guy (hello) say hi to the bad guy
I come from the bottom, but now I'm mad fly (say hello)
They say I'm a menace (hello) that's the picture they paint
They say a lot about me, let me tell you what I ain't (say hello)
Ay (say hello), ay, ay, ay
They say a lot about me, let me tell you what I ain't

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
I ain't playin, life's short so I aim
I ain't waitin 'til lifers start betrayin 'em
It's twice as hard to get a job as payin 'em
So I ain't payin attention to what you're sayin
Raindrops keep fallin on my brain
Cousin in the drop all flames
I'm so hot even if the weather change
I don't have no top, I'm insane
'Member dark-skinned Jermaine
Who swayed in the rain, we sorta kinda the same
'Cept, I'm no lame, and you gonna know my name
Before I go the world gon' feel my pain
They sayin, I'm a bad guy, why's that?
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga I react
Secretly though, I know you admire that
You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrrap
Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh
You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrap!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
I ain't no ordinary nigga
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya (IT AIN'T~!)
Extraordinary figures (damn)
I'm an extraordinary nigga
Before my name became Jigga
Before I sang I had that thang on slippers
Can't complain 'bout what they ain't gon' give ya
That ain't gon' get ya shit, might as well give up
Or get up, get out and get somethin nigga
Get a job my nigga, or get to dumpin
Only God can judge him, only he without sin
Tell me if my means, justified my ends
'Til then, I'm just gon' fly in the Benz
Wire my friends, through Western Union
Shhhhh, suprisin
My system knockin, here comes the bad guy again
Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh
Hello, uhh here comes the bad guy again

[Chorus] minus last line

[Verse Three: Jay-Z]
... let me tell you what I ain't
We ain't thugs for the sake of just bein thugs
Nobody do that where we grew at, nigga duh
The poverty line we not above
So I come to mask and gloves cause we ain't feelin the love
We ain't doin crime for the sake of doin crimes
We movin dimes cause we ain't doin fine
One out of three of us is locked up doin time
You know what this type of shit can do to a nigga moms
My mind on my money, money on my mind
If you owe me ten dollars you ain't givin me nine
Y'all ain't give me 40 acres and a mule
So I got my glock 40 now I'm cool
And if Al Sharpton is speakin for me
Somebody, give him the word and tell him I don't approve
Tell him I remove the curses
If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect
When Jena Six don't exist
Tell him that's when I'll stop sayin bitch, BEEEITCH~!

[Chorus] minus last line</pre>
