[Chorus]
My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours
My-my chick bad, badder-badder than yours

[Ludacris]
Listen, I'm sayin my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that your chick wish she could
My chick bad, badder than yours
My chick do stuff that I can't even put in words
Her swagger don't stop, her body won't quit
So fool pipe down, you ain't talkin 'bout SHIT!
M-m-my chick bad, tell me if you seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena
All white top, all white belt
And all white jeans, body lookin like milk!
No-no time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell yo' chick to go home!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Ludacris]
Now-now-now-now-now-now
Now your girl might be sick but my girl's sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
Will knock a bitch out, annnnd FIGHT!
Comin out swingin like Tiger Woods' wife
Yeahhh, she could get a little hasty
Chicks better cover up they chest like pasties
Couple girlfriends and they ALL a little crazy
Comin down the street like a parade, Macy's!
(Whoo!) I fill 'er up, balloons!
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
D'oh! But I ain't talkin 'bout Homer
Chick's so bad the whole crew wanna bone her
Yeah!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, now-now-now-now
Now all these bitches wanna try and be my besty
But I take a left and leave them hangin like a testie
Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a Hefty
Runnin down the court I'm dunkin on 'em, Lisa Leslie!
It-it-it-it-it's goin down, basement
+Friday the 13th+, guess who's playin Jason?
Tuck yourself in, you better hold onto your teddy
It's +Nightmare on Elm Street+ and guess who's playin Freddy?!
{My chick bad} Chef cookin for me
They say my shoe game crazy, the mental asylum lookin for me
(Ha ha ha ha) You a rookie to me
I'm in that wham-bam purple Lam', damn bitch you been a fan!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Ludacris]
Luda, DTP!
And when we all alone {I might just tip her}
She slides down the pole {like a certified stripper}
When we all alone {I might tip, tip her}
She slides down the pole {like a certified stripper}
When-when we all alone {I might just tip her}
She slides down the pole {like a certified stripper}
When we all alone {I might just tip her}
She slides down the pole {like a certified stripper, I kinda like that}</pre>
