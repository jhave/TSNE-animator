Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I represent them jet planes, Young Roddy
Trademark, and Wiz do the same thang
Fly over the city where the hammers bang
Miracle to make it to this age in the physical
And not have fallen victim to violent crime
Living in these wildest times
Your assailant could be a partner of mine
Octogon signs can't stop a nigga when his mind on them digits
did you figure I could take the day off how?
With tomorrow I'd be better than I am right now
Change clothes, change hoes, change in my ashtray
Pay the toll with a hundred I got the next 99 motherfuckas who coming
If I say that I done it, or doin it presently it's either that or I'm frontin
In Antlanta actings for suckers
Grape weed in the jar call it smuckers
Put it in the grinder while your up shut the blinds for me momma if you bout it

Is you bout it? well say you bout it bout it
I roll one you match one if you bout it bout it
Trees in the blender got some kief at the bottom
Would of told you but I got high and I forgot about it
Jets nigga, bout it bout it, roll and match one if you bout it bout it
Smoke one for C-Murder you are not forgotten
You lookin for spitta you find me where it's cloudy, cloudy

Yeah nigga I'm rollin thru, orange coup, candy suit, chrome shoes
Attention given to spitta your bitch is ignoring you
You a simp homie she ain't like the way you think
She like "poor me some of that" she can't pronounce what I drink
Aspiring models, showing groupie love to them niggas with 20 bottles in the corners of them clubs
And on the real I been so old g, before my time when I was 17
My main girl was 25
Ain't seen nothin like it in your life
Hot spitta space jammin livin flow so on ice, nigga

Is you bout it? well say you bout it bout it
I roll one you match one if you bout it bout it
Trees in the blender got some kief at the bottom
Would of told you but I got high I forgot about it
Jets nigga, bout it bout it, roll and match one if you bout it bout it</pre>
