"When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets" --&gt; Sermon, from Rampage on
                                                  EPMD's _Business as Usual_
(repeat 4X)

Verse One: Erick Sermon

Chill and relax, I'm back in effect
Yes I'm Erick Sermon, with a brand new cassette
Deaths turned spoiled, rich like top soil
Still loyal still the MC Grand Royal
I'm still dope I'm still no joke
I'm don't care, I'm still wild like Tone Loc
I'm swift, a.k.a. a black stallion
Fat herringbone, with no medallion
Hello, I still got the same funk flow and yo
I still get busy like Arsenio
When I rock I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight, like Whitney
Houston, producin a style that make a smile
To make you say, "Ooooohh chilllld!"
Bust the steps, the picture, frame it
Hall of fame it hang it so no one can claim it
I rule from my style from the Boondox
Now my shit pumps in the boombox
Yo Red, my ears are ringin
*sings* Heyyyyy, Erick Serrrmon!  Heyyyayyyy!
Uhh, rock the mic honey I love the way you sway
Plus you have the crotch to drive me crazy
I'm replyin rude ("slow down baby" -- LL Cool J)
I'm ill, smooth as Johnny Gill
Gill, my my my, I pack steel
So back off softie, here's a ice cream cone
Put down the microphone
Thank you, right about now I'm through
I'm ghost like Casper... see you!

        "When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets" (repeat 4X)

Verse Two: Redman

Funky fresh in the flesh, the Sooperman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay, freshly dipped with the nine
and a clip on my hip, moneygrip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black
My jaw snap with raps so umm, get the balls Jack
Flavor like Flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a plaid, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkly like Colgate
My dick's name machete, I stab much hoe-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix
Jammm, OOPS!  I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeahhh, I'm feelin kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose blow
Funk out of site with the type of hype
to make you say umm, a dy-no-mite!!
Chiller, chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the quils from Tequila
I'm down with the green eyed brother named Erick
Charlie how you rate this? (Hmm, jam like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to Cool V and Sally
PMD, my man Solo, and I'm auuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudi...

        "When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets" (repeat 7X)
        "When I come around homeboy watch yo nuggets
         A master of the beatdown, my style's rugged..."</pre>
