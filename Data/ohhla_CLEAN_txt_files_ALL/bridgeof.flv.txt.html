[Flavor Flav]
I'm wit'chu Spider; aiyyo check one two
his cut goes out to all my brothers locked up
in the penile systems all over the world y'knahmsayin
I wrote this cut about a bridge, that takes you to Riker's Island
I was locked up on Riker's Island, C-73, C-76
This is my story about when I was in the mix

[Verse One]
WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS - that's what they all say
Ridin on the big bus down the highway
Thinkin of the next move, ridin in the rain
Headin up the road to the bridge of pain
Only if I woulda, only if I coulda
Maybe I just shoulda, nah that ain't gon' work
I'm fucked up in the game, they got me by the balls
To cross the bridge of pain your ass is right behind the walls
'Fore you at that bridge a lot of shit goes through yo' mind
You stressed the fuck up, ready to spaz
Goin back behind the gate, walk around without a pass
The bridge of pain makes you think of all of that
Doin magic ain't blankin out none of that
Because it's all about reality, your {fucked} up mentality
SO just sit back and face uh, the technicality
This shit is real son, keepin it gully
Cause even after jail when you could be sleepin at your telly
Too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Chorus]
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain

[Verse Two]
Here we go again, back to this shit
Same old shit, just a different toilet bowl
Hangin in there like a sweater in the closet
Slow motion, is better than no motion
Gotta beat the game tag, gettin caught up in the broom
Police sweep the streets to make room
They don't give a fuck, all they want is rank
Not givin a fuck about what your family think
You get Flavor Flav in the papers
Headline news about all of my capers
Everything that Flavor Flav gotta do hit the news
Front bage to back page, from the jail to the stage
Make crowds outraged all over the world
Around the world 8 times and I'm goin for more
Had it goin real good 'til the judge stopped me
Locked me up and tried to make the world drop me
Simple and plain, Judge Goodman's insane~!
After I saw his face I crossed the bridge of pain

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Mind done ran down the drain, can't make no moves
Loosin all my shippin cause of state boots
I guess they need me, the C.O.'s lead me
Some niggaz greet me until they freed me
to cross the bridge of happiness, which do exist
Within the same bridge that you see in the mist
But too late now is the name of the game
Cause right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain
Bridge of pain, bridge of pain
Right around the corner is the bridge of pain

[Chorus]</pre>
