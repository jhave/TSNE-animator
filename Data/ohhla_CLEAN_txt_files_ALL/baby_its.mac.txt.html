Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I really can't stay
But baby, it's cold outside
I got to go away
But baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
Really I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just have a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like star light
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside
I simply must go
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
Baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
Got to get home
But baby you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
Just get on your knees right there
You've really been grand
I do when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty of play
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside</pre>
