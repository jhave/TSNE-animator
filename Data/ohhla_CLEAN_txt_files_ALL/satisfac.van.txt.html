[Verse 1]
Saturday night, The club was packed, But I can't get no action
The girl I want is frontin hard, I can't get no satisfaction
Thousand people up in the club and the music's thumpin hard
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress
The kind that makes ya body wet, Hmm, I must confess
I tryed and she said no, But fellas yo, I can't get no

[Chorus]
I can't get no [Yeah]
I can't get no [Ya know what I'm sayin?]
I can't get no [Yep, Yep]
Satisfaction, Ah hey hey hey
You know what I say
That's what I say
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Girlie at the bar, Lookin mighty fly
She look so fly at the time
I had to make up, You know, My mind
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak
I tryed all I could, I even said please
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away
I told her what was up, She said come back another day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The party's almost over, The club's about to close
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose
I'll take another chance, A try at romance
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong
Tyson at my back, I had to move along

[Chorus]

[Repeat chorus till fade]</pre>
