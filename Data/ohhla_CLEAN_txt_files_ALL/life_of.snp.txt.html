[Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hyped
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites
You live like a movie but a movie my life

[Chorus]
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Now go and roll up the Swisher
But don't drink all my liquor
You know it's all good my nigga
Give me one second, I'll pose for your picture
Like cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese
Now everybody just freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze
Now DJ bring the music please

[Too $hort]
I'm the life of the party
It don't take much, for me to get started
Every time you see me, I'm with a bunch of girls
Straight to the table, in my own world
The ballplayers know me, movie stars too
See my homie Snoop, we doin' what we do
Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player
(Beotch) Cause I'm the life of the party
I got ten bad bitches, actin' retarded
I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones
What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'
Do you drink, do you smoke?
I could tell by your purse and your shoes you ain't broke
Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hyped
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites
You live like a movie but a movie my life

[Chorus]
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Now go and roll up the Swisher
But don't drink all my liquor
You know it's all good my nigga
Give me one second, I'll pose for your picture
Like cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese
Now everybody just freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze
Now DJ bring the music please

[Snoop Dogg]
I've been trappin' all day, gettin' paper
Headed to the club in my brand new scaper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm bout to rock it
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Dogg y Dog, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's
I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hyped
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites
You live like a movie but a movie my life

[Chorus]
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)

[Mistah F.A.B.]
Now go and roll up the Swisher
But don't drink all my liquor
You know it's all good my nigga
Give me one second, I'll pose for your picture
Like cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese
Now everybody just freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze
Now DJ bring the music please

[Outro: Too $hort]
Count 'em man... there's about 12, 13, 14 bad bitches
It's me, two of my homies... drinkin', we smokin'
I see all the ballers in the house, what's up mayne?
They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't be the same
Cause I'm the life of the party baby
I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!</pre>
