[Intro: Queen Latifah]
Dana Owens aka Queen Latifah, yes I'm here to testify
No, I gotta speak on my behalf, you don't even know
what happened
Can I just tell you what happened?

[Chorus: Macy] (Latifah)
He had it comin' (He had it comin')
He only had himself to blame
If you'd a been there, if you'd a seen it
I think that you would have done the same

[Verse 1: Queen Latifah] (Macy)
I mean imagine, why was he hittin' his woman?
Why was she takin' that?
Now picture her fightin' back, picture the ass kickin'
Think of his ass flippin' down the stairs
And me at the top smilin', he shoulda stopped wildin'
Now could you picture me tryin' to finish him off?
See why I pictured me on this side of the law
High heels leave holes, you'd a thought I was gunnin'
Now the cops comin', I ain't runnin'
(He had it comin')
Girl you shoulda seen it, shoulda bobbed and weaved
Before the cops came, got a coupla clean hits
In word the ??? couldn't take the abuse
But I couldn't explain that to the state troops
But you know girl, yeah you go girl
Plus I look real cute in orange jump suits
This the story I'm tellin' and I ain't changin' nothin'
I just needed you to know Your Honour

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim] (Macy)
Aiight aiight, let's get this over with
Take the mug shot, hurry up the fingerprints
What the blood clot?
Lil' Kim aka Sofia Luchiani
Keep your jump suit, I'm rockin' Armani
Yeah, I bust at him once, but that was just a warnin'
My lawyer will be here with bail money in the mornin'
I'm not guilty, just tryin' to protect mine
It ain't my fault he ran into my knife 20 times (He had it comin')
Just my luck the bastard ain't die
What you woulda did if every other day he blacked ya eye?
Broke ya nose 'til it started bleedin'
Kicked you in ya ribs, chocked you 'til you stopped breathing
(Fuck) that, I'm sick of bobbing and weaving
Threatenin' to kill me when I threaten to leave him
I do a bid, 'cause ain't no way
(Nigga) gonna do me like Ike and OJ

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3: Queen Latifah]
This is for the constantly accused, mentally abused
How many of you been in my shoes before, aiight
Or have you felt you caught the worse case
Puttin' up wit his tired ass in the first place
Why am I flippin'? I just bought them condoms
I ain't used not one but there was two missin'
Get a new mission, how to catch a cheater
If he only use coach, you shouldn't smell ???
If you know he don't smoke, you shouldn't smell reefer
If you catch him cheatin' you shouldn't yell either
Run up on him quietly, took him out silently
It might sound cruel, but you gotta love the irony
So explain that, just came back off a trip
And I come home to this, please
He ain't followed the guidelines
So forgive me Your Honour, he ran into my knife five times

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
