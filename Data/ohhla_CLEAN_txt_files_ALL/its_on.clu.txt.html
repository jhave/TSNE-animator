Ugh Dmx 
Clueminati 
Is y'all motherfuckers ready for the Ruff Ride!
Grrrrr!

(1st Verse)
When I speak I'm understood, my decision is wood
I see what I'm able to see, (ugh) cuz my vision is good
It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, knowin I can kill this guy's whole fam
Sometimes better to be thought dumb and remain silent
than to open your mouth and remove all doubt cuz if it came violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you asking me for
It's a war (ugh), and nigga, when it's on it's on 
Doin' wrong (what) till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, (ugh) ya'll niggaz gonna burn
Peep how I finished money (what) and y'all niggaz gonna learn
All fucking week you've been talking about that drive-by
And ain't did nothing but drive by
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good
(Uhh) Everybody is the man in they own hood, for real

Chorus x4 

Yeah cuz if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!! 

(2nd Verse)
I always keep my enemies the closest (uhh)
Always make sure I know where the toast is (uhh)
Always cover my tracks when I creep
Always get away when I'm done to relax, shit is deep
I always know the rules of the game before I play
And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day
I always walk my dogs off the leash and
always get my thoughts off the streets and 
always remember lend a hand then borrow
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow 
I always pay my respects to the dead
I always take at least one blunt to the head
Now always know which bitches is gonna end up getting fucked
And always know which niggas is gonna end up getting stuck!
I'm always strapped; I've always packed
I've always rapped; it's always that
Always black

Chorus x4

(3rd Verse)
Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours
Never take a man's life cuz you hate yours
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you
Never forget where you from someone will remind you
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift
And never sleep on a nigga, less that nigga stiff
Never turn your back on a nigga you don't trust 
Never turn your gat on a nigga and don't bust
Never expect to get away with the same shit -- more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring it to a nigga, if you scared to die
Never gonna do it nigga, if you scared to try
Never gonna be another day it gets dark, nigga
Never get it fucked up, that shit here, for the heart nigga
Never say never, cuz I never thought this clever thought never
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with three letters, DMX!

Chorus x4

Uhh Dmx
