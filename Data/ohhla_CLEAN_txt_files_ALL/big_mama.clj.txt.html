Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, this one's dedicated, to my grandmother, and your grandmother
It's all love, let's not forget who raised us, word up

[LL Cool J]
Big Mama, my grandmother, my main girl
I love you much more than the scandalous world
As a young boy you gave me whoopings to save my life
Cursed me out, to keep me out the streets at night
Cause my momma had me when she was young
So you took on the responsbility to raise your grandson
You taught me if a task is once begun, Todd
Never leave it 'til it's done, Todd
Be thy labor great or small Todd
Do it well or not at all, God
Big Mama, my blood is your blood
When the whole world's against me, I know I got your love
If I was in a cell for the rest of my life
I know I'd hear your prayers in the middle of the night
Used to sit me on your lap and teach me mother wit
Early Sunday morning for them salmon and grits
I love you baby, you the one and only, that's a fact
'Til death do us part, I'ma always have your back
You beefed cause you heard that I was cursin in my raps
Eighty-six, still you wanna run and get the straps
I love you, I promise you I care for you deep
Cause when I had bronchitis you would rock me to sleep
Rub me down with green alcohol
Little brown-skinned lady bout five feet tall, Big Mama

[Chorus: Dru Hill] + (LL)
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table (you gave me unconditional love)
There was no time to eat, she said to me
Boy hurry to Sunday school (you gave me unconditional love)

[LL Cool J]
I remember when you told me certain friends wasn't real
I didn't wanna listen, I swore I knew the deal
Come to find out, everything you said was true
Who I end up goin to for advice?  You
I love you, that's why you got nurses and maids
Ever since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid
That's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think
How to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice
You kept on livin, cause when my granddaddy died
It took all your might, but you ain't quit on life
We took trips down South, biscuits and chicken
Me you granddad and Alison, trippin
Remember, you used to pick me up from junior high
And classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by
Remember, I pulled my privates out in class
And from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!!)
The best cookin a man could ever taste
It's written in my heart, it can never be erased
Thank you so much, you taught me well
How to not get souped up, because I'm LL
How to walk the street, and hold my head real high
How to live with Christ and not be afraid to die
We sipped daquiris, but you never told moms
We even shared beers, Big Mama my dear
A toast to a woman that raised a man
In popular demand all across the land
You're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend
My mother, my father, you with me 'til the end
I love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart
That's the reason why my record's #1 on the charts
I'ma tell it like it is, I love you forever
Dead or alive, we'll always be together
Big Mama I love you

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
I dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere
The ones who raised us - when nobody else was there
The ones who held us and told us it'll be alright
When gunshots was goin off every night
Taught us how to lock the door and check the peephole
And how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold
How to stay proud, and represent hard
Eat plenty baby, but first say grace for God
Big Mama, I'ma miss you
When one of us leave this earth
But baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth
And if it wasn't for my children, I would wanna go first
You're the reason I'm the man I am today
The inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J
When you told me "Knock 'Em Out," I brought you home a Grammy
I learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy
A black man that was raised by black women
On tour, sippin your special honey and lemon
You told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt
The concert was hot, thanks to your support
Girl - you're the one I love
Whether right here with me or smilin from up above
Trouble or no trouble, you always had my back
So I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
