Fat in the ass, do you want a taste?
Pop to the bass I'mma make ya drop

Cause my shit firm and tight, just right
And if the price is right I just might

And I'mma shake my money maker
I'mma shake this thing like a salt shaker
Cause ain't nothing wrong with the bump and grind
When I do this thing up, jump behind

Ride like a chuchoo train

Lil' mama fixin' ta do this thing
