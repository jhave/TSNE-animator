[Verse 1: Kemo]
Uh, baby girl don't you know that you so fine
Let me introduce myself, I'm Mo from Da Hol' 9
I'ma let ya know while ya sippin on yo wine
You can roll wit me and you'll be sittin on a gold mine
I bust it down wit ya baby you can go find
I make my own cheddar, baby I'ma show rime
And make sure that I'ma hit u, we can both shine
And ya lovin, I bet you givin me the slow kind
Back in the days girl I prolly would've played you
But today baby girl I'm here to save you
When I look into the eyes I'ma say to you
Hella thurl like my damn record label
So come and get some of this gangsta luv
From a hella thurl gangsta thug
She prolly never knew what a gangsta was
We can roll to a Camry and a Range uh what

[Hook: Keisha Ivy]
Wh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
Yeah baby
Uh-huh uh-huh
Bet you don't have a clue
Of how long I been tryin
To make my way to you
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
Yeah baby
Uh-huh uh-huh
So what you wanna do
Cuz 9 men out of 10
Don't even relate to you
(So come and get some of this gangsta luv
From a hella thurl gangsta thug
She prolly never knew what a gangsta was
We can roll to a Camry and a Range uh what)

[Verse 2: Kaos]
Well I've been even, you believin
You can see he's keepin you away breathin, you ain't even pleased wit you
He's cheatin you, misleadin you, deceivin you, mistreatin you
And leavin you, home alone, he's always gone
And he's always singin that "Sorry" song
Bodies in the streets we got a heat, claimin it wit these beats
For hours, days, and even weeks, hell call back when you beep at least
He say he cool, now why the hell do you want to continue to
Pursue a future wit no feuds, just look at the picture that I drew
You need to be hugged, you need to be held, you need to be loved instead of
Dyin inside cryin "please help cuz I'm tired"
So come and get some of this gangsta luv
From a hella thurl gangsta thug
She prolly never knew what a gangsta was
We can roll to a Camry and a Range uh what

[Hook: repeat 3X, ad libs from the second repeat on]
So what you wanna dooo
Cuz I been tryin to make my way to youuu
Ooowww, owww, so what you wanna do

Every time I get a lil' bit of ya lovin, it makes me wanna
Siiiing
I'm tryin to make my way to you booooy</pre>
