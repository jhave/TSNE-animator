In New York (it's comin)
In Detroit (it's comin)
In L.A. (it's comin
No, it's here)

[ VERSE 1: Toddy Tee ]
Drug busters, you better beware
And don't turn your head as if you don't care
(Because they got it) they got it, they say they got you
Right in their hands and they don't need no clue
They say they're sick and tired of snatchin down bars
Cause on the tow trucks it's makin it hard
And by the time they get in-to your pad
You done flushed it down the toilet and now they're mad
And so they're mad as hell and take you to jail
But you're out the next minute cause you post bail
Then on the very next day you say, "What the heck?"
You get a letter in the mail and it's a D.A. reject
And you're jumpin up and down cause it ain't no case
And to the police that is a waste
But yeah rockman, you'll see it soon
And you won't hear a snatch, you'll hear a boom

You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

The Batterram
You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

[ VERSE 2: Toddy Tee ]
(You were so high) that night when your eyes was tight
And you didn't even notice the Batterram lights
(So gone) so gone that when they said it was there
You just shook your head and said, "I don't care"
(Based out) based out without no doubt
That when they said "give up" you cussed em out
And when your dopebustin friends drove up in their car
You stood out your chest and started actin hard
You took off your Fila shirt and your Reebok shoes
And had the nerve to call the police a bunch of fools
You called em pigs (sissies) and even punks
While the Batterram battery needed a jump
And by the time it got started you fell to the floor
And that's when the cops said they can't take no more
And you were so damn high, my little friend
That you didn't know your living room was in your den

You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

The Batterram
You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

[ VERSE 3: Toddy Tee ]
Well, I would sit at home about to eat dinner
Had a hard time at work and my day was gettin thinner
My kids was in the room watchin Mighty Mouse
And my wife was gettin ready to leave the house
But as she opened the door she seen a flare
It was a undercover cop, he was standin there
So she hollered back to me, "Honey, come and see
Just who this strange man could be"
But when I went to the door I thought it was a dud
Cause he kept asking me to sell him drugs
I said, "Listen homeboy, what you talkin about?
You're mistakin my pad for a rockhouse
Well, I know to you we all look the same
But I'm not the one slingin caine
I work nine to five and ain't a damn thing changed
And I don't have time for the hustler's game"

You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

The Batterram
You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

[ VERSE 4: Toddy Tee ]
Mayor of the city, what you're tryin to do?
They say they voted you in in '82
(But on the next term) huh, without no doubt
They say they gon' vote your jack ass out
Because you musta been crazy or half-way wack
(To legalize somethin that works like that)
And the Chief of Police says he just might
(Flatten out every house he sees on sight)
Because he say the rockman is takin him for a fool
And for some damn reason it just ain't cool
And when he drives down the street, I tell you the truth
He gets no respect, they call his force F Troop
He can't stand it, he can't take no more
And now he's gonna have you all fall into the floor
And Mister Rockman, you better stop some day
Hang it up homeboy, your house will pay

You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

The Batterram
You can't stop it, baby
The Batterram

(Went through my pad)

And if you didn't see the Batterram cross your line
(Honey boon) honey boon, I'm tellin you - give it time</pre>
