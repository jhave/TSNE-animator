[Verse 1]
I want it to pop, I want the revolution to start
Watch niggas get exposed straight lose their heart
God willing I be the one doing the killing
Say nobody got no love for the hood and its children
I'm the illest in the world fuck it the universe
Make your life hurt when I start puttin' in knife work
I zoned with Curtis Mayfield vibed with Marvin
Cause the black snake is the worst snake in the garden
They used Judas made him turn his gun on Christ
Shots riddled Malcolm X and destroyed his life
Even Martin Luther King got hit with the flame
And you wonder why the black man stuck in the game
Fuck it I stay dirty Timbs and grey shirty
Pop your hard hat put two in your derby
My life too many questions and not enough answers
Get 'em all back for what they did to the Panthers

[Chorus: V-12]
Lift every voice and sing true love that heaven brings
Filled with the harmony of liberty
This is the rising sun a brand new day begun
Let us march on'til victory is won

[Verse 2]
And this is for the pure souls who died at birth
And the mothers in the struggle still feeling the hurt
They say the meek'll inherit the earth
And I wonder if God love us cause all my thugs is cursed
Wish I could go back holler at Asada Shakur
Having flashbacks like I did time in the war
Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor, The Berlin Wall
And I paint a clear picture to provide you all
And I might not be the artist going platinum this year
Fuck it long as my niggas bang it on the tier
Cause any given time I can be right there
Stressin' in the yard throwin' up dead weight
Black babies on the C-O's arm playin' my gate
It's real my mom shot dope in her vein
Pops layin' in the clouds took a shot in the brain
So I never sleep always gon' keep my banger
And the media wonder why I write such anger
Imagine life as a lost soul cold no guidance
Outta control cater to crime life and violence
And me no love Bush despise Bin Laden
It's like I'm caught in the middle between to Fascist
This world shallow I'm prepared for gun battle
And I'm never gon' forget what they did to Diallo
They stay crucified me for holding my gat
Same way they did Luima and Geronimo Pratt

[Chorus: V-12]
Lift every voice and sing true love that heaven brings
Filled with the harmony of liberty
This is the rising sun a brand new day begun
Let us march on 'til victory is won

[Verse 3]
All my life and my rights made laws to trap me
Guiliani and Pataki want me in kak(i) sacky
Bleeding in a cell, wanna see me in hell
A chosen, frozen but still living to tell
Victims to the system, government officials
Bin Laden got missiles and I got issues
Henny ease the pain but fogs the brain
They in the Middle East waiting for Allah to rein
While the victims in the World Trade burn in flames
And even if God came we wouldn't embrace him
Probably go to war with him blow guns and lace him
Like the whole world wanna give they trust to Satan
While they sitting in the White House layin' and waitin'
With all the Armed Forces we still digging corpses
Still can't give life back to them voices
United we stand, divided we fall
Provided we all take heed to the call
If Christ was alive would he plead with the Lord?
Have mercy on the young seeds laying in the morgue
Refuse to be whored by these man made laws

[Chorus: V-12]
Lift every voice and sing true love that heaven brings
Filled with the harmony of liberty
This is the rising sun a brand new day begun
Let us march on'til victory is won</pre>
