Chorus:

Children, groovin, women, confusion
Then go away, it's time to understand
Everyone's got to make a livin
Children, groovin, women, confusion
Then go away, it's time to understand
Everyone's got to make a livin

Nineteen-ninety-two and, you and I were fightin
LAPD beatings got the whole world frontin
My man Rodney King and the Reginald ?Deeney?
You could look for justice but I bet you won't find any

Because people getting beatin, news keep repeatin
Chaos and anger, just surely peakin

Yo everybody's runnin, some of them are gunnin
Avalanche the block, feel the anger, wantin something
'Cause some of them are frontin
They didnt know the reason
Emotion in the end made it feel like revolution

And yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, we got eight years of chains

Hook:

So hurry up because I'm runnin out of clip
Runnin out of time
Runnin out of clip
Runnin out of time
Runnin out of clip
Runnin out of time
Runnin out of clip (What)
Runnin out of time

Chorus

Nineteen-ninety-seven, reduction of a nation
The government is slayin, new laws is what you're facin
Next comes the clonin, they're makin new creation
Secretly forming soldiers of you and they station

No more free education on former segregation
Politics's about affirmative activation

So make a run for the border
Caught by the deporter
The immigration caught you but you got to leave your daughter
We are slowly being slaughtered
So be prepared for the new world order

Yeah, yeah, you can yell out your brains
I tell you right now, we got eight years of chains

Hook

Chorus

Year two-thousand, what's it really holdin
Or is it really right, live beyond on what you're knowing
Or is it that technology is what keeps on going
Could it be that the end of time is what I'm showing

I don't see any grass growin
Everything's conquered, we're running out of land

And goddamn yo, I'm runnin out of clip
I'm almost out of time
Runnin out of
Damn, I'm almost out of time

We could all try now but just look up in the sky
We ain't got no ozone left, we are gonna die
Crime and corruption, is the only season
Is it 'cause the reason is that we out of time
