This time we're gonna get funky
Everybody clap your hands
Clap clap clap clap your hands
Clap clap clap clap your hands

Alright we gonna do the basic steps

Right foot lets stomp
Left foot lets stomp
Cha cha real smooth

Now turn it out

One hop this time
Right foot lets stomp
Left foot lets stomp
Cha cha now y'all

One hop this time, one hop this time
Right foot two stomps
Left foot two stomps
Slide to the left

Criss cross, criss cross
Cha cha real smooth

Lets go to work

Take it back now y'all
Two hops this time, two hops this time
Right foot two stomps
Left foot two stomps
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees

All the way to the floor
