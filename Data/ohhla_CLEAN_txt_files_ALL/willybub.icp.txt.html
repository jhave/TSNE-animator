Ok class, um, please settle down now, 
I'd like to introduce our new student
uhh, uhh Willy Bubba, Willy is from Kentucky, welcome Willy, uh,
I'll be your teacher, my name is Ms. Felby

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Well I flopped out of school but I still hang in the halls
So there I was, you'll never guess what I saw
Maybe a chicken, I thought it was a duck
But it was a redneck fuck, so I walked up
"Hey Willy Bubba, hubba-bubba-lubba
My names Violent J, but my homies call me chicken plucker
I been down with the clown since day one, it's day two
I guess I got some plucking to do
In these parts, we tie you to the desk
And all line up and take blows to your chest [punch]
Fists to your chin [punch], kicks to your head [punch]
Last year we killed a kid dead [HAHHH!! oh, my fault...]
Walked in the school, there's hay in the hallway
Leading to your locker, walk up 'n sock ya
Then bounce your head around the class room and act nutty
The teacher walks, and asked everybody [body, body..]

(Chorus x2)
Who kicked Willy Bubba's ass? [I DID!]
Did you do it right here in the class? [SHO' DID!]
Did you punch him in the face, did you slap him in the mouth
Did you kick him in the forehead [YUP, YUP!] 

[Nice to get back with a high school crowd where your alive]

(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Willy Willy Bubba hubba lubba dubba dilly
Tell me why you talk so silly, bitch
You sound like you come from the land of the bigots
Jolly old Dickens, the land of the chickens
I guess you're in season, I'm packing me a .44
Barrels to your head and blow your face out your asshole
POWWW, bitch! I'm Shaggy2Dope
I'm coming for your kin folk, you get your chin broke
And don't cry or run to the teach
She can't understand your redneck-ass speech
If she could, she wouldn't do a thang
'Cuz she's my bitch and she loves to suck my wang
You in trouble Bubba, you better run quick
You too slow, Willy, 'cuz you a fat bitch
I caught up and got my hands all putty
Teacher walks in the class room, and asked everybody [body, body...]

(Chorus x2)

HOOOOOOLD UP! check it out...

Let's play, Willy Bubba, and kill the Willy Bubba (repeat 'till end)</pre>
