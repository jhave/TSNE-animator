This is the trip
The best part I
Really really like
hahaha
Yeah I'm proud to be apart of this new  ???
Used to be good
Now I'm goin bad
yo  like this

(intro)
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
Everything was suppose to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan

(1st Verse)
In the new millennium
You can't play with nobody's mind man
Deliberately messing up a good thing
Or holding up a grind and 
You already knowing life's a big fight
Against time man
Crime minds
Really shine
Who's dying 
Is the kind man
When some of us
Find that life ain't beautiful
We switch to
Pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five
Ain't suitable
For the cuticles
I'm going bad
Currently I keep ending up
With even less
Than I had
Record company
Is dealing me something sad
How do you expect
A man to sit
And wait with three kids
For you to
Figure out
What Tech's SINGLE is
Going bad 
I feel like 
I just might 
Act a fool 
When I see 'em 
Gotta a nigga 
Feeling petty
Looking forward 
To perdeium 
I got some issues 
Most of these record execs
Are soft as tissues 
Defecate on they self 
When they here some
I'm gon get yous 
Understand this 
When a Rogue's at
You're trying to hold back 
His dough sack 
And try to bozack 
And he go cock 
The 4 4 back
You chose that 
So cut these ties 
And I'll rise 
Let's compromise 
Or else 
I'll hop a plane 
With my guys 
QDIII said 
"It ain't all good 
When you sign with a record label 
Who ain't
Had a hot soundtrack 
Ever since 
Boyz N Da Hood"

(Bridge) 
I'm going bad
No luck 
I'm going 
Bad, bad, bad 
So rough 
I'm going 
Bad, bad, bad 
No church 
I'm going 
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse
I'm going 
Bad
Feel me out now 

(Hook-Charmelle)
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angles to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever

(LeCoya LeJuene)
No one wants to see
An angel in this world
In these days
To them I am
The epitome of evil
A found soul
Looking to save the lost
To them I am death
And of not wanting
An evil man

(2nd Verse)
For living expenses
They gave me like
Thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital
Shot up
With thirty I V's
That's what I really needed
When I found out
This drama
Trauma
Instead of moving
I should've kept all that
And continued to stay
With my girls Momma 
Gutter 
Living 
Got me tripping 
I'm smoking bud daily 
Gutter 
Living 
Got me tripping 
I'm going blood crazy 
Gutter
Living
Got me tripping
I'm struggling like a bad actor
Gutter
Living
Got me sounding like 
The Madd Rapper 
The bad influence 
The bad apple
The bad seed 
That's me 
The bad people 
The bad karma 
The bad breed 
Mushroom tripping 
Brain's a mushroom cloud 
Finding groupies 
Tugging on my zipper 
While I'm hanging on 
To my vows 
Demons surround me
In triple 
Stage darkness 
And taunt me 
They know I'm the good guy 
Going bad 
So they want me 
All my family remembers 
Way back in the day 
I was good 
But they doubt now 
Disperse 
I'm going bad 
Feel me out now 

(Hook-Charmelle) 
This life I live 
Ain't extra 
No angels to 
Stand next to 
To live a life that's better 
I'll sacrifice 
Whatever 
This life I live 
Ain't extra 
No angels to 
Stand next to 
To live a life that's better 
I'll sacrifice 
Whatever 

(LeCoya LeJuene) 
To say going bad 
To most 
Ha 
Never been good 
Just getting worst 
Thoughts to destroy 
And to tear things apart 
Thoughts to praise 
Adore 
And to love 
The trick is 
What voice is telling you what 

(3rd Verse) 
Mind state of a pirate 
I'm irate 
Used to be cool 
Till some straight fool 
Lit the pilot 
Will I be that 
Mid-town bound 
In the middle of a riot 
Or at a wherehouse 
Shipping platinum 
Shaking hands with 
Violet 
No love for the bane 
False foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame 
Twas a journey full of pain 
But Tech N9NE will remain 
Hella brave 
And untame 
So make way 
For the reign 
I'm bringing Highland and Wayne 
No thanks to Qwest 
They on the receiving end 
Of the gun 
I cursed you 
Everytime I climb 
You're getting fired 
One by one 
But taking one with me
Cause she knows the true meaning 
Of a modern day hippie 
Who creates jewels off mushrooms 
And bombs sticky
HOG STYLIN'
Mid West Side 
And Newday 
And King Tech &amp; Sway 
These are the people keeping me alive 
To this day much love
QD said 
"You can't make rell 
With a label who let 
Tipper Gore talk shit
And made 'em take Ice T's cop killer 
Off the shelves "

(Bridge) 
I'm going bad 
No luck 
I'm going 
Bad 
So rough
I'm going
Bad
No church
I'm going
Bad
Disperse
I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now


(Hook-Charmelle)
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever
This life I live
Ain't extra
No angels to
Stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice
Whatever


(LeCoya LeJuene)
Right now I can't distinguish
Which voice I'm listening to
Am I evil
Or just another lost soul
Going bad
Or just been bad
And getting worst</pre>
