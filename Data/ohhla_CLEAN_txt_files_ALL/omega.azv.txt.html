(AZ talking)
Its so simple....life...death...

(Verse- AZ)
I am one of the flyest my crew is like the Al Qaeda's
We war like in them mess halls of Elmyra
Bodies get caught predicate's bails is higher
Why talk if you ain't walk through hell's fire
All-nighters upscale attire
In car get new cars you and your mans admire
Young messiah back bottom guns for hire
I am that what them rap contracts require
Ghostwriter coast to coast cyphers
I do this for them grown men in diapers that don't like us
Though still the nicest sending kites to Riker's is priceless
Reminiscing on plaza fights with Cypress
Hung lifeless sprung from financial crisis
Never ran I stand amongst the righteous
AZ-Q dark denimy V suits
His arson is lethal only pardon his people so
Just ask it open or closed casket
Coke or the dope bastard I'm back on that old Shaft shit
Got my ratchets army fatigue jacket
Fitted cap on backwards with them cats from Flatbush
Bravehearted fuck if they say squash it
We remain the largest we invade regardless
Trains to Spofford insane with a brain from Hartford
It's hard to explain my artwork
One for the haters two for the true and the raiders
I know dudes who eat your food with a razor
It's major barbaric 
Brutal behavior car addict I talk about the jewelry later
My respect is for the CL cartel connects
And the crews that came through and left arise well effect
Finesse big boys only play with the best
It's no regrets being dead broke and raised in the jects
I'm a vet cousin Comstock calling collect
Saying he just left the box hot annoyed and depressed
Claimin he stressed did a 3 and still facin a stretch
I'm like look this ain't the row and you ain't waiting your death
So save your breath tie your boots up and bang with the rest
Cause in reality they just incarcerated your flesh
You know the deal I pray they process your appeal
Cause on the real I still got my hands on the wheel
And I'm a drive til the gas run out
Either crash or a wrap til a smash come out
We them real niggaz

It don't get no more gangster than this...rap it up daddy...yea
