[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Are you ready!
I need everybody to report to the dance floor
Now (Remy Martin just stepped in the building)
To all my ladies that don't need child support
I need you to report to the dance floor right now
All my niggaz thats on the grind (echo:report to the dance floor right now)
You on the grind right now
We about to get it poppin in this motherfucker (Remy)
Already told y'all what it is
1-swizzy
2-y'all gon'make me
1, 2 hands in the air !!

[Chorus: Remy and Swizz]
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)

[Verse 1: Remy Ma]
See if the God say get her I'ma get her
I'll hit her wit a pillow where the casket won't fit her
The only reason I hit her she kept talkin' greasy
Lil' jump skeezy betta ask somebody who I be (bitch)
I'm R to the E-Z
It's mid-summer got on long sleeves cause my arms is freezin'
I gets fly for no reason
See I got money but its always robbin' season, yeah
See hip hop needs me, the beats is Swizz
The girl is sick and please believe, that I'ma start
Till every damn day I ball
My jeans is blue and grey like Seton Hall

[Chorus: Remy &amp; Swizz]
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)

[Verse 2: Remy]
Yeah
See Rem is a monster
I'm raps MVP the star on the roster
Officially a boogie-down Bronxer
Terror Squad ain't the Brady Bunch and I ain't Marcia
My shits so butter they should call me Marge
And I ain't gotta be boss just as long as I'm in charge
And whuteva I say goes, so if I say NO
Don't ask why I assume its because I say SO
I've been doin it too long, ain't nothin' new to me
I'll run through ur lil' gated community
You know how the girl be, I'm a show stopper
I'll give it to you early before the toast pops up

[Chorus: Remy &amp; Swizz]
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Put your right hand up (Man, man)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
Whuteva (get it poppin)
It's whuteva (get it poppin)

[Verse 3: Remy]
See this goes out to my B-X crew
Put your hands up in the air if you feel me
Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night
Treat niggaz like hoes
It's 'Whuteva' like a four alarm blaze
And I'm hotter then hoes that work at the Days Inn
People tryin' to make shit to make niggaz bop
I make shit they play then niggaz get shot
Put your right hand up, put your left hand up
Right hand got a blunt, left hand got a cup
And you already know the rules don't apply to us
We gon' do what we do, it's 'Whuteva' 2 fuck
We got that fly shit here we go
Drivin' backwards down a one way like Big in the "Hypnotize" video
Bang this in your stereo, turn it higher, higher
Now everybody light your lighters!

[Repeat Chorus: Remy &amp; Swizz]</pre>
