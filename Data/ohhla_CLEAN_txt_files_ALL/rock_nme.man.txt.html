[Verse 1]
Look at me, what you see?
Is it him or me? Critic's is dissing me hard was this meant to be?
The feeling I'm feeling is real, and it's stealing, the meaning to stay in this field
Many men of tried it, few have ever made it
Most taken out fighting sin temptations
I separate my English, like the French 
When I fall, get down repent, what don't ye get?

[Chorus]
Rocking me constantly, being somebody, the pressures is calling me
God and society

[Break down chorus]
If do I could fall, if I don't I will crawl
It's so hard having all, isn't this what I want
I stepped out, fell down, Got up, what now

[Verse 2]
Put yourself in my shoes, with my crew,
I lose take a ride right through my mind, birds eye view
I stopped caring what yall think a year ago, here we go, radio, video,
Stereo, types cause I'm white, the harder I write, the more lies on my life
Ye tell it in spite
Right to my face, or stab me in the back
Manic depressive no, but I might just snap

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This position's warn out, I want out
It's what I wanted not what I thought
It was when I was poor now I'm cornered
Knowing now it's in the past with the wack raps
I'm signing 99 hundred 9 lines of autographs
Most significant feeling like I'm infinite
Critics used to kick my backside now they kissing it 
What a switch up, thought I'd a give up
Ridiculous, how I ended up, so what
I ain't so different, yeah I'm a Christian
Living still winning you got counterfeit religion
I say it in my lines in ye face up to rise
You hating on something that you ain't even tried

[Chorus]</pre>
