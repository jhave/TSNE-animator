Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Kissin on me [x4]

[Verse 1]
Baby I don't blame you
For being in the club
Getting all that love
Cause your so beautiful
God made you to show that off
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy
But i want you to myself, I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one on one thing
But baby, It should change
Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

[Chorus]
I don't want nobody but you
Kissin on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me
Talkin to you
Until you fall asleep
We better stop playing (We better stop playing)
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (nobody but you)
Kissin on my tattoos

[Bridge]
Nobody But you
Kissin on me
Kissin on me
[x4]

[Verse 2]
All my homies wanna know whats up with us
They can't believe that Im kicking it with just one girl
But Im cool with that
Them pretty eyes and that smile
Girl Im a fool for that (yeah Im a fool for that)
Cause when I be out with other chicks I be thinking bout you
And when you be out on dates you be texting me too
Telling me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breaking you off

[Chorus + Bridge]
