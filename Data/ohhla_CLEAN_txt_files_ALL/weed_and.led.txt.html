Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
A wah wi waan
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya

[Verse 1]
Drive out the truck
Drive out the car
Ride out the bike
Gyal cock up pon the back a wah mi like
Load up mi cup
Gimmi a spliff
Gimmi a light
Champagne pop, fly like a kite
Mi just get a new gyal
And seh call up you crew gyal
Mi and mi dawgs
Dem a gyallis usual
How wi do gyal deal with it crucial
Real boss, have papers fi burn
Holiday weekend, tables a turn
Most of your money straight like perm
Hotel presidential suite confirm

[Chorus]
A wah wi waan
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya

[Verse 2]
Then you no si the whole place tun up
Then you no si how dem yah gyal yah stand up
Batty cock out and dem a push up stomach
And the whole place tun up when the big Benz come up
College gyal she dem love mi swag
Scream off stage when mi throw mi rag
Mi no haffi brag
But mi know mi bad
Trap lord fi the gully God

Trap lord, trap lord
Wi ever fresh wi no stale a road
Trap lord, trap lord
Every ship and every plane a load

[Chorus]
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya
Weed and Hennessy
And a little bit a grabba leaf
Full suit a Louie V
Bare gyal inna the vehic's
That mi waan fi di Sumaiya</pre>
