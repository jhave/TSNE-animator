[Top Dog Big Kahuna]
Is it The Big Ohh, or is it gon' be no?
Let me tell you one thing, D-O ain't trickin no dough
At a show, shorties wanna meet me at the mo'
Askin mad questions about the dough I hold
Hold on baby, don't even go that route
Because the money, that I'll make you don't need to know foul
Cuz the thing change, and all the talkin stops here
Just lay your back down, and take off your underwear
Who cares, it's your bras and panties, they ain't matchin
Yo what's the rules? You have to leave if The Ohh ain't happenin
Yo, why you laughin, you won't be laughin
If you standin in front of room, 
they clear to get your punk ass maskin

[Smokelite]
Only mess wit the girls that sharin (Sharon), they nickname carin (Karen)
Known from the big butt and the tight Jean wearin
Also big breasts, always comin to my rest
While I cores they chest, and they suck me off next
Easily place in the mouth, like a grape from a tree
But she can't eat it, she must suck it, like a sweet lolli
I know that's a hobby, I met her in a lobby
Lookin good, beautiful self, bad ass body

[Chorus]
Yo it's goin out to Nicole, out in New Jerz
	To my girl Keisha, out in D.C.
It's all about the girls, girls, girls, girls
	Spark them some O.G.C.
And it's going out to Wendy, out in L.A.
	Going out to Tasha, out in Tennessee
It's all about the girls, girls, girls, girls
	Bob Marley spliffs and hennecy

[Starang Wondah]
It was me and Hennyville in the Starang mobile
On my way uptown, pumpin the new Dru Hill
I couldn't rush it, turn to Hennyville, bust this
Seen Reese in tight jeans, doin her ass no justice
Her mother gaspin, right where the restaurant be
I drove by, waved, kinda nonchalantly
Me and my man, cruisin through, checkin out the scenery
Stopped at the light, these two niggas double schemin me
Lookin in my 740, so I guess they beemin me
Yo they ain't gettin money, yo ask me what it mean to me

[Louieville Sluggah]
Yo, not a God damn, not since you my man
Because of jealously, over they fuckin toes, he ran
Yo I'm the Villest, that be my nigga for real
You don't think shit real, then go and ask your girl

[Starang Wondah]
Aha, we stopped by the store, I stepped outta the ride
My big gold chain steady swingin side to side
These two shorty wops, was all up in my grill like a barbecue
Say "I don't wanna bother you, but aren't you Starang"
They couldn't keep they eyes off my big gold chain
I kept my eyes on they ass, so shit was like the same
Yo simple and plain, I know ya be singin my song
Let's take 'em back to the crib, so we can all get along
The Big Ohh

[Chorus]
Going out to Mergari in N.Y.
	And this is going out to Tammy out in N.C.
It's all about the girls, girls, girls, girls
	Bless the mics for the whole M.F.C.

[Louieville Sluggah]
Guess who, son, just um, jumped upon the scene
Nadine, you know that chick we met out in Queens
That chick is mean, she steamed our whole team
Had heads gackin up things like gangrene
Take it from B.B.D., that think right is labeled "Poison Five"
You never could trust a big butt and a smile
For she say we display our thing well
And I say "Bitch, what that shit you tell?"
Shit, I know, niggas that hit it and lookin sick
No, no, sick dick, Henny I do a bid
Don't explain, simple and plain
The only thing you lovin is my name and my fame

[Chorus]
It's all about the girls, girls, girls, girls
	To Shari out there in Philly
Break it down now, girls, girls, girls, girls
	To Sundum Lee in Japan
Yo it's all about the girls, girls, girls, girls
	To my girl Bronca Swollen from Brazil
Girls, girls, girls, girls
	To Francewola Bei from Paris

Bless the mic! (8X)</pre>
