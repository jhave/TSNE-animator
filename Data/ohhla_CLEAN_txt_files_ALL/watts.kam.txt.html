[Kam]
God damn devils, done finally made they move on South Los Angeles
In Watts, the shots don't quit
And in Compton we got the same shit
Damn pigs is puttin in straight work
Murderin blacks and just smirk
Ain't nothin but another day at the office
So now it's damn near illegal to be a negro
So do I make a run for the border?
Or - fuck Bush, and his "New World Order"
The law is the straw that broke the camel's back
Just one more punk attack
on the black, and now the shit is on
(Peel his cap and I'm gone!) Oh yeah
See now all hell is finna break loose
And Uncle Tom ain't got no juice
Nigga shoulda been down from the start
but he ain't had a heart, for another Watts riot

[Kam]
So we done lost all patience
(Man fuck police investigations!)
See we gon' handle this right, tonight
(We're tearin up everything in fuckin sight!)
And I ain't got a damn thing to lose
So the news gon' have they hands full
Not to mention the police, fool
No justice, no peace
It's a eye for a eye, so don't even try and speak
on how blacks, should turn the other cheek
To hell with all y'all devils
Ain't no love losses for no white crosses
So what y'all know about this interpretation
with your college education?
Y'all best just keep quiet
and get your ass ready for this next Watts riot

[Ice Cube]
Straight pandemonium!  Niggaz I'm with nutty
Mr. Macgillicuddy done got, got
And I'm tossin more cocktails loc
'Til the whole fuckin block smell like smoke
Black folks are loc'n, no jokin
Yo Kam, grab the coke and choke 'em
Make sure that somethin is broken
and then you can smoke him (c'mon)
Got a clip on the news of me with a TV
and I don't give a fuck who done seen me
Fightin the police with my peers
With head and shoulders, and no more tears
And they can't stop me
Cause, I'm eatin more crackers than Polly
For the Jack that smoked the black
I gotta do the right thing for you and Rodney King
Burn down his market
But then you claim, Ice Cube had to spark it
Puttin Beverly Hills in fear
Cause Hollywood burnt down last year
So if you throw me Ozzie and Harriet
I fuck around and bury it, huh
Ain't makin the hood look shitty
Watts riot, insert your city motherfucker!

[Kam]
The whole city is on fire
And now it's down to the wire
Time to call for a national emergency
Cause white folk goin up in smoke
Too fast, they ass is out before they know it
So when I light this cocktail, Cube throw it
And make sure that it reach
Yeah motherfucker, that's for Howard Beach
And Brother Olivert X, so what's next
with y'all punk-ass cowards?
Each of us bring fo' devils
and let's get this over with, yeah, no shit
We ain't worried about dyin
(Man I think you better give up man) Nah I ain't even tryin
I'd rather go out fightin
But let y'all tell it I'm incitin a Watts riot</pre>
