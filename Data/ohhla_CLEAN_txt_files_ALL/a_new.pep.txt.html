(Pep Love)
Uh huh
(It's like a new...place in space)
It's like...

I stand amidst the pits and glitz of geometry
Symbolism livin within the rhythm on the streets
Jungles of concrete, where the people be walkin asleep
Consume, talkin to eat the fumes of Babylon
While I travel on to the land of Avalon
To learn what I haven't known
Apprenticeships from avatars
Avidly advocating the avant garde
I have been scarred, and had my memory jarred
To get me to remember who the fuck we are
Return from whence you came, yes the essence
The source, the energy, the bliss, the blessings
The mission, the message
The vision, the vestage
Of a new religion is etched in
The way that I get down
The way that this shit sound
As the world goes round and round
I expand and expound upon my earth-bound
Experience, when I looked in my book and found a poem
Now I'm knowin my forum of expression
To make an impression and keep growin

My intuition guided me
To a new religion inside of me
And you can hear it in my flow when I ride the beat
It's like that!
This music mission guided me
To a new religion inside of me
And you can hear it in my style cause I'm quite unique

[The Grouch]
My guiding light shone bright through the fight
Pulled me to the right and said stay here
You can rest and lay here
I'll be around down people
Have a little faith in yourselves, don't practice evil
My, church and steeples stand high behind my eyes
I'm housing a place to preach
With each thought, the devil dies
Wait there is no devil I'm a rebel
And this week's sermon comes from the book of treble
Let us listen, feel the prophet's mission
Vibrations from his voice show he won't be stopped without position
Nor even flustered
And you can usher all busters in to pay for their sins
It's not monetary though I'm a bury those stereo-
Typical rituals, everywhere we go it's mythical, made up
Stories we oughta trade up, tell me some too
Cause that's what helps me get through
True inspirations, a bit of holy spirit
When you near it be a merit to the next
Reflect on the breath that you gave
And the context it's taken and I'm shapin men for ??mice??
Not taking them and breaking them
I want to sacrifice my whole life's work
To the search of the meaning of the Earth
It's seeming like since birth it's all purpose
I'm gonna work this to the ground and plant a new surface
Worship the sound, never curse this
Blasphemers search cause it's worth it and perfect
From the dirt to the skyline
I always find the most of what I value deep inside rhymes

(Pep Love)
Soon as I wake and take a breath I'm in service
We havin church today beneath the surface
This, underground congregation has no past or a pope
Just dope beats and conversation
Time is racin, change is immenent and uninhibited
Music enthusiast, feel the vibe
I illuminate when I communicate with my tribe
It's spiritual but I'm not no saint
I'm here with you to do what I can, nothin I cain't
I walk amongst the monks and masons buildin bridges
Third Eye Vision of creation

[The Grouch]
This new religion it invited me
I use my vision, found it wise to free
Everything I had to say, come inside and see
Come inside and see
True words of wisdom they apply to me
Straight from the heart I arrived at the key
And I can be there any time I decide to be
Cause I decide to be

(Pep Love)
My intuition guided me
To a new religion inside of me
And you can hear it in my flow when I ride the beat
