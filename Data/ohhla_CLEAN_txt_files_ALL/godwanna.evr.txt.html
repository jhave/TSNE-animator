I said God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it
God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it

Come on, bounce, rock, skate
Tune in, drop out, de-motivate
Renegotiate for the proper rate
Somethin' to push weight, have to go up state
And fuckin' jailbait is statutory rape
And don't you never get your ass caught on tape
This ain't New York, there ain't no escape
And Superman's just another pimp in a cape
And even if both your eyes come up snake
It's time to get wise, rise and cut the cake
It don't take much for the Earth to quake
So watch what you clutch when you on the tape
I'm tryna tell you

God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it
God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it

I don't know where I'm going, I hardly know where I've been
The only thing I know for sure, the party's bout to begin, you got it
Thousand angels dancing, all on the head of a pin
Some people live in righteousness, and some people live in sin, you got it

God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it
God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it

Everybody jump in Lord, everybody jump in
Everybody jump in Lord, everybody jump in, you got it

Yo I'm a pimp, I'm a thief, I'm a killer, I'm a dealer
I'm a Holy man preacher, I'm a teacher, I'm a healer
I'm a mover, I'm a shaker, I'm a giver, I'm a taker
I'm a long time bonafide big money maker
I'm a winner, I'm a loser, I'm a begger, I'm a choser
I'm a thug, I'm a poser, I'm a chronic drug user
I've been rapping, I've been mixing, I'm fact and then I'm fiction
I'm a walkin' talkin' livin' breathin' contradiction
I'm working for my God but I'm playing with the devil
Don't act like you can see me cause I'm on another level
I'm a mic burner, not a trick turner
I'll act like Ike Turner, then I'll treat you like Tina

God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna wear my skin
Time to get the party started, everybody jump in, you got it
God wanna fill my heart, the devil wanna take my soul
Gotti got a broken heart, party's gotten out of control, you got it

The party's gotten out of control, y'all
The party's gotten out of control
The party's gotten out of control, y'all
The party's gotten out of control, you got it</pre>
