"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

[Run]
Had a fly girl Flo, called her honey
Next thing she spent up all my money
?? debt, you and your girl's dizzy
Stopped movin crack but you're still gettin pissy
You could call me everyday God sent
like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

[D.M.C.]
Mary Mary Mary you cold thumb suckin
Lookin for you, but you keep duckin
I wanna find you, I gotta tell you somethin
So just be quiet and don't say NUTTIN
Mary Mary Mary why you out there stuntin?
Supposed to be with me, but not you're FRONTIN
We started out new, you used to be true
Now you're buggin, what's wrong with you?

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

[Run]
Now..
This girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never failed
(Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled)
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent a night locked in a cell
I knew Mary well cause she +Raising Hell+

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

[D.M.C.]
It's not Mary who was quite - contrary
Talkin bout Mary who was always in a - hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need, a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she's crazy and I'll say very
Livin in a house that's out on the prairie
I worry about Mary cause Mary is scary!

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?
"Mary, Mary.."	I NEED YA HUGGIN

"Mary, Mary.."	WHY YA BUGGIN?</pre>
