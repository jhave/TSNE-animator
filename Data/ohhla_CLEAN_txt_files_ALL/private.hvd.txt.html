And that's ok I suppose, private dancer, there she goes

[Verse One: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
Every friday 'round eleven, at di club she's dancin
Di wey she moves is like she romancin
Nuff people come in fi watch har turn and spin
It's like di breeze blowin when she groovin
She seh she really doesn't trust nobody (Nobody)
She seh she just lookin to love somebody (Somebody)
I said I'm lookin for a private party 
And I just want to see you shake your body

[Chorus: Sizzla] (Heavy D)
There she goes (There she goes) I love the way she work that pole (Yes she does)
Dance for me nice and slow (Do do do!!!)

She's a pro, good at what she does that's her flow
(Extra flow) She love to take off her clothes 
And that's ok I suppose, private dancer, there she goes

[Verse Two: Heavy D] (Background Singers)
Now look at how she flows
Gal yuh pretty and yuh wicked from head to toe
Can we kick it and tek tings nice and slow (SLO-OW-OW)
And I suppose, this is how it goes
Then I give yuh one dozen red red rose 
Bend mi till mi watch yuh tek off yuh clothes
Pure diamond ring and ting fi sure
And I give yuh love galore and much much more
Every friday 'round eleven, at di club she's dancin
Di wey she moves is like she romancin
Nuff people come in fi watch har turn and spin
It's like di breeze blowin when she groovin
