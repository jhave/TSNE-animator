Sittin down in the rosspot earnin my pay
Gotta get off these bundles and be on my way
But quicker than a nigga could say lets get paid
The Narcles busted in on an early mornin raid
So I kicked out the window jumped the roof next door
Took the money left the war, but I'll get more and more
Cops on my trail tryin to put me in jail
I slipped and I fell, got up and ran like hell
Dropped my gun runnin through this jungle
I ain't tryin to get caught with no bundles
Cops yellin freeze I hear one say there his gun goes
I don't wanna go to the lock-up, the officer picked my glock up
All I heard was sirens and police cars surroundin the block up

I bust a cap and holdin psycho less you know I'm paranoid
Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit
I bust a cap and holdin psycho less you know I'm paranoid
Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit Detroit

Runnin down this alley too, a blue Malibu
Sky FOX got me on the Channel Two news
Fuck you is what I'm yellin as I'm bellin, pockets swellin
Fleein and a loon tryin ta hit me with a felon
Caught with possession and attempt to deliver, drug sellin
Survelence saw me servin plaques on the street hellin
Ain't no tellin if somebody snitch or not when you makin nots
All I know is I toss my dope sack police chase me around the block it's hot
I got no choices I turned down a dead end
So I figure I throw my hands up and turn myself in
But then (BANG!) "Damn man you see that cop shoot that unarmed man?"
Damn, bitch shot me</pre>
