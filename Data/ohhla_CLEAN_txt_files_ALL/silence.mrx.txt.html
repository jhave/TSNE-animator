Verse One: Godilla

Snakes slither as fake niggas shakin' my hand
Body language read so I know right where they stand
Disguised as fam cuttin' lifespans for grands
Waiting to strike like scorpions in the sand
Live in a land fighting odds goin' in hard
Even relatives on some dog eat dog (woof)
I peep devils quick exposing they hoof
Watch loyalty turn like pages in books
Traitors on blast display 'em like hooks
Big Payback (uhhh) Payments get took
Patience mistook for weakness, sorry you lose
A fine line between who's who and neutral
Know what it is before things get so truthful
If need be fight dirty peliando sucio
Enemies at a distance within my pupils
If not they do you like Solar did Guru

Chorus: June Marx

Rumor creators war instigators
Offering favors like foreign invaders
Shark imitators liars and fakers
They smile but they haters silence the traitors 2x

Verse Two: June Marx

Thought loyalty was imbedded,fam I broke bread with
The same fam wanna see the marxman beheaded
They born to backstab due to bittersweet logic
I don a gasmask cause the industry toxic
Surrounded by judasses tell me who true to this
They rape the artform its losing its exclusiveness
Decode the politricks and make it all clear
The crosshair of psychological warfare
No type of remorse here, its every man for self
They smile in your face plotting to damage your health
Their album is shelved, and lack integrity
Mad cause my solo lp surpassed their legacy
A gift and a curse a burden I carry
Contractors blackwater mercenary
With Muffled statements the jungle the pavement
Humble and patient dealing with a double agent
