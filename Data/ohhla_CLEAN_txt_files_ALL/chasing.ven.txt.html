[Chorus 2X: (sample) J-Boo]
(Some people shoot for the moon) To the top, to the top, to the top y'all
(Chasing the rainbow so high) We won't stop y'all, we won't stop y'all
 
[J-Boo]
This time around, we gonna reach for the top
Cuz niggas tried to stop our dream, but they forgot
That we don't give up, won't give up
Even if we don't blow up, we still roll up, on the scene
You know my team and the reputation we got
We spits that Venom and we always keep it hot
We been through the struggles, and we done seen it all
The rise and fall, but Deadly Venom counquers all
Ya see at A&amp;M, we got caught in the merge
But we still dropped Da Bombs and gave you the urge
And deal number two? That put us back on the map
Darrell Buzz, we did his thing, but his crew was wack
No disrespect, but I keeps it real like that
Got that underground buzz and them platinum tracks
So here we stand united and divided we fall
We gonna keep on Rockin' the World for all of y'all
 
[Chorus 2X]
 
[N-Tyce]
Rap-a-rina, used to be a day dreamer watchin Selina
Wishing I was sellin records out in Argentina
I went from locally known, to vocally known, to outspokenly known
Verbal skills openly shown, yet the struggle continues (that's right)
Until I'm sellin out about 100,000 seat venues
I might end up on tour, with Marilyn Manson or Hanson
I'm makin moves for expansion
Better my life, too many folks settle in life or either ahead of they life
But I'mma live it up (uh) its like I'm stuck in 18 again
Caught up in between the men, get the CREAM and win
My point exactly, always had a strong family to back me
Crack that don't attract me (you)
Even though I been hard headed since a young'n
I always break ya'll off a little somethin', somethin'
 
[Chorus]
 
[Champ]
Ayo, I'm, sick and tired of all the frustration
Broken hearted, like we ain't Venoms, split up like the Temptations
So what, another mad rapper kicks the bucket
But as far as this game goes, I love it
Check it, Champ, D, puttin it down
Crazy as what, no way I'm giving up now
Spittin' Venom til the death, its either do or die
Deadly as ever, you can see the tears in my eyes
Feeling my pain, ya hear me, the shhhhh in the game
I'm losing my cool, I suggest you better maintain
Ease up, for real yall, throw those D's up
Representing Rocks the World, my nigga, G's up
Microphone Fiend and ain't nothin' wrong for chasing ya dream
Keepin' it real, still gettin that Venomous CREAM
Poison and Viper, my homies still on the team
Holdin' it up, givin' you the finishing touch, the finishing touch
 
[Chorus to end]</pre>
