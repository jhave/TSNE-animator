[ Fresh Prince (&amp; Ready Rock C) ]
Ladies and gentlemen
Fly girls and fly guys
My name is the Fresh Prince
And I've come here to introduce someone to you
His name is the Human Linn Drum Ready Rock C
And we came to tell everyone that...
( *Ready Rock C starts beatboxing* )
When we rock the house there is no doubt (is no doubt)
That me and Ready C will turn it out (turn it out)
We're down with the DJ Jazzy Jeff (Jazzy Jeff)
And you know that we are def (that we're def)
And you should not settle for less
Than the undisputed best
[ Fresh Prince &amp; Ready Rock C ]
That's right, we are the best
[ Fresh Prince (&amp; Ready Rock C) ]
Everywhere we (go), everytime we do a (show)
Everybody wants to (know) how we make em say (ho)
The way we do is not a magical trick
It's a lotta def rhymes (and beats like this)

( *Ready Rock C breaks into a new beat* )

[ Fresh Prince ]
Somebody yell 'hooo-o'
[ crowd ]
Hooo-o
[ Fresh Prince ]
Say 'ho, ho'
[ crowd ]
Ho, ho

[ Fresh Prince ]
Now I'm the Fresh Prince, hello, how do you do?
I just have a little fun with the rest of my crew
So take a chill and just relax
Yo Ready C, pretend that you're a dj and scratch

( *Ready Rock C imitates scratching* )
[ crowd ]
Go Ready Rock, go Ready Rock...

[ Fresh Prince (&amp; Ready Rock C) ]
Alright now, bust a move
And get the hell out if you're tryin to bust the groove
Cause we came to (party) all through the night
And we're excommunicating those who don't act (right)
This is a (party), so grab some(body)
Drink some Ba(cardi) and dance (with everybody)
The feeling's good, some people think it's great
Get on the dancefloor and let your body girate
In cadence with the beat, just move your feet
While the Prince is on the rhyme (Ready C is on the beat)

[ Fresh Prince (&amp; Ready Rock C) ]
My.. beatbox rocks everywhere we go
Gettin utterly respected at every show
No other can (beat me), no girl can out-(freak me)
(Man, I'm gettin tired) Ready C, give me a beat, please
He does a lot that others cannot do
Ready C and the Prince, the toughest two man crew
We're comin out rockin and we're takin what's ours
Ready C is the man and the suckers he devours
Beat after beat he gains respect
Ready C is the man that's keepin others in check
I like to rock with him, side by side
Me and Ready cold chillin with the utmost pride
So if you're not down by law to rock the spot
Then get the hell out, cause we're never gonna stop
My beatbox

We been rockin kinda hard ever since we begun
Yo Ready C, man, play Stanford and Son

( *Ready Rock C intonates theme from 'Stanford and Son'* )

Now play it under water

( *same routine sounding like it's done under water* )

How 'bout a fresh beat
A fresh beat
Ready C, how 'bout a fresh beat
A fresh beat
Bust it

( *Ready Rock C switches to another beat* )

Well, his name is Ready C, and I'm tellin you
He can play a beat forwards and backwards too

( *Ready Rock C makes the beat sounding like it's being spun backwards on a turntable* )

Play it backwards

[ crowd ]
Go Ready Rock, go Ready Rock...

Bust it

Backwards

[ Fresh Prince singing (&amp; Ready Rock C) ]
Do you know where you're goin to
And do you like the things that Ready C is showin you?
(Showin you) where you're goin to (goin to)
Do you know that we are down by law
We want you all to know that we're primal of all
And when we rock the house there is no doubt
That me and Ready C will turn it out
Do you know where you're goin to
And do you like the things that Ready C is showin you?

( *crowd cheers* )</pre>
