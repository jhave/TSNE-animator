[Intro/Chorus: Flo Rida]
She had Hennessy hips, and Belve' eyes
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)

[Flo Rida]
Hey hey hey shorty, took me to tipsy from sober
Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier
Hopin she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover
Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta
Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need
like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment - must be sealed inside
Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?
Body bangin, I lay the language, that walk is famous
The proper anus like she was painted
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous
None other, who's her lover, this above her
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother
Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler
Shorty whassup~! She had..

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Heyyy parking lot pimpin, yeah that's the way I approached her
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster
Miss - got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder
Serious, she the business and I need closure
So hood and I'm startin, I'm blowin see no stuck up trumpin
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin my platinum my money
This ain't your normal every day baby
The type to drive nothin less than that 600 Mercedes
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380
I feel like she put me under a spell
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal
I put her on my tab, had her sippin, call a cab

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
All my shorties if you with me, let me hear you say Ms. Hangover
(Ms. Hangover)
All my shorties if you with me, let me hear you say Ms. Hangover
(Ms. Hangover)
All my ballers if you with me, let me hear you say I'm hungover
(I'm hungover)
All my ballers if you with me, let me hear you say I'm hungover
(I'm hungover)
Ms. Hangover (Ms. Hangover)
Got me hungover (got me hungover)
I'm hungover (I'm hungover)
From Ms. Hangover (from Ms. Hangover)
Ms. Hangover (Ms. Hangover)
Got me hungover (got me hungover)
I'm hungover (I'm hungover)
From Ms. Hangover (from Ms. Hangover)
