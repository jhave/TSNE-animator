[Tajai]
Back back, way back, I used to fret that my honey
Would play me for one with more pap(er)s, still it was funny
'Cause she paid no mind as jerks lurked constantly
And my insecurity turned into maturity (I matured)
As the years pass I find it hard to be monogamous
So do other brothers, ???? and (?) ???? still synonymous
Catch crazy glance when I'm with female company
Some think I'm a softie and they step to her in front of me
So in public places I am often found in my trunk
Reaching for bats, and *smack* goes his spunk
Because I have the right to riff, and in spite
Of a few protests, progress and I might smite you
Once you come, your fronts, they got no future
Blunts blur my sight, get left and right suture
I know this, and also notice advances:
I peeped them pap(er)s in which he slipped to my dip
With numerals, and you're soon to roast thinking I'm jelly
'Cause numbers left in the gutter lead to lonely tellies (telephones)
(God damn, why won't she call?)
'Cause we see who's pee-wee and we see who's me
The difference is Vaseline: You're slipping while I'm skin-dipping
Grips, and grips of chumps my way:
Slumped from back-bumps on rumps, 'cause I flay
So why play, 'cause Tajai has to flip
I found mine, so find your own companionship

(Chorus)
Every time I see you in the world
You always step my girl
But ask yourself homeboy -- Why is that?

[A-Plus]
Brothers get jealous when I'm chilling with my dip
Just because she's flyer, you try to, play me like Milton Bradley
I'm mad, G, just because you've gotta settle for Maggie
Or Agnes, maybe Mathilda the Witch, yo
I'mma have to beat you if you call her a bitch, yo
Keep your mind off what's mine for the keeping (yup)
Or I'll put a bomb in your house while you're sleeping (boom!)
Keep your distance, Hiero is watching you

Step by step, I never slept, I gots to do lots
'Cause you brothers never respect who you should (me)
Try to be my friend, and it might do you good (yeah)
Get down with the program, hey yo man yo
Don't even look at my girl on a slow jam
Of course not, you'll never get that close (nah)
To her soft skin, rest in a coffin
If you ever disrespect, I'll twist your neck
If I've got a bat, I might get pissed and flex (boom)
'Cause your tramp ain't got a stamp of approval
When I get mine with this rhyme, your crew will
Have to learn the hard way, I'll have to slam you like Hammer
So I bet you'll all break
Even though his song is wack, mine's not
Your girl will never get the props that mine got

(Chorus)

[Opio]
I'm the brother stepping with the flyer female companion
Others be scheming or scamming, dreaming, planning, plotting
Trying to make moves when I'm not in the vicinity
I'll fill that ass with splinters, see
Pull a wood bat, would that change your disposition?
Wishing you was in my position, kissing and hugging on a goddess
But I stay humble and modest
Brothers want to rumble, but they stumble and fumble
'Cause they get pummelled by the mischievous
You might catch a whiff of this sneaker
Seek the company of my sweet senorita?
Swing a bat like _The Natural_, break your clavicle
Fracture femurs, as you scream I'm overcome with laughter
I'm the champion, my man slaps me ten
'Cause he's twice as nice, twice the jealousy
'Cause fellas see they don't suffice
Opio Lindsey spins the spinal cords
Of the hordes of the Huckleberry Finns
My knuckles are buried in chins
'Cause it offends when you're stepping
Adrenalin is pumping, I thump chumps with my weapon
Moments of tranquility abruptly have to cease
Walking hand in hand, when one feels he has to speak his piece
Should I pull a piece and unleash a couple of bullets?
Would it persuade a brother to turn his head and foot it
In the opposite direction, throat sets in his chin
Recognized that I fooled him

(Chorus x2)
Everytime she sees you
She could just take off
And you could just let off steam by screaming</pre>
