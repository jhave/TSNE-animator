[Intro-Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world
Slim Shady

[Chorus-Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O oh o oh, bitch's hopping in my tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers, Whose got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of them 
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
and we're starting this party from dusk

[Verse 1-Eminem]
Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Fix your must, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mothers son who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick from under cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitch's lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cut, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse then Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O oh o oh, bitch's hopping in my tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers, Whose got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of them 
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
and we're starting this party from dusk

[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

[Verse 2-Dr Dre]
They see that low rider go by there, like Oh my
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre
I'm an itch that they cant scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, Elcamino or the Eldorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decision, garage looks like precision collision
Or maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

[Chorus-Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O oh o oh, bitch's hopping in my tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers, Whose got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of them 
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
and we're starting this party from dusk
[Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent

[Verse 3-50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, its simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, i'm King Kong
Get rolled, on wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the paper man, I'm caking, you know i don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker i'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck i want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy shit, Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

[Chorus-Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
O oh o oh, bitch's hopping in my tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves
Now where's the rubbers, Whose got the rubbers
I noticed there's so many of them 
And there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn
and we're starting this party from dusk</pre>
