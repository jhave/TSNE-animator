[Swan]
It's platinum baby, A/K/A BJ, so got them goin crazy
Back up on the scene, and I'm showin you green
Don't gotta ask what I mean, take a look at my team
Entrepreneurs gettin publishin, raw on tour, no rubbishin
Swan drops nukes by law, where we at wit this
Everywhere you see them four byes
Low low's Jack Benz wit the bubble eyes in every hallway
In every PJ, all night, all day, they bumpin BJ
Now when they play me in the clubs, girls rush the DJ
And say you gotta replay, wit no delay

[Chorus: Swan]
I'll be damned, if I couldn't turn the party out
I'll be damned, if I couldn't make you scream and shout
I'll be damned, I'll be damned
I'll be damned, if I don't collect a royalty check
And don't have a niggie beggin on knees, because he slept
I'll be damned, I'll be damned

[Buckshot]
Fire one, fire two, let the missile drop
Let the doors get loose when the whistle pop
Bark, this is the arc, you could get a ball but we leavin at dark
If you got your ticket, then your mission starts
Don't get caught up in some shit, niggas want they throat to get slit
Now, I gotta lot, you gotta lot, if you gotta pot
And I gotta spot, if I gotta knot, tell me if I got shot
Cuz I got somethin for you when my shit get hot
Lyrically about to let my nine cock
Bust off a whole round, I'll be damned if I see hoes now

[Chorus: Buckshot]
I'll be damned, if I have to keep being this broke
I'll be damned, if I go a day without no smoke
I'll be damned, if I don't become a millionaire
I'll be damned, if ya niggas don't watch and stare

[Buckshot]
What's the deal BJ?
I really wanna know what's the deals these days
Don't forget the bombay

[Swan]
If I take another life, then I sell my soul
But I'll be damned if I let you run up on me for my gold
So when I roll, I take precaution
Too many of my peers got took out while they were flossin
That hit me hard, and I still gotta battle police
Cuz brutality ain't no where near a cease
Once you provoke, I'mma, I'mma blast
Cuz I'm nervous, and I don't want plungers runnin in my ass

[Buckshot]
I'll be damned if police try to lock me up
Put they hand on they waste and glock me up
Rather die like a champ, and live like a ass
Cuz when it's time to bust, I'm boundin to blast
We got bomb weed, bomb beats, bomb to licks
We got to bomb the weed constantly
Watch, I'm feelin when I get up in the ass like
Tonight's the night, you weak MC's
Better come right, now when I say come right
You better sound tight, cuz all that shit you kick
It sound like it bite, and you better prepare for this shit I'm on
Cuz I'm a Nocturnal nigga, and I'm bringin Da Storm
Word is bond, and I'll be damned</pre>
