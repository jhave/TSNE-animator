[Z-Ro]
I came up around the roughest of the rough necks, on corners with a bar
Shadow rocks and a Geniva real ready to go to war
We don't love nothing ready to murder something on sight
Put it on my life, one of my foes'll bite the bullet tonight
You see ths red light this beam, plus a murdering team
Thinking of even to coming and get you it's the E and D
So what's another murder nigga you brought this on yourself
I'ma do it to you slow and make you want to chrome yourself
You owe me something nigga don't like you don't owe me when you see me
I got killers looking to locate your bitch and bust freely
I'ma take another ass for it, to get a million
I be going against the grain slow living or living fast for it
Therefor I'ma mash for it, addicted to greed
I'm headfirst up in this dirty game my life is full speed
Trying to hog it all, bleed the block until the block drop
Screaming fuck y'all until a nigga fry

(Chorus - 4x)
Gorilla till I die

[Den-Den]
Grill out, chill out from my cool reflection
Face spill out, fill out the room full of haters section
Reck's aggression, cause this Frankiln got tossed
For reala gorilla these wars with an extra set of balls
Got to war down to the thug field with bombs suit up
But don't talk to me, holla at my little thugs
If it's Prada that you want then we got it by the way
But I won't hesitate to seel you an underground tape
Fuck the straight and the narrow I be crooked than a bitch
Slide through the door sideways with a mask and some clips
With a dope dog, that I stole from the law
Make you slip up out of your clothes on the way to see your balls
Too down, too dirty, I'm all that shit
Don't get caught in this movie when my mind start to trip
It's a hit, hit by Mr. Crooked Profit
Gorilla till I die and can't nann nigga stop it

[Lyrical 187]
My plans to be a millionaire done tripped and went elsewhere
Times pass, thangs change but me I'm stuck in nowhere
Now I done told the laws, when I found out be a little bit better off
Then worry about them white cars that keep passing by my house
And, rare digits, I'm speaking from experience
Thinking this might be the time for me to set it off
I'm lost and throwed so it seems it can't still matches
Some bank heists, and aggravated terroristic jackers
Drama related but damn it I've been straight since 98
I put that life behind me and still trying to reach the gate
They say money is the key to success but can't handle this
Without the paper on your hands it's hard times and stress
No shit, I told you that I can handle it
But damn it, I'll be damned if I'm gone let it handle me
I tell y'all what, I stay high, cause it keeps me from spilling away
It's inside, I'm a gorilla till I die

[Z-Ro]
Maybe I should try hitch hike cause too many niggas on my block
Trying to make a million pettiest songs in the same spot
Grab mentality of a sick nigga, anyway that I can get it
You better believe that I'm gone get it till I see a rich nigga
Remember my strategy, always bust first
In a situation me and Nina burst, leavin memeories on the streets
Heartless, with or without heat
Holding ground as if a nigga sporting cleats
Gorilla till I die cause I'ma be a hog, I want it all
Trying to ball until my final curtain call
If it means stepping on they toes they better be ready for my moves
But fucking recognize I'm a raw dog with a trunk full of 2's
Click for the ooz', my nigga we gone blast together
When it's rough and tough we take it till we laugh together
Forever, we gone bleed the block until the block drops
Screaming fuck y'all until a nigga fry

(Chorus - 4x)</pre>
