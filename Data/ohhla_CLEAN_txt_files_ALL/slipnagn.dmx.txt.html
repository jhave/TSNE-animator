[DMX - repeat 2X]
That's what it is baby
It's straight biz baby
We ain't kids baby (WHAT!)
We get down like that

[Chorus 2X: DMX]
Slippin and fallin
It's how they got a nigga callin
up to the Lord cause I'm crawlin
All my niggaz cause I'm tired of, slippin and fallin

[DMX]
Check it; more money, more problems
I thought more money would solve 'em
I spent more money in Harlem
then Frank Lucas did before the boys got him (WHAT!)
Oooh, now shit done changed
How I'm feelin, shit looks strange (YEAH!)
I realized that, shit ain't the same (uhh!)
Cause at the end of the day shit ain't a game (c'mon!)
Nigga goin through it but I slipped and fell
Went to the hood, took a trip to hell
Did what I should, so while my shit sell
Always know I could, so I did well!

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Check it; if y'all only knew
what, my life is like and what I'm goin through
Maybe you'd THINK before you talk (OKAY~!)
You gotta crawl before you walk (C'MON!)
Think havin money is the answer?
Money ain't nothin but another form of cancer
All you could do is watch me die
You don't wanna, watch me try so watch me, BYE!
What you gon' do is watch me fly
Do my thing on that big stage in the sky
Lord, PLEASE, hold me down (C'MON!)
Cause now everybody wanna know me now

[Chorus]

[DMX]
PLEASE HELP ME! (WHAT!) WHICH WAY DO I GO?
Life's a book, which page do I show?
Cause I KNOW, you can't show 'em all
Even though I stripped and fell I won't fall
GET IT? Okay, you don't
Some of y'all WILL but most of y'all won't
But I'ma keep livin life bein the man that God made me
Cause I know, only He can save me

[Chorus] - 2X

[Outro: DMX]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
I wish, I wish! (can you help me?)
AHH, I wish you knew!
(I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna fall)
I WISH YOU FUCKIN KNEW! (please help me)
I WISH (I don't wanna fall)
I WISH YOU KNEW! (ahh-ahh)</pre>
