	Don't drink the milk (why?) IT'S SPOILED!

[Pete Nice]
Eyes slow to open, alarm clock's broken
I'm steppin out the bed but ain't a booty line spoken
Stick a 40 to my lips, I sips and I guzzle
A 40-dog "Breakfast of Champs" it ain't a puzzle
Grips on my feet and step out my rest
I meet MC Dope Incredible and DJ Fresh
They got a demo; fiendin for my headphones
So I throw it my system but it's so-so
I said, "The weebles wobble, but I dabble in verbals
The movies that you're makin get the herbalz"
This ain't a Prince Paul loop from The Turtles
It's just 3rd Bass givin y'all the herbalz

	Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is, there it is!)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is, there it is!)
[Serch]	Hold up!  Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down
	Herbalz in your mouth (say WHAT?)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	From the North and to the South (there it is, there it is)
[Serch]	Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down

[MC Serch]
Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down
But them herbalz, they bobble and you see them all around
Them 501 blues can't hide the red apple
when I'm in a bodega, buyin some Snapple Orange Iced-Tea
Skins are playin nicety behind me
Scatterbrain no-name do you mind G?
Spot the profile and slips in the Serch zone
and wants a description of the bone -- hold up
Wants a description of the bone?!
Play AT&amp;T and check the three on your telephone
D-E-F, then I left to break South
and left a herbal in her mouth

	Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (There it is!)
[Serch]	Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!
	Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	3rd Bass givin herbalz in the mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Herbalz in the mouth (there it is, there it is)
[Serch]	Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down!

[MC Serch] + {DJ Richie Rich scratching}
Herbalz.. HERBALZ!  Ha ha ha
Herbalz..

[Serch]	Weebles to the weebles to the wobbles - to the herbalz
[Nice]	I don't drink milk when it curdles
[Serch]	Cause then it's too pasty, French like pastry
[Nice]	It's like gettin caught boostin at Macy's
[Serch]	True indeed, Cogswell Cogs, and Sprockets at Spacely's
[Nice]	I make like George, and Jet-i-son safely
[Serch]	to my rest and not a Tribe but I'm Quest'n
	You got bad breath, then take a Certs with Retsin
	Dribble dribble drabble say what, I beg your pardon
	Quincy ain't convinced me, got my own "Secret Gardens"
[Nice]	So now we boomin out the speakers and amps (true)
	Buggin your nuts like the PMS cramps
	Some falsified but I gots bones to pick
	The only nine you ever seen was in arithmetic
	Herbalz given, how you livin?
[Serch]	Yo I ain't played like a pseudo
[Nice]	Herbalz in your mouth, and mine are macanudo

	(There it is)
	Herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	Say herbalz in your mouth (there it is?)
	Everybody say herbalz in your mouth (there it is, there it is)
	A from the North, to the South (there it is)
	Everybody say HERBALZ IN YOUR MOUTH

[MC Serch]
