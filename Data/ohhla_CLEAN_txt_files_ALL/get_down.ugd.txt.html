[Hook: U-God (MC Eiht)]
I'm a bonified g, g, g, g, g, g (Chea, chea, chea, chea)
I'm a bonified g, g, g, g, g (Chea, chea, chea, chea, come on)
I'm a bonified g, g, g, g (Where ya at? East coast, west coast)
Vicious, vicious, viciously (come on!)

[Chorus: U-God]
Get down, get down, brah', I'm in your town, brah'
That's how we do it, I'm a stone cold rider
And now, I bust a round off, I'm a survivor
This is how we do it, for you snake ass conivers around

[Boo Kapone]
For you conivers, bust a round
Look around, lay ass down with the fo' pound
Shady spots for eighty blocks
I keep a bitch eyes closed like Jamie Foxx
Off the chain, niggaz saw I'm off the chain
Nigga, stay in ya lane, so I'm off your face
It don't stop, I'm on the block
Lickin' shots, with the twelve gauge
Hit a nigga up, have you rapping for the front page

[Chorus]

[Squeak Ru]
When them 24's park, them big dogs bark
You don't wanna get down when them big dogs start
Moving through the crowd, making glocks get loud
Lettin' suckers know we'll take yo town
Flip a little ass, stack a little cash
Quick on the smash, I'm always on the smash
What these niggaz gon' do with the Wu and the Ru
Them Timbs and them chucks, gon' put it on them dudes

[Chorus]

[U-God]
I'm down for the get down, earnin' my stripes
Hillside, real guys, burn burners for life
Put slugs through yo vest, or blood on my knife
Yo I'm up in here, where it at? Throw the dice
The chrome device, still layin' on my hip
Lettin' my nuts swing, we bang for the strip
I'm up in this bitch, I bounce around the west coast
Hollerin' at hoes, lookin' for the best smoke

[Chorus]

[MC Eiht]
I'm a gangsta-gangsta brah', straight up menace
And I don't stop shootin' til the clip is finished
Ya'll ain't heard about me, still a boy in the hood
AK in the trunk, brah', it's all good
One time try to gaffle, the work, no hassle
C.P.T., kingpin of the castle
It's Compton, you see the bulge in the waist
T-shirt go up, y'all about face, chea

[Chorus]
