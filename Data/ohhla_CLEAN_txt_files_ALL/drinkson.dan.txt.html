[Verse 1]
You got your neice to babysit ya baby
Toes lookin' right cause early you got a pedi
You ain't got a man but you got a baby daddy
Go out ya way to get drunk at a party every Saturday
But who am I to judge, baby? Want another drink?
Tonight give me your brain, you ain't gotta think
Just let yourself go, tomorrow blame the alcohol
You ain't got a job, it ain't like you got a class tomorrow
Find you a purse to borrow, beats is like your friends
Start being in thoughts cause the party never ends
I.D. say 22, forever 21
Best friend 30, she forever 21
Goin' down the same path, take another sip
Pour another glass, take another hit
I tell you that you're beautiful, your pops never did
Probably why it ain't a pop around for none of yoÐ³Ðº kids
Sorry for puttin' out ya biz
But right now I can't stop lookin' at them tits
And grabbin' on that ass, fillin' up the glass
Get you drunk and fuck you, that's a part of my task
And she really helpin', bein' a real sport about it
Full cup of Goose, pinch of cran and she allowed it
20 minutes later, man, she really all about it
20 minutes later, man, she took a nigga out, kid, drinks on me

[Chorus]
Pass the designated driver the keys
And don't worry y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Bring your I.D. hangin' with me
It's on my tab y'all, drinks on me, so have a toast with me
Hennessey and Grand Cru for me
I take a sip and say free Max B, so have a drink with me
So don't worry y'all, 'bout no fees
I said I got it y'all, drinks on me, so have a drink with me

[Verse 2]
Say my auntie sort of like an alcoholic
Been drinkin' since the teens, shittin' blood in the toilet
Started real young, nigga pushed the bottle on her
Drunk, fully clothed in tubs, I took showers on her
But I still love her and I live life for her
She ask me for a dollar, I'm gon' give it to her
Stay drinkin' on the brew, keep a can in her hand
Tied grocery bag full of Keystone cans
Alcoholism has poisoned our city
Liquor store on every corner ain't like that in other cities
So you have a drink, take a hit and pass that
Give a buck to a wino help him buy crack
Dwell on the past, lookin' towards tomorrow
Wish I could lend my pain, let you borrow my sorrow
Live where lil' niggas wanna be Chris Partlow
Say fuck the lotto, buck's on a bottle, drinks on me

[Chorus]</pre>
