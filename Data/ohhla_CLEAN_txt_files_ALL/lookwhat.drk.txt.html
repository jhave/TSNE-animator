Yeah, mm-hmm, man
It's like oh-nine in yo' basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smokin heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ask shit and we argue about spendin money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button you push it
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and yo' heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
if you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbin a bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the mornin
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signin me, I come home, we make a mixtape with seventeen songs
and almost get a Grammy off of that thing, they love your son man that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of and I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise it all worked out girl, we shoulda known
cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You know that I was gonna be somethin
We stressed out, and you need somethin I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you...

[Drake]
It's like oh-six in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just wasn't that real, so then it doesn't fade
And my father livin in Memphis now he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
That still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneakin in your pool after school dances
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons, for all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib you'd calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done actin I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, to you got to me you you tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top Lexus hopin that I don't get arrested
Just another kid goin through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounce but we bounce back, I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know how I'd really be without that
It worked out man, you deserve it
