[Verse 1]
Walk in to a room with my hands on my side, head raised
All this gossip and talk, it reminds me of my webpage
Ya'll people give me headaches
It's hard to keep my head straight
It's like tryin to go up but held down by dead weight
Walk on lands and stay interesting
Nine albums dropped and I can't play an instrument
A lot of people wanna say I'm cheap as fuck
Why, cause I spend my money on my beats and cuts
Ya'll peeps speak too much, matter of fact
You'll peeps can eat these two nuts and still peep my new stuff
I ain't too ashamed, I say what's on my mental
Try to quit my job and make a livin on my pencil
But sometimes, people like to open up they mouth
Put their nose in my business, kid ya'll need a life
Since the first day my mom taught me how to read and write
I've been spreadin my vocab to the land like Jesus Christ
So believe the hype, yo I'm dope when I speak on mics
So when I smoke pass the beeper I don't need a pipe
Trust me kid, I'm mendin' all my nemeses
(But class!) cut you off in the middle of your sentences

[Chorus]
Ah damn! Another motherfucker up in here
Runnin his mouth and puttin shit in your ear
Ah damn! And I ain't tryin to hear what you sayin'
Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertainin'
Ah damn!
? when you say my name
Try to spread love through the game
Say what you want I wont change

[Verse 2]
(Go ahead) call me a pasty white kid (whatever) I ain't concerned
I can't sun tan, I'm too hot, I burn
And if I drop I'll return with the status that I left
Yeah this is a game and I play the reign of ref
Cause I break rules, take fools for they money and they fake jewels
Eh yo some things never change
And I'm puttin in work more than one way ask your lady
You still wanna talk, actin' like class is lazy
See I'm like a bum with no legs, I cant stand workin'
But I'll write in to the night until my right hands hurtin'
Strike like lightening and kill all the nonsense
Son, just be honest you never were a profit (now stop this!)
Why you wanna rhyme like you deep now
I tried to listen but your puttin me to sleep pal
I'm flowin' better when I freestyle, listen to me speak now
Impress your female but keep it on the DL (shhhhhhh)
Some things are better unsaid
Your whole rhyme book is better left unread
And I ain't tryin to turn this in to a battle track
But I gotta handle cats who try to battle back
