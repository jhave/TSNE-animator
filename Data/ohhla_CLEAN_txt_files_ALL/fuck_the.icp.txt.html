[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck. Fuck this shit.
Fuck givin it to me.

[Chorus:]
If I only could I'd set the world on fire
If I only could I'd set the world on fire
If I only could I'd set the world on fire
Sya fuck the world! (Fuck the world!)
If I only could I'd set the world on fire
Fuck em all! (Fuck em all!)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck you, fuck me, fuck us
Fuck Tom, fuck Mary, fuck Gus
Fuck Darius
Fuck the west coast, and fuck everybody on the east
Eat shit and die, or fuck off at least
Fuck pre-schoolers, fuck rumors
Kings and Queens and gold jewelers
Fuck wine coolers
Fuck chickens, fuck ducks
Everybody in your crew sucks, punk mother fucks
Fuck critics, fuck your review
Even if you like me, fuck you
Fuck your mom, fuck your mom's momma
Fuck the Beastie Boys and the Dali Llama
Fuck the rain forest, fuck a Forrest Gump
You probably like it in the rump
Fuck a shoe pump, fuck the real deal and fuck all the fakes
Fuck all fifty two states! Oooo, and fuck you

[Chorus] X 2

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck Oprah, fuck opera, fuck a soap opera
Fuck a pop locker and a cock blocker
Fuck your girlfriend, I probably did her already
Fuck Kyle and his brother Tom Petty, Jump Steady
My homie, fuck him, what are you gonna do?
(Fuck that bitch, fuck you!) Yeah well fuck you too
Don't bother tryin to analyze these rhymes
In this song I say fuck ninety three times
Fuck the president, fuck your welfare
Fuck your government and fuck Fred Bear
Fuck Nugent, like anybody gives a fuck
You like to hunt a lot, so fuckin what?!
Fuck disco, Count of Monte Crisco
Fuck Cisco, and Jack and Jerry Brisco
And fuck everyone who went down with the Titanic, in a panic
I'm like fuck you, AHHHHH!!!!

[Chorus] X 2

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fuck Celine Dion and fuck Dionne Warwick
You both make me sick, suck my dick
Fuck the Berlin Wall, both sides of it
And fuck Lyle Lovett, whoever the fuck that is
Fuck everybody in the hemisphere
Fuck them across the world, and fuck them right here
You know the guy that operates the Rouge River draw bridge in Delray on
Jefferson? FUCK HIM!
Fuck your idea, fuck your gonnoreha
Fuck your diarrhea, Rocky Maivia
Fuck your wife, your homie did, he's fuckin you
Fuck the police and the 5-0 too
Fuck Spin, Rolling Stone, and fuck Vibe
Fuck everybody inside
Whoever's on the cover, fuck his mother
Fuck your little brother's homie from around the way
And fuck Violent J!</pre>
