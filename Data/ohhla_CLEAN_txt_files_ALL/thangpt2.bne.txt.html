[Chorus - Krayzie]
Ain't nothin' changed, everyday
Ain't nothin' changed (x3)

It's an everyday thang when you hear the bucks bang
Mo Thugs is all you claim
stay thug up in this game and remain the same
So follow me, now see [now see]
off to the double-glock and hear pistols poppin'
buckin' them bodies with shots, and a come up,

Everybody get up, get down (x4)

Everybody get up and like my fucked-up gang without the grip
Gotta have another bill, y'all Dog, I need all my change
Soon as creep up, I'm pullin' my people up outta the bullshit
That's why we choose this thugsta music
You just move it dont abuse it
Bone so lovely
Gotta get, gotta get, get money [mo' money]
Thuggin' forever we keepin' it real,
I'm ready to show when they let niggas roll with Mo Thug hit the shit
then we roll with murder we told ya
Rollin', blowin' indo, we go
niggas doubted we are trues, yeah
Ready to bust on anything
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Killa, Me killa, killa... [Break it down](x15)

[Layzie]
I'm wonderin really how many more niggas
I'll see in a coffin before its my time
I'm the kind right here to take losses, not a dime
Everyday it's the same, and I gotta mine to the grind
My mental be stressed on my pistol my only untensil for cheddar
It's on the level war
Whatever my mind is my church and my kids or my pleasure
Would ya like to come parlay with Lay all through my hood?
Sit back, everything gon' be all good
Niggas ridin' real, knock on wood, goin' against the grain
It's all the same, It's all the same
Smokin' on a lot more weed than before
no pain, no gain
You straight up hangin', and that's shame
How long we'll reign
Bang, bang, gotta get down for my thang,
ain't nothin' to do to get outta this game [outta this game]
Run, we came with consistency
instantly and guard them greens of the earth
We're resistance, baby
baby, tell me what doyou wanna do?
Tell me, what do you wanna do? You can ride and smoke with me
or I can ride and smoke with you
It's all cool, It's all cool, It's all cool
Act a fool, Act a fool, It's all cool, It's all cool

[Bizzy]
Ready when I got my pistol, and got to flip, and when in my hood,
should be animal and gnarl, wanna go shut you down and eat breakfast
oh so, don't you know that I know you're whole M.O.
and away you go and I got (...?...) mo, little bit
you know so, hit it, me stumble (...?...) and even scuffle
I heard my little brother smacked the shit out you bitch and bust you
hear my nationwide "fuck you, fuck you"
I got people that you trust,
who needs some greens, and really don't love you
Never familiar, send 'em all in the city out to (?)
an everyday thang and I bang your brains, nigga

[Krayzie]
Ain't nothin' changed everyday
Ain't nothin' changed (x4)

[Wish]
It's an everyday thang, it's an everyday thang, 
it's an everyday thang, thang.
It's an everyday thang, it's an everday thang, 
it's an everyday buck, buck, buck, bang.
Calm me down. It ain't gon' change. We won't change
Bone thugs-n-harmony, we keeps it realer
Tell me, can you feel us feel us, feel us?
Tell me can you feel us, feel us, feel us, killas?
Even though we still roll the Clair, playa haters better beware,
'cause we got mines, we got nines, we got shit to blow you all the time
Anytime you got yours, you got yours, I got mine, I got mine
Fuck with mine, fuck with mine.
East 99 is the street, keep it on the low when they creep,
or Bone got heat, Bone got heat,
hurt them who tried to hurt me. B-O-N-E, 'cause I'm rollin with ya, 
'cause I'm rollin' with ya, 'cause I'm rollin' with ya.
It's an everyday, it's an everyday, 
it's an everyday thang, bang
It's an everyday, it's an everyday, 
it's an everyday buck, buck, buck, bang
