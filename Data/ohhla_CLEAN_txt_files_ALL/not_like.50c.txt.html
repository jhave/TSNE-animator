[Verse]
Niggaz wanna shine like me (me), rhyme like me (me)
Then walk around with a 9 like me (me) 
They don't wanna do it, 3 to 9 like me
And they ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Aiyoo, you think about shittin' on 50... save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David
I teach niggaz sign language, that ain't def son
*click* *click* you heard that? That mean RUN
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stun on, pa
Pull through, I'll throw a fuckin cocktail at ya' car
From the last shootout, I got a demple on my face
It's nothin', I could go after Mase's fanbase
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doctor to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth *huck-too* spit it out
I don't smile a lot, cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war, and I ain't never left the City
Hos be like "Fitty, you so witty"
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P.Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

[Chorus 2X]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
Moma said..
Everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk him, I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy, cause I don't fear man
Cause I feel when I kill a man, God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan
I been coulda killed these niggaz, I'm still waitin
In the telly with to whores, a Benz with to doors
32 carrots in the traws, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got atleast two guns
I carry the glock, Tony carry my M-1s
Hold me down nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waitin for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga don't knock me
You need some shit with banana clips to try and stop me
I'M THE ONE

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me

[Verse]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
The good die young, I ain't eligable for that
I shot niggaz, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stand some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range, with a glock, I shoot better then Kobe
See a nigga standin' next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch gettin in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a 38, it's special yoooooo
A country boy tell ya, I'm fittin' to blowwwww
I'm more like a pimp, then a trick, you knowwww
See, I'm in this for the paper, I don't love the hooos
Niggaz broke in the hood, worried about mines
Grown ass men, wearin starter piece shines
You know them little pieces, with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossip starts, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit dog, why don't you stop it
Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me
Now tell me what you like more, my watch or me
Haha

[Chorus 2x]
If you get shot and run to the cop - You not like me
You ain't got no work on the block - You not like me
It's hot, you ain't got no drop - You not like me
Like me duke, you not like me
