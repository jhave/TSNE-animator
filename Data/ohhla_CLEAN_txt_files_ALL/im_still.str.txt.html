Hook:

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC

[Yungstar]
I'ma -- baller, I'ma twenty inch crawler
Blades on my Impala, Don Paula on my rottweiller
I-10 hauler, Twin Benz's is gonna follower
Break these boys off I'ma twenty inch crawler
Bust a left, a right, I'm outta sight I'm throwed
I'm bouncin' off the road, Straight Profit sold'em,
I fitna' explode'em
Tiny tune -- hop out my big body form
Chain with the charm, can't forget Moet along
I'm hopping out, I'm lookin good, diamonds against my wood
Let it be understood, Southwest is my hood
I'm pushing big body can't stop me
For the millenium Straight Profit sells a million copies
I'ma crawl slow puffin on the Optimo hit the sto'
In a Y double O and my a.c. blowin' snow
I'ma let me grass gleam, man I'm lookin clean
Want remote control, big screens, and ice bezeltynes

Hook:

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC

I'ma Lafayette hauler I been a shot caller
My Georgia Perion, better known as the hogger
These boys talking down on these streets of H-Town
Blowing killer smoke by the pine
Hit em up, spit em up
I-10 connect
Laf. Texas, Straight Profit, putting boys on they back
How you feel about that
You better grab for your gat
When you walking through yo crib
I'm beatin yo girl from the back
So body rock, body rock, body rock to dis
Haters standing in my way they got Laf. Tex pissed
Wooday, chop chop keep my hand on my glock
Candy Red on my Benz time to put back the top
I'ma crawl down slow puffing on the Optimo
I'ma come down real on my tippy tippy toe
Down the high way, the fly way
I'ma come down cuz you know it's my way, my way

Hook:

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC

I done got better, now let me move on
Switched from Motorola to a PrimeCo phone
Broke in two chrome, all the way to the millenium
They used to count my spoke, now these hoes count my inches
Had to get older -- my Bentley got colder
I done got grown and got a chip on my shoulder
Licks in Kuwait, got links in Pakistan
Dre in Alabama, virtual reality Caravan
Double doors and marble floors naked hoes around me
Everytime I'm comin down, These niggaz they wanna sign me
Got the Lil' Will diamond grill we in the wind
Blaze in the Ben and I can't forget the den
The boo went down to Rueben's
I'm watchin on a movie
Drop da top its cotton and you know I'm in a jacuzzi
Bourban and I'm swervin, man it's gettin hot
My last name Lemmon
Drive with my title off the lot, David Taylor

Hook:

I'm still a baller, and it's plain to see
I'm still a baller, watch out for that TYP
I'm still a baller, leanin' that I-10 East
I'm still a baller, rolling in the 600 SEC</pre>
