[Intro]
Yeah, Caltroit shit. Phat Kat AKA Rhyme Pat P.A. Ronnie Cash. Yeah. Uh

[Phat Kat]
Yeah, you know I had to get 'em
Phat Kat AKA Ronnie Cash is bout that wickem
Wrong place, wrong time, caught in a fucked up position
On that ass like a Pit when the master says "sick 'em"
Amber Alert file cause your ass came up missin' 
Found three days later, your head needed some massive stitchin'
Your lucky cause your family could be goin' casket pickin'
I'm in style like Red Bull and Bud watchin' asses gigglin' 
Call me Ronnie Cash cause I'm filthy rich in the mind
Life's so bright, so no need for ice to shine
20 years in the game, still sharp with the rhymes
Spank little nigga, send him home cryin' to they moms
Got 313 ways to rip y'all apart
Where should I start?
Niggas not true to the art
When they really need to focus on their flows and they timin' 
Up in their videos shinin' 
Rockin' their conflict diamonds
Rewind what I said and let that shit sink in
Too many rappers rappin' but they really need to be fans
Rewind what I said and let the shit sink in
Too many rappers rappin' but they really need to be fans

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's how we do it
We go at it
Watch us do it to you
Don't panic
We got y'all doin' it too
So savage
Shit might ruin your crew
Mo' havoc
Got a little cocky, just shoot
Go at it
Watch us do what we do
Don't panic
We got y'all doin' it too
So savage
Shit might ruin your crew
We go at it
We go at it
Go
We go at it

[Elzhi]
You know the pharaoh
From doe deniro
The flow is thorough
I let it go like a bow and arrow
I've always kept a slick chick
Quick to grow a halo
Hoppin' on my thick dick
Stink with no apparel
I effect minds 
The way I connect lines
Respect mines
My neck shines like electrons
So is the wrist
The poet insists
He fold a nigga just to show that his shoulders can kiss
And any fool is lost
Once a rhyme is out my book
Took
Watch him look shook as a dual exhaust
I'm cruel of course
If you make me blow my cool and frost
Blaak Blakk!
Then the tool is toss
See my rep's malicious
If you step, then I'm kept suspicious
I might have crept till you slept with fishes
Y'all really need to practice twice
I axe and dice 
Till the track is sliced like the back of Christ
I'm still 
Tight and skilled
You will frighten
My grill is still writtin'
It might be how lighten feel
For real
I've gotten used to
Me havin' a loose screw
Way back when Marley Marl produced by the Juice Crew
I need two chicks who's down for the deuce screw
I make it three
Mistakenly
You thought I wouldn't break your knee
And your back spine
Then I'm back grindin' like a nigga takin' E
I need my doe singles high in bills
But for now I take the hoe sittin' high in 
High end heels
When it's hit man for hire
It kills
You need a buildin' like fire drills
And skate off when the tire peels

[Chorus]

[Bishop Lamont]
Yo, I got it
Belligerently, deliberately, diligently, skillfully
That spits artillery
Shell cases pile up your facility 
My photo look like Lobo Cop
My fo fo pop like Robo 
Pitch your logo on your polo
Split your Domo A Regato pronto
Ask how I flash mash smash slash gas staff and fag fans fast
With the axe just like Tonto
Get scalped clowned stomped out, knocked out it's that simple
Raise your hands, you see stars just like King Hippo
Mayday, runaway 
We Pearl Harbor shit all day
Got harder armor, come and bomb ya
Harm ya, blow your crew away
Nagasaki, Hiroshima
Walkie Talkie for more back up
Tell them motherfuckas better send some niggas meaner
Death Star, rock star
Pull up like a cop car
Hop out and hope niggas wanna blow you up like Akbar
Leave your back charred
Nigga please
You ain't spittin' shit
My dick get mo' hard
California push the line like the Coast Guard
Feel niggas, real spittas, it's time to bogard
Fuck the labels, radio 
Ev'body get it 
Pop my glock out on you niggas like that Hell Date midget
Get twisted
More statistics
Stretched out, chalked out
Reminiscent of Hieroglyphics
My Souls Of Mischief 
Flows malicious
It's Bishop motherfuckers
Tivo it if you missed it

[Outro]
Yeah, slow it down, slow it down, slow it down
Yeah. Switch it up on 'em. What I want you to do
Is see you just bounce. Bounce nigga. Yeah bounce
Yeah. Black Milk. Elzhi. Phat Kat. My nigga Bishop</pre>
