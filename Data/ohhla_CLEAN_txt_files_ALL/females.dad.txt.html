[Intro]
Yeah, Yeah, Uh, Yeah, Uh

[Hook x3]
Now my side bitch, my main bitch, cause my main ho, ain't feeling me no mo, no mo

James, I said...

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
Fuck love it's overrated
What's fellowship, Now I'm reinstated
Might need a witness, these bitches crazy
Let me say it again, (these bitches crazy)
Fucked her once, now I'm swayze
Fucked her twice, (now I'm swayze)
Put my partner on
He got her pregnant
Man fuck life, life ignorant
Might need a cigarette, that newport
(That newport)
Got new shoes, got new clothes
Need new hoes, (need new hoes)
Like old school, with two doors
I'm Too Short (I'm Too Short)
Too clean for them photos
So please do not snap those
Got my hands up with my eyes closed
Your girl head down with her mouth open
I'm in my tank top with my pants open
She still going (she still going)
Say Ay bruh, what you wanna do
Say Ay bruh, (what you want to do)
We got bad bitches and a ton of brew
Nigga we the troop, they loving the crew

[Hook x4]

[Dubstep plays]
No, mo [x13]
Mo [repeats and echoes]

[Hook x4]
(Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard take it far [x2])

[Bridge: Reija Lee]
Boy, I can see it in your face, you're all over the place
Can you stand up straight for me, yeah
Get it back on track if you want me back
Don't you know
Do the sweet, do the sweet talk
Talk [4x]
Do the sweet talk
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard take it far [2x]</pre>
