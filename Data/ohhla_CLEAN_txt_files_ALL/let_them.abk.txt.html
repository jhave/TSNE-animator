Song:   Let Them Outside
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Never come outside but you know that they want to (x5)
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to
Never come outside but you know that they want to
You know that they want to, you know that they want to

Just moved onto a new street and the motherfuckers sweet
Liquor store right on the corner which is good because I drink
Had to move because my old crib was looking all hit
Aluminum falling off the sides like a snake does his skin
Anyway where Im at now is so much better
Except for the kids man I swear they need to get they shit together
Staring at me out the window all crazy
Never met me but they lookin like they hate me
What did the parents do to make these children so damn rude
Stuff them in the closet, and beat they ass with a shoe
They need to let em outside, but its like they never do
So now these kids stare out the window and give me the attitude

[Chorus x2]
Let em outside [x4]
Hey let those children play
I dont know whether I should leave or stay
Because if I take on too much I might go insane
Little bad asses, half my age
Locked in they crib like a cage
Looking out through the shades
Its like my whole blocks been hypnotized
And now they trying to get to me with this glare from they eyes
Just beamin at this killa with their infrared
Like Im the main reason they on house arrest
I thought kids was supposed to have fun
Instead of being all pale from never seeing the sun
If it was me, Id have to break free
Cause life too short not to be able to breathe

[Chorus x2]

[Chorus 2 - x2]
Why dont they come out
Let them out
Why dont they come out
Let them out
Why they look so lonely

[Chorus x2]
[Chorus and Chorus 2 - x2]
Why they look so lonely? [x2]</pre>
