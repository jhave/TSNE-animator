Now's the time when things are hot
To show the world just what you've got
Just grab a partner,hit the floor
'Cause this is what you're waiting for
It's time for us to take a chance
So get on up,got out and dance
Just shout it out and spread the news
About those low-down Boogie blues

Now The Boogie Blues is nothin' new
It started back in '22
Some guys and girls were sittin' 'round
In a little club outside of town
In walked a dude from parts unknown
Without a friend,he was all alone
Dressed up in tails and button shoes
He taught them all The Boogie Blues

I've got a dance you ought to know
It's no too fast and not too slow
It's not to hard and not too easy
Not too straight and not too sleazy
Something different,something new
Something special just for you
Something just to rock your shoes
Something called The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat

The Boogie Blues will move your feet

Feel the beat and spread the new

About those low-down Boogie Blues

The dude got up to whirl and dance
Just like a dervish in a trance
Spinning,twirling,up and down
Round and round and round and round
Just like  Bojangles or Astaire
A dapper dude without a care
With flying feet,top hat and cane
You knew he only drank champagne

Just watching him would keep you busy
Make you feel a little dizzy
Such a sight for all to see
The Boogie Blues done to a "T"
Leaping high and doing splits
The crowd was simply having fits
They cheered until their throats were dry
But soon he had to say goodbay

I've had a ball the stranger said
But I should quit while I'm ahead
Those splits and leaps are hard to do
They really take it out of you
But in a minute when I am gone
The night is young,it's far from dawn
You've seen the dance,you've heard the news
It's time to do The Boogie Blues

The Boogie Blues has got the beat

The Boogie Blues will move your feet

Feel the beat and spread the news
