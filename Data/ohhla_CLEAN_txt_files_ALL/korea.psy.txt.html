Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[English Translation]
Our things, our taste, the precious things are alive
If I have taken out my sword, at least slice up some radish
If I don't see the end, I tremble with anger
Even if you get far from your dream,
Don't ever get sad and just run  you're still young

It's not over until it's over
They do it till the end, Korean people

Everyone get up, right now, get up
Everyone get up, a big thing is happening
Lift it and get up, right now lift it and get up
Lift it and get up, then that is Korea

Korea, louder  Korea, louder
Korea, harder  Korea oh oh oh [x2]

The music is ringing, the music is ringing
The shouts of 50,000,000 are ringing and spreading
Yaya, yayayaya, yayayayayayaya oh oh oh [x2]

Who dares to test me? That test will be dangerous
If I say I'll do it, I'll do it  Once I do it, it's tremendous
The shouts of the 50,000,000 are our sound
It's the shout of the Korean peninsula  Korea

It's not over until it's over
They do it till the end, Korean people

Everyone get up, right now, get up
Everyone get up, a big thing is happening
Lift it and get up, right now lift it and get up
Lift it and get up, then that is Korea

Korea, louder  Korea, louder
Korea, harder  Korea oh oh oh [x2]

The music is ringing, the music is ringing
The shouts of 50,000,000 are ringing and spreading
Yaya, yayayaya, yayayayayayaya oh oh oh [x2]
