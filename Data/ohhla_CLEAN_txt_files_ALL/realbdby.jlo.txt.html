[P. Diddy]
Yeah

[J. Lo]
Called you on the phone, said, "I'm comin through
Hope you're all alone, cause I got plans for you
We could stay at home, or dance and hang all night 
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do"

(Bridge)
[J. Lo]
Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm gonna do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand 
Baby, there's no mystery, cause you know how I am

(Chorus)
[Jennifer (P. Diddy)]
I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you tryin to do to me 
You wanna say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're fallin so in love 
Say you just can enough
You're tellin all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

[P. Diddy]
All my niggas take a walk wit me (what)
You ain't gotta holla you could talk wit me
Try to learn where my thought could be
And how I stack figgas (uh-huh)
Learn why I'm real, still that nigga (still that nigga)
I get money I don't got to do crime (what)
Shit I hit dimes what I need wit a nine
Before y'all jump me be clear (what)
We got nuttin but heat here, beware, we here
What's my name? (what)
Got chicks twisted like what's my game
Pimp game still the same
I smash shit I don't harass it (what)
Ma, I'm a balla I score and pass it
Feel me still be filthy
If making hits is a crime, I plead guilty (what)
And this is what we came to do (what)
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through

[Jennifer]
You like the way I dress, the way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends and, baby I don't care 
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn

(Bridge)

(Chorus) x2

[Usher]
You tell her you look hot don't you worry at all
?As long as we be shook? then get ready
She's telling you she might change, and you telling her not to
Shorty she looks stunning, really fine
Coming before the game that means I got you
Need not take to running cause I'm the one

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
