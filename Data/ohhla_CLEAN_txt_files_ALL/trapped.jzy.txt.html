[Intro: Jill Scott - rapping] + (Young Jeezy)
Yo, they still be grindin', and runnin'
Tryin' to get into somethin' or nothin'
I remember them days
When the block got hot, bullets flyin' for the what
It was, like, you ain't, really give a fuck
I'm a sister, mother, I'm your daughter, I'm your lover and I'm
Right here, and I'm sayin' that it's wack sauce
Everything that you do tryna be the boss
You ain't really really doin' it (nah)
I mean honestly pursuin' it
Ca-cause, if you did you wouldn't be murdering your own people like
Oh ya see, it's a, trap (it's a trap, that's what it's called by the way)
It's a, trap (It's a trap night nigga, here we go again)
(Jill left the door wide open, so I'm goin' in - let's go)

[Young Jeezy]
Through a bedroom I could see my momma tears (tears)
All I smell is hennessey mixed with my momma fears (yeah)
Please momma don't cry, you know I hate cryin' (cryin')
I try my best not to die, you know I hate dyin' (yeah)
Three eighty for my thirteenth birthday (birthday)
I promised her I wouldn't let you motherfuckers hurt me (yeah)
So ya'll get back, Jeezy got a automatic
Everytime I turn the TV on a nigga seein' static (damn)
Guess they forgot to pay them cable folks
Them niggas in my first class got them cable jokes (haha)
Open up the frigerator see some old milk
Shit been sittin' so long look like some old silk (damn)
I've been cursed since the day this earth birthed me
I've been cursed since the day my mother birthed me (yeah)
And how did I get here in the first place
Oh that's right, see the trap is my birthplace (haha, young)

[Chorus: Jill Scott] + (Young Jeezy)
Said that I know you've been trapped, (trapped)
Like you wanna move on, but they hold you back
To face consequences, of what you did on some bullshit (yeah, wassup)
Said that I know you've been trapped, (trapped)
Like you wanna move on, but they hold you back, (ain't no way out)
To face consequences, of what you did on some bullshit (what you know bout this homie, trap life, let's go)

[Young Jeezy]
Even though we had a will, we ain't have a way (way)
They just told us how to live, we ain't have a say (say)
All I know is the other side got some cuffs for ya (for ya)
Fresh khaki suit, nigga that's enough for ya (yeah)
Got ya spendin' all ya money on lawyer fees (fees)
Judge throwin' numbers at you like he speakin' Japanese (oo-wahh)
All cause a nigga out here playin' bakery (bakery)
I'm out here tryna get this bread, somebody pray for me (haha)
I'm always on the block so I rarely go to church (church)
Didn't wanna hear it from the preacher, cause the truth hurts
And right now I'm so high, I should be scared of heights (heights)
A Town nigga I be on that kryptonite (yeah)
I got deadlines nigga no bedtime (time)
The only thing promised to ya is some fed time (time)
And how did I get here in the first place
Oh that's right, see the trap was my birthplace (haha, Young)

[Jill Scott - rapping] + (Young Jeezy)
You ain't really really doin' it (nah)
I mean honestly pursuin' it (not at all)
Ca-cause, if you did you wouldn't be murdering your own people like
Oh ya see it's a, trap (it's a trap ya'll)
It's a, trap (yeah, this the trap life, welcome to it, yeah, let's go)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Young Jeezy]
Trap or die nigga till the day I mothafuckin' die nigga
Till you put me in that mothafuckin' couch and you put that dirt on me homie
Goin, ain't no way out: it's death or jail nigga
I'm there; count me in, trap life</pre>
