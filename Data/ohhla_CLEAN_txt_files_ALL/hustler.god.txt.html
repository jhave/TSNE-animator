[ VERSE 1: Necro ]
I was a thug paid off the illegal drug trade
What you need, touch ya, cut ya jug with a blade
Fuck the pig brigade, carry a nickel plate
Try to vic me for a nickel, I'll stick a sickle in your face
Like Griselda Blanco, paid like Banco Popular
Jewels like Zelda, default on your payments, I'll pop you, pa
Smooth like velvet, jet in the Bronco
Pushing more rock than Gibraltar
Traffickin, bitch you need Massengill
Another balloon in your ass again, hash and krills
Sell 'em to Ashton Kutcher lookalikes
The fashion biz, Kardashian, cash-hooker types
Distribution, piss the putrid
Piece of rubber out your pussy, bitch, before it's polluted
No time to shoot the shit, cause when you finish takin a shit
Some motherfuckers gonna shoot it
People get shot to shit over a hit
You're shot, you got a rock of coke on your beard
(Hit it)
Like George Jung, with a bong
No deposits, money in storage in closets, out the bung
Skunk in your lungs, coke numb the tongue
Plenty funds, pushin twenty tons in uranium drums
From Panamanian slums, Ukrainian cum dumpster mules
Transport in their rump, enema ( ? )

[ CHORUS: Necro ]
I'm a Hustler, I ain't sellin to you if I don't trust ya
If we suspect you, it's the criminal custom
To grab the musket and bust ya, that's a true hustler
Customs police would love to bust you, ship you on a bus
Lock you till you're old with an ulcer
Don't snitch, cum guzzler, man with a vulva
Shut the up like a muffler, son, like Larry I'm a Hustler

[ VERSE 2: Kool G Rap ]
G the king of strip sales, fish scale, brick mail
My ship sail in bringin a Moby Dick whale
All flavors, white, beige or beiger
Freeze like anesthesia, Anastasia of gram weighers
100 percent Colombian handmade, acres of land, man labored
Alaskan salmon have your heart beatin faster, damn it
Got lines to blow your mind like grams packed in a cannon
More ki's of porgy, the raw be the door key
To open up sluts, whores be in an orgy
From coffee grounds to get around authorities
Never get bored of the bread or Boar's Head cheese
My red snapper's the dead president head stacker
Pots over red crackling flames, package of caine
Let it strain on red napkins, fiends get fed the crackers
Stay ahead of the fed crackers
Swordfish is flawless, we lawless
The strip got a D on it like Warwick, I can't call it
All I know is before my niggas do more bids
One more pig to the morgue, shit get morbid
I'm Morpheus, I morph to a warship
Tap your top, get the message in Morse code
Head wrapped like the Moors did, on horses
Seahorse come out a poor kid's pores, kid

[ CHORUS: Necro ]</pre>
