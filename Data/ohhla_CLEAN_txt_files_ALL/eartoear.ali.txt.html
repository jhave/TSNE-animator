I shed my ex-wife kept my son with me
Now me smiling ear to ear now that's something to see, shit

[Chorus]
I said my life, and my God and my songs
Good Lord Ya'll
I said my life, and my God and my songs

[Verse 1]
Man no question use to always know that I was crazy
Guess it's safe to say I came a long way baby
Mama throwing dishes at my ex-wife bitching at me
never did envision daddy could be this happy, shit
To me not broke is rich
Got a two bedroom a new sofa to sit
For the first time ain't go to Good Will or St. Steven's
But IKEA put that boy together last weekend
Out in NY I met a fly Puerto Rican
Dimed out sales girl Victoria's Secret
Took her on a train to Pennsylvaina for a weekend
that's eighteen months ago dog, guess where she been?
Frozen tundra chillin with boy wonder
Done discovered love like a mother fucker
I tried to warn my baby that the winters no joke
She said "Big dick daddy I'll just get me your coat"
Goddamn

[Chorus]
I said my life, and my God and my songs
Good Lord Ya'll
I said my life, and my God and my songs
Good Lord Ya'll
Said I'm gonna do it for you
I'm gonna do it for you

[Verse 2]
Feeling fly as hell right about now
I done pushed a whole heap of hell out of my house
Any orphanage will clove and feed a kid
but I raise my little man teach him to live
That's why he's 4 years old and can read like he was 6
Behave and recite the Qur'an in Arabic
Eat healthy, knows all the words to Laddy Daddy
Taught him to use the potty without his Mummy
It's three years away I ain't the least bit nervous
I feel like I'ma do it real big in my thirties
Honestly love everybody in my circle
Been with me since the scrimmage and the dress rehearsal
Oh let me tell you that my sweet potato pie
Will curl your toenails and bring tears to your eyes
And all corny bullshit aside
your boys smiling for real the first time in my life

[Chorus]
I said my life, and my God and my songs
Good Lord Ya'll
I said my life, my God and my songs
Good Lord Ya'll
Said I'm gonna do it for you
I'm gonna do it for you</pre>
