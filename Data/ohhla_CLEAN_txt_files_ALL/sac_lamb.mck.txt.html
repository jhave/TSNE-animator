Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The trumpets blow around the walls of Jericho
As I get caught up in the line of fire
They fire tryina leave my line flat like a nail infested tire
Nod to heaven where niggas been hiding
You liars, y'all never see your Messiah
While I'm reading the book of Jeremiah
I am better than any cat that try to run up, I'm a warrior
Standing on the front line, homie, look, I bust mine
See I don't mind dying, standing in the midst
Make sure that my man don't get hit, take a bullet for my best friend
Cruising North West sin, as y'all spirits just taught a lesson
I'm the type you don't wanna mess with

[Chorus]
And I'll take everything in this life
I'll join everyone when I die

[Verse 2]
Who's afraid to lose their life?
That's a man that should have never been born
You shall be scorned, my niggas be warned
You don't start this because you're considered children of the corn
Land in the cornfield, tryina just to pick something
Maybe a harvest, see life is the hardest, see we was born here
Just preach the Gospel to the Holy Apostles and to the lost people
I see Your lost people, I'll be Your navigation
I don't really wanna be the type for sanitation
I'm not the type that run off before the confrontation
In fact, I'll always try to stop the confrontation

[Chorus]
And I'll take everything in this life
I'll join everyone when I die (I'm the sacrificial lamb baby)

[Verse 3]
Me and Him got the same parents' name
You know, Mary and Joseph
How do you know His last name?
Shit, I'm not from Bethlehem
See, I'm from Holly Grove
But I would lend a hand to those that need
Some counseling to make sure they not lost
Plus I could call shots every day, see, I'm a bossy
If this was the old days I'd be born as a king
Landing the major, type that's not endangered
My dad will make sure that I plight and shoot like a ranger
And I have a lot of soldiers, I still got a lot of soldiers
I don't need to pop the doja, I just maintain composure
You know that, you know that

[Chorus]
That I'll take everything in this life (come on come on...)
I'll join everyone and understand (I'm the sacrificial lamb baby chyeah)

I don't understand
'Cause all men die
'Cause all men die

[Chorus]
And I'll take everything in this life (where you gon be when the trumpets blow? You know... leggo)
I'll join everyone since I'm gonna die (let us not hesitate... revelations)
(I'm a die anyway)

I'll take everything in this life (I can't take the Bentley with me to heaven)
(Can't take none of this money with me to heaven)
(I'll I could is leave is leave my soul and leave these songs that you on, I hope ya'll live on)
I'll join everyone 'cause all men die
(Like Martin Luther King, Malcolm and all the great ones)
(I don't need a halla bit)
(We all die, can't escape it)</pre>
