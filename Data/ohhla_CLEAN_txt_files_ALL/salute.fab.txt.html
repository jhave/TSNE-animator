[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
First off I'm a mother fucking
G.en.er.al word to the k shells
in this chopper I will p - p - p - p - pop em
make it sound like a hellichoppers land on top of this Bitch
you want this whopper come and get your beef nigga
I'm not a boxer I'm be brief nigga
were on top I will put you underneath niggas
we will take your whole tribe and I'm the chief nigga
your highest title numero uno
I'm not that litte pregnant white girl but juno
you no anything within a nigga reach
my dogs will bite you and guess who the nigga leash
I was once told by my nigga meach
you feed a sucka he just grow to be a bigger leach
so every time you hear mine get your hand to your hairline general

[Chorus - Lil Wayne]
Yeah I'm in this bitchh
sending champagne to my enemys
salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
salute me salute me salute me salute me
salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
Salute Me! {*echoes*}

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, now just say hello to the captain
And I stay away from magnets cuz the metals what I'm packin
Bet yo brains on your shirt will look like jello on a napkin
and I promise my fellows will put your fellow on the canvas
Call me Weezy F. Baby
Young money army, better yet Navy
Fab I got'em
And watch me get'em
And I do'em or I did them
And this tool inside my denim
I shoot everything but women, and kids
Bitch nigga stop bitchin its just how it is
Now watch me let that sexy nina kiss you by your ribs
You wont be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib
Shoot you in the stomach now you pissin out your ears
Holly grove all day
Bodies in the hallway
And If you come searchin
Then you're finding out the hard way
Uh, no matter where your from
You better recognize a real nigga when you see one

[Chorus - Lil Wayne]
Yeah I'm in this bitchh
sending champagne to my enemys
salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
salute me salute me salute me salute me
salute or shoot you choose motherfucker
bow down till your head touch your shoes motherfucker
Salute Me! {*echoes*}

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
At second thought I got the heart of a Ssssssolider
Ttttttold ya I ain't come to play y'all
My mind has gon a.w.o.l.
Find it I will pay y'all
My money is yay tall okay ya'll
A digit stacks is midget mack
that mean it's gona stay small
Told them I don't see nobody
I'm a rappin ray charles (I don't see nobody)
I think I need a seein I dog
Come to being fly dog
You ain't seeing I dog (ok ok ok ok)
We sit in here like pollen now
Fuck you niggas hollerin now
They said I been M - I - A
Yea bitch I'm on columns now
Leaders dont be followin crowds
General like collin powell
Water means cary gay
Beef is just a style of cow
I'm who make the call
So dont make me get the dialin out
Nick got the cannon yea that nigga be widlin out
they ain't ballin these niggaz is fouling out
they ain't throwin jabs they just throwin towels out yea</pre>
