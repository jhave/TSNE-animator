[Missy]
I was in love
That's what it was when I met you
In love
And no one could ever talk about you
But it sucks, so many lies and alibis
In love

1 -	[Beyonce and Missy] 
	Crazy feelings 
	Make me stay in love with you 
	Crazy feelings
	Make me stay in love with you

[Beyonce]
So in love
I just didn't see the wrong you did
In love
But now that I know I can admit 
It was love that made me a fool, a silly fool
In love, oh crazy

Repeat 1

[Missy]
You was always in my face, all the time
Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie
You was always in my face, all the time
Even with 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie 

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
