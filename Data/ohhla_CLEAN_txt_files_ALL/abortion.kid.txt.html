My veins are poppin from this love inside
I just can't let it out
This pipe and these needles are my only guide
They've got me on the wrong route
What is my life about
Living in the shadows of a man I've never seen
Dreamin' like a lonely child
I know your brothers and your sister and your mother too 

Man I wish you could see them too
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Man I wish that you could see them too
Man I wish that you could see them too

So can I come to see you sometime
Cause I been missin you
I've never heard you cry I've never seen you whine
I'm feeling oh so young
But still I must die to get to you
And if I do I wonder how just you will see me
And implicate the things I've done
I'm dyin in the shadows of this man I've never seen
I'll see you soon
Now where's my gun

Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord 
Wheres my gun
Oh wheres my gun
Oh Lord
Wheres my gun
Oh Lord
My gun

Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of 
The second coming of christ
It's God himself in a jar
Yeah...yeah 
Yeah...yeah

Let me open your eyes
Let me see who you are
I am you, you are me
We are a part of 
The second coming of christ
Its god himself in a jar
Yeahhhh
Heyyyyyyy

You got me, sad and lonely
When I'm me...me
You know you make me so lonely
I am so alone
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry
And I will pray and then I'll cry</pre>
