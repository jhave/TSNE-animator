Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, you ever just know
that you was finna splack another nigga's bitch up
like, you see a bitch she be with a nigga
and you be knowing she be thinking to herself like I wish I was with that nigga

[Chorus]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song)
then I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch

yo bitch like me and I don't know her
all up on me at the show I'm tryin' to control her
you hatin' from afar she tryin' to get closer
sittin' with me at the bar and tryin' to be sober
no sir, so you come and kick it with my clique
ya nigga somewhere heated screamin' that's my bitch
I'm tatted up rich, them bitches understand
when you makin' money talk, everyone know you the man
with my Hollywood hoes, or somewhere by the sand
fuck your shit up with your nigga tryin' to fit me in your plans
tell em' you're a fan, now you're at my crib
used to like my music now he's saying fuck young wiz
and that's how I live and I won't change for the world
make ya man feel like u 'gon need a chain for ya girl
says she been searchin' round for some change in the world
I'm doin' shit that you not so I'm lookin' like Barack to her.

[Chorus]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song)
then I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired (jerz) of fightin' and runnin' round (wizzle) with the same nigga (neako)
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (tell you a story)
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch

I see you stressin' my nigga now tell me what is going on
Somebody took ya bitch
I guess you want to grab the ratchet go hit his hood and do him wrong
all over your chick
look at lil' rick baby bro no he ain't comin' home
because the nigga straight flipped
a nigga hit his bitch re-tripped then he hit him in his dome
he got a life sentence
you might want to think about what you're doing before you do it wrong
when you shoot don't miss
cause if you do niggas'll catch you and baby bro they ain't wrong
if they put you in the ditch
I'ma tell you like this, life is priceless
Because you took a shot don't mean it gon' miss
You never knew another nigga sent ya wife the dick
and now you sittin' back with a chick like this

[Chorus]
If you at home lettin' her go out alone (lone)
then I'ma take yo bitch
and if she keep jockin' me stalkin' me e'rtime she hear my song (hear my song) (I see ya man)
then (yeah) I'ma take yo bitch
she said she getting tired (neako) of fightin' and runnin' round with the same nigga (khalifa I got you bro)
and plus she know I ain't no lame nigga (yeah)
and I ain't pressin' her just to see if my number's in her phone (in her phone)
then I'ma take yo bitch

I could do my thang If I wanna
forecast change I make it rain in the summer
let the chain hang
scoop ya dame for the fun of
