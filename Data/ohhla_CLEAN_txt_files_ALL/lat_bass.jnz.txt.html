[Jonny Z]
Yes, yes, y'all
It's ya boy, Jonny Z
And I got my homie
The South Park Mexican
And we gonna kick a little puro Latin bass
{*scratching*}

[Verse 1: Jonny Z]
Well, it's Jonny Z and South Park, we're ready to roll
Sport Versaces and a Rolex, and our pockets on swoll
Check in the pent house, the day of the show
Check them player haters too because we good to go
We roll in '99 Impalas with the 20 inch blades
Rollin' hydro with my boy before I hit the stage
See, we just in town, for just one night
Makin' freaks shake that ass when I grab the mic
Being born in the barrio, that's were it all started
Pourin' 40's for my homies
Who are gone and departed
Now the jente give me props
When I walk in the place
The freaks give it up
When I show my face
You know I got love
That's all I can say
They can't get enough of puro Latin bass

[Jonny Z]
{*scratching*}
"Yes y'all"
"Yes y'all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y'all"

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
SPM and Jonny Z on another bomby
My G quick to pump, to pump the party
Will we quit, not me
Charlie
Likin' my style cause I do 'em doggy
Still I get jiggy
Here kitty, kitty
The finest girls I met are from a little bitty city
Big booty, big [{*titties*}], spendin' twenties and fifties
I really don't mind, cause to me, it's just pennies
Sippin' on Henny
Haters can't offend me
Still I have your clique hollin', "Who killed Kenny?"
High power player
Microphone slayer
Smokin' red hair with the H-town mayor
Puro Latin bass
All in your face
I'm a watch the whole world all fall into place

[Jonny Z]
{*scratching*}
"Yes y'all"
"Yes y'all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y'all"
{*scratching*}
"Yes y'all"

(Verse 3)
[Jonny] Now the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
        Haters tryin' to front
        But the ladies wanna get some
        Back at the momo
        Keep it on the low-low
        With this Latin player
        Who drives 'em all loco
[SPM]   Bass in the attic of my Cadillac Seville
        Come around here, we can battle rap for real
        Got bang, shakin' walls
        And rattlin' the house
        Lettin' boys know who the baddest in the south
        Never bow down, represent my cow town
        Smokin' on the pow wow, bet you feel my style now
        Hella pipe players
        Dress like I'm Adais
        Boys wanna spray us
        Girls shake they ass
[Jonny] Cause you know we got love, that's all I can say
        They can't get enough of puro Latin bass
