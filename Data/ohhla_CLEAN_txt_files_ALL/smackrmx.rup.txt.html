[Chorus: Akon]
I feel you creepin I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gulatto
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae-Bo
And possibly bend ya over
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh-ohhh-oh-ohh

[Akon]
Shorty if you wanna ride you can ride on me
We can bump heads and collide on me
Want beef, damn right can rely on me
To bring that Campbell like Naomi
Just pull that girl and take it on easy
Lookin all oiled up and all greasy
Bout that time you stop that teasin
Way that you drop done got me here cheesin
What's funny is that you takin
all my money for real
I rather spend it on you
Right now than my homie's bail
And I can see that's what you're made fo'
And ain't ever been no lame ho
With that booty bought and paid fo'
Won't move 'til you on my payroll!

[Chorus]

[Stat Quo]
Yeah, yeah, Stat Quo! Ahhh!
I love when you do it girl move to it like you're used to it
Drop it down I wanna put my thang through it
To the crib we go, go fast and slow
Make it twirl like a stripper slide down my pole
Shawty ass so swole got your boy like whoa
One night with me now she wanna marry Stat Quo
But I'm like no, let's keep it on the low
On occasion let me come through and tap that hole
Make you lose control and all her girls know
that I hit it right at night, I'm a pro
I only come 'round and get sexual
if she flexible and bisexual
I might stay around for a longer time
Only if, only if she can blow my mind
I can hurt that, murk that, work that spine
Now she in love and wants to be mine
Stat Quo, YEA!

[Chorus]

[Bobby Creekwater]
Yeah, it's Bobby Creek, know'msayin?
The ice in the watch reflects the light to her
The money quite green and the ice light bluer
The swag might kill her so I said good night to her
She don't want me to leave I can see right through her
So we, dipped out, burn one trip out
Get low like Caribbean limbo
Didn't go out like light, baby girl get right
Head so swole my hat don't fit right
We can cruise in the car or we could take flight
The middle of the night, make your body +8+ like
+Mike Vick+ against the Eagles
Call myself a king cause I'm regal
To be this hot is not legal
But we don't care, listen baby it's a fact that
if you drop back I'ma quarterback sack that
We can go deep and I can shark attack that
Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
