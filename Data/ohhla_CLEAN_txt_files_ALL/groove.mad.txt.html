Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yo it's the weekend, time for freakin, no doubt
Hit the mall, get a hookup, night falls and I'm out
Pick up my man (Whattup Hobbes?) from around my block
Get nice, pump the sounds, now it's time to hit the spot
Crews downtown freestylin off beats
If heads start whylin I got the glock in the seat
Hectic out front, some chillin some wild
Tonight I'm takin a niggaz girl like Ill and Al
I freak raps so black they let me through the back
The DJ was on point, the joint was packed
Females were all of that, I'm seein nothin but dimes
Moet on ice, yeah it's time to go for mine
Dancefloor got packed when they played All Night Long
Brothers that front with blunts passin round the ?
Crew mode in effect, party can't go wrong
This is strictly for my peeps that's gettin they groove on

	Get your groove on (4X)
To all the ladies -- lookin mad fly
And to all the fellas -- gettin mad high
We got the vibe in the air, Hennesey and Perignon
You know the flavor
	Get your groove on

Standin by the speaker as the tempo gets faster
Brothers runnin through piece huntin for Dutch Masters
As the night proceeds G's lightin more weed
Fake players tryin to find the freaks that they need
Of course they get their cards pulled quick
90's girls are independent, and ain't havin no bullshit
Niggaz get scorned, girls be gettin they acts on
Word bond, when glorifyin mine, I get my mack on
There's T'yon, the baddest dip in the place
I'm checkin for her, but her ugly ass friend all in my face
"Ain't you Mad Skillz?"  Yeah and your grill is through
You not T-Boz baby, I'm not tryin to Creep Wit U
Next a reggae set, freaks flippin they wigs
Bouncers by the door beatin brothers like bad kids
More heads at the door man this party ain't stoppin
Get your groove on, cause it's on and poppin

	Get your groove on (4X)
To all the ladies -- lookin mad fly
And to all the fellas -- gettin mad high
We got the vibe in the air, Hennesey and Perignon
You know the flavor
	Get your groove on

By now, the heads outside is pissed
Cause the fool at the door sayin he ain't got a guest list
I'm sippin 'Lua and milk, all in a drunk mode
Brothers panickin cause they heard they cars got towed
"Sup, what time is this over?" Yo I don't know but it's live
"I paid $20 to get here man" Yeah and I paid five
They got you, but I'm tryin to get with her Pah
Right there, mini-skirt "Where?" Chillin by the bar
How you doin?  "Fine."  Yo what's your name?  "Keisha."
Yo what you rollin your eyes for shorty you havin a seizure?
"Nah I'm just tired of all these niggaz harassin."
You was doin the runnin man before, but now you ain't dancin?
It's over anyway, and outside it's mad cops
Heads still cockin biscuits, poppin off shots
Same places different faces every weekend it moves
I send this out to those that's tryin to catch a groove

	Get your groove on (4X)
To all the ladies -- lookin mad fly
And to all the fellas -- gettin mad high
We got the vibe in the air, Hennesey and Perignon
You know the flavor
	Get your groove on

	Get your groove on (4X)
To all the ladies -- lookin mad fly
And to all the fellas -- gettin mad high
We got the vibe in the air, Hennesey and Perignon
You know the flavor
	Get your groove on</pre>
