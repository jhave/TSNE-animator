Bring it from the top

[Peter Gunz]
If you mad and you hatin' mother fucker please kill it

You know Neptunes is hot like skillets
Your ego's scared then nigga please go heal it
That tight ass fitted cap the dogs will peel it
Long as the Bronx still got me and New York still feel it
For the jump off, jump off niggas best to kill 'em
Ay yo Gunz you change let's make it rain you conceited

Naw still got a 9 girl and Peter still eatin'
I'm just another nigga from the hood in the car
Six double zero bikes double the R
See them dogs draped in red cover the bar
See them cowards be in the club trouble we are
I smokes no drugs just Henney no chase
Foot on the throttle with models giving me face
Like Oochie Wally Wally she gave me lolly lolly
Now you wanna polly polly holla if you hear me y'all

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams &amp; (Lord Tariq]

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, if you mad and you hatin' muh fucker please kill it
Puerto Rican diva came thru to rip it, shit
Ya'll niggaz need to know i'm not playin'
I'm spittin serious bitches need to know what I'm sayin
Fuck, it aint a game no more this is realness
All the way out to Cali ya'll bloods &amp; crips feel this
Dont act like I still ain't runnin' this shit
Angela, model/rapper and top radio bitch
Reppin' the Boriquas!! Ya'll know Angie keeps it real
And I'm still pushin records &amp; not sex appeal
ITS ANIMAL HOUSE, we're I sign ya'll to deals
And make cash to keep 22's in the wheels
I can never be broken, never ever soft spoken
Light up the blunt and I just start tokin'
Hardest workin bitch in the entire industry
FUCK THE HATERS!! Ya'll need to take a look at me
I'm 10 years strong, count em 10 years long
Can't nobody stop my hunger, people love my songs
If I Could Go climbed up to the top
And I got a shit load of hits, bitch it dont stop c'mon!!

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams &amp; (Angie Martinez)]

Its been a minute since we spitted 'em
(Dogs we be killin' 'em)
Niggas they be hatin' 'em
(Broads they be feelin' 'em)
Actin' like we reachin' man
(Ay yo Gunz let me get at them)
Look at how he buckle (when them things get to hittin 'em)
Just another nigga with his face in the sand
(I pull them things out and blam!) him and his man
(I guarantee my guns wont jam) he should a ran
(I'm crazy with a thing in my hand) you understand
(Ay yo Gunz we aint havin' that) Lord I be grabbin' that)
(I run up in his crib tap the safe where he stash it at)
Give me half of that I slap 20's on the Cadillac
(Laughin' at chickens I'm only trickin' if I'm tappin' that)
Ay yo I'm hittin' Hon's (sippin Henney)
Got money (gettin' plenty what you thinkin')
We brings (drama to whoever we can) squeeze things
(From the street to the stage nigga) we sing
(Bring the chorus in)
