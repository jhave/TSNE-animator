Check it out, this a hood classic
We gon do it like this for the ghetto's
And the projects out there, in the world
Feel this here

[Lil' Keke]
This the shake down, you niggaz break down
This for haters in the world, putting they hate down
We got cake now, sp we step on the scene
Convertible looking clean, got my mug on mean
This is Southside, to the Northside
In the 7-4-5, the beamer be sitting wide
Get my roll on, yeah coast to coast
Like my nigga Big H.A.W.K., I'll butter ya toast
Riding fat sack, I turn my har back
Jamming old school Pat, how you like that
Cause it's drastic, I'ma glass it
This for DJ Screw man, another classic

(*talking*)
Check it you know, we gon reach out to all the thugs
All the gangstas all the cut throats, three time felons
Niggaz out there, getting that bread mayn
Getting that cheddar, staying low to the ground
Reall not trying to hear it, you understand
I'ma stay down and get mine, try to stay up on this mic
Go off take it to another level, and get this money you heard

[Lil' Keke]
A pen and a paper, a stereo a taper
Since 9-blow, I been known to pull a caper
Light it up, and let the chronic gon blow
Creased and pieced up, got the bitch like whoa
I'm popped up, traffic stopped up
This for all young niggaz, getting locked up
Slow ya roll mayn, go on get ya some cash
Be careful up in the city, take your time and mash
This a war zone, get you a cell phone
And if push come to shove, get your bust on
Get your paper the cheese, the feddy I gotta have it
This for my ghetto niggaz, another classic what

(*talking*)
Yeah, this for them go-getters out there
You know I'm tal'n bout, them hard borads
That gotta get they card, getting on them planes
Getting on them trains, with that cocaine ya heard
Yeah, this for y'all shaking that ass in that club
Staying up all night, getting them 10's and 20's
Get that money girl, cause I ain't gon give it to ya
Somebody got to do it but not me, go 'head wholay

[Lil' Keke]
Buckle up knuckle up, when you coming correct

Hold your head nigga, you know the Lord work his magic
