[Rza] Bring da bring da muthafuckin' ruckus!

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

Bring da motherfuckin ruckus

Verse One: Raekwon the Chef

Somethin' new from my real live raps and so catch this,
While I kick a verse like chapters.
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act 
With the rugged Timberlands or with boots that's black!
But on the real, I'm cold like blue steel.
Out to catch a hit and make a mil...[CHILL!]
Maintain yourself black!  You're strappin' all of that!
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack!!!
That's my word!  I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw,
And pick it out my gold teeth!
But yo!  Back to the subject,  Wu's tryin' ta get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check!  Need a little meth yo
true!!!  Back to me flippin' you and your so called zoo!
You got nothin' on a nigga from Staten, 
A drunk monk, smokin' mad skunk and stackin'!
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey,
Drivin' a Benz hearin' my man's song.
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out,
And cops drove the wrong route!
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, 40 gunz be flowin' in ya face,
Who want's some!!!

Chorus

Verse Three: Inspectah Deck

I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's bangin
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hangin
Bust this, I'm kickin like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes, the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigga
So bad, stabbin up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on ya ass like your dad, bring it on...

Chorus

Verse Four: The Genius/GZA

Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fuckin' up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp!
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creepin up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fuckin' dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Choppin through ya back *swish*
Givin bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggaz to kick buckets
I'm wettin CREAM, I ain't wettin fame
Who sellin gain, I'm givin out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin ruckus...

Chorus

So bring it on...(X7) 

punk nigga!
