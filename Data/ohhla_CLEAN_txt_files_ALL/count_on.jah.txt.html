[Ja Rule]  
Uh, yeah
It's Ja Rule nigga
Uh, uh, yeah
Feel this
Uh, Ja Rule nigga
Def Jam, Ja

Look at my life style it's dangerous
When I was young this sorta life was contagious
Hustlin' hard like them sharks down in Vegas
My gat and I come bust spontaneous
This world made us to take only what they gave us
The game is our loss
Watch yo gloat
Then show you that this world aint yours
Push crack like swingin' doors
And leave strips wide open
Ja's holdin
A pair a nines and ya'll cats foldin'
My life ain't been all that goldin'
This ryme hit me at a young age and kept callin'
I know I'm fallin' 
To the evil of money and drugs and lost woman
But thats what I'm lovin' about livin'
Bein' I see my birth as a givin'
Knowin' my inner limits
This game aint no scrimmage
Lets play big we're winners
Beg the Lord for forgiveness
For when I die please take me off your shit list
Cause I'll be nameless
Puttin' them through changes
The J to the A
Niggas know the flows crazy

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt 
You could count on your nigga

[Ja Rule]
I got a lust for this money
Admire them old timers
Assume with no conscience
Made a world so chaotic
Opened up my mind and introduced me to narcotics
Brand new wips not this thicks the hottest chicks
I just can't seem to keep them off my dicks
The difference is ya'll did ya'll thing on the low
Made alot of doe
We did our thing high pro
Thou we still blew
I wish I knew dirty money was evil
I never understood until I lost a few people
Dead and gone still their memory lives on
Throw a mural up let them niggas them was loved
Now were in to better things
Got our hands on every ring
Crime in the streets
Cause it's my time
I draw the line between love and war really
Nigga you with me 
Your flossin, out side that you fear me
Literally strait up and down with no cross
As God is my witness and JA is yours
I'm a spit in your directions
Hit the floors, Nigga

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt 
You could count on your nigga

Uh, yeah
Uh
It's Def Jam
Topp dogg nigga
Recognize
Uh, Uh
Ja Rule nigga
Uh, Uh
Recognize
Def Jam nigga
Uh, yeah
Recognize
Uh, yo
I'm big boy nigga
What the deal big boy
What the deal
Uh, yeah
All my niggas, live on
Dog
We kill 'em all

[Chorus]
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Were we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt you could count on your nigga
What makes a nigga what he is?
And how do we get from where we at to where we be?
It's evident who's out for the dead president
And why so many close to my heart had to die
Where we goin' in life figure
There's no start no end
But when in doubt 
You could count on your nigga

Uh, yeah</pre>
