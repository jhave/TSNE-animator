Black Rain

With the Lotus
With the Lotus
You can see anybody in my mothafuckin' Juggalo family
Yeah!
So try bringing that shit on mothafucker
That's right
These six petals will unfold the Black Rain on that ass

[Anybody Killa]
With my Lotus
We can make you all believe
That it's time for the pod to rise and mislead

[Jamie Madrox]
With my Lotus
I can drink from the liquid mirror
And reveal the other half of me that never seems to appear

[Violent J]
With my Lotus
I gorilla press cars
I rock write a Lotus on my chest made of red scars

[Monoxide Child]
With my Lotus
We steal a sun and hide it in our pockets
And leave your bleedin' world hidden in total darkness

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
With my Lotus
We walk on water and spit acid
And melt your fuckin' balls like a piece of plastic

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With my Lotus
I can make the clouds split
Have the rain drops line dance with the moon dust a jig

[Monoxide Child]
With my Lotus
I disappear in the action of run and hit
And leave victims on their blind side
They never see me coming

[Violent J]
With my Lotus
Vampires flock to me
Because my blood is worth diamonds
And it's redder than ruby

[Chorus]
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
With my Lotus
I talk to the ghosts of fallen soldiers
Awaken all their souls with plans of taking over

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With my Lotus
I see the walls sweatin' and bleedin'
I know their alive
I can hear them mothafuckas breathin'

[Anybody Killa]
With my Lotus
Watch bodies start to fall
And shiver and die slow
Because they came too close

[Jamie Madrox]
With my Lotus
My skeleton glows electric blue
It's been broken and remended with scotch tape
And Elmer's glue

[Violent J]
With my Lotus
A kitchen knife becomes a weapon
Cut your motherfuckin' foot off and leave you half stepping

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
With my Lotus
I travel through fire and brimstone
To the land of the living dead
Where all my people roam

[Anybody Killa]
With my Lotus
I can have you thinking you're crazy
You'll be running to a church screaming
Dear God save me

[Monoxide Child]
With my Lotus
I've been blessed with the mightiest sword
In the hope I could just rip out people's vocal chords

[Chorus]
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight

[Violent J]
With my Lotus
A ritual dance for black rain
Like budda budda booda bang

[Monoxide Child]
With the Lotus
I can keep my hatred away
By sproutin' wings of a demon then just flying away

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With my Lotus
I can see the shadows in the dark
As they creep in your soul
And stop the beatin' of heart

[Anybody Killa]
With my Lotus
I can make a grown man cry
Just by starin' him in his eyes
It could blind him for life

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
With the Lotus
I erase anything in focus
If damage irreversible
Resistance is hopeless

[Jamie Madrox]
With the Lotus
I can accomplish anything I set out to do
Power is impersonal it lies inside of all of you

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
With my Lotus
I swing quick and punch your toupee
And stab you in the chest
And show these bitches we don't play

[Jamie Madrox]
With the Lotus
I remain in focus
Nothing can slow us down
We're everywhere so don't be afraid
When the lights are down

[Chorus]
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight
With the Lotus
I can freeze fire tonight
I cut my petals in the moonlight

With the lotus
C'mon
What
Psychopathic
Whoop whoop
