[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, hey, I bet it must be nice, chillin' every day
Not really doin' shit, a couple million in the bank
I'm workin' all the time, never gettin' me a break
But fuck it that's fine, not a minute go to waste
I just want to be a legend every second I gotta be goin' in
A part of me wanna chill, but part of me wanna win
No college payin' my bills, I'm sayin' just what I feel
Cause haters be lookin' stupid when you just keepin' it real
I got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
But the people comin' up say I'm forgettin' who I am
Just because they randoms I went to school with
I'm cool with it, chillin' with some buddah smoke
I always do it big like Jewish nose
Cadillacs, I'm tryna to get a few of those
Fuck stress, everything'll be okay

[Chorus]
How did you know
I was feeling so under the weather
This evening
If you don't mind, progress your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay
And they say they love you, but they kiddin'
They say they bought your CD, but they didn't
If you don't mind, progress your mind
I think it's all gon' be okay

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Do you believe in fairytales, dreams come true? one day you gone make it
If they gave you a hand out, and you were down, babe, would you take it?
I found that bein' famous in reality, well it ain't shit
Cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
But it don't mean a thing 'til you change it
Listen, baby, I'm a be great now
We can watch a movie, fuck it, stay up late
I'm a make my way to the top, every day I get closer
When I was young they told me to wait until I'm older
They turned a cold shoulder to me
And now they want tickets to my shows for the free
"Hey Mac, can I take a pic? Can I have an autograph?"
Bitch suck my dick

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm riding by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright
We go front, back, side to side
Wave, say hi if I'm riding by
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5
But everything'll be alright

Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
The hatin' gonna last forever so
I just smile, it's whatever
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Under the weather, shit'll get better
Don't let nobody say you can't, heart beating like an 808
I know it sucks with a 9 to 5, but everything'll be alright

[Bridge]
