[Chorus]
We're vacationing somewhere on an island

[CASSIDY]
Just when you thought I was done
I come wit the remix
But dis for the hood

Cum see the strip its like takin a ski trip
Zero degree wrist 80 a whop
My chain blingy pinky full of radiant rocks
I aint Chingy I'm outside the motel party
Passenger side wit Rob in the Ferrari
I smoke la-la get high like I'm a Marley
Wit the mamiz you can find me where the bar be
Its hot as hell in here got Kels in here
You can smell in the air we got L's in here

And vacation on an island I ain't know existed

[Chorus]
We're vacationing somewhere on an island

[TRINA]

You know I stay clean 20kt pinky ring

But tell the truth you don't know a bitch as bas as me
After the party is the after party
In the penthouse suite and we actin naughty
Dis chicks so nice got the cris so nice
In the hotel room thoia thoing all nite
And you know I'm ready, L'Pearle teddy
Rock the boat steady till I'm hot and sweaty
In the hotel motel make you wanna go tell

[CASSIDY]
If theres anybody dat do it big in the hotel
Its me see I practically live in the hotel
I put in work in the street
So I can afford to spend 10 grand on room service a week
I got the top chef makin my lunch
And the tip the waiter get prolly more than he make in a month
I'm in the hot tub breaking a blunt
I got 4 freaks in my suite all getting naked at once
While their girlfriends wait in the front
I got plenty cigars and plenty bottles and they not from the mini bar
I got Swissy looking out for me
I'm in the presidential you can see the whole city from my balcony

[Chorus]
We're vacationing somewhere on an island
(we chillin 4x)
Drinks of all kind
(we chillin 4x)

Girl you wanna cum to my Hotel

I'm feelin the way you carry urself girl
And I wanna get wit you cuz yous a cutie
So if you wanna cum to my Hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
Cuz we havin a after party
Checkin out 6 in the mornin 6 in the mornin
