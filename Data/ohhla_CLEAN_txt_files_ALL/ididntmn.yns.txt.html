Song:   I Didn't Mean 2 Break Your Heart
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

Girl, I apologize, I didn't realize
What I was doin, I didn't mean to ruin
Our relationship, you're a cute honey dip
Let's try again on the serious tip
No girl in this world could ever replace
Your pretty smile and your beautiful face
And your magical touch
Until now I never knew how much
I really felt and cared
So come on, girl, don't be scared
I admit I was a little ungreatful
But now I know how to be faithful
I'll turn your frown upside down
Things might be better when I'm around
I knew I was wrong from the start
That's why I'm here to say I didn't mean to break your heart

I didn't mean to break your heart
I should've known right from the start
I didn't mean to break your heart
I needed your loss to fall apart

I'll never forget the first day in May
I was chillin with my hands in my pocket
Thinkin should I give her a play?
At the time I didn't know what to say
So I thought I let her
My boys used to say, Yo don't sweat her
Cause she ain't no better
And when she called I ain't never dialed back
I don't know why I dissed her
Cause in my heart, I can't resist her
Now I truly regret it
What came out my mouth, I wish I never said it
Cause now I'm lonely
I promise to be your one and only
Nothing can keep us apart
That's why I'm here to say I didn't mean to break your heart

We were like two love birds in a tree
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
And now it feels like I'm lost and stranded
Sayin to myself I can't understand it
Everything was fine and dandy
Even at the carnival bought you cotton candy
I know I was wrong from the start
That's why I wanna say I didn't mean to break your heart</pre>
