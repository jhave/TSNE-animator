[Mac Miller]
Don't even know my schedule
Levels reaching several
Rose petals delivered make you feel special
They doubt the money should've changed it
Slide's still blue
Why the world keep tryin to paint it
When life around you changes
Try to keep your sameness
Try to keep your brain
Maintainin through the lameness

[Chorus]
Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home

I hope its never all gone
Don't think its ever all gone

Sometimes I just wanna go
Back to Blue Slide Park, the only place I call home
I hope its never gone, forever long </pre>
