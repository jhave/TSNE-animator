	Yo we represent Queens

[Mr. Cheeks]
Yeah yeah
We have a tight situation goin down right now
A tight situation
LB Fam, Queens most wanted
Funkmaster Flex

	Queens niggaz in effect!

Yo (Uptown Boogie Down)
We bring the dram' to the mills, show the skills
(Brooklyn!)  Word up?  How we do baby
Represent (NYC)

Aiyyo, aiyyo
I come correct with just a paper and a pen
With glasses with tints, I represents with my men
Either, inside or outside the pen
Color of my skin spells sin
And let me begin, to hit these motherfuckers in the gut
My attitude is what?  I lay in the cut
Your crew's blunt, they play Moet when we come
I represent the slum no need to tell you where I'm from
Jeans speak for themselves, Jamaica Queens fit
I play the smart when I hustle on the Van Whip
Believe kid, word to mom we come through
and make a power move kid on you you and you
My man Pop got the glock ready in position
Rapper bust a cap we do the same, man listen
You must be on a mission thinkin you can fuck around
with the champ you must be amped you can't blast a whole round
I make the fo'-pound everytime now how you want it
I think I'm bustin up inside that ass because I'm black
So down everyday, that's the way I sway
Like I said before you're just a needle stuck in hey
Yo what the fuck you say?  You don't smoke trees?
Now what the fuck that got to do, with the LB's?
Get a few degrees, plus robberies
My rhymes is perfected like a sniper when I squeeze
It's not about the G's it's capabilities in this
For those that try to diss I put you on my death list
I'm the drink they call, lime with a twist
I got the shit that go, pump your black fist (PUMP PUMP)
If you tight what's the deal, wanna get ill?
