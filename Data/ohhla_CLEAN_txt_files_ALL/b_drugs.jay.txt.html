Typed by: AZ Lyrics

These days a lot of niggas is wack
All I hear is who gonna bring new york back
The south is this the south is that
Slinging crack in the white tee in the trap
Sippin patron and yak
Ringo hit me up on the jack
And said man spit that spat
And leave that chicken scratch for frick and frack
Guru told me slow up the flow
Cause science and metaphors will slow up the dough so here we go Gs up hoes down
If rap was like blacks in the sixties, I'm a white cop in riot gear ready to hose down
Memo to all I'm settin you hoes down
I'll spray a sick round on any sick clown who wanna get down
From nueve york to chit-own
Comprende, wack rappers bow when they in the presence of the sensei
The flow is, muy caliente
Jaydolf spitler, rap hitler
One man militia
Burnin niggas live with the scripture
The sound waves shake the dead in they graves
Pro toolsll import the session from the richter
No wonder I'm the victor
If a thousand words is equivalent to a picture
Then welcome to the cinema
Shot of wheat grass in the enema
Who wanna style war with the emperor</pre>
