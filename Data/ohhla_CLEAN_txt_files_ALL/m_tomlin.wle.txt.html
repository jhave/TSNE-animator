[Wale]
Black and Yellow bottles at my table, I'm ballin'
Black and yellow ladies at my section, I called 'em
Balck and yellow, balck and yellow SS
Black and yellow everything nigga, Mike Tomlin
Look at my carnage, bitches be astonished
Up at Wale college shows, edibles and bong hits
This just ain't no song shit, do this for my city Joe
Bout to get my city on, had to let me city go
Shout outs to my Philly hoes, told her drop that eagle o
Called that bitch my quaterback, wild cat all that
Give a city bra's and make em soar black and all that
You don't sleep on nothing but a [?] and skull cap
Me I never call em back, she said that y'all go together
She just let me beat in you, an acapello kind fella, black and yellow
Yeah ain't that what the song say
What you calla lifetime, I just call a long day

[Wiz Khalifa]
Ah ha, you know what it is..

[Wale]
It's no days off, you ain't doing shit
Shout outs to them Taylors and them Jets fool
It feel like Woodstock in a nigga dressing room
Looking at my opposition like bust and move
From where they take them old beats and turn em into news
You can end this verse premature
But I got sceptics and some fans that just be needing more
Louie D don't see the score, going in and leave it gone
Flyer than a [?], I'm a [?] to reinforce
I don't be in wars, so I don't need a fort
I just be in the cut, my nigga Neil Spore
Some niggaz slept on me but I don't see the snoring
Some niggaz sayin' bullshit but they don't be important
They don't want, my attention, I'm cool cousin
A lil liquor a lil rose for my lil young'n
A nigga suffer, ain't eating nothing they still bluffin
While I go hard and spit retarded like them little busta's
I'm still buzzin', chick is something like nigga fuck it
Y'all little niggaz like lil bustas with lil budgets
You lil niggaz is silly you think my niggaz budging
I think you niggaz funny, I leave you niggaz bludgeoned
Hold up... ok
Black and yellow j-force, always wear a rubber so they never ever late for it
Than we celebrate when they on it
She can nip it in the bud and leave that bitches face warm, yuughck!
In my best Pusha imitation
Bitch I be ballin' on the low like the chim is baking
And I'm a need some more Patron I don't want no chaser
I'm throwing hundreds at KOD, a little paper
And you're girl working out, I let my niggaz train her
You Tim Tebow ass niggaz probably still gater
I chump chump pussy if it smell good to me
And I don't do nothing to her but she do it to me
I'm trifling, damn right ignorant
Mic magnificant, you're all simpletons
It's a [?], bitches blind dating [?]
Baby I ain't liping, I just tend to keep my city there
On my back boy, holla back boy
Half a mill rap touring, Jerard Jack boy

Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
[Repeated]
