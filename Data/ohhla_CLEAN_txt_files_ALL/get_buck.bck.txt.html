[Intro]
Yeah!!! Get 'em Buck!!!

[Verse 1]
OK! I'm reloaded my bankroll swole and a nigga can't fold it
I got 'em like HEY! Got 'em rollin
The kush on the way and the champagne frozen
Watch me do my thang, I got these hoes open
I'm ridin presidential like the shit that I'm smokin
Water wih' the work, Petrom on my shirt
And a zip ain't shit I need a quarter P of Purp
'Gon break it down, pass it all around
I can serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
Them dope boys in this bitch like, let me buy that
Broke niggas in this bitch like, let me try that
I need a beat in the bitch, let me call Polow
Mr. Tennakey I still get 'em for the low though
Shawty light up the dro, I ain't ready to go
Can't ban me from the radio or fuck up my show, you know

[Chorus] (*Ladies replying to Young Buck)
Haters tryin to ban a nigga mayne (It's OK!)
I bounce back watch me do my thang (It's OK!)
I got my Chevy hoggin up the lane (It's OK!)
I'm a boss I can make it rain (It's OK!)
Now get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)

[Verse 2]
Let's play the game I'm the quarterback, don't stop homey
I go to jail if I get sacked, so block for me
Eightball in my corner pocket, it's on and poppin
Got the whole club leanin wit' it, and body rockin
Drunk drivin in my Cut dawg, I got my truck parked
Seventy Two Tennessee Titan like what up y'all?!
I'm home boy, holla at ya homeboy
Better come quick, once I get it then it's gone boy
First come first serve, fuck what ya heard
I'm piecin out my pack till I come up on a bird
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimpin on these hoes
They know me at the bank love me at the jewelry stores
I play it how it goes, the butterfly doors
On them old school vogues with the chrome on the toes
These fuck niggas know, that I will let it go
(I bet he got a vest) No but I got my tech though

[Chorus] (*Ladies replying to Young Buck)
Haters tryin to ban a nigga mayne (It's OK!)
I bounce back watch me do my thang (It's OK!)
I got my Chevy hoggin up the lane (It's OK!)
I'm a boss I can make it rain (It's OK!)
Now get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)
Get buck bitch (Watch me do the damn thang)

[Outro]
Yeah you know what it is, how we do the damn thang down here
Nigga  what you workin with?
Yeah, hey my nigga now don't be in the club, throwin ya rent money, be broke in the mornin
Have us laughin at ya broke ass,  yeah  where my dope boys at?
Yeah! Shawty I see you! Now pick up that god damn money! Hey! LET'S GO!</pre>
