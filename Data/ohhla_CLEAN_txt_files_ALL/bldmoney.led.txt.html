Ha Yeah Triple c CMB poe boy Boss what it is nigga?
Birdman what up The Goons to be king
How you love that pussy nigga? Yeah Blood Money

The definition
I'm Clutching on my slippin in
The Way I'm Feeling Right Now
A Bitch Could get the Business
Just know my niggas squeeze on side
Only problem is we doin this head knock
I told Ross
We gon show em how the Gutta do
All black skis
Black ones
And the Jumpsuit
Silde in the silder in and out night vision
Scopes on the AR
To hit em with precision
And did I mention this one here's for the thugs dummy
A little drugs bunny
We did it off of Blood Money
More pieces of crown Vic surround us
We runnin up on niggas
They jumpin off of counters
One time for my allies
I'm a poe boy that like my guns
Supersize
CMB what it is
I'm cookin up them kids

[Rick Ross]

[Ace Hood]
Okay we getting from us servin weight
Get it cause we servin ye
See the way we get the cake
Like every days a boring gay
Blood Money
And I'm a count it till they come for me
The feds hate it
They mistakin me for Blanco Buddies
I'm puttin Blood, sweat and tears for this cash money
I'm talkin crooked unidentified bags of it
I'm talkin yellow table paper
Put the tags on it
You play with mine
Bet I turn you into crash dummies
Better not need heaters
I spit them shells like the beatles
I have my people go see you
I squash you out like a cheater nigga

Underneath the rug money
My niggas love money

[Rick Ross]
Hammers in the Hummers
Sticks in the lids
Sweets in the trunk
Streets gimmie sneers
Money comin fast
Blood comin slow
Who dem boys with the H
Feds wanna know
Gators on theif
Neighbors gon sleep
You dealin with a G
And the haters gon see Boss
I'm in the dealership
With a duffle bag
Couple Mazaradihs
Couple Hundred Stacks
Far from peaches and cream
Niggas deceased on the scene
I'm just countin my green
Chillin sippin' my li
Keep investigatin
Cause you got a job
Better keep your vest on
Bitch cause we got a mar

[Rick Ross]

[Birdman]
Well I'm the mob chief
Givin orders
Callin all the shots out
Make a nigga understand
We Gangsters
We don't play out
Came from under the sand
Lift my own weight up
Bought a house off the curb
Was patient so it paid up
No pleasure and pain homie
Just the price for the flight
Don't get'cha head chopped
Fuckin with them five stripes
Eagle land it went south
Now we got the cake
Paper plate money
Every time I hitch a state
High on this pressure life
Famous from the mud
Got the game from some old heads
I took it up in Blood
Yeah the only price nigga
Is a price
A mill on some whips
A hundred on ya life

[Rick Ross]
I'm countin Blood Money
