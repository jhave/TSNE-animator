Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it
Turned up with my partners, we coolin it
Compressive yea so my heat ye it's coolin it
I'm coolin it [x4]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it

[Verse 1]
It's time to make a movie
Note for dough till the dealer gonna cut it
She been over like boy I'm gonna do me
Not turn around no fam but shit she blew me
She got a big booty, I got a big dick
Girl tell me have you ever drove a stick
I'm shifting gears, I'm going fast I'm going slow
I'm going fast, I'm going slow on another nigga hoe
I spit cocaine, oh ye I'm talking dope
I'm just trying to celebrate
While all these other niggaz try to sell some fucking hope
Ha, I put my bandz on
He got his meds on, now he get that grands on

[Chorus]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it
Turned up with my partners, we coolin it
Compressive yea so my heat ye it's coolin it
I'm coolin it [x4]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it

[Verse 2]
Ha, roll some doobies up
Call some bitches up
Tell 'em we wanna fuck
Girl you know what's up
You better be talking what I'm talking
'Cause if you hating right now I find you walking
Brick man, he on speed dial he hawking
And he let 'em go for the 20 Brian dock us
Shit your bitch is in the bush ye she stalking
And be buy the bat little nigga's just for the talking
New WII connect, it's going down
Hasthma bitch, I'm smoking out the pound
Automatic shit, ye we spit in rounds
And silencers on them guns you won't hear a sound

[Chorus]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it
Turned up with my partners, we coolin it
Compressive yea so my heat ye it's coolin it
I'm coolin it [x4]
Treat them bandz like a fair, I'm coolin it
Nigga quit callin your bitch she coolin it</pre>
