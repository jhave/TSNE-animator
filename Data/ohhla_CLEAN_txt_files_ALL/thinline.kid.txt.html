Chorus: Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.
It's a thin line
Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

[Kid Frost]
(Verse 1)
Three in the morning
My pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, just starting to wonder
Where I'm at
What I'm doin' and all that
I could have called, but instead
I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three
I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know, it's that
Hates trip
That's it's a thin line
Between love and hate

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 2)
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, "Don't
Come over, because
Of the cold and rainy weather"
But

[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.] Knock, knock, knock
                     Who is it
[Kid Frost]          Yo, it's Frost, girl
[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.] Let me in
[Female Singer]      Frost gon' let me
                     Down
[Kid Frost]          Well, you know I won't let you down
                     Just remember that

Repeat Chorus Twice

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
It's
Five in the morning, and you're still tryin' to get through
Swearin' to Frost for hangin' out with the crew
But baby
If this keeps going on
I can't
And just like I can't, I'm gone
We been through
Thick and thin
Good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I need you, trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line
Between love and gate

Repeat Chorus Twice

(Verse 4)
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
And now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, "Don't
Come over
Cause of the cold and rainy weather"
But

[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.] Knock, knock, knock
                     Who is it
[Kid Frost]          Yo, it's Frost, girl
[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.] Let me in
[Female Singer]      Frost gon' let me down
                     Don't let me down
