Yeahh...[mumbling]....kid frankie!

[Verse 1]
I live life sucka free
Thats why them niggas you be wit, talk down like they don't fuck wit me
I get money realistically
And the homies show me love
Groupies wanna leave tha club wit me
Ain't nothin to a G
Let your hair blow in the breeze
Roll some bomb ass weed!
Get high, cruise at a jet speed
Do it like I do it for TV
675 damier LV's
7 somthing wit tax
And when im on the plane, got the carry on to match
Nigga thats fly shit
Trynna peep game lil homie just watch this
Champagne in my cockpit
Talkin bout you got a man mommy just stop it
Please!
As we proceed to give you watchu need, to roll up our weed.

[Hook]
You out here talking it
I'm out here livin it (out here livin it)
Niggas know we doin our thing cause we out here gettin it (out here gettin it)
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (gang gang)
Aint nothin changed (nothin changed), still rep the gang (still rep the gang)
Okay

[Verse 2]
Self-made, been through what I been through...
So I know what I know
I write bomb rap songs, tell them bitches what im in to
So the hoes wanna roll
First class roll to another coast
Just to smoke kush
I know a nigga who grows
And thats on the real momma
If you tryna slide gotta bring one for Will
Just another day in the life
Nother plane
Nother night
Gettin faded wit another nigga wife
Drinkin hella champagne
Tanqueray wit the sprite
Then I'm up in the AM to catch another flight
Niggas reppin the gang
Simply because everything else lame
The fans want real niggas
Them hoes lookin for change
I seen it all
Player in the game
First they bitin our flow
Now they jackin our slang

[Hook]
You out here talking it
Im out here livin it (out here livin it)
Niggas know we doin our thing cause we out here gettin it (out here gettin it)
But I rep the gang gang gang gang gang (gang gang)
Aint nothin changed (nothin changed), still rep the gang (still rep the gang)

So incredible... Hahaha...If I do say so myself...My nigga germ, on the boards
Yeah he did that shit fool... Yeah! Hahaha... what up Will?...
Benji just got off that flight from vegas...Okay...
Taylor Gang, Over everything! Rostrum Records...
Thats how the fuck we do shit! Yeah! Bitch! Smoke somethin...
Kush and Orange Juice nigga....Can't forget that....Everything's Louis Vuitton on this...</pre>
