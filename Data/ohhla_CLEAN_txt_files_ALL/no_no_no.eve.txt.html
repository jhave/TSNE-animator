Yo, Eve

Yeah we telling, ya know how in the club

[Damien Marley (Eve)]
Now this one is elementary
We going to end it for the century
Ruff Ryder evolution presentary
Rag-a-muffin play-mentry
Yo (Uh, Come On, yo) Bumba

(Chorus)  (x2)

No, No, No
You don't love me and I know now

Cause you left me baby
And I got no place to go now

(Bridge)  (x2)

Uh huh uh, uh huh (yo) uh huh (yo)

You say that you love me but how could you lie
You say that you love me but why could you lie

[Damien Marley]
Max to my respect to my girl I love the best
But when you left me it's like a bullet to my chest
Now I'm not the same, I got a bullet proof vest
Knocked off my feet I pleaded no contest
Sleepless nights without no sleep or rest
This is ragamuffin, Junior Gong comin' next
Take it no more, I had to make a confess
Sometimes I feel I'm in the Wild, Wild West
Lost the love I had now I live to the death

[Stephen Marley (Damien Marley)]
Se woman a tell me lie, a give me long story line
Oh, sincerely yours, it could be sincerely mine
But listening to promises what a fool am I
Can somebody tell me?  You know all his life
I'm just trying to be friendly, but I'm losing my mind
Mi notice that your moving physically on time
Use to be rubber ducky late nights no wine
Miss the loveliness of the body old whine
Well, might as well you shoot me with a new cold 9
Sweet one above me; is so hard to find
And I know you don't love me, I'm reading the signs
Cause there's no where to go now you've left me behind
(Now it's TRUE, TRUE) that I loved you for truth
(TRUE, TRUE) she stick like ankle glue
(TRUE, TRUE)  I make your gray skies blue
(TRUE, TRUE) you want me pers-nal boo
Chilling up on the house our love be that strong
DJ's got to plays on the one's and two's

(Chorus)  (x2)</pre>
