You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Til you, be fresh out of clout (fresh water trout)
Rumors (out of water) that he got a mouth on the street (somebody tell him yo)
You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin in (streets is watchin you)
Hope, they don't know (they don't know nothin)
As much, as he thinks, that they know
That what, he drinks, is Drain-o
Rat butt, she winks, rainbow-oww-owwws

{*woman screams, Doom harmonizes*}

Loser, was twice in the fed (comin home son)
User, whose nice in the head (where that shit at bitch)
Choose to, entice him with bread (get paid son)
Harem, they said he was ex-pen-dable - dead broke
Air him, there's no witnesses (tell 'em the B.I.)
Dare him, they said he was ex-pen-dable (dead 'em dunn)
Air him, there's no witnesses (tell 'em the B.I.)
You know, you best to watch out (watch your back nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin in (nosey yo)
Hope, they don't know (they don't know nothin)
As much, as he thinks, that they know
That what, he drinks, is Drain-o
Rat butt, she winks, rainbow-oww-owwws

This Villain was a ruthless mass conquerer
