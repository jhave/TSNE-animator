[Intro - Chamillionaire]
(Got the slab talkin 'bout)
Swang down and ride with me (got the slab talkin 'bout), yeah
Swang down and ride with me

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
As I slide through on fo's
You know that the baddest women wanna get chose
I got 'em talkin about, swang down, sweet cherry or lemon ride
Hop into my passenger side
As I slide through on fo's
You know that the baddest women wanna get chose
Talkin about swang down
So go on let me show ya how we do it on that Southside

[Chamillionaire - talking over the end of the Chorus]
Swang down with me
Here lizard, lizard, lizard

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Let's give a toast to all these losers that cuff broads (uh)
Without y'all there wouldn't even be none of us dog (nah)
I'm always fresh, ain't never nothin to dust off
So much good game in my brain, they thinkin this must cost (must cost)
Don't trust talk, ya silly rabbit
Thought that I'd give her carrots/karats and cabbage but no I haven't
Chasin the same chicks like it ain't no more on the planet (uh)
Act like you wasn't with it like Justin after that Janet
Incident, I'm convinced that there's plenty of little sensitive
rappers, really actors, numbers that's probably infinite
Thought that I shouldn't mention it after gettin all intimate (what's up?)
You hear 'em talkin in person like it's a Pimpin skit (hold up)
They serenadin in this rap game G
They package it and call it "Pimpin," what this crap ain't free?
You're chasin groupies, buyin 'em Gucci, haha, that can't be
I'm livin just like Tom and Jerry 'cause the cat chase me (come on)

[Chorus]

[Short Dawg - talking over the end of the Chorus]
Yeah
It's your boy Shorty, know what I mean?
Yeah

[Verse 2 - Short Dawg]
+Shorty Wanna Ride+ with me, Young Buck
She see me comin down swingin like nunchucks
Them Texas plates'll make a sexy face bum rush (come on)
Stacks on deck, pockets lookin like Sun Trust (damn)
I chunks up the Southside when I pass (uh)
84's glass, cops out there harass (with my)
Mug on mean, glocks off in the stash (and the)
Slab so clean, tops off and the jazz (woo)
And I'm gettin to the money (money), fifties, twenties, hundreds (hundreds)
Don't worry about how nigga, just know that it's comin (comin)
These rappers gettin punished (why?) 'cause I spits fire
On the road to the riches, passin by you hitchhikers
Told my niggaz when I make then we can all ball (switch)
So I'm gonna grind 'til my money tall as Pau Gasol (that's right)
I'm respected like a rabbi (uh huh), young but I'm mad fly (fresh)
Plus I got 'em starin like a glass eye, as I

[Chorus]

[Break - Chamillionaire]
I'm yellin "hey Ms. Parker (Parker), we both should take a ride in my Charger
I hope that you won't pass up this offer girl
'Cause you know I drop ya back off tomorrow, yeah"
I'm yellin "hey Ms. Parker (Parker), just walk up to my car when I call ya
I got to let ya know that ya gorgeous girl
And ya know that I wanna really know ya
So I'm yellin hey, hey ...

[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]
You frontin like I ain't your biggest business
(You) better do more than dishes, (you) better have more than pennies
I've been a rebel I told you, these corporate losers can't deal with me (uh)
Get old, we gonna live like the Beverly Trillbillies
The real dilly, careful when seatin 'em (why?)
'Cause nowadays they shirt and they bag be filled up with helium
Won't deduct no points if your shirt is an extra medium
But if you supersizin the truth, then I'm probably eatin in (hold up)
The dash is digital, diamonds are individuals (uh)
What I'm here to do is to give ya woman a physical
I'm who she give it to, this point in her life is pivotal
Could be the last time that she ever see an invisible - roof
Haha, I'm such a dog

[Outro/Chorus - Chamillionaire]
As I slide through on fo's
You know that the baddest women wanna get chose
I got 'em talkin about, swang down, sweet cherry or lemon ride
Hop into my passenger side
As I slide through on fo's
You already know ya women wanna get chose
Talkin about swang down and ride with me (in my passenger seat)</pre>
