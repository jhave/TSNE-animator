[Big Moe]
Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West 
With plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't trying to go to war
The common denominator in the sitution 
is barre like a star you can shine with 
Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
C'mon and try to leave your mind with me
Steady be sellin, celebratin, for payin our dues
With so much drank in my cup the soda water don't even move
I's a playa can't associate with the plexin
Bone hard, bitch, Mo City, Texas
And a veteran don't get me wrong cause put you a glass
Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill bill
Blow some kill pop the steal
Since we won't ba seen 
Sippin syrup till we leave 
From the dirty-third coast it ain't no roach a G
So fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast with me
   
[Chorus: repeat 2X] 
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup 
Bang Screw

[Big Moe]
Big Moe don steped in (2X)
I done knocked out twins (2X)
Moe-yo comin down I'm throwed 
Ballin  outta control it's Big Moe

Can't nobody sip mo than moe-yo

And you know I'm throwed a G
The M-O-E cocked up on three
I'm comin down threw in my day moe-yooooo

Moe comin down made that candy wet moe-yoooo
Said a moeoooo
Big Mow ridin down on chrome
Y2K with my headlights on
Crossin threw the yellowstone 
Bout to scoop me a yellowbone
Po six and my stop one
Time for me to pay my phone
Hatta'z better leave Moe alone 
In other words just sing the song
  
Chorus
  
[Big Moe]
In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
Still come up substance make them hit the floor
84's and vouls with the freshes on my lows 
Specialy on the fours doors
Bump the strape againts rows 
Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard 
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack, get yor wimp ass threw 
Payin do's and stayin tru is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw it won't change for nothin

Chorus 4X</pre>
