I heard the streets been talking 
He keeps saying my name, that nigga Game gon' be layin in a coffin 
I'm the muthaphuckin prince of Compton 
First and last 
Don't make me the first to blast 
You're the type I'll merk ya laugh 
Cause youse a fony 
Walk around like you was my homie 
Knowin Damn well you was neva close 2 E 
Jacion who da hell you suppose to be 
On my block I got homies who can pose to squeeze 
And have a motherfucker layin face down to the streetz 
Certified G and I don't have to pay for that 
No one but E brought y'all little fame in rap 
I drop sixteen and I'm gettin paid for rap 
(He don't write his own raps) 
How lame is that 
You sound just like a bitch when she start to bleed 
You gonna have a nigga trippin once he spark this weed 
The old E keep a nigga straight fuck that Vodka 
Can't waste time dealin with these punk Imposter's 
Had to holla at the DR so we know what's poppin 
Lil E is the name and I'm coming from Compton 

Real recognize real my nigga 
Youse to be strippin in the club, cause you ain't no killa 
Loc nigga to the death note the set I claim 
In the hood homies action never said you bang 
If I can change a motherfucker in the new york minute 
You from compton, but keep puttin new york in it 
I'm a west-coast nigga I get respect from both 
The tatto on your arm is disrespectfull loc 
Gotta smoke cause this nigga keep working my nerves 
I'm a have that butterfly in his face on a curve 
Get served try to hit me with a come-back verse 
Already known in the streets I'm a come back worse 
The truth hurts 
And I hate to expose yo homie 
Before The Game ya nickname it wuz dosia homie 
He's a fony and a fake can't relate to E 
Certified and I'm coming from the C.P.T.</pre>
