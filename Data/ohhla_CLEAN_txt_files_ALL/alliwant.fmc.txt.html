Yeah, Father MC at ya
This time I need somebody to give me what I want
And what I want is your affection

	[Unknown Female Singer]
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)

	[Father MC]
Now it's a pain to my remy cos I need someone true
My guard is down so baby come to my rescue
And show me that you wanna love me for who I am
See we could be flam and I can even meet your fam
I'm not an everyday but anyway I'll parlay
And I give good love almost everyday except for Sunday
That's my rest day, I'm getting ready for the Monday
So give me your affection

	[Unknown Female Singer]
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)

	[Father MC]
Now baby, baby, baby or miss, miss, miss
Can I get a ? because I didn't disrespect
I use my intellect when I hit rock bottom
I look at your legs and say hey sugar you got 'em
The way that you're walkin is buggin me hey love
Look at me, eye to eye, let us get a contact
Do I have to play the back just because you're off that
I wanna show you that I feel good
And let me give you a taste of my man hood
You see I'm bleedin inside on the loss of the effect
Do I have to sweat you to get you my ?
Cos I'm not into sweatin so I guess that I'm gone
If you knew what you were missing you would beg to be on
Cos I'm the type of brother that's a typical type
Don't believe in hype but I believe in love at first sight
So be my fantasy, lover and flavor of affection

	[Unknown Female Singer]
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)
All I want is affection (all I really want)
Baby please no rejection (all I need)

	[Unknown Male Singer]
All I want is a little ?
All I want is you
All I want is a little ?
All I want is you</pre>
