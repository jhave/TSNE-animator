In your mind...

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

Let me caress your consciousness
Want you to taste the thought of me
Is your imagination aroused
It ought to be
Let me seduce your soul
With every word I say
Oooo, Wait on my love
It's on its way
Whoa, may I have this dance
Your dreams and destiny
You've got years to yearn
Please say yes to me
Baby believe, believe and it will be
Prepare yourself
I promise you'll remember me

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

Love has lost its compassion
But no I won't commit that crime
I'd rather leave an impression
That will last your whole lifetime
You see I go deeper
Instead of standing in the shallow end
I want to please my partner
I want to fuck my friend
I want to be inside you, literally
Girl I want to use you, habitually
Was all the waiting worth it
Soon we will see
I want to remember you
And I want you to remember me

I wanna make love but it's not quite time
I'd rather spend the night in your mind
I won't be hard to find
I'll be right there in your mind

(Cee-Lo speaks)

"I want to eat your emotion
And lick your life line"
"You can search your lifetime
And not find a love like mine"

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh........she's sleeping</pre>
