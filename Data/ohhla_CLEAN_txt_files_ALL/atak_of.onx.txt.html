"It's the beginning of a new and excitingly different story!"
	"Aight listen" -&gt; Rakim
{*needle rips across a record*}

[Fredro Starr]
What's the matter with my BRAIIIIIIIIN?
I can't think clear, oh it's the hair
Run and get the razor, gotta make it disappear
There!  Now I've got a open mind
plus some grease to give it a shine

[Big DS]
Baldheads and hoodies, black jeans and boots ta
move by the millions and children stay rough
But uhh one for the road, til I get wetted
Try to riff and conflicts get deaded!
Gats in back of baseball caps, when I react
six rascalz'll have to get stacked!

[Chorus: Onyx]
It's attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)

[Sonee Seeza]
Most times I get dirty, down-low, scandalous, crazy, connivin
WILD!  Suckers now I'll
smoke them like the bloody buddha but, BALD HEAD STYLE
Triple zero against ya grain, I shaved it close
and nick them (WHAHH!) cause it's just another victim!

[Sticky Fingaz]
(Shhhhhh!)  What?  (Shhhhhhh!)  What?! 
(Whassup whassup!)  Listen, do you hear what I hear?  (YEAH)
Sounds like an intruder comin in the rear
(Aiyyo Stick, stick 'em)  Nah I wanna kick 'em

[Sonee]
I've got the glock cocked, I'm wid it
Now they gonna get it!!

[Big DS]
I got him, I shot him, he hit rock bottom
I flip it, get wicked, and wild when I spot him
DS knows best, yep I pack a heater
Twenty bags of cheeba, slow up you damn speeder

[F]  We rush on 'em hard		(Bring 'em out dead!)
[S]  Onyx rush on 'em hard		(Bring 'em out dead!)
[SF] Bald heads rush on 'em hard	(Bring 'em out dead!)
[DS] Stinkin, what the hell was they thinkin?

[Chorus: Onyx]
The bald heads..
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
.. bald headz, ATTACK!

[Sonee Seeza]
I got news now, but proves, no way no how
(So GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY, GIVE IT AWAY NOW!)
Smooth as a baby's ass, headed for the body blast, BUDDY
Escapin through the ghetto, pigs BLOODIED
Wilder than wolverines, run with a scheme team
Meaner than Mean Dean, obscene and head's clean
So while aware for well, there goes the big bell {*DING!*}
And that means see ya, hate to be ya!

[Big DS]
My clean beat production, so damn disgustin
In the cut, bust ya gut, and head bussin
Ain't no escapin, Da Mad Face Invasion
Hot ice and cold steel, bustin up IN YA GRILL
Word to God I get odd
And even leave a punk dread out, sliced up the scalp
Maaaan!  I'll leave ya head in shreds
Attack of the bald heads, attack of the bald heads

[Sticky Fingaz]
AIYYO!!!  What's goin on with the world?
Yesterday, seen a bald head girl
WHAT?  MOVE!!  You heard what I said
I wouldn't be caught dead without a bald head
Make one false move and I'ma fill ya with lead
cause there's enough dum-dum bullets for ya whole bum bum-
-rush crew, who should I do?
Attack of the bald heads, WE COMIN THROUGH!

[Chorus: Onyx]
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack, attack!)
Attack of the bald heads
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)
Attack of the bald heads (attack!)

[Sonee Seeza]
(I GOT NEWS!)  Attack of the bald heads!
The Onyx; rippin it.. from '93 to the year 2000!
WORRRRRRRRRRD THE FUCK UP!!

[Sticky Fingaz]
Cut ya hair we still never STOP!!!</pre>
