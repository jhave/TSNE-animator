Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You're not drunk enough if you can count to 30
She had put 4 down already, go birdy
Got me, my accessory
A pretty idiot mixing alc and ecstasy
And I'm shot/shocked[?]
Is that all you got
Digging through her purse and all I found was some pot
Jameson reserved the urge to be creeping back soon
I know there's cocaine being sniffed in that bathroom
She just sneered looked at me retarded eyed
Am I lame? I'm sorry I lied

Your aim is off so is your point of view
When the hand of god pointed at you
He said you were designed to grow up and go slut
Gave you a pretty face, nice tits, and no butt
If getting away with murder ain't the way to be
Then getting bitches all rapey/rabies[?] okay with me
Why would I care who's fake I'm living major lies
I don't relate, I placate, I plagiarize
Save that talk for your friends or go home
I know you're fly, I'm the shit and won't leave me alone

The word storm kept her underwear warm
Till she dripped on the floor then she slipped out the door
And you like my circle I can tell
Cause you're starry like Orion's belt
I looked in death's eyes through my shades
He winked and then ignored me
One look in yours I know your lily white story

I was underground like this buried garage
A car came around better wizardry than Oz
Slipped a 20 said thanks for taking care of this
She's jetted in a 9 eleven like a couple terrorists
And I know it's mundane
Not pharmaceutically lobotomizing my brain
Co-sign don't need a notary
Trying to steal with this bitch's head and hands all over me

Come dummy
I already took your lunch money
Federal on the 101 doing 120
And I'm driving trashed of course
Like I'm the first white dude to crash a Porsche
Even though my name's seen
That shit's invisible compared to James Dean
My report wouldn't be history
Make sure I'm cremated so nobody can piss on me
I should drop you off, call it a day
I've got zero condoms anyway

So where you going?</pre>
