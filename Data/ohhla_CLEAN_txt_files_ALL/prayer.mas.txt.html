Song:   A Prayer For England
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In the name of
And by the power of
The holy spirit
May we invoke your
Intercession for
The children of england
Some of whom have seen
Murder so obscene
Some of whom have been taken

Let not another child be slain
Let not another search be made in vain

Jah forgive us
For forgetting
Jah help us
We need more loving
See the teachers
Are representing you
So badly
That not many can see you

Let not another child be slain
Let not another search be made in vain

Jah calls the ones who's
Beliefs kill children to
Feel the love of you and be healed
And may we all cry too
For representing you
So badly so badly

Jah forgive us
For forgetting
Oh Jah help us
To be forgiving
The teachers are representing you
So badly that not many can see you

Let not another search be made in vain
Let not another child be slain</pre>
