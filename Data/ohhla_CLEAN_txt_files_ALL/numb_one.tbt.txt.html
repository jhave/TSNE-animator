Chorus (2x):(Mannie Fresh)
All the niggas was, buck, buckin' in the crowd
And all the ladies was, scream, screamin' out loud
Go number 1
Brian, Baby, Bizzy, Bubba
Go number 1
Old ig-nant motherfucker

Verse 1: (Baby)
(Come on, you ridin' this dick)
Yo, fuck being a prince
I'm the king of the south
It's the birdman daddy stick the gag in ya mouth
It's the, Boss Hog, known Big Dawg
The boss of the ghetto and I ball like a Dawg
You see that, four pound, ga-round, and round
round banana clip and I shut your hood down
See I floss like Jewelry (stay broke like Woodie)
It's the number 1 daddy, look for carpet and pully
See I shine like feet, 23's for me
24's on the truck and leave on dub streets
See I wipe a bitch down
Then dribble on the hoe
And touch her from her head, from her waist to her toe
Now buckle up Ma it's time to ride out
G-waggin' daddy , I keeps it down south
Escalade truck, in the back, and it's nasty
Cut it on the side, switch it out, and it's a Caddy

Chorus(2x)

Verse 2: (Mannie Fresh)
Let me holla at these niggas that went out bad
They jumped in the magazine and showed they ass
But it ain't nothin' but stunna to bust a nigga ass
When I jumped off the porch, y'all were still on the grass (Biotch)
Nigga gave me a shot and gave me a gun
Fresh loaded the gun and told me have some fun
But A,A- the B-I the I-I 
You motherfucka! (Fucka)
Suck a d-iock
You Motherfucka! (Fucka)
Ba- Ba-  Bubba Motherfucka !
Them hoes be sayin' (Women: You a dirty motherfucka)
See the pipes, rims, cars, the chrome
The jewels, the ice,  ears, the arm
The ???, the Lui, the Gucci, the berry
The swine, the mink, let's get it together
The prowler, the swade, the jacket, the leather
Headliner, rebot, tailor made sweaters
The guns, the pistol, automatic niggas
Ak, nine glocks,  mackin' left niggas
It's the princess cuts, round shaped diamonds
You betta understand because these hoes all minors (You better Biotch!)
It's the Ma- Ma- Mannie Mannie Fresh nigga (The fuck with this nigga!)
Disrespect, you get the Smith and Western nigga!
Spin yo block on 24's nigga
Woman: Stunna Stunna
Mannie: I'm known to havin' hoes nigga!

Chorus

Verse 3 :
I went from, teach to streets, to solvin' this beef
Nigga gave me my shot,  November the nuts ski
Aye aye 19 that is (Woooo)
See them tattoo tears
See I'm a known deep boy with the dope in the frig
It's me Lac and Stone and all my kids
Ridin' round town in that brand new Jig (Woooooo Weeeee!)
Jaguar that is
See I'm world wide grindin' and I'm tryin' to live
You know how it is when you  got the kids
You gots to go home and get it how you live
Ain't got no money so you pick at eye lids
Turn around the corner and you askin' why
You fought everybody cause you stupid ass high
Asked mom for money you dumb motherfucka (fucka)
She find out in jail and you back this summa (summa)
