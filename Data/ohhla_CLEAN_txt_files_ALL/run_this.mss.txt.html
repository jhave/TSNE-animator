[Missy Elliott]
My style can't be duplicated or recycled
This chick is a sick individual
SICKTATE, VOLUME TWO, BELIEVE IT!
	{*"Apache" breaks start*}
HO!! HO!!
Let me switch up the game

I drink that co-gnac
Step back cause I might put it ON ya
I go deep, so deep 'til you sleep
Count sheep, wake you up from, {nawe?}
You don't want me have to SHOW ya
How a freak bitch act when I ain't SO-ber
Whattup, I'm to' up, sho' nuff
Ain't scared to take it out, tell the freak to take it off
Tipsy and I feel, good
Black dudes got big, woods
Into it, I do it, I did it
If you really really want it then nigga stop frontin
Aiy boy you know I'm yo' type
Five two I wear my jeans real tight
My curves, they swerve, so superb
My word is my word and I came to serve

[Chorus]
WE RUN THIS, run this, WE RUN THIS, run this
WE RUN THIS UH-OHH, OHH!
It don't matter where you're from it's where you're at
And if you came to freek-a-leek better bring ya hats nigga
East, coast, West, coast
Down, South represent ya coast
YEAH WE RUN IT, AND YEAH WE RUN IT
Y'ALL DON'T WANT IT, CAUSE MY COAST RUN IT
Uh-ohh, we run this shit, uhh, WE RUN THIS SHIT

[Missy Elliott]
WICKED!  Wanna pull my hair, break my back
For the right money might sit in your 'llac
Back to back, and can't even keep track
It's a fact the freaks love to get slapped
Suck my toes and then the backrub
I don't come to do it, I just wanna be touched
Look at how y'all makin me blush
I'm enough to go around so people don't push
Don't push - when I run that tush in the bush
Don't my diamonds look real good
And they shine so hard, that he glitters
So many karats they look like critters
And we can do it all night
Take a flashlight to see up in my windpipe
I like to keep a nigga hype
I wanna know can you handle my mic

[Chorus]

[Missy Elliott]
Any hustlers in the party y'all - HELL YEAH
If youse a pimp lemme see you party hard - HELL YEAH
Ohhhh strippers take yo' clothes off - HELL YEAH
Y'all superstars, y'all don't need no bodyguards - HELL YEAH
Nigga I bo-gart
A lot of rappers fakin way too hard
Pull up at the club in a rental car
Where them freaks at, the freaks at the bar where the hard drinks are
Don't, start
You don't want beef, don't take it that far with a superstar
I got my foot on the clutch, see me bounce my butt
Misdemeanor too much and I don't give a fuck

[Outro Chorus]
WE RUN THIS, run this, WE RUN THIS, run this
WE RUN THIS UH-OHH, OHH!
It don't matter where you're from it's where you're at
And if you came to freek-a-leek better bring ya hats nigga
WE RUN THIS, run this, WE RUN THIS, run this
WE RUN THIS UH-OHH, OHH!
Represent ya coast and act like ya know
Know how to act 'fore you step your two feet in the do'

VOLUME TWO, HOLLA!
WICKED!  THIS SHIT IS SICK!
BIG SHOUT OUT TO MOBB DEEP
