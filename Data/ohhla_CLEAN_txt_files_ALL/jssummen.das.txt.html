Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Well I'm the jibber jabber, jaw like Shabba
Franks making thanks, operating like Trapper
John M.D., yea, that's what folks tell me
I plan on going far and be a star like Marcus Welby
So there, dear, uhum, you suit though
Yes, I makes the ruckus, causing ruckus like Menudo
Or Judo, I kicks it, I throws them when I gamble
And when I swings my thing, I take a swing like Mickey Mantle
But um, I got more flavors than a pack of Now and Laters
Beg your pardon, Mr. keebler, but I love Vanilla Wafers
See, i got it going on 'cause of the songs that I write
I got it going on 'cause my crew is nuff hype
Plus I zitz em, I zamz em, I grams em like Zorro
I shop at Dagastino for a bag of Stella Dorro
Breadsticks, oh yes it's the books plus three
Of my cousins, Crazy Drazy, ?(Abe Blitz and Tea)?
'Cause we're

(Chorus)
Jussumen that's on the mic...

Diggity yes, back up, I just come like Shaka
Zulu, I pop like Orville Redenbacher
When I'm proper, I doobity dibble dabble wit my winnings
I drop a Def Jam as if my name was Russell Simmons
I'm funky, spunky, I clock bread like Wonder
I'll jump up and flex , make you think I'm jane Fonda
I shiggity slam Rito, I'm layed back like Tito
I good gots nuff wisdom like Mama Montigo, amigo
Se Vente, yes I can samba
I'm known like Geraldo, shishi karamba
The jibbity jibba jammage, always wit the hippity houser
I got crazy smarts like that kid Doogie Howser
So cool out, Purno, I burn you no jive
I wickity wax that scalp just like Alberto V.O. Five
Diggity damn right half pint, i taste great like Bud Lite
I'm well known like Spike or Walter Kronkite
Cause we're

Chorus

Check it, 1 for the money, 2 for the show
Thunder, Thunder, Thundercats, HO
Yep, I got my moms, i got my girl, I got my friends
And they say some making dollars, in Japan, I'm making Yenz
Wit the new style, meanwhile, my real name is William
I went and break a slut like Donald Trump can break a million
Or zillion, I kills 'em, I watches All My Children
I'm hard as women, watch it silly stunt, just ask the pilgrims
I was strong from the get go, I'm not Lou Ferringo
I never caught the cooties from a fluzy or a bimbo
Like Cheeko, I'm the man, yes indeed, i got the smart, so
When I take a stand, just take a seat like Rosa Arts
Some tomato, tomato, bolongna, bolongna
I use to fraggle rock ya but now I fraggle zone ya
A loner, i can't swim, I'm laughing in my hoodie
And I get down and boogie, oogie, oogie
Cause we're

Chorus

I'm like Slick Rick the Ruler but I'm cooler that a calvin
My mon's name is June, my pops name is Alvin
I'm not your Kurt Gowdie but I'm outtie, Sianara
So hit the road Jack so I can Welcome Back Kotter
I flippity blast the ill shit, I flips them when I get them
I chills wit the Books now mom paid out the rectum
No comp, I stiggity stomp em all out like sash squash
I'm deep, no steep, I'll make you wanna join backwash (zoom)
I diggity drops a jam and now I'm slamming like Madonna
I gave a crewcut to Sinead O'Conner
Your honor, I'm bad to the bone, word is born
'Cause me and Mrs. jones, we got a thing going on
Yes I am, my ?(gibitibibity)? bedroom will not end
To the diggity cows come home, take the Gitney again
'Cause it's crazy, so give it a rest toots, don't you know me
I go from ten to two just like Ivan Roni
'Cause we're

Chorus
