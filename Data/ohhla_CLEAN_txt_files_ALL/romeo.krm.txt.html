Your Romeo my juliet which get to get wet
My crosstown love in the project
The target over enemy lines
But I'm willing to die for what's mine

From the beginning we was sinning like adam and eve
Each other has taken from the others forbidden tree
Another casualty if i get caught up
Shot up by a thugs lying in my blood body by this love
We got commitments to the place were we grew
I got love for my crew but a growing love for you
Don't know what to do
I'm tired of playing the creep
Packing heat setting rendezvous to go out and eat
I can't sleep by the sin of passion lasting
One day with you away is like a muslim fasting
I guess it's evident face of my bloody murder or represent
Never hesitant to put the squeeze on your residence
My alibies and disguise starting to wear out
I pay the price of my life you what I care about
What ever it takes scuffles and scrapes or squeezing 38's
Anything for godsakes to end these heart aches
Close to confession dying for my hoods blessing
Reminiscing in hotels caressing
Thug sexing your body's pleasing
As I'm easing, glassy eyes and inner thighs squeezing
This is it ecstasy is your next trip
Grinding hip for hip as I suck your bottom lip
(If the kids from that crew find out what I'm doing to you I'm through)
But I gotta do what I gotta do...

Your Romeo my juliet which get to get wet
  my crosstown love in the project
The target over enemy lines
  but I'm willing to die for what's mine

If a man don't have nothing to die for than he ain't worth living
Thirteen hearing these words of wisdom
Giving visions of this girl juliet a deep respect
For the princess of her project
We first when on the humble it was destined
Perfect first impression two different kinds but intertwined with sexin
My introspection cause me to say this
I give thanks to the god who made this possible to happen
I'm trapped in thoughts of getting clapped in, your back stairs
Trying to deal with these nightmares
I don't scare easy but everytime you see me
There's one of them kids right there ready to leave me
So from top to bottom, my problem brings yellow tape,
But I'm in shape and break down your back fire escape
Don't want to end as a captor of a neighborhood kidnapper
Bringing my life the final chapters
Thug edition, god don't curse me
Send me an angel of mercy so i can deal with this controversy

Your Romeo my juliet which get to get wet
My crosstown love in the project
The target over enemy lines
But I'm willing to die for what's mine
Your Romeo my juliet which get to get wet
My crosstown love in the project
The target over enemy lines
But I'm willing to die for whats mine

Speeding through red lights hot rainy nights
Cruise control sipping on Henny then message my broken soul
Trying to make my situation make sense
Ever since ducking and weaving your back yard fence
Avoiding hot slugs cortex aim stake my claim
(Guns cocking) cause im a die for this notorious dame
Killer rain is destined then we'll be the only question
Bullet proof vestin doing our bestin
Unless them cats lay down they gats and stand back
Then there's drama word on my momma pure trauma cause im a
Little tired of these lies and these games
Awaiting me is satan through my blood soaked stains
From strained strained conversations to death threats on my phone
Niggas is swearing on their seeds I better leave you alone
Or catch a hot one we got the wrong one for that
Clicking they gats trying to clap me and they set booby traps
Thats not safe my life for theirs this time
Nickel plated fate ready to die for whats mine</pre>
