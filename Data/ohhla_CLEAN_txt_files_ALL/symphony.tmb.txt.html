[Timbaland]
Hey! I was mean... before I became a fiend
I took over the world when they gave me a beat machine
And then I made my city jump (jump)
It's your favorite producer, come on baby let it bump (bump)
I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone
A typhoon everytime I get on a song
A tycoon, I just went and bought another home, who you stuntin on?
I'm never off, I set it off, and you was never on
What's there to care about? People know my whereabouts
Anywhere I want, private jet, in and out
Whip brand new, you know what Tim about
Ferrari 5-99, windows tinted out
I-I-I'm the man, m-my beats is crazy
You want my sounds? Frikki you gotta pay me
But don't get it confused, never had no silver spoon
But you got a long walk, tryin to fit Timbaland's shoes
And next up (I believe that's me)
And what's your name (D.O.E. on the M-I-C)
And where you from (N-Y-C, we up in here G)
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[D.O.E.]
Okay, okay
When you see me roll through (yup) got the whole crew
Timbaland he produce, if you a fruit, produce
Ridin in the old school (pimpin) like I'm 'posed to
She french kiss my dick and then I told her "Merci beaucoup"
(Put it in the bag) Nah baby I ain't Fab
When I fucked you it's a wrap, I'ma put you in the cab
Better be happy I rap, if I wasn't I'd be strapped with the mags
And I'm... and I'm coming for your stash
When I find out where you at, I'll be (shimmyin your lock)
Get the fuck up out, yo babe you betta (gimme what you got)
Want yo' {*censored*} money, {*censored*} money
{*censored*} money, {*censored*} money
Lyin like there's no money? (Uhh) Gotta go money
Pockets feelin drained then it's back to snatchin chains
And I wish a nggaa run up on me, he gon' find that he done made
the wronnnng move - I ain't changed, still the same
D.O.E. be the name, I'm from Northside Queens
Next up (Ha! Hey I believe that's me)
And what's yo' name? (Bran'Nu a/k/a Brandy)
And where you from? (Mississippi but was raised in Cali)
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[Bran'Nu]
I got it, I got it - ha! It's been a long time comin
I'm back like I forgot something important
Can't have a problem with me, I fade it to black
like church slacks now I'm in the Range, no Cadillac
So you don't want it with me
I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubblegum, I got yo' head strung
It's my return like the "Kingdom Come," I'm takin off like a rocket
I got this beat in my pocket, I keep your heart droppin
And you.. ha, never gonna hold me back
Timbo put me on the map, now you wanna say I act
Bran'Nu.. ha! Just like my Prada boots
Struttin like a model do, don't you wish you had another
Chance to.. ha! Get up under my skin
Frontin like you get it in and you keep runnin your mouth like them
broads do.. I gotta learn you like a school do
Cause clearly you don't have a clue
So next up (yeah, hey I believe that's me)
And what's yo' name? (Attitude on the M-I-C)
And where you from (Alabama we up in here G)
Why don'tcha, get on the mic for the Symphony?

[Attitude]
Okay, {niggaz} pokin jokes, I'm never mediocre
Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toaster
On my side bitch ride unless she a Oprah
Bitchh I'm too fly to drive, I'ma need a chauffeur
I get a whole lot of hoes like a G supposed ta
They could put me in the fed for what's in my sofa
Rap {niggaz} wack, smack 'em if they say your part
Diss me I'll up the ratchet on you and your A&amp;R
I know they mad, never thought that it could happen
Got my {*censored*} on, then I hopped in a Aston
Every check I cash in, bigger than the last one
Met a new freak, she thicker than the last one
Nah, I don't love her homey, music is my passion
I don't show compassion and all I do {*censored*}
Bitches be yellin I'm the shit even when nobody's askin
Boy I'm on fire like the {*censored*} at the {*censored*} Inn
That's why I stay so gone player
Fuckin {*censored*} in the ozone layer
I drop a hit everytime I got some shit to say
And if I miss I come back like a ricochet</pre>
