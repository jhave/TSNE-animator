[Chorus] (Steve Knight)
You better get ready cause you know we bout to go all night
We do what we do when were doin' it cause we doin' it right

[MC Piper]
It's just another night my brother's night I'm rollin' up a dub that's tight
Get smothered right you bustas better be shackled up to ya wife
We doos it right when we does it stay buzzin' with cousins
Thought I wasn't at that bar poppin' collars hollin' it's nothin'
We crushin' game sprinkle on dames commence to change thangs
Playin' brain games she addicted like dick was cocaine
Feelin' no pain unpredictable like the dope game
From here to Spokane sippin' liquor that's mixed with OJ

[Chorus]

[MC Piper]
Voce nao pode ver que estou falando agora
Se'ta escutando vamos para baile vamos embora
Se'ta escutando vamos quero fumar a maconia
Se'ta escutando vamos let's go to California
We hit Copacabana then we hit Ipanema
We touchin' down in the Mangueira where the thugs winnin'
We touchin' down in Cidade de deus where they sinnin'
We fill the stretch up with women and keep the wheels spinnin'

[Chorus]

[Steve Knight]
They call me Knight Rider I do the damn thing
Looking for woman half black and Lebanese
At the poker table hit em' for a 100 G's
And you can find me early mornings in between the knees
Light green purple hairs once again it's on
High speedin' through these California streets gone
Hollar catch me if you can peddle to the floor
Had to go four in the morning now it's on

[Chorus]</pre>
