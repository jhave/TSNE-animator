[Verse 1 - Cowboy Troy]
Like dust in the wind sand slips through your fingers
Similar to shattered dreams that still linger
Trying to succeed in whatever you do
But the failures of the past seem to laugh and mock you
I'm worse than a has been? 'Cause you say I never will be
I'm just tryin to excel so you feel me
'Cause boundaries are made to be broken
And I'm leavin' all the namesayers chokin' 
On the dust that I'm kickin' up behind me
It's difficult findin' words to define me
The hick hop cowboy from the D-A-double L-A-S
So fresh in the contest
Rockin' stages like Guns and Roses
I been flowin' since Madonna was strikin poses
I can't quit now 'cause there's too much buzz
And I'm gettin my chance because...
 
[Chorus - Tim McGraw + Big Kenny]
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you - and smilin' on me
 
[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
I remember the days sittin' in the pews
When I heard the preacher sayin', "Spread the news!"
I was feelin' the blues 'til I had a chance to choose
Now I feel the love to the soles of my shoes
Try to walk in a path of the guiding light 
I thank the Lord for everything when I pray at night
'Cause I can feel His strength, I can feel His power
He's the one I turn to in my darkest hour
Try to be a good man, never called a saint
Never walked on water so I know I ain't
I might swim in the whiskey, 
But I'm bathed in the blood of the Lamb
If you want peace raise your hand
And when Heaven comes, it won't be no drama
And if you see her first say "Hi" to my mama
 
[Chorus - Tim McGraw + Big Kenny until end]
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Somebody's Smilin' On Me
Count your blessings, can't you see?
He's smilin' on you - and smilin' on me</pre>
