[Mike Jones]
Green sticky, as long as it's do-do I ain't picky
If I sold pounds for two fifty, would you fuck with me
I'm sliding down Tidwell, candy blue V-12
I hit the club, with that do-do smell
I'm Mike Jones (Who), Mike Jones-Jones
That's gotta get full blown, before I grab the microphone
Let's get high, raise your lighters to the sky
And let times pass us by, while we chilling getting high (Mike Jones)
I be solo while I'm sipping drank, and blowing (do-do)
I'm from the city where music, and everything is in slow-mo
I'm sliding down Richmond, top and bottom glissening
I got something to say, so please listen

[Hook]

(high-high-high), G-Dash be getting

(high-high-high), and Michael Watts be getting

[Mike Jones]
50/50 click Hollywood, my hood is Studawood
My name blow when I raise hood, I sit on buck and I molest the wood
I come down that Tidwell, with females in a V-12
Fully loaded on Spewells, my crack sell off client tale
I'm Mike Jones from North mayn, color change when I swang lanes
I'm stacking bills got tired of change, I'm stacking bills got tired of change
I don't hot cap so please speak, top and bottom platinum teeth
Girls fall out whenever I speak, straight to the room I'm wrecking tweet
50/50-Mike Jones, go hard in the paint on the microphone
In the Bentley truck holding styrofoam, about to get our shine on
I'm sliding down Richmond, top and bottom glissening
I got something to say, so please listen

[Hook]
