[Too $hort]
Whassup baby?
Damn like that? Can't even speak?
I ain't tryin to fuck, just tryin to holla, say whassup
Let me ask you somethin baby
Is that a wig or a weave?

What you see is what you get
If you don't like it, fuck you bitch
You look good, you hot as shit
But you broke as hell and ain't got no whip
I ain't yo' type, I don't care
Get a light-skinned nigga with long hair
I spoke, you act like you mad at a dude
I don't give a fuck 'bout your bad attitude
It's in me - I'm laced with game
You get a signed autograph with a face to blame
Tear it up later when you hate my guts
Right now, I wanna make you taste my nuts
You hella fine, but I don't wanna keep in touch
All I wanted was to sleep with a slut
I wanna fuck you bitch cause you got the look
A top notch, but you ain't too hot to be shook

[Chorus]
BROKE BITCH~! You can't fuck with me
You can't afford me
BROKE BITCH~! You can't even afford a happy meal from McDonald's
BROKE BITCH~! Five dollars worth of gas
Where you goin, 'cross the street?
BROKE BITCH~!
You just wanna marry a million dollar ballplayer
BROKE BITCH~!

[Too $hort]
You wanna get you a nigga in the NFL
A bsketball player, tall as hell
You might get lucky, marry the champ
But when you walk by they say there's a tramp
Your stock is low, you don't know what happened
Yo' baby daddy is low budget rappin
You wanna do it big, spoil the kid
But you're still at the club out hoein an' shit
You tryin to hit a lick - no doubt
You want diamonds, all you get is dick in your mouth
Bitch, you need to stop and think
You act like a dick is a slot machine
Are you serious? You can't be thinkin clear
It's quicksand bitch you'll sink in here
You wanna be rich better stop that shit
You never hit the jackpot

[Chorus]
BROKE BITCH~! Yeah we tryin to get top notchers
Nobody want your busted ass
BROKE BITCH~! Quit buyin all them knockoff purses and clothes bitch
BROKE BITCH~! Always starin at the ground
You need to hold your head up
BROKE BITCH~! If you had some money you wouldn't be wearin them
raggedy-ass shoes
BROKE BITCH~!

[Too $hort]
There's too many women can't stop a player
I see one I like, I'ma stop and stare
I don't need plans, I'ma take the chance
I don't even have to ask the bitch to dance
I'm a natural, I don't need luck to win
I'm the kind of nigga that'll fuck your friend
And you won't know nothin, every time I see her
On the low we fuckin, I know them buttons
and I hit 'em, most of the time I get 'em
I got a million lines and I spit 'em
When I wanna fuck, who do I like to call
I throw a little party and invite 'em all
They never argue and fight with a brother
And I like when they like each other
I told Polow I'm never gettin married
I don't give a fuck if you was fuckin Sherri!</pre>
