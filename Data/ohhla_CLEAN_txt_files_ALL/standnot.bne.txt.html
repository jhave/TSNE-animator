[Chorus x4]
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way
Beelzebub; Get behind us, behold the Yahweh

[Krayzie Bone]
I'm tryin'to resist all this temptation that I've been facing lately
Constantly praying that I can make it and keep on shakin' Satan
It's drivin' me crazy 'cause he makin' the plate look oh so tasty
Then again, I'm knowin' that it's only Yahweh that can save me
Livin'in this world today It's really gettin harder to stay awakened
But I'm not tryin' to get caught too drowsy 'cause I know we're waitin
Just contemplatin' on my situation
hopin' that my desperation eventually breaks my concentration
But I'm waitin' cause I'm aware that it's a snake in the grass
Can't wait for God to free us" we can scream it at last
Now oh my God, God, God! God of my God, God, God
(Now, oh my God, God, God...) Steady all day

[Chorus x4]
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way
Beelzebub; Get behind us, behold the Yahweh

[Layzie Bone]
As long as the Lord got my back
I won't be afraid of the evils around me when they surround me
I drop to my knees and I pray to the Lord proudly
Probably, these trials and tribulations in front of my face
is a test so I be standin' firm in my faith
Stand not in my way, stand not in my way '
cause I'm a soldier ready for Armageddon, prepared for my day
Make no mistake-stake-stake stake;
These bells above, they never break-break-break
You hear the alarm; We're headed for ruin
This world is so wicked;
Controlled by the superpowers, the Federal Government
They' wagin' these wars for this oil, actin' like they love it
We rise above it 'cause they can't deny the truth
And the truth is to the youth; Better strap on your boots

[Chorus x4]
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way
Beelzebub; Get behind us, behold the Yahweh

[Wish Bone]
Everyday's a replay; We always facin' evil people
Some have them wicked ways, some donate they lives
just to make us not equal
And oh, my Lord I want to make it welcome in your home
but I must demand forgiveness 'cause I done did so wrong
I gotta make a stand in my way, whatever I gotta do
I'll do it; Lord, just show me the way
So I pray, yes for me, and all my peeps in here that don't believe
It's hard to seein' what we see, but you got to
Just let it begin and you will feel that faith inside you
Never alone, always right beside you
Every time something goes wrong
who's the person you call to? Huh, huh? Huh, huh?

[Chorus x4]
Stand not in our way, stand not in our way
Beelzebub; Get behind us, behold the Yahweh
