[Pitbull - Intro]
Drop, They thought he was done dawg
but he's back bigger, better, stronger and free (ha ha ha)
like I ain't fucked my way out of all these motherfuckin' situations
Watch this

[Verse]
Im here to remind you, just in case you forgot
MR 305 no label stay hot
38 choppers, but please no glock
used to move work but had no trap no block no spot
ma was cool with work, but no rocks
until she found my first nickel ruff bag
said I had enough shit to push a dad
so she told me to get the fuck out the pad
i was out to my first baby mama's crib
caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib
thank god for music my saviour
thats what helped me fight Xavier
don't believe these rappers and what they play ya
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa
shit better say it
I am an owner, bitch!

[Avery Storm - Bridge]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
let 'em know now that they gon' remember
they don't know (what I got into)
they don't know (everything I been through)
they don't know (what it takes to get through)
they don't know, they don't know

[Pitbull - Chorus]
My life, pain
struggle, hustle, grind
them boys knock me down
you must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade county raised me right
and we gon' take over this thing
put down my fuckin' life

[Verse]
Lemme come back, I've been here for years
grindin', blood, sweat and tears
I don' gave the game my life
turned the streets from my bitch to my wife
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit
Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls
y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all
young and stay, we realest
i'm on my way to the show
gettin' paid, marvellous rates
you the ace im the spade
cut cut gay, buck buck spray
this ain't a duck duck goose
this duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that

[Avery Storm - Bridge]
I got the city on my back and I won't surrender
let 'em know now that they gon' remember
City on my back and I won't surrender
let 'em know now that they gon' remember
they don't know (what I got into)
they don't know (everything I been through)
they don't know (what it takes to get through)
they don't know, they don't know

[Pitbull - Chorus]
My life, pain
struggle, hustle, grind
them boys knock me down
you must be out yo fuckin' mind
My mom taught me to fight
Dade county raised me right
and we gon' take over this thing
put down my fuckin' life

[Avery Storm - Verse]
Now you can stack the world against me
close the doors, I can't come in
you could bet your life against me
bet your ass I'm gonna win
you take that chance, you roll them dice
i prove you wrong, you prove me right
so damn what they say anywayyyy</pre>
