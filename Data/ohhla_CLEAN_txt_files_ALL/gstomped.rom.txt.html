Typed by: trickshady@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
If you ain't with my team, you can get stomped out
When I get crunk, go and get stomped out
If you hatin on my team, you can get stomped out
GET STOMPED OUT, GET STOMPED OUT
If you ain't with my team, you can get stomped out
When I get crunk, go and get stomped out
If you hatin on my team, you can get stomped out
GET STOMPED OUT, GET STOMPED OUT

[Verse 1]
Ugh, Yea, Now the kid is back
Not Michael Jordan, But I'm coming back
Kinda like Pierce in Boston, the truth is back
Now the Diesel on my team and his name ain't Shaq
Now my team is stacked, I only roll with the best
I'm leading the pack like my name was Garnett
Best believe that I got my back-up
Cassell on the right, Latrell on the left bro
I know dat things gonna heat up
When I watch the suns and heat, I catch a fever
But that don't stop me from jumping up
When Kobe Bryant jams a 36 and dunks
It don't matter, I could cross and shake ya dawg
Like A.I., you can break your ankles dawg
I'm like Shaq, ain't nobody in the game can hold me
The only way is to foul me and throw me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ugh Yea, Let's get it cracking
Like Jason Kidd, I makes it happen
Go to the left, I dunk the ball
Like Vince Carter, I'm half amazing dawg
Get ranged like Detroit, I bend you like Wallace
I'm going to the pros then I'm going to college
Ain't Lebron James but the youngest in the game
and I put it through the net like I from New Jersey
Catch me in Philly with a throwback jersey
I like games with a real good pace
Thats why I'm watching Indiana take on Yao Ming
I'm #1 like Tracy McGrady
My jumpshot deadly, They gotta pay me
I was born to ball, my games so sick
And my jumpoffs like my handle, they so tricky
Yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
