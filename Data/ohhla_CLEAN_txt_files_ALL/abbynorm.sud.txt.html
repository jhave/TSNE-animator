Well Tally ho! Yippy ki-yi-ya! Narf! Zort!
Let's burn the ship and throw the kids overboard
I'm bored (I'm bored) I need something to do
How 'bout we go free all the animals in the zoo
[huh huh that would be cool]
Or we could just sit here and drool
I'm a fool, I dropped out of school at age three
Then I chased my little brother up a tree
Ya see I'm a twisted guy, fly six miles high
Live in a pig sty, refuse to comply
With the safe, plain, cautious way to do things
I found my puppet master and I cut all his strings
And then I wrapped them tight around his throat
Blew a hole in the castle, threw his ass in the moat
Now I'm free [free!] free to reak havoc
Run around foamin' at the mouth like I'm rabid
Bitin' everybody I'm near in the rear
Do you see where I'm comin' from? Somewhere over here
I'm out to have fun, this is how it's done
[dum-ditty-ditty-dum, big, big fun]

Normal is boring, same is mundane
You can't really have fun until you lose your brain
So rip it out through your nose or cut open your head
And you'll be kinda like me [brain dead]
Keep people confused make everybody guess
Forget V.E.G I'm down wit' P.M.S
I go to bed, go insane, then I go into debt
I do the Thorazine Shuffle every chance that I get
That's just a start, just a part of the madness
Can't get a girl I make love to my mattress
That's just it, Dementia Divine
I wanna  go to Minnesota to see the biggest ball of twine
[His brain is cooked] my brain is fried
My I.Q. will raise 30 points when I die
Enough about me I wanna go have fun
Let's stare for hours into the sun
Then we can pick fleas off of each other
Walk through the drive-thru, mumble and stutter
Bet our life savings on a horse on a hunch
Then go out to the graveyard and dig up some lunch

I roll around in my own feces for a while
If someone walks by I just sit there and smile
I put on underwear where it doesn't belong
And have a marathon of all the "Whoomp! There It Is!" songs
That'll keep me busy for a couple of days
I'll take a month off from work and make fish filets
I'll give my dog a shower in Niagara Falls
And put him in the microwave to dry him off
Oops, that didn't quite rhyme, but who cares
Here we go, lions and tigers and bears
Oh my, wonder why? I'm a putz you see
I got None of the Above goin' nuts with me
[deaf , dumb and brain dead- brain dead]
Sit BooBoo, sit, roll over and play dead
Let's all go p lay in traffic a while
Spin around and around till we cough up bile
My body odor floats from coast to coast
'Cause I only take a shower once a month at the most
My underwear's full o' holes, crusty, fermented
