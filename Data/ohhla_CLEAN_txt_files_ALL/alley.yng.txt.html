[Hook]
Nigga, we be alley
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we be alley
My nigga, we alley
Nooooooow

[D-Roc]
Tell a nigga dont act no fool
What's up cuz? Stay cool
Smoke some mary jane, you know the rules
Haters puttin salt in the game
Wanna keep a thug out the drug house
But you know the drill...a fro, polo
And a nigga in the club smokin dubs
Like a tru center thug
The big boy Willie Grill
Smoke swisher sweets, dont miss a beat
If a nigga feelin froggy leap
We ballin, shot-callin
ho's holla'n, try to follow
When a nigga aint ballin, sheesh
Still pullin on the hair
On my ching-ching weigher
(????????????)
Ho we can head to the spot in Decatur
(??) smoke optimos, and try to cop the ho's
(?) cant stop my (?)
Killa a bitch, kill a bitch, soon to buss
Aint to many niggas that can fuck wit' us
Y'all niggas think you can fuck wit' us
Some of y'all niggas gon' miss the bus
See playa we dangerous, stay (???)
Cock-block that fo'-fifth, 
Switch your hands like (??)
Man then kick over to
Nigga cant see me with a birds-eye view
So you betta back up, back up
'fore a nigga straight have to act up, act up
Stand in this thang wit' the mac up, mac up
... 10 then because

[Hook]
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we alley
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we alley
Whoa

[Mr. Ball]
We some alley muh'fuckas from the ATL, Georgia boys
We came to bring the noise, and we got them tonka toys (boom boom boom)
Niggas be bitin like jaws, nigga back the fuck off my balls
If you got some beef wit' me, then I got some beef wit' y'all
Now ooh lawd, them boys on the map again
Who they be? Mr. Ball and them Ying-Yang Twins
And when you down for yours, my nigga, I'm down for mine
Now dont make me have to say this shit one more time
Now back up, I know you dont want some muthafucka to act up
I thank you need to put your muthafuckin ?gack? up
Before you get dealt with
Fuckin around and get yourself hit
Off some fuckin bullshit
Cause we some country-ass Georgia niggas, I told ya nigga
We done and we done showed ya nigga, it's on my nigga
Doin this shit one more 'gain
I thank this time I'ma get a lil' more money to spend

[Hook]
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we be alley
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we be alley
Ah

[moans 'n groans]

[Kaine]
Ah, we some alley muthafuckas, shawty ya didnt know
Niggas is entertainin when they hit the front door
Nigga be like whoa, stop, control
But he was poppin off, so I'ma hit him in his nose
Throwin them 'bows, ColliPark know it explodes
Have a nigga feelin crunchy, smellin like toes
Ya know we had it from Georgia to Cali'
Doin shows from Virginia to that Cakilaki
Ask if are we lackin? Nothin, see we packin
4-5 glocks, .9 spray milli-tec and no actin, I'm blastin
I make my money ?threashin?
The foes see the gold and they dont wanna respect him
Maybe I cant help it, the way that I act
Handle your part thug, give him a heart-attack
Beatin ass in the back, slammin upon a track
Ying-Yang in this thang, ColliPark runnin thangs

[Hook]
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we be alley
My nigga, we alley
Nigga, we be alley

[D-Roc]
Now what's on your mind, if you got something to say
Then say that shit, dont hold that shit
Bitin your tongue, because your boys aint here
Who you roll with, 'cause that's bullshit
You'll get your ass kicked fuckin wit' real thugs
Playahatin you gets no love
Run and get your boys if you thinkin you're hard
If you know like I know, then your ass wont start...
with some crazy muh'fuckas tote gats too
Crazy muthafuckas that'll blast you
Crazy muthafuckas dont give a shit
What? Y'all niggas dont know who y'all fuckin with
We T-H-U-G-G-E-D O-U-T
We'll F-U-C-K yo' ass up with that heat

[Kaine]
Mutha-mutha-muthafuckas always talkin shit
Sixty-five niggas you can suck my dick
We Ying-Yang and it aint no thang
Sheisty muthafucka put it down on they brain
We real, some tru-city thug shit
The essence of a thug, they dont like a nigga in public
With two glocks, I represent 2pac, the block is too hot
They want a fool out the neighborhood (why)
Straight hard to fuck with, know he slangin hard
Niggas is paranoid, all I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
All I know we raw (raw)
We youngin's nigga
