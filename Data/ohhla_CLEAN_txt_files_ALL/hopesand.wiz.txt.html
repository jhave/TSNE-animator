Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Long money, hopes and dreams
Always be around them niggas wit' paper but got your own money
it's yo world, buy this drink for you girl
You said tell the DJ play this song for me
Here's my number case you ever need company
Better weed tons of drink, love the way I dress, let her rub my ink
Hell yeah, I'm fly, that's why they all beneath me

[Chorus]
Got money fall and she make dough
I'm giving her all she can take though
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for
Yeah that's what we came for
Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low, low, low, low, low yeaaah
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Throw it in the air watch that paper fall
Don't know how much I came here with
End of the night, shit, she gonna take it all
See them diamonds in my chain
You ain't gotta know my name
Rushing to the bar, I need another round of drinks
Then it's to my car, puff a pound of dank
Now we in the stars, and I'ma make it rain
Drown the sink

[Chorus]
Got money fall when she make dough
I'm giving her all she can take though
And you know we ball but this ain't no game no
I'm spending it all cause that's what we came for
Yeah that's what we came for

Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low, low, low, low, low yeaah
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go
And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go

[Verse 3]
Pay for your own clothes, fly on your own trips
You a big girl, you buy your own shit
Supply your own smoke, you like your own zip
No leasing yours, you like to own shit
So rich, the one them niggas hate the bitches wanna go with
I'm buying O's like it's Wheel of Fortune
Feelin flawless, living lawless, get

Throwing my money when I see you every time she gets low, low, low
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go
And all them other hoes competing they ain't even coming close, close, close
Foot on the gas when I see you niggas she ready to go, go, go, go

I'm throwing money up and watching her go round and round
Watching her go round and round
I'm throwing money up and watching it come down, come down
They come down, come down
Oh we can go to my house or we can go to your crib
We can jump in your car, you can see how I live
But I'm still throwing money up
So much I'm loosing count and count
So much I'm loosing count and count
Yeah I'm counting about</pre>
