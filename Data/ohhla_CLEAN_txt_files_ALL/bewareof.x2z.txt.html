Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, Stong Arm Steady
One gang, four guns, how the West was won, let's go

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Jump if you really want it (jump)
You'll catch one in yo' stomach (yeah!)
When you see the Steady comin {*blam*}
Y'all better bewaaaaaaare of us
Loudmouths is always talkin (talkin)
When we come they keep on walkin (walkin)
But my dogs ain't only barkin (woof!)
Y'all better bewaaaaaaare of us

[Chorus]

[S.A.S. - Krondon]
I'm eatin chicken wings, mm, it's like chicken feed
Mm, I'm at the feedhouse smokin all this chicken's weed
Huh, you're hardly hard, this sucker's soft as volleyball
Cold Chillin' like my name was +Big Daddy+ +Marley Marl+
You're not a star at all, no, you're just a sidekick, yeh
Runnin the outside lickin shit and ridin dicks
Real niggaz start cliques, start shit we spark clips
The mac'll make your door lift and leave me with a sore wrist
You should be impressed, yeh, it's like my first impression
I pull representer, exposition in a session
I'm in the Expedition, expose a dark dimension
Your girl used to suck dick du-ring detention
You got dumped, she came up by spittin
out nuts of every homey comin home from prison
Yeah the fake chicks get dick the Ferragamo fake fits
I keep they drawers drenched, no drawers, fake tits

[Chorus]

[S.A.S. - Phil Da Agony]
This the last call, total recall, my pimpin flowin like Niagara Falls
So you can Phil Da Agony y'all
Yeah you get beat to the punch, rap monsters eat you for lunch
And feed you to the beat that you want
Fear keep knockin fake fans sent to no one
Fuck them niggaz run from me I don't owe 'em
Why do things for free, you don't know 'em
These niggaz'll load up the heat, they don't throw 'em
Hooks stay floatin in my mind, I design 'em like
architects workin online, I'm on the incline
Lamp like the heavyweight champ, it took 3 months of trainin
While it's rainin take your brain through boot camp
Fair facts, Nike Air Max, I'm back blunted
Yeah that them niggaz hear that and don't want it
Triple trick niggaz get sick to they stomach
Strong Arm Steady ready act like you want it - BITCH!

[Chorus]

[Xzibit]
Every day above ground is a good day
My wordplay only contain what the hood say
Clack the black off a nigga make him see the light
My overhand right'll violate your civil rights
We get bars, big cars, cigars
12 gauge salute to your face to face God
Icon, marathon mack, where the bitches at?
Raise it back, steady game, came with a gang of gats
I hit your pressure points, we jack the motherlode
Expose your motives like a CSI episode
Output maximum level, dig deep down in the dirt
with diligence and dance with the devil, yeah
Cause you don't know me homey, I keep the banger on me
It wasn't my aim, it came with the territory
Feet planted firm in the turf, plant you six feet deep in the earth
Gettin slumped while the ammo dump, fucker

[Chorus]

Bewaaaaaaare of us {*BLAM*}</pre>
