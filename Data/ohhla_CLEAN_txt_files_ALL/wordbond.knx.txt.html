[Intro: Bumpy Knuckles]
Last time I saw HeadQCourterz was at a video shoot 
And...I was pullin off to leave and he said head up eyes and ears open ya nah mean
And then he said word is bond, yo that was like his signature thing ya nah mean
And, everytime he said it you know he always make sure he said he fightin for life
You ask him how he doin he fightin for life
He was a signature dude who was original and he always had his own style
He never changed for nobody you know what I mean
Ummm, I respected him for that you know what I mean
Everybody call me a real nigga, you know what I'm sayin
There's more real niggas than me, he definitely was a real nigga
I miss him, and I love him 

[Verse One: Bumpy Knuckles]
When I die, I want people in the funeral to kiss my face and feel me
Take a whiff of this last breath for real b
Every word about me could never be good
'Cause I fight for survival, I grew up in the hood
Made the subway train my bedroom, but not for long
For just a minute it takes me, to get put on
All I know is righteousness I walk in the path
And light this spliff and the smoke is my trail
I Inhale 'cause to choke is to fail
I'm too smart to be locked down broken in jail
That's where they want me, in the basement, stuck in a cell
Eatin jacked mac, toilet seat cold as hell
I got a african necklace that my sister bought me from the motherland
So I rock it in jewel the brother man
Got me screamin b it's not platinum, it's made of all wood
But the memories devalue weight, it's all good
I'm a hip hop conisuer, street promotion
Got love for the realest rappers, beat devotion
And I walk now through the heavens, arm and arm
Screamin heads up eyes and ears open, word is bond!

[Interlude: Vocals from HeadQCourterz]
Word is bond! Let's take this fuckin shit over man!
Niggas gotta fight man!
Fuck tryin man niggas gotta fight for life goon
That's what the fuck it's about man! It's time to fight man....

[DJ Premier Scratchin]:
My-My-My-My-My nigga HeadQCourterz-"Snoop Dogg"
H-H-H-H-HeadQCourterz rest in peace!!!!-"Bumpy Knuckles"

[Vocals From HeadQCourterz]:
Everybody's ready man, it's on your fuckin word man
What's good man!

[Verse Two: Bumpy Knuckles]
Follow my steps now is somethin you can't do
The essence of die hard b when I left you
Reppin The Bronx, where I borrowed life and gave it back
Truly dedicated to the underrated, people can't believe I made it
'Cause their projection is just projection
Disrespectful to our complexion, I'm my mama's boy
On the ave with a drama toy hopin you don't try me
Recognize when you walk by me
We fightin for life, pass me the henny and dro
I light it and write, my opinion is my own dominion
And if I know my head while your bumpin your shit
Believe it my nigga then It's a hit
'Lot of spit in my click, we tour cities and we set up streets
We comin through, and we bringin the beats
I'm hip hop raw to the core everything about me
What hip hop 'gon do without me?!
I was born in the game, I died in the gaame
I turned into a angel now I fly to the game
I'm a hip hop conisuer, street promotion
Got love for the realest rappers, beat devotion
And I walk through the heavens, arm and arm
Screamin heads up eyes and ears open, word is bond!

[Interlude: Bumpy Knuckles]
He was a signature dude who was original and he always had his own style
He never changed for nobody you know what I mean

[Vocals from HeadQCourterz]:
Do they know how many motherfuckers is out here?!
Starvin, hungry, whether it's, it it's physically or mentally
Or spiritually, you know what I'm sayin?!
Nah they don't because they just be sittin up in them fuckin high rise buildings!
Up in fuckin happy hour you know what I'm sayin
They don't know about the struggle man!

[DJ Premier Scratchin]
My-My-My-My nigga HeadQCourterz-"Snoop Dogg"
HeadQCourterz rest in peace!!!!-"Bumpy Knuckles"

[Verse Three: Bumpy Knuckles]
To my niggas in the streets don't ever give up, we still in a rut
B stop fillin my cup, I left alot to think about now, could never be a fool
Went from homeless in a couple of years, to back to school
'Cause I hustled my ass off, save up every dollar
Sold hoodies in the hood, my act's hard to follow
Holla! If you see me on cloud nine my cup rave
Rewritin the tough days
I turn six shots to six strays, they go into a wall
That leave me there to kick it with y'all
I'm a soldier that will never fall, I'm free from hell
No more felony stripes, three from jail
Don't cry shed no tears, I'm still here
To oversee all my dogs so be clear
I'm a hip hop conisuer, street promotion
Got love for the realest rappers, beat devotion
And I walk through heaven, arm and arm
Screamin heads up eyes and ears open, word is bond!

[Outro: Vocals from HeadQCourterz]
I got Panch and them on the third! I got Smile! Mel!
All my niggas man! You already fuckin know!!!
WORD IS BOND SON!!!
