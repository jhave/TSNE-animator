[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Sports coupe spoiler
Sipping on a bottled water
Dead serious like the fourth quarter
Niggas can't get the shit, it's on back order
Holla at the waiting list, I'm already sporting 'em
Bout to give away the shits, can't get bored of the money spending
High performance exhaust system
Straight bossing, more than often
Nigga I'm always getting it, straight Jet living
I got all my cars, all my weed, all my women
Valeting exotics at mafia style dinners
Ducking pictures as we toast to getting richer
It was all planned out for us to stand out
The have-nots have it all, without accepting handouts, dog
Twisting the top off the big jar
Higher than a...

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Niggas out they rabid ass mind
Thinking I ain't gon' try to get as much money as I can make this year
You must be on some hardcore drugs
I'm just flipping through magazines and rolling them Raws up
My red cup filled up with gin
That's my gang and they destined to win
In this thing and you better spend
Give good brain, you should let her in
Leave your cigars, joints already rolled, I got
Weed in the jar, told you that my life's the shit
And you're gon' love it
In the morn' look at a Polaroid of it
Wake up feeling way better than you ever did
With the nigga that you was with
And now you got the nigga all upset because of it
Would call my phone but he know that I don't play that
Send some real niggas where he stay at
Made it quite clear, take ya lips put 'em right here</pre>
