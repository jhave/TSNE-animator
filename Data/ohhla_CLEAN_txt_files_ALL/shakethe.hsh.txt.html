[Verse 1]
I'm the next new kid not on the block
But I will knock your block off quick not with a glock
But 2 guns and knuckles that bring pain
It's a shame you couldn't spit venom on my name
Is it worth all the fame and money it's no joke
I done came from nothing to something it's so funny
How you could just start at the bottom so hot
Til they see you at spot when you got no product
And the crowds do flock to see you
And the shot you got and it's hot to be you
And shocked to see through all the squat they feed you
You did not squeeze through in a plot they need you
The dude calling shots at the top could be you
unless you get got and the rest it rings true
It's just the beginning of pain and my glory
Starts when I finish the end of this story

[Chorus]
Shake The Ground (Everybody move to the sound! GET UP!)
We Put 'em Down, Put 'em Down Put 'em Down now
Shake The Ground (Everybody move to the sound! GET UP!)
We Put 'em Down, Put 'em Down Put 'em Down now

We Put 'em Down, Put 'em Down Put 'em Down now
We Put 'em Down, UH!

[Verse 2]
See I float like a butterfly
You could fly like a bee with a sting but could never fight me
Call it Bulletproof
Teflon with a voice and track that hard just to put it through
Cause it's a banger comin' in showin' the middle finger
Once I begin to flow you'll know anger
1 dagger sharp with the tongue I walk with a swagger
You seem to stagger
1 slip of the jaw and Hush I'm Quick Draw McGraw
Cause me I see all see y'all fallout
Ballout on the streets and seize all
And beef I breath for
Try me lyrically I'll bully and squeeze off 'til fully
See y'all I'll risk it
When your dogs to limp for bizkits call for this shit

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm here, you've been waiting for me
you've been waiting to see, now that I'm here I'll be
Right on the top of things, no you don't want it now
Cause we be poppin' thangs, no you don't want it
I said no you don't want it now

[Verse 3]
When I'm to hot you're lovin' it
When I'm not you're just not into the plot with no slug in it
Just not shot with a glock or Tupac in it
Must not be in a squad with no thug in it
Cause I'm a breakthrough where I take you
Now I will shake you up like a quake and make it so painful
Pistols ain't playful it's the way crews act they erase you
If I'm to face you I'll replace you quick
When I spit shit that's so graceful Ma$e will embrace you
So you better pray Jesus sways your way just to save you
Me I will never die
But I will live on in any song long as forever I
live for the agony and defeat whatever it is I meet with no tragedy
