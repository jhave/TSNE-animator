[Chorus]
Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh (Here comes the Hammer!)
Uh-oh, uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh (Here comes the Hammer!)

[MC Hammer]
Yes, this is a mission, that I'm on
Takin out the weak on the microphone
I'm hype -- so don't talk
about the hard hittin Hammer, when you can't even walk
on the STAGE -- after me
And if you do, yo, a catastrophe
happens -- just like that
I rock 'em all from white to black
OH, OH, OH - BUST IT!

[Chorus]

[Dance interlude]
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo
Hoooo, hoooo, hoooo

[MC Hammer]
"Naw, NAW!" -- is what I said
when I came to see a show
I looked and it was dead, DEAD!! -- y'know!
Like a body in the ground, will your show ever grow?
Let me know -- if not
then close yo' mouth because you sho' ain't hot
It needs WORK! -- like a car in a wreck
They call me Hammer, you gotta earn my respect
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

[Chorus w/ dance interlude]

[MC Hammer]
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)

BUST IT! - I don't hesitate -- or wait
Before the bell rings, I'm out the gate
and rollin, out for mine
Workin so hard for such a long time
In life, it's here and gone
So (PEDAL TO THE HAMMER) while I'm watchin the throne
Not a king, just feelin hype
You dance to the music while I'm on the mic
OH, OH, OH - Here we go!

[Chorus w/ dance interlude]

[MC Hammer]
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
C'mon, let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)

BUST IT! - A minute or two, now I'm rollin
A whole new style that the people are holdin
ON -- TO
I move, I groove, I rap, you're through
You're so plain -- just plain
Your ego so big, that you missed the whole train
a-GAIN, my friend
The people wanted more, that's why the Hammer's in
OH, OH, OH - Yeah!

[Chorus w/ dance interlude]

[MC Hammer]
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
C'mon, let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)

Check me out.. 
MOVE on the floor, and get hype
You came to get wit it and this is your night
YEAH! - Let 'em know
The cool, the hard, the fly (HOOOOOO!)
We're in here! - and it's pumpin
Hammer's in the speaker and you know the bass is bumpin
LOUD!! -- and low
It's about that time so here we go
OH, OH, OH - BUST IT!

[Chorus w/ dance interlude]

[MC Hammer]
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Yeah! Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
Let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
C'mon, let's make it SMOOOOOOOTH... (RUH!!)
BUST IT!</pre>
