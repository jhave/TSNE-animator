[2PAC]
Back to get wrecked
All respect to those who break they neck to keep they hoes in check
Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I dont know why, your girl keeps pagin me
To tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady, take it easy
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I dont want it if its that easy
Hey, yo, bust it, baby got a problem sayin bye-bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, dont matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybodys lookin for the, ladder
And aint no need in bein greedy, you wanna see me
Dial that beeper number, baby, when you need me
And Ill be there in a, jiffy
Dont be picky, just be happy with this, quickie
When will you learn, you cant tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I Get Around

Chorus:

I Get Around
2Pacalypse Now dont stop for hoes
I Get Around

[2PAC]

--Why aint I call you, please-- 
Fingertips on the hips as I tip, gotta get a tight grip
Dont slip, loose lips sank ships
Its a trip, I love it when she licks her lips, see me jockin
Put a little twist in her hips, cause Im watchin
Conversations on the phone till the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethins on your mind, let it off
You dont know me, you just met me, you wont let me
Well if I couldnt have it, silly rabbit, why you sweat me?
Its a lot a real Gs doin time
Cause a groupie bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby if your too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town, break out, or be clowned
Baby doll, are you down? I Get Around

Chorus:

I Get Around
The Underground just dont stop for hoes
I Get Around
Still down with the Underground
I Get Around

--Hey, yo Shock, let them hoes know--

[Shock G]

Now you can see from my everyday fits, I aint rich
So cease and assist with them tricks
Im just another black man, caught up in the mix
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Just cause Im a freak, dont mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you dont recognize me
Im Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me
I Get Around

[2PAC]

Round and round, the town we go
But the Underground just dont stop for hoes
What do you know, another young bro makin dough
But the po-po wont let me go
Tryin to do my show, but other young bros wanna throw
Time to hit the door, grab a hoe
Dont forget my dough, and if the promo say no
Let him meet my 4-4, Im from the O
And yo, I Get Around

[Chorus]
