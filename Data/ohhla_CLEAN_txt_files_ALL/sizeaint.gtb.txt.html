[Intro]
Yo Bushwick
What do you do when motherfuckers underestimate your size man?

[Bushwick Bill]
First of all I laugh! (Then what?)
Smack their ass like a God damn car crash
So if you wanna try your luck
C'MON~! Play pussy, get FUCKED!
Asshole speak, you get beat
You're a bad motherfucker if you dare to compete
Cause Diana Ross'll be comin out your ass fool
... and have you singin the blues
Tall lil' figure by the pound, let's go a round
I'ma take ya, shake ya, and break you down
And if you kick, I'ma pick up a stick
And beat your ass to the size of your dick
and that's small! And you think you're mackin
While you lackin, Bushwick is packin
I'll show your girl how a real man feels
Large things come in very small packages
And while you're gettin on your knees to fuck
A nigga like me's still standin up
Any bitch, will tell ya
As long as he has a big dick, size ain't shit!

[Interlude]
Yo Bushwick Bill man, show these hoe-ass motherfuckers out here in the game man
That you're too short to take a motherfuckin short
And DJ Ready Red got your motherfuckin back

[Bushwick Bill]
Liftin weights'll make you bigger
But lift me you'll be a dead ass nigga
You wanna squabble cause you think you're tougher?
{*gunfire*} Squabble that motherfucker!
Those are called bullets, they got 'em in every state
To keep niggaz like you in place
And since I'm a trigger happy nigga
Look for your place to be in a
cemetery, you God damn sucker
Lyin next to another bad motherfucker
Reputation ain't shit cause see
what you done did in the past don't excite me
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
You can't have it, na na-na na na
Any motherfucker wanna get with Bushwick
Bring it on cause your size ain't shit!

{*scratched: "cause I'm too short to take shorts"*}
{*scratched: "Bushwick Bill"*}

[Bushwick Bill]
I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
The penitentiary became my residence
It wasn't nothin for me to disfigure
you lil' nickel and dime ass niggaz
Shank a motherfucker in a minute!
And I knew my Mexican homeboys was with it
I didn't give a fuck about a pardon
the shit I was startin or the God damn warden
Take a motherfucker like you
And without remorse this is what I'll do
Punk you out and make you be my bitch
and let a nig get shit on his dick for one cigarette
Ain't harder than my dick and you're talkin shit
Carry on motherfucker
Before the state convict me of assault
or somethin hyper; and I end up right back at Riker's
Like a sniper I'm scopin you out
You won't even know when I'm takin your ass out
I'm equipped and vicious, toleratin no misses
Rougher than your lips when it comes to bitchin
Bitch, yeah I'm talkin to you
Some of you niggaz are bitches too!
You gotta be crazy as hell to try to buck up
or one bold motherfucker cause your size ain't SHIT!

{*scratched: "Yo Bushwick Bill"*}
{*scratched: "Come with it man, no future in frontin"*}

[Bushwick Bill]
Some stupid motherfucker said he had an advantange
Fuck my size! You wanna do damage?
Contestant number one, c'mon down!
You're the next motherfucker I'ma clown
So don't get excited like your bid is fair
Cause you ain't winnin shit but a root canal
When I throw a motherfuckin right cross
and bust you dead in your God damn mouth!
Now where's the hype comin from?
Don't make me use this God damn gun
cause I'll give your ass hell and charge you rent
Fuck you up like a God damn accident!
Innocent is how I look
Cause a nigga this size ain't supposed to cook
You took me for a sucker that day
So bitch you find out the hard way
SIZE AIN'T SHIT!
