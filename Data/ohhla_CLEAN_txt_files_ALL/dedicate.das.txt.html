Intro/Chorus:

Dedicated dedicated to all the niggas gettin high
Dedicated dedicated to all the bitches actin fly
Dedicated dedicated to all the niggas runnin game
Dedicated dedicated to all the chicks that do the same

Verse 1: Dray, Skoob

Yo
Well if the honeys think I'm stuck up, I tell em "Shut the fuck up"
and you can get'cha man, I bet a grand he gettin broke up
So whatta you wanna fuck around and get silly
Really? We're on the road again just like Willie
Nelson, so what the hell son, no bore ya
Anoy ya when I spill the beans like lawyer
I saw ya, tried to pick my style, hit the balls
I guess you must be ready to die like Biggie Smalls

Diggity good heavens, it all started in the projects like the Evans
but fuck the Good Times, we packin weapons
Want the fortune and the fame kid, you know the name kid, style reign
Puttin MC's thru style change
And if you want me then you got to come get me
I'm strictly fuckin niggas up like 1-50-
1, two rum shots chased precise
Two gun shots but it's sheisty, they wanna ice
Thinkin I might beat the hurt, I'm not him
And I'ma get paid and fool like Rakim

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2: Dray, Skoob

Well here I come, word, yo this be my third release
I never let the honeys and the moneys get me geese, peace
to the crews payin dues in the background
How my rap sound? Yo Boogie Banger bring it back now

Niggas with the runnin mile, your time's runnin out
I make it happen, niggas slackin, son they dumbin out
Actin fly, jack passed me by
Mmmah - you can kiss that black ass goodbye

No lie, see I fry your crew til they sizzle
Fizzle, you know the sewer style is unbizzle
Bull take a pull, lift your floor money pack
Backs before I put a whoopin on that ass

Ya not get the bones, split the el, stuff it well
Niggas bullshittin wonder how the fuck it sell
Now dig it, me and my man we came wit it
We snuffin motherfuckers out the way and like Riddick
Admit it, I'm right to rough so tighten up
I'm audi for them niggas actin rowdy, lightin blunts, what?

Chorus (x4)

To all the niggas gettin high
Dedicated to all the bitches actin fly
Dedicated to all the niggas runnin game
Dedicated to all the chicks that do the same
Dedicated to all the niggas gettin high
To all the bitches actin fly
Dedicated to all the niggas who on the game kid
Dedicated to all the chicks that do the same
