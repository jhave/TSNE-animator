Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Horace Andy]
There is a man that live next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down...

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
We'll find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans they fall
Bang against my wall
Bang against my wall
No rest at all

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
We'll find a quiet place</pre>
