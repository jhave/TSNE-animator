[Soopafly]
Ha, Ha, Ha baby what's yo name, what yo number
What's them diches, shake it bitch
Now what is it that you want from Soopafly
Recoginiz, I let you kick it
You let me stick it, then I ric it
Say you law fit, toss it, its gone
I don't like to talk on the phone
And maybe tap, get an job
Bitch I rap, you keeping talking shit
You would be the same bitch i slap
What about nine inches of emphasis, on it
Hoe said I was dog, well dog on it
Shit, let me stick my grand territory
Bitch tried to flip the story, my glory
I told her no money involved, problem solved
No more talking about it
Now you can shout it out loud if you want bitch
Soopafly is still going to remain one
About the fact, you aint getting jack shit form me
Talking about this other nigga gave you an g
Ooh wee, it aint me, it an I
You aint green and you damn shore you can't get me high
Bitch, why the fuck do think they call me Soopafly
If I ride duce yo ass, im like wind in the sky
Traveling, yea see you in traffic or not
Thinking im giving up plastic im not
You got your nerve, you wanted to buy her an ring
Called her on the phone, there you go you got your ring
Told the hoe she can go on and do your thang
Hit the streets why you at it bitch buy me an chain
Flip the game, like im fliping an bird
What's the word, leave them flush, while im rollin pimp out plus

[Soopafly and Snoop Dogg Hook]

And snoop to get them swoop
Bitches out there be on dat whoopty woop
They want soopa to get them fly, ya'll
And snoop to get them swoop

[Snoop Dogg]
Bitches, all over the place
An big fat bitch with an real cute face
She said she never left delaware before
I tell a nigga like a doggy and came along and come bust this ho
Fa sho, im layin low with my negro Hershey Loco
Smokin on some orange mix with choco
Latte, la gatta, hoes dessert, dick for dessert
Yea the truth hurts, we flirt with yo skirt from the sky to the dirt
See, bitches love niggaz puttin it in work
No R and B shirts, we too g for that
Blue Khaki suits, with braids pulled to the back
Like that fo realer, cold killer
I need beef from the swat meat to get some scriller
I filler, nigga got to the get his cheddar
If you let her, spread her, man you stay the header
And that's when you grow on, I go on, and flow on
And see you ho on, an ho stroll, from my bank roll
Im way to cold, to keep it pimpin is to control an bitches soul
And once you get it, you out of control
I won't stop pimpin intill im ninety years old, it won't fold fa no hoe
Cause yall know the rules, the mayor of this here
Plus the the playa of this year
For esso, yes ho, fresh yo, boss hog, top dog right here on the westcoast
Oh yea, peace to my eastside click
And fuck an gold digging, rat head, nappy headed bitch
