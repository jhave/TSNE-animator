[Dina] Yeaaah, hahahaha... whooooo, shit! Mmmmm.. {*harmonizing*}
[Em]  (aight)
[Em]  Guess what?  I ain't coming in yet...
	  I'll come in a minute
[Em]  Aiyyo; this is my love song, it goes like this

[Eminem]
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to, mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my pre-diction is you're gon' probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every-thing's spinnin, you're beginnin to think women 
are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
{*spaceman voice*} Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Look at the life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so

[Chorus: Eminem] + (Dina Rae)
Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa-ohh!)
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve (Whoa-ohh!)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa-ohh!)
These drugs really got ahold of me (Whoa-ohh!)
Cause every time I try to tell them, "No" (No-ohh!)
They won't let me ever let them go (Go-ohh!)
I'ma sucka all I gotta say (Whoa-ohh!)
is drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa-ohh!)

[Eminem]
In third grade, all I used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubix Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy's, got me standin next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the mornin like "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I have stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later
But fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm goin to try to find some more

Chorus

[Eminem]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna want to do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mari-ju-uana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cause none of this shit is gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin
Even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lot of growin up to do
I still got a whole lot of throwin up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysiting for Hailey while Hailey's out gettin smashed

Chorus 2X

Drugs really got a hold of me
They really got a hold of me
Cause drugs really got ah old of me
They really got a hold of me</pre>
