Song:   Wants vs. Needs
Typed by: outkast137@hotmail.com

*CHORUS*
Forgetting the things you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
<repeat>

*ABSTRACT RUDE*
You want wine
And need water
These rhymes we offer
The kind of authors
To knock ya' out of ignorance
End of the innocence
Begin to the finishing
With the men significant
Welfare recipients
Tragic
Addicts with a bad habit
Somebody's baby's momma
At the Carter
In the new jack city
Oh what a pity
This again locked up
For soliciting
Oldest profession
The men buy
So it's selling
You want pork
Need veggies
For your bone support
Be ready for armageddi
Hold the fort down
Go through the court trial
Get acquitted
Be committed
To the sacrifice
It's a lotta pie
Ab get a slice

*CHORUS*
And tell me how bad you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me mow much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

*MIKAH 9*
Right about now
A nigga Drunk
Been smoking
Some ole janky
Rolled stress blunts
I want skunk
I really want my baby momma cunt
She kick it with punks
When I know a family man
What she want
Bitch made niggas
On the rag
Every month
I should just punt fools
Like footballs
My goals to make you look
Yo I could call some stunts
&gt;From porno industries
Or get some from
In the streets
Shady heat
That's meant for me
But what I want
And what I need
Should be about me
And my seeds
Cause sometimes
I have flashbacks
Of chopping crack
And weed
Moving X and LSD
Having sex
With more than 3
Busting checks
For 50 gees
Cashing checks
And pushing keys
Vexed and connects
With the greed
I process
Take the rolex off your wrist
Take the roladex off your desk
But in the long run
I'm a strong son
Those klepto days done
My life reflects
Universal
Cause and effect
In every action
I'm sorry my karma
Ran over your dogma
Loved one
Don't be upset
We can still pop a bottle
Then we can get lit up and wet
The common ground
Is the love
We all express
Whoever got a problem
With that
Deserves what they get!

*CHORUS*
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need
And tell me how bad do you want it
And tell me how much of it's greed
Forgetting the things that you want
Versus getting the things that you need

*ACEYALONE*
Man
I want money
I need food
I want clothes
I need housing
I want cars
I need good health
I need knowledge of self
I got knowledge of self
I want peace
But I need help
I want to do right
But I need the mic
I want wings
But they gave me a bike
I need light
I want the blacks to know
They need the facts
I want a Cadillac
But I need tracks
To make stacks
I want a million in the bank
And a pound of dank
But I need to think
Cause I could sink
And get caught up
In the funk stank
I want to pull rank
But I need to be a saint
And so I need a prayer
And after that
I need a drink
Cause I want to be
Wanted need
To be needed
But I want to stay
blunted
And need to be
weeded
For my own goodness sake
I want to escape
But I need to set you straight
So tell me how bad do you want it
Punk
And tell me
How much of it's greed
Versus
Getting the things that you want
Pumpkin
Or getting the things that you need
Sucker
