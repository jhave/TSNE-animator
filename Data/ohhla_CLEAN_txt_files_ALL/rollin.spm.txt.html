[Verse 1: Shadow Ramirez]
You got g's maan please
I'm overseas
I got the beats to keep you blowin on trees
Keep them hoes on they knees
I'm as cold as Mr. Freeze
Makin music in this game
Like flippin coke into ki's
Everyday is the same when I'm rollin on chop
Got a cop on my left so I'm ridin non-stop
Till I die
I'ma win 
See it's time to make ends
Thinkin bout how I'ma make it so I'm sittin on rims
20 inches on chop
Hit the scene on the lean
Burban clean
6 screens
Biscuit tucked at the seams
Make my dreams so real
Plot to make a mil
Let these hatas know the way a playa really fells
When I'm rollin 
SHIT!!!
I'm never gonna quit
Bout to hit the switch
So I can dip on the strip
Pull in sideways than I cock it on 3
Everybody stop and stare cause they all wanna see how we

[Chorus: Shadow Ramirez and SPM]
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop
[SPM]
17 in a 7 7 Seville
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop

[Verse 2: Grimm and SPM]
Left 
Right
Than front to back
Fresh off the lot in my Cadillac
[SPM]
Done hit this spot Grimm
Where we goin next?
[Grimm]
Let's flip to the club and try to find some sex
See when I'm rollin in my ride
With my homie on my side
Got 2 sweets rolled 
And I'm bout to touch the sky
High so high
Like my boy Carlos Coy
[SPM]
Maan!
[Grimm]
I'ma Dope House soulja that's self employed
[SPM]
Ya saves quien soy
More chips than Ahoy
Dime lo que quieras
De le doy
In a 100.000 dolla toy
En tontes ya me voy
Take the pain with the joy 
While I bang Pink Floyd
Ship em out the box
Sip Henn on the rocks
I bought 2 clubs and 3 restaurants
My Cadillac hops
I'm strong as an ox
I'ma fly by
And chunk deuce at the cop
Cause I'm

[Chorus: Shadow Ramirez and SPM]
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop
[SPM]
Cruisin down the street in my Benzo
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop
[SPM]
Swangin and bangin that DJ Screw

[Verse 3: Lil Bing]
I'm rollin non stop
I done wrecked  the block
Chop chop
Bunny hop
Trunks pop
Tops drop
Got buys by the fly
Got rocks in my watch
I'm sideways on mine
Finna hit the Mariot
I done dodged the cops
I broke em off by the lot
Glock 17 shots
When I punch in the clock
Switchin lanes on the main
Crunk the bang when I feel
Wood grain wood strips
Bezatines smokin dip
On the interstate
As I hit the pancake
Sippin on the 8
Straight as I break my scrape plate
Keep my ride up to date
Flippin 20's when I say
"It's that throwed ese on the grind movin weight"
Pull out the shades
Shinin down my blades
Today's a sunny day
And there's money to be made
It's that 7 1 trey
Pullin out the Escalade
Creased up with them dames
And a bald fade

[Chorus: Shadow Ramirez and SPM]
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop
[SPM]
17 in a 7 7 Seville
[Shadow]
I'm rollin
Rollin on chop
I'm bout to drop the top
I'm fresh off the lot
I'm rollin 
Rollin on chop
