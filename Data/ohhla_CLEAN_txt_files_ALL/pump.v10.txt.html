I was raised in the hood called what the dif? what the..
The brothers in the hood be Chivalrous 
So i rest defense on my ligaments 
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it 
Full life living it, never giving it back 
Too late for slipping, so slack...up 
On my lap its on your lips so track shot 
A steel dick more clip for pump but 
All im saying there aint no question who the man is 
In my civic or in this showbiz 
I shit a fool, kill the fool 
Come on what you say? 
i think i can take care of all you muthafuckaz don't delay right away 

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times, right? 
Cause tricks be out for your blind side 
Never understood it, but remember i showed you 
That in the nineties you gotta look over your shoulder, strap 
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin high 
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by 
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals 
If you ain't got none, bitch, I got a million styles!
Whose around me?
Are we getting along? we family, we better be 
We got your back, we got your back kid
Just dont be pointing one of them guns, aiight man...

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!

Rhymin' iz a sinch, sonavabitch, I'm rich!
But that don't mean you can get me, cuz all my peoplez is pimps!
Playaz, hustlaz, pimpz, all been through the filter...
I hang wit' my doggz man, fuck a gorilla
Iller, coddaba, hilla, bings...
Show me have a enough steam, to blow me up, run up, what up, shutup!
A trick get the buck-shotz
Your daughter get the luv, a lot, yer outtie, at the cemetary...
Man, she loves me, and not a single solitary, witness, to the party
And if you didn't know, should've asked somebody...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times!!!

Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times...
Fools be jackin' other fools, but they ain't be jackin mine!
