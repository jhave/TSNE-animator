(Tupac) They say

[Intro/Chorus]
(B-Legit)       Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
(C-Bo)          Where I can pile up my chips
(Richie Rich)   And niggaz call me a timer
(Tupac)         I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
(E-40)          Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin

(Tupac) That's right, that's right boy start that shit off

[Verse One: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Picutes of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason 
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin, too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after a night of fuckin around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: C-Bo, B-Legit]
I got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find

Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
That's while I keeps on grindin (that's right)
to the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin

[Chorus]

(Tupac) C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
(E-40) Da Bay, beitch!

[Verse Three: E-40, Richie Rich]
Down the steps  
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggaz
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin-ass niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him

Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

(Tupac) Hell nah we ain't hard to find
(C-Bo) The whole clickilation fool
(E-40) Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch

(Tupac)
Why them niggaz actin like they can't find us
like like they can't see us and
like we don't be at the same spots they be at
        It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
(C-Bo) Nigga be lookin all the way when he see you and shit
        It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
(E-40) Motherfuckers better understand this shit
(Tupac)
Ay D-Shot nigga can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up?
        Hey, we smokin, and we ain't hard to fine
Drinkin and shit, fuckin with some hurricane
(E-40) A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboros regardless playa
(Tupac) You suPPOSED to
        Sideways to the next light...</pre>
