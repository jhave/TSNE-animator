Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm here to catch you when you fall
I'm here to answer when you call
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon
I got the strength and the nerve
Here to protect you and to serve
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon

I'm your hero, hero, defender, protector for you
For you, for you!
I'm your hero, hero, defender, protector for you
For you, for you!

I'll be your superman in bed [laughs]
Yeah you heard just what I said
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon
I'll stop a train for ya (for ya)
I'll catch a plane for ya (for ya)
Sugah don't ever doubt it (no if's, and's, or but's about it)
In the morning, in the evening, baby even in the afternoon

Cause I'm your hero, hero, defender, protector for you
For you, for you!
I'm your hero, hero, defender, protector for you
For you, for you!

Oh! From the heights of the sky (sky), to the depths in the sea (sea)
I'm your guy (no question)
I'm your guy (you're the world to me), yeah
No mask, no suit, no cape, no weapon, no group
Got the power of love, baby give me a try!

I'm your hero (yeah), hero (yeah), defender (yeah), protector for you, for you
For you, for you!
I'm your hero, hero, defender, protector for you
For you, for you!

Yeah, yeah... yeah
No question
You're the world to me
No suit
No weapon, no group</pre>
