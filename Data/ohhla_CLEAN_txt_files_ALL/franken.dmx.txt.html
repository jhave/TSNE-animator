[Intro]
ARF, ARF, ARF, ARF (AIYYO!)

[DMX]
Started off in the dog cause a child'll play with it
Started off with the fog, I was wild, I stay with it
Now I got a dark side, they call it a monster
Cause it comes out when it wants ta
If you knew half of what I did the nightmares would haunt ya
And nigga I'ma get ya, I warned ya
AHHH! Run up on ya like I own ya life
Whether it's wrong or right it's on tonight!

[Chorus 2X: DMX]
WE GON' TEAR SHIT UP! (What!) TEAR SHIT UP! (What!)
TEAR SHIT UP! (What!) GET IT!
WE GON' TEAR SHIT UP! (What!) TEAR SHIT UP! (What!)
TEAR SHIT UP! LET'S GO!

[DMX]
Aiyyo Cavi' this joint is bananas
It made for niggaz with bandannas to cock and pop hammers
Niggaz'll gang bang, pull out and bang bang
Wipe it off, break it down, get rid of the thang thang
We gets it in from the club to the hood
And after a few drinks, up to no good
It's not a fuckin game, make sure it's understood
Forget and your man'll be knockin on wood

[Chorus]

[DMX]
We walk these dogs like we got leashes on 'em
Before your mans is wrapped the police is on 'em
Got him laid up in a casket and the priest is on 'em
Y'all bitch niggaz go down when the streets is on 'em
I be talkin to them, just be bumpin old men
Give a FUCK if you on one, I'm on ten
And if we got a problem I'ma let you know then
And I'm gon' win, cause I go in!

[Chorus]
