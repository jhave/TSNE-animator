[Intro]
This is how monsters function

Leave me alone
I ain't fucking with nobody

[Verse]
Keep fucking with me you going turn me back to Boo Boo
Have me casing out your crib, trying to pop your fucking noodles
She was 20, I was 12, man my Nana said she raped me
I just smiled from ear to ear, saying take me baby, take me
Since high school, nigga I ain't got no friends
Got two 3-80s like the Ying Yang Twins, Ahh
That's spot clicking till the Ds run in
Then it's bail money and lawyer fees, you got to have ends
Freshman year I had that CBR Hurricane
In a ill Herringbone I got them swinging Heroine
I shoot a nigga in a heartbeat I ain't no chump
Then you can run Forrest run, retard when I dump
They take kindness for weakness, niggas don't respect that
So me I'm where that Reuger, that Pump and that Tech at
Some look at me I'm on now, I thought we was rich then
Shipment, but you had like, twenty bricks in Richmond
We was in Cocaine heaven, I was fishscale dreaming
We just got in the town, we was strapped up scheming
First Country caught a body, then Country caught a body then
I popped a couple niggas then Country shot everybody
It's cold blooded, it's real shit you got to love it
Tre-Eight Snub it, and don't think nothing of it
It's the way of the wolves, it's how they train us to move
Get it popping when we shopping niggas hold down the tools

[Chorus]
I seen niggaz getting rich
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I was tired of not having shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
I seen niggaz getting hit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
We was slinging that shit
Then days went by, then days went by, then days went by
Here I am

[Verse] 
Unsure since we was little niggas, son since we were seven
Armed robbery, first degree, my man did seven
Niggas popped his whip up, hit his Camry with a seven
He a lucky muhfucker I bet he make it to heaven
My Grandpa drunk, my uncle Rock drunk
My uncle Champ pump crack, smoked my fucking stash up
I had 250 grams stashed on the porch
I mean, how much you going to smoke, man? how much you going to snort?
First the VCR went, then the TV went
He stole out of mommy purse, she thought it was me, kid
I ain't ask her for no money son cause I was out hustling
She was looking at me sideways like I'm a thief or something
That hurt me, come on son that wouldn't hurt you?
I pistol whip that nigga till his face was purple
I need anger management, see I hold on to a grudge
The same way I hold on to that nickel-plate Snub

[Bridge]
The Lord don't have imperfections baby
So I think I'm perfect the way he made me
Some say I'm cool, some say I'm crazy
Some say I ain't shit, some say I'm amazing

[Chorus]</pre>
