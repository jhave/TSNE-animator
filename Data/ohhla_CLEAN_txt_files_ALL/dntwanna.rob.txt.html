Song:   Don't Wanna Fall In Love
Typed by: Wammy Giveaway

Chorus: Eric Bellinger
I
Don't wanna fall in love
Cause everytime I give myself
She gives herself to someone else, that's why I say
I
Don't wanna fall in love
Cause everytime I fall
I learn that love don't love nobody
At all

[Lil' Rob]
(Verse 1)
I don't wanna fall in love no more, that word is for the birds
How else can I say it, hmm, that word is to the curb
Absurd, overrated, and I hate it, don't want it
Don't need it, won't happen, believe it, I seen it
And I've heard it
Just when I thought that everything was perfect
She with my best friend getting perverted
Like I deserved it
I started cursin', turning into a different person
Had to evaluate the situation
And not let it worsen
At least that's my version
I'm the one who got the hurtin'
That's for certain, now it's curtains and I'll never love the same way twice
Cause it ain't nothin' nice, and never ends up right
I feel sorry for all those who are in life

Refrain: Lil' Rob
I know you say you love me
But baby, no you don't
I know you think you do now
But later on, you won't
You'll find another guy
That's when you'll cheat and lie
And then you'll say goodbye
And that's the reason why

Repeat Chorus

[Eric Bellinger]
At all
At all
I learned that love don't love nobody
At all

[Verse 2: Lil' Rob]
She loves me, she loves me not, well, love is somethin' I ain't got
I'm about to hit the block and have that stupid cupid shot {*cartoon gun shot*}
Hey
He shot me first
And it was cool at first, until she found that other guy
And then, it hurt
What the heck is that about, I regret the day I asked her out
Gotta make a brand new plan cause this one isn't pannin' out
If love is in my path, then I'm a have to take a different route
Cause all this heartache and sorrow, I could really do without

Repeat Refrain

I learned that love don't love nobody
At all

I learned that love don't love nobody

I learned that love don't love nobody
