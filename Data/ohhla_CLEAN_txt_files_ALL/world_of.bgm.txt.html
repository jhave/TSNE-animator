Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
Some doin good and others doin evil

I heard somebody say I'll do anything nowaday to make a buck
Cos niggas are dyin and nobody gives a muthafuck
And you be wantin to trip when I be talkin about murder and thangs
I think it's obvious that you ain't never heard of mine
What goes on in the neighborhood
East coast, West coast, ain't shit turnin out good
Sometimes I wanna cry
And straight put the 9 to my muthafuckin dome and let the bullets fly
But mama said I'm too strong to break down
And I'm caught up in another drug shake-down
Cos they think I'm sellin birds
But i'm workin 9 to 5 and still ain't gettin what I deserve
So who's fuckin who
Is it that white man or the black man standin next to you
See, most blacks can't handle power
Get paid and get to changin by the hour
Closin all the doors
Got a little paper, now they wanna treat they people like hoes
Now after takin a look at that
How the fuck you think the white man is supposed to act
See we can't check the peckerwood
If we can't treat our own fuckin people good
We wanna pick the fruit, but the fruit ain't ripe
Yeah, now who got the right to write

Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
Some doin good and others doin evil

Niggas are gettin fooled by the president's plan
In jail they got a president, but they call him the boss man
The boss man is prejudiced, hurtin em with politics
Better let em out quick or they gon' cause a riot, bitch
Even if you lock the door they still got the power
Cos the fuckin white house reminds em of the watch tower
The man is watchin over us, steady controllin us
And if we make a move he's ready to put a hole in us
Everytime I step he's always around me
To tell the fuckin truth, I feel safer in the county
At least in jail I know what I'm up against
But everything is a muthafuckin mystery outside the fence
Thinkin that we made it, but we ain't made it yet
And it's gettin harder cos the man ain't givin up shit, bet
Steady lettin us down
And ain't nobody helpin us out

Now as I flip through this world of mine
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
The ones that's doin good and the ones that's doin evil

Now as I flip through this world of mind
Everything is lookin peaceful
I'm checkin out these people
Some doin good and others doin evil

Yeah
A new beginning
Big Mike
Comin from that swamp
You know
Just kickin it how I feel
And that's on the real</pre>
