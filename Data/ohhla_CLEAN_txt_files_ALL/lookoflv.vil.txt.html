Hey baby what love got to do with this
Huh, yeah I don't know, but umm
Yeah, you know what love is
Say it with me one time - you know what love is

T3 is on some love tip y'all (you know what love is)
See the S is on some love tip (you know what love is)
T3 is on some love tip y'all (you know what love is)
T3 is on some love tip (you know what love is)
She said "I wanna be down with the S"
I said "Certainly and let me taste your splendorness"
Bustin a Virgo, you were scandalous
Your fragrance got me losin consciousness
Your stance got me unbucklin my fuckin pants
Spendin, clams to finance on the two dollar romance
Take this dick, to the tip, get a lick
Tell a bitch, the S is the shit, so eat a dick
You need to... just give me your clit
So I can get nasty like an old porno flick
Oral sex, got me caught up in the {?} bliss
T-Cedric, as I drop this dick between her tits
Yessssss... (yes yes you know what love is)
(Say it with me one time - you know what love is)
(Yes you know what love is)
(You know what love is) (You know what love is)

Yeah, one on one havin fun in my master suite
It's two o'clock, time to go and see the wee
The out cat, got a V.I.P.
Lapdance, cutie romancin
I picture you at my crib
Aerobics, got you straight up flexible
I'm tellin you, you the one that I like
I'm smellin you, but you smell so nice
I really like the way you listen to my advice
On how you never - you never fight
I really wanna, take you home
And do you, on my bearskin rug
Romancin...

Aiyyo baby what love got to do with this
Yo, I don't know, but umm
Yeah, you know what love it is
Say it with me one time - you know what love is
Uh-huh, uh-huh - you know what love is
Yo I don't know - you know what love is
... you know what love is...
