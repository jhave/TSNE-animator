[Avant]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah
 
[Chorus - Avant]
I am, the one you denied
Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright
I'm able to swallow my pride and put all the bullshit to the side
If you ready to ride, I'm down for a one night stand
I'll accept it any way that I can, 'cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first
Yeah, yeah
 
[Verse 1]
I can't keep my eyes off ya
I can tell why them other guys lost ya
Your kind's rarer than a flyin' saucer
And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, 'cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered
Tryin' to squeeze in but you wouldn't bothered
Now I ain't neither, soon as I realized that I ain't need her
She in a rush to get close to me but I ain't eager
Shiit...
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 2]
Look I don't mean to bother you
But your sex appeal is remarkable
You make a G wanna walk around in park with you
There ain't no tellin' the kind of things I'ma start to do
If I get wrapped up on your ass too fast
I could tell you feel the same 'cause when I asked you laughed
So I'ma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math
I imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath
And I'm buggin' 'cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable 'cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit, I've been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with
'Cause, most of these broads has had they eyes on my grit
To the eager shit, and learned to be satisfied with the dick
And, if you ain't worth it that's all you get
I ain't gon' blame you, I'm gon' blame all you tricks
'Cause...
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3]
It seems like your attitude, only appears when I'm mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When I'm gone too long, ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home there's rumors and scattered news
You know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be
Your girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me
My heart's colder than sandwich meat
'Cause I, come from the hood where hammers be
I move fast with a switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin' your body like this
Gon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'
Man I don't know no one hotter than Twist
You got my temperature risin'
From your hips and your thighs and
And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em
It's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in
 
[Chorus 2x]
 
[Avant]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, aw yeah</pre>
