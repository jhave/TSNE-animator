(Chorus X4)
Ghetto freak show Ghe Ghe Ghetto Freakshow
Ghetto freak Ghe Ghetto Freakshow

It's three o'clock in the morning and you're sleeping
Wicked clowns in the moonlight creeping
Slide through your window under your bed
Crawl in through your ear, eat your head
Bumping into bones cuz I need light
Tip-toeing down through your windpipe
Climbing down your spine was the fun part
Looky looky and I think I see your fucking heart
Uh huh so I'm stabbing like it ain't nothing
Wicked clown cut his way out your belly button
I'm like a vulture waiting in a dark place
Swooping down and I'm picking at your dead face
I'm sick but you don't know the whole deal
No one ever loved me and they never will
Bitch, I take you out on a blind date
But then they find you dead under a wooden crate
Rapped in a bag deep in the woods
Cause my mother always said I was no good
Locked me in a closet, fed me dog shit
Well, I'm out now, so motherfucker watch it
The insanity's grip will never let go
Here's your chance to a glimpse of a ghetto freak show

(Chorus X4)

I'm a freak show coming to your house
Standing at your porch, chewing on a dead mouse
I'm looking like a fly so you swat me
Keep chasing me even though you got me
So what you wanna do to a ghetto thug
First you starve me and feed me them fuckin' drugs
Turn me into a wicked, wicked cat
I'm coming to your house, so catch ya catch ya clown
Gotta have a fucking throat, hatchet once, hatchet twice
Gotta have the governor, the richer fucker, pay the price
Driving with your woman, that's sweet
Never even know I'm in the back seat
Chat chit-chat about the weather
But then I slam they fucking heads together
Is it jealousy, they never loved me
So now I'm ripping out your guts and it's ugly
I'm trapped, don't wanna be a rich man
Not a poor man, I need my own land
Because the rich man be stressing all the dumb stuff
They cut there fucking wrists if the grass ain't green enough
Right there in your face, you can't tag it
Just found out your son is a faggot
Dick-sucking, butt-fucking homo man
If ya stressing then you better talk to mojo man
Insanity's grip will never let go
Here's your chance to catch a glimpse of a ghetto freak show

(Chorus X4)

Ahaha, Violent J, the Ghetto Freak Show
He's still alive
The ultimate amazing freak show
Is here on the Carnival of Carnage
Line up and see him
Lived years in the slums
And he's still alive to tell about
Line up and see him
He's nasty, he's disgusting
He's filthy, he is a freak show
And you can see him live at the
Carnival of Carnage
You, young man
You look like you could use a viewing
Of a good freak show
Line up, bring your sister, your brother
And see the ghetto freak show
Violent J is still alive</pre>
