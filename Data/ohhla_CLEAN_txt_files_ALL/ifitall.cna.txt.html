What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 1: Tha Trademarc)
Uh, this is how it go down
I have the black-pound-silence so it don't make sound
I pile a 150 outta town, aint nobody around
Im in the back seat breakin it down
My love has been a bad streak dawg lately I found
Our press made us turn the radio down
But God bless now they talkin bout layin me down
Now they on about shovels in the weight of the ground
What now?
Preachin on the way that they handle thing
Watin patiently to do the 6-foot Sand Thing
Now, so I take a second look at my life
I made too many mistakes that I just couldnt make right
Should've been more focused than I take things light
When I'm gone this is what y'all will say I was like
An arrogant fool, no not that baddest or cool
Just a big fish caught up in the shallowish pool
Not a big name playa, in fact its true
Never wanted this shit without the kats he knew
He got lucky rode the coattails of everyones fame
In two weeks aint nobody gon' rememba his name
Fuck It
I'm ready to go, I done made records
Made monetary off of the flow
More importantly though, I proved everyone wrong
Its all over regardless what you say when I'm gone
What now?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
So many paths, which one you gonna follow?
What would you do, what would you do?

(Verse 2: John Cena)
I want y'all to feel the wound, its the truth in my words
I been quiet for too long, the truth should be heard
It was a while back, 10:20 in the morn'
Kat should up on my lawn in the rug-ed uniform
Unexpected, theres a knock on my door
I met this fool in the club, I don' see him before
Open to great him, but the second he sees me
His eyes buckle, his voice is uneasy
But it's cool, I didn't even catch it at first
I check his shoulder, homie's rockin a purse
Now I know something's tricky, but I'm already sittin down
Homie pipes up, you should hear what he's spittin out
Says I've been sleepin wit his wifey
And he ain't the type of kat to take that shit lightly
I made a move and he told me homie wait
Reached in his purse pulled a chrome 38
He asked me if I'm ready to die
Said he was gonna blow my brains all over the sky
Said he was leavin the country, and he was straight with the passports
Cocked the hammer, I'm thinkin my last thoughts
I'm in a bad way, nothin could save this.
I close my eyes hopin it's painless
Just waitin for the sound, ready to swallow too
But homie havin trouble with his follow through
By a miracle, I avoid the chalk ground
Homie's confused, he just wanna be talked down
His wife is sleepin through town and he knew it
Picked me outta the crowd but couldn't do it
He Squashed it, and as he's walkin away
I realize life is short so I'm markin the day
Now it's full speed ahead, I'll rest when I'm dead
And I could give a Fuck what the next man said
I live how I wanna live
Buy what I wanna buy
Do what I wanna do
Try What I wanna try
Fear nothin, take chances
Not afraid to fail, always makin advances
So when I ride on the Grim Reaper Highway
No regrets bitch, I did it my way
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

What would you do if it all ended tomorrow?
Time runnin out, ain't no more you can borrow
