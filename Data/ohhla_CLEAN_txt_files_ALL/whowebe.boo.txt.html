{Man1: talking}
you think they have any idea you think they know were coming
{Man2: talking}
those people are paranoid they figure somebody's coming
they just don't know when 
{Man1: talking}
I don't know my gut says they have no idea

{Lord Infamous}

I stepped over your shoulders then I rough rocked your bells 
the Zima's on the rims are yelling flex are hella rough 
I'm coming hit man style and leave your pillow filled with slugs

when the mourners gumming on Coke and Rum doing devil stuff 
Kaiser Soze Tear da Club up Thugs I yell it out loud 
Scarecrow I keep ganja smoke flying out my mouth

{Project Pat}
automatic gunfire when your time to die left you in a coma 
fucking off with busters in these streets got you causing drama 
marijuana feels my congregation your affiliation 
with the wrong click of motherfuckers got annihilation 
on your program who's the man with the master plot 
fresh up out the pen once again with the mask and glock 
shot you point blank range feeling strange put that ass in shock 
Project got an answer for you bitches Posse closing shop

{Gangsta Boo}

with your pussy ass crew trying to get a load of Boo 
I be the one to bring the pain bring the rain on a sunny day 
smiling in your face mean mug it with a pistol play

I'll leave you wet like a fat pussy in an orgy 
snatch your fucking soul I'm the cold that's in the winters hoe 
mess with me you die you cant tango with my .44 
drinking on some Henn and some V and some P it be in me bitch 
smoking on some weed 100% it be fire bitch 
what you trying to do I done already did it baby 
if you wanna rumble come get your ass up don't be a baby 
plain as it may be we done talked around each one of your cities
