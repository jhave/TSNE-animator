[Chorus]
Third wall I represent represent "C-muder"

Tru Records I represent represent "C-murder", get outta of here

[Verse One]
I am deep in the game, I weight more than six feet (for real)
I am straight street ain't nothing fake about me
From the pen,to the hood to the studio booth
One hundred percent Tru I only speak the truth, my G code is impeccable
I am Capo at this, check my tat
Check out stats
Man respect it, check out gatts it's still smoking
We in the Lac chocking, when I am hurting I push those ghetto tokens
One thousand four grams, we call them hood chickens
Watch me pluck them feather imbombit nigga, fuck the weather 187 on a slick
Then it's on (we run this) fuck the House of Blues
wodee move I anit got nothing to loose
Bop ya head if you a gangster (Bop ya head if you a gangster)
"Murder" shut your mouth if you a wankster (shut ya mouth if you a wankster)
I got an army ass, call my ass Cancer

It's gonna be a long night
Yeah it's murder

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]

And meat balls they for a wig, to bust brains
