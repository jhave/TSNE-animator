[Ant Banks]
Its been a long time kickin this and everybody knows it
Oaktown still in the house, but I suppose its
Time for some more shit
So yo peep the flow bitch and I'll be
the motherfuckin host with the most dick
So now you know it ain't a damn thang changed up
Stayin true to the streets since we came up
So blame us for givin you the game plus
Much bass now the name is just Dangerous
So here we go, its time for some new shit
From 94 to 95 we can do this
So nigga just love this with no playa hation
Cause we gets respect all over the nation
Still in this to win this so you can pretend this
Beat this like my dick in yo mouth, until I'm finished
The shit goes on and on and on
But when you gets no promotion
That ass is gone
In the studio all day puttin in work
Hoes didn't give a fuck and man that shit hurts
Used and abused no pain no gain
Sure them hoes tried to play us, but we still in the game

[Short Dawg]
Still in the game, after all these years
Been bumpin so long I can hardly hear
Still got the same flow that I used to have
You can clown if you want, but don't do it too fast
Cause I'm gone slow it way down, than shoot your ass
And send you wanna be pimps, back to class
Cause Ant Banks been making these beats too long
You trying to get with these funky songs
But the formulas patented, we ain't havin it
Game is all we spit
Keep on mackin bitch
You can't make it hard
Can't tell a motherfucker how to play this part
Call me Short Dawg baby of the Dangerous Crew
Talkin on the Mobil Ant Banks came through
Ridin in a brand new Benz
A nigga like that might have a few ends
No shit bitch, stupid hoe
You spent your last 10 years in the studio
We ain't no punks
We can't be played
Still in the game, still gettin paid

You know we got all the hoes
More hoes than Swiss cheese nigga
Ant Banks you wanna hoe, you wanna bitch?

Chorus:  

Well can I get a bitch (bitch)
Nigga can I get a bitch (bitch)
$hort give me a bitch (bitch)
Banks jump yo fat ass in the mix

[Ant Banks]
Yeah the shit gets hectic, but you gots to accept it
10 years chillin in the game, well respected
But check this, some niggaz don't give a fuck
Never be givin us props, see we don't stop cause we don't give a fuck
We gets paid, so tell me what a nigga know
We hit him low with the bass, than we get more
Number one album, so where the fuck you at?
Doing sit-ups, stay off my dick still tryin to rap
Damn, we never ballin out of control
We open doors for the motherfuckin O
Now lets roll
Everybody up cause we all got to get it
And when you get your motherfuckin chance nigga spit it
So listen to what I'm tellin G, come with the melody
Or keep yo skin tight so you can have longetivity
Like the Bad Ass, shit I had to earn that name
Some love it some hate it, but I'm still in the game

Chorus

[Short Dawg]
Young nigga in the fifth grade, stealin cigarettes
At ten years old, he was a real vet
Sellin gold weed, makin money like a star
Wasn't old enough to drive, but I still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the crome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
10 years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back through the town ain't nothin change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through alot, but his bnk is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch thean told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

Somebody say bitch (bitch)
Somebody say bitch (bitch)
Somebody say bitch bitch (bitch bitch)
Now let me hear y'all scream (hooo)
Scream (hooo)
Ant Banks and Short Dawg in the house fool and we mackin</pre>
