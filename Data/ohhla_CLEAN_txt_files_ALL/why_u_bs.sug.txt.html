[Suga Free talking]
Yeah the man get G's for his beats man
Y'all ain't heard? Ha! (garbled speech) dude
Ain't nothing happened to me, man
I been right under you all the time, watchin you
Five long motherfuckin years!
And you know what I see?
I still, see the, same ol' bullshit
And what motherfuckin thanks do I get?
I think I done died bout 8 times and came back to life
From y'all punk motherfuckers
Yeah, take this with you, Suga Free the Pimp
Ain't no leavin nigga...

[Verse 1]
Now either you gon be a stand-up ho or a fall-down bitch
I seen the the mountaintop befo, nigga you can't tell me shit
Bitch you been talkin to God behind my back?
You let me get pretty low yesterday and I don't like that
You better back up off me
Bitch such a disaster with with that square shit
Red Cross wouldn't give her coffee. Mama mia!
Swear to God man, pimp game so deep
In Mexico they say a pimp showed up on a tortilla
I learnt her; she was talkin shit in the shower
when I was in there takin a piss, I flushed the toilet and burnt her
I said "Bitch when you do that?" she said "I think when-"
I said "You thought?" she said "Yeah"
I said "Bitch well just don't think then" (shit)
Now I must be the truth, yah, cuz I know I'm the way
Now I can see the light? (Do you see the light?)
Can you see the light? Sometime...

[Chorus]
Now, where my money, why you bullshittin?
I need my paper why you bullshittin?
I get down, when you lyin, when you bullshittin
I need my paper, you bullshittin

[Verse 2]
Ho I happen to like who the fuck I am, this ain't no mistake
I didn't come in this motherfucker
lookin for no goddamn change for you to make
Bitch I don't wanna do nothin 'less them muthafuckin joke
Not a Cadillac with 6 or 7 scenin hos sayin "Daddy's Cadillac"
And this past new cd foresight-seeing bitch
You with a macaroni ho, you better watch that shit
Don't start this, ho if I'm tellin you I'm the truth, the way, and the light
Then why in the fuck do you wanna ???? darkness
See she wants the phone
And I thought you had sense enough to realize
This shit yourself, but I see that you don't
Somebody help me, somebody, anybody, everybody, I get down
An anti-ho, with your fake words and your slow money
Imposter of a real ho took it from the dildo and think it's funny
So now, now you loud
Meet me in ???? what happened to that dude you had?
I kissed you out in the name of the Father
and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, bitch
Chapter 8, Verse 6: Bitch gave God ups to me and over you
And contrary to rumor....(struggling, slapping, wimpering)
Now get up and act like you wanna do somethin then bitch

[Chorus]
Now get my money why you bullshittin
Baby why you bullshittin?
I get down, motherfucker, why you bullshittin
Laneway don't be bullshittin</pre>
