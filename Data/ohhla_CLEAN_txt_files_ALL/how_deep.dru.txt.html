Hey mami, dju know that I like it that you call me papi
But it seems like they maybe baby
That you've been seeing another Chico
And baby, you know that he can't go down like me
And dju know that the nigga can't freak like me
So mami tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me

[Dru Hill]
1 - 	How deep is your love for me
	Tell me what it's gonna be
	And do you see yourself with a
	Like me, on the low low
	So your friends won't know, see now

	How deep is your love for me
	Tell me what it's gonna be
	And do you see yourself with a
	Like me, on the low low
	So your friends won't know, see now

[Sisqo]
Ven aqui` little mami, Puerto Rican
I see the way you wiggle it, the way you move your body
He can't make it get wetter than me
But I bet he keep tellin' you he better than me
Ooo, you know that he can't go down like me (Cuz dju dunno?)
You know that he ain't no freak like me (And dju dunno?)
So baby tell me one little thing
How deep is your love for me

Repeat 1

[Female]
Ay, Nokio
Te extrano mucho
Ven aqui` mi papi morenito
Y damelo duro
Damelo papichulo

[Redman]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, buenos dias mama
Creep with Dr. Bullshit
When I talk my teeth should rot
I'm from Da Bricks, so which means I'm born to dog
Your girlfriends want a shot at it?
Warn 'em all
I hear them all from the bathroom stall
Tap and drawl
Say they get gas to pass platinum cars
Then I'm like, Yo!
I'm goin' to buy my crew bikes with double pipes
That we quick to lose on the turnpike
I'm the one that turned you out, dog it out
It was the Hennessey that made us slug it out
But you like, bitch you freaky, you down with it
Your other man's a punk
When I hand the punk the rush, he ride out
I'm tough, even Honey Comb hide out, duck the hour
Rush, better choose quick chick, I got tracks to dust
Dru Hill, Def Squad, if you askin' us

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
