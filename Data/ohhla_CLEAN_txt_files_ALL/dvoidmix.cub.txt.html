[Intro: Male Interviewer]
Aiyyo, Ice Cube man
Since you went solo, what's up with the rest of the crew?

[Chorus: George Clinton]
So High you can't get around it
So low you can't get under it
So High you can't get over it
I can't get over it
Nothin' can stop us now

[Hook: Sir Jinx Scratching quotes below]

Dirty mother, dirty mother  -----&gt; Ice Cube
Dirty mother, dirty mother  -----&gt; Ice Cube

[Hook]
I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
See, I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out! -----&gt; Ice Cube
Said, I got a big old ding-a-ling, and if that bitch can hang
Said, I'm gonna do my thing, with your dauuuughter
Givin' up the nappy dug out! -----&gt; Ice Cube

[Girl] Daddy, where did he go?
[Pop] I'll tell you where he went, goddamn it (*4 Gun Shots*)

[Ice Cube]
Give me that beat fool, it's a full time jack move
Chilly Chill, yo, homie make the track move
And I'll jack any Tom, Dick and Hank
That's the name of the suckers I done ganked
I get away from a copper
Drop a dime, I'll break you off somethin' proper
With the L-E-N-C-H-M-O-B, T-Bone and that's J.D.
And here's how we'll greet you
Stop!!!
Here we go, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
Drop an Old School beat   

[Ice Cube]
Goddamn, I'm glad, goddamn, I'm glad 
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now, you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the A.K.
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Lookin' like straight bozos
I saw it comin, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin' 
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Damn, you're wicked, man!!

Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline ---&gt; LL Cool J
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline ---&gt; LL Cool J
Now, you're gettin' done without vaseline ---&gt; LL Cool J
Damn, it feels good to see people.. on it ---&gt; Biz Markie
No Vaseline  ---&gt; Ice Cube

[Ice Cube]
Little boys and girls, they all love me
Come sit on the lap of I-C-E
And let me tell you a story or two
About a punk-Ass-Nigga I knew
Hickory dickory dock, it was twelve o'clock
Cinderella ain't home must be givin' up the cock
I don't doubt it, she is kind of freaky of course
Had a fight with Snow White, she was fuckin' her dwarfs
Saw a fight over colors, too
Red Ridin' Hood, and Little Boy Blue
A bad influence? - y'all I don't know
But Ice Cube'll tell the kids how the story should go

[Interlude: Little Russ]
Yeah money, that's it, yeah money, that's it
This is Little Russ in the house
Rock that shit homey, rock that shit

[Hook: Sir Jinx Scratching quotes below]
Cops ain't shit to me ------&gt; Ice Cube
Fuck all y'all        ------&gt; Ice Cube
Cops ain't shit to me ------&gt; Ice Cube
Yeah, good that all them girls remember him, Ice fuck that

[Ice Cube]
Once upon a time in the projects y'all
Yo, I damn near had to wreck a whore
I knocked on the door (*Knock knock*) who is it?
It's Ice cube came to pay a little visit to you
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
Yo, I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I gotta say it was a good day (*Gun shots*)
Fucked up my night

[Hook: Sir Jinx Scratching quotes below]
Now, ask yourself, now, ask yourself  ------&gt; Ice Cube
What did you say?   -------&gt; Prostitute
Now, ask yourself, now, ask yourself  ------&gt; Ice Cube
What did you say?   -------&gt; Prostitute
Who's the mack? ---------------&gt; Ice Cube
Straight Gangster mack -------&gt;  Humpty Hump

Straight Gangster mack -------&gt;  Humpty Hump

[Ice cube]
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
Why, oh why must you swoop through the hood
Like everybody from the hood, is up to no good?
(*Helicopter Propeller Turning*)
Run from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Run, run, run, from the ghetto bird
Motherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird

(*Helicopter Propeller Turning*)

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
