Yo.. just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
Just because I'm whylin don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby, and I use it a lot
People, here's somethin that you should be considerin
Things could turn bitter when, you don't use discipline
You might wake up the next day, upset and in fear
Buggin out, yappin bout, "How the fuck did I get here?
Who the hell is this stranger, starin all in my face?"
Now you wishin you hadn't positioned yourself, in that place
Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (take the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Tycoon thug, he made a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the zootie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(don't make it right)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not

Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(just because I'm yours)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
