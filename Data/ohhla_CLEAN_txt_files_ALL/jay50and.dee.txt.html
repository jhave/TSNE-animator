Intro:

Yea, so picture I had this dream right?
That I walked into this office building
and the receptionist came downstairs and said:
"Dee-1, your party is ready upstairs."
So I hop off the elevator, and I see Jay-Z, 50 Cent, and Lil Wayne
sitting at a round table

I hope they hear meeeeee!!!

Verse:

What up Jay, what up Fif, what up Weezy, I'm Dee
I 'preciate yall for having this conversation with me
I know that i'm the brokest person in the room yo
But money don't matter here, because I'm rich with ideas (Ooo!)
First off, I grew up listening to all of yall
 From "The Block is Hot" to "Get Rich" to "Blueprint" I bought it all
I paid twenty for "The Block is Hot" at 'Peaches' Wayne
And Hov I bought Volume 2 because I loved "Money Ain't A Thang"
Fif, you had it locked in high school, huh
You're the reason I stopped buying Ja Rule
But I graduated from that train of thought
So that's why I'm here today, not to fuss but to talk
Here we go, look..

50: You're a marketing genius and you're stupid rich
Let's come up with a scheme and give the game a super fix
I seen you slaughter the careers of other men
But they were all brothermen, so that's just another win
For the other team, entertainment is what it seems
But black on black hatred is the underlying theme
Paid, powerful, and popular, you got it all
Use that to fight the real enemies and make em fall
Other rappers might not understand, but so what?
The game probably got em bending over doing a toe touch; its raping em!
So Fif, I know you got a heart, homie I don't doubt you
But trust, the movement's gon move on with or without you

Lil Weezy, flow off the heezy
But we don't feel your presence down in the Big Easy
Shouting out New Orleans at the Grammys, that's cool
But how bout donating some cash money to help the schools
Wealth is cool, but not if you're a selfish dude
(Get at him Dee!!!) --Nah, let's help this dude
Every statement that I yell is true
So take heed to it Weezy, this ain't coming from no jealous dude
I know you're smart son, you went to McMain
Now everything you say and do got kids trying to be Wayne
Friend or foe, it all depends on how you manage your talents
So what you gon do: Step up or step down from the challenge

Young Hov, Jigga, H to the Izzo
It's truly an honor for me to meet you my nizzle
It's impossible to belittle your impact on the game
You got the hottest chick in the world wearing your wedding ring  
(That's right.)
You know most of these lil rappers are wack
They spitting poison, they hurting the culture, they're holding us back
But i'm trying to see how you feel, cause when you speak, people listen
Do you agree with me, disagree, or you feel indifferent?
With all that you done sold, now you can afford to be
Lyrically, Talib Kweli
But truthfully you ain't gotta rhyme like Common Sense
Just be down for the cause and don't ride the fence, ya heard?

Eh man, but hold up, while I got yall here right fast
Let me umm, let me look through my notebook
Cause see I was writing a rap about this same topic
I just didn't know yall was gonna show up to the meeting to day ya know?
I know, I know yall busy. Hold up, hold up Wayne, hold up
But uhh, let me just, cause I'm still unsigned
So let me at least rap this for yall
Eh, but my stuff's on iTunes tho.. Alright here we go..

Picture this, we got the blind leading the blind
Man, how stupid can we get, I just couldn't let it slide this time
Besides, my people need this
And I ain't on a major label, so they can't delete this
Ha, let's go in:

Now every rapper needs to lose their deals and earn em back
Most of em done let the industry take em and turn em wack
I be spitting from the soul, so they feel ya boy
I want your EAR and your HEART, like Amelia, boy

Stop Snitching. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard of
That's why nobody spoke up when my dawg got murdered
Everybody trying to stay true to the rules
Forget the rules if the rules was devised by fools

Most rappers is puppets, that can't be avoided
Being used for their stupidity, then getting exploited
By a man with a different color skin
But homie we grown men, so that's why I blame us and them

Me and you, we're David; the industry's Goliath
I'm here to fight it, &amp; all that trash, I don't buy it
When I was lost, I used to look up to these cats
Now I pray for these cats,; How you love that?

A young, dumb, desperate, money hungry rapper
First a label sees him, then they go in for the capture
Precisely what they're after, another pawn
Talking bout the people you killed, Pop pop pop pop... Hold on
They also like it when you talk about your drugs
How much you sell em for? 18.5, oh that's whats up
I'm trying not to point, but I hope you get the point
These cats ain't running the game right, I'ma get the point

Fight him, battle him, the media stay instigating
To us its real beef, to them its instant ratings
Then when somebody get shot, its such a problem
That same media's now saying WE should stop the violence
Ancestors of ours are screaming from the grave
Cause physically we're free, but we're still some mental slaves
Ancestors of ours are SCREAMING from the grave
Cause physically we're free, but we're still some mental slaves...
So what yall think?</pre>
