[Lil Wayne]
Uhh
Life on the rocks, too hard to swallow
So we get high 'til it feel like the sky low
Y'all boys just a bunch of pussycats, Milo
Money is the song, pockets on high note
Doe ray mi fa so, I rock like a fossil
Big ball shit, Paul Castellano
Shoot yo' ass up, now crawl out the condo
That's that nine nigga, uhh Rondo
Sleeping with the enemy, so I fuck the world
To Miss Louisiana, the sweetest Southern girl
The sweetest Southern girl (sweetest Southern girl)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
This is time's up, put your signs up
Made 'em pick my dude, out the line up
Baby what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
You see many are called, very few are chosen
Lookin at the wall, and I can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck wrong, wrong with them?
What the fuck wrong, wrong with them?

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh
Mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders, should I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
Fuck the bullshit, but just don't fuck it raw
Man pussy has a pattern, and I know where I'm goin
And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin
Sanity kills, so I live the crazy life
I wonder if you'll pay attention, if I change the price
Life is my wife, 'til death do us part
Man I'm fly as fuck you ain't even next to depart
Quick Draw McGraw, I hope you like art

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh
Steppin on the bullshit, you can be my doormat
Y'all ain't goin nowhere with that hatin shit, four flats
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn't all that
Yeah, now time's gettin shorter
With life on your head like a fuckin Reed Carter now
Don't you cross me, you do better crossin the border
So much money piled up I'm a motherfuckin hoarder

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
