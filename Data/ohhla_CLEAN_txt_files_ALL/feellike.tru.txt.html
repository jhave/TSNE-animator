{*inhales, coughing*}

See y'all niggaz think I'm tripping cause I'm on that doja
(I'ma sprinkle y'all niggaz with some game)
See y'all true niggaz
One reason I'm spiitin this game to y'all niggaz
Nigga cause I want y'all niggaz to watch y'all motherfuckin self y'know
(Motherfuckin F-E-D's everywhere y'know)
See the white folks be followin niggaz all in the projects
(Narcotics, U.S. marshals)
All in a nigga car, all on planes and boats
(Motherfuckin cable man - buggin niggaz houses up and shit)
Just like deez niggaz and deez hoes
(Telephone man)
Tired of motherfuckers followin me man
(Uh-huh, motherfuckers everywhere)
Take another route nigga somebody after you
Keep ya eyes open fool

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
  I always feel like, somebody's watchin me
I'm paranoid I can't sleep I'm in the dope game
I think these hoes and these niggaz out to get me mayn

[Master P]
I ain't never had nuttin in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up, on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid I can't sleep cause I done stole a ki
Peeped out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie downstairs holla, "Five-oh!"
But I ain't runnin from no motherfuckin white folks
I got the A-K spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holla, god damn I hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen Dopefiend Willy in the Cadillac
He said, "P where ya goin man? Get in!"
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off, 'fore I do ya trick
Take me to the projects, to meet my bitch
A hundred G's, two ki's, and a bullet-proof vest
And like Billy the Kid I got some pussy and headed to the West

[Chorus]

[Silkk the Shocker]
I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
but I saw him followin on the highway
And I today, know that I'ma blast
See I don't know who in it because the cars wiz-window was tinted
And I be seein shit that ain't there
It ain't there but I be seein shit
I be in places without bein seen there
But be seein a place without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game coke game got my mind, gone got my mind gone
I be havin nightmares everyday, I'll be woke but I'll be sleep
I looked at Shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me 'noid..
It got me 'noid, it got me noid..
But I ain't paranoid!

[Chorus] - 1.5X

[Mia X]
I beez more
paranoid than a fugitive, because I choose to live
Pro-life, when it comes to mine my Ruger 9's on cock
For all them haters with the scandolous plots
The red dot, marks the spot, for my nineteen shots
{*BOOM!*} Thought I forgot the way they did ya boy?
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy
(Fa sho'!) They wanna trap me kidnap me duct tape my mouth
Torture me until I tell 'em 'bout my man and point the dopehouse out
(Damn!) I used to be about the same drama games
That's why I'm, two steps ahead of all you, gutter brains
You know the name Mia X the biggest momma
Ghetto Sara Lee at the store
And Betty Rocker when I choppa fa sho'
The evil eyes be watchin, cause niggaz
be always tryin to get in the best players spot and
knockin, motherfuckers heads off and cris-crossin
Throw in mo' salt than Morton - when it rains it pours
Whores with pitchfork tongues; they're tryin to get my slung
on my back gotta watch them jealousy acts so black
My eyes be in the front and the back and on the sides peepin
for all them crooks that be out creepin - I feel they watchin me

[Master P]
They're watchin us
But TRU soldiers don't die, we multiply - UNGGGHH
Keep an open eye - for them haters

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
