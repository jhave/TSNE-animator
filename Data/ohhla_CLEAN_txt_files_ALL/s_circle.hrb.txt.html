Song:   Small Circle
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: DJ Victoriouz]
We don't fuck with new niggas
We tell 'em move around
I go for what I know
I ain't here to fuck around
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle)
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle) [x2]

[Verse 1: Lil Mouse]
Keep the 30 on me
'Cuz I don't fuck around
I do this for my squad
[?] gon' lay you down
I keep a small circle
My niggas will murk ya'
Hella Bandz that be my squad
Stop flexin' or get robbed
All that money gotta have it all
So much money all I do is ball
Keep lames up out my circle
Top Shotta will murk ya'
I ball out, I cash out
From the trap house to yo' cash house
Get shot down if you run your mouth
Them niggas mad, I'm hot now
I ball out, I cash out
From the trap house to yo' cash house
Get shot down if you run your mouth
Them niggas mad, I'm hot now

[Chorus: DJ Victoriouz]
We don't fuck with new niggas
We tell 'em move around
I go for what I know
I ain't here to fuck around
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle)
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle) [x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I only roll with killas
You a pussy move around
In my hood it go down
Tote 50's and 4 pounds
And my niggas will murk some
Yo' niggas gon' hurt from
And my niggas don't feel shit
Tell Lil Chris hit the kill switch
Get booked don't say no names
No Limit ain't no lames
No Limit don't play games
And my niggas don't change
We lost a couple real niggas
We went to go deal with 'em
Block hot the cops still flip it
Opps out them Glocks still hit 'em
Now we on the Ave
Them hammers in the stash
Left witness on the scene
But shout out to my mans
Bitch catch me gettin' cash
160 for the Jag
220 on the dash
All red, call it flash

[Chorus: DJ Victoriouz]
We don't fuck with new niggas
We tell 'em move around
I go for what I know
I ain't here to fuck around
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle)
I keep a small circle (I keep a small circle) [x2]</pre>
