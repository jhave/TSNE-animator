[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm rockin a rhythm, and I'm never wick (what?) wack
I'm rockin a rhythm, and I'm never wick (what?) wack
I'm rockin a rhythm, and I'm never wick (what?) wack
I'm rockin a rhythm, and I'm never wick (what?) wick wack
It's the Mr. Twista comin to twist the (what?) tongue
I make the melody go dum diddy (what?) dum
I crush a rookie like a cocky cookie (what?) crumb
I twist the words to leave the nerds sayin (what?) uhm -
My lyrical flowin'll make em cry boo- (what?) -hoo
I tick a tock to make the clock coo- (what?) -coo
You think I'm wack, then black, I flow for you (what?) too
The crew was through as if I knew voo- (what? -doo
Never say hello, that makes hell (what?) low
I flex a funky tongue like it was jell- (what?) -o
Comin to flow against a funky fell- (what?) -ow
Are you afraid, or should I say yell- (what?) -ow?
What I bring will swing like ping (what?) pong
Tryin to copy this, I bet you swing (what?) wrong
I ring the bells just to hear the ding (what?) dong
I'm throwin a style that be breakin em up in the flow of the song

[ VERSE 2 ]
I know the time, I kick the funky tick (what?) tocks
I flow forever, never to quit, be non- (what?) -stop
To boost the juice I used to flow upon (what?) blocks
You couldn't manage if your name was Don (what?) Knots
I sliced a victim up like Han (what?) Solo
As sure as Dorothy's puppy's name was To- (what?) -To
Toe to toe I'm never to give a low (what?) blow
I'm kickin sorta funky like a ho- (what?) -bo
Sissy chickens, I call the fag a he- (what?) -she
Just scope the funky tongue, I flow in 3- (what?) -d
The phrase wick wick if you think it be (what?) me
My tip be glowin as if my name was E. (what?) T.
She sells seashells by the sea- (what?) -shore
Have you heard a flow like this be- (what?) -fore?
Gettin deeper than the deepest sea- (what?) -floor
Check the style, that's only one, there'll be (what?) more
Oh Salem, went to hip (what?) hop
To see just what he could hip (what?) hop
And all that he could hip hip (what?) hop
Was the Mister Twista funky hip (what?) hop
