[Maceo]
I don't need you hoes, jumpin all around
Steppin on my shoes, knocking liquor down
Please give me space, let me see your face
checkin out your features, if you fine you can stay
Chillin at the bar, eyes on the crowd
Looking for them girls looking cute not wild
Hoes like my style, they be jockin hard
Jumpin round the club, actin like some lil boys
I be grippin toys, killing all the noise
Target practice on, and I'm ready for some war
Niggaz they be stoppin, sittin down watchin
Know they can't stop it, now they wanna cop it
Brother by my side, you know that he got me
Buckin on these lames, cause they game sloppy
Hoe pay attention, play your position
Young Maceo y'all taking nothin from these bitches

[Chorus]

[Marco]
Ho sit down, every time I come around
You hollerin, screamin, jumpin up and down
Jump around me ho, I'ma hit ya wit a bow
knock ya down, and don't give a fuck if you get up ho
But if ya calm down, we can chill and talk a while
Have a conversation, let imaginations run wild
But if you don't though, Marco gotta let you go
Cuz one thing he can't stand is a fuckin wild ho
Don't get it twisted though, just had to let you know
How a real nigga from that Kirkwood light hos
Can't be slutty though, gotta be on point folk
In a minute all the hoes 'gon know how to flip wow
We roll deep so, y'all better stay low
Fuck around and catch blows, better go and call your folk
Chopper bullets rang out, now everybody on the floor
So all that jumpin 'round crunk shit, man let it go

[Chorus]

When a maggot ho get in your face...
Is you 'gon ball up like a bitch?

HO SIT DOWN!! (x9)

[Maceo]
Tell them sucker niggaz, sit they ass down
Musty in the club while they jumpin all around
Bouncin all around while they muggin up and down
If they get some pussy then they maybe settle down
Can't get a ho, now he wanna fight
Try to holla at hos, you ain't got your game tight
Breath stank, you stank, body look nasty
Guess what I told him when that lame walked pass me

[Chorus]</pre>
