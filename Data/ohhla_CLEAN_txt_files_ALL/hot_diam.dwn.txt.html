Yo, what's up, this is Too $hort
I'm in the house with my homeboy Down

Lean Like A Cholo

(Verse 1)
[$hort] She's a dame (Dame...)
[LaLa]  We hot
[Down]  Got diamonds on my team
        Always on the scene with a gangsta lean
        I go to work...
        It's, it's, it's Down, homie
        Mister Lean-Like-A-Cholo, yeah, you know me
        Pockets full of feri'
        Oh yes, I got 'em
        Freaks in the back, lookin' fresh at the parlor
        Cup iced out with them diamonds in it
        Long white tee with the L.A. fitted
[$hort] It's how we do it, biotch
[Down]  I'm a boss in the hood
        All the dames come get it while the gettin' is good
        Hot diamonds
        Me and $hort Dawg stay shinin'
        Promise you the world, but girl, we lyin'

Hook: Too $hort (LaLa in background)
Hot diamonds (Diamonds)
Everywhere I go, they got fine ones
I want a dame, I gotta find 'em
Hot diamonds (Diamonds)
Everywhere I go, they got fine ones
I can't get 'em all, but I won't stop tryin'

Chorus: LaLa
Got them high heels with the jeans (We hot)
Hair and nails done, y'all, we lookin' clean (We hot)
And daddy, I know that you wanna dine (Yeah)
Like a diamond, look at how we shine
We hot diamonds, diamonds
We hot
We hot diamonds, diamonds
So daddy, don't stop
Tryin', tryin'
Until you get yourself
A diamond
A hot
A hot diamond

[Verse 2: Too $hort {LaLa in background}]
She's a dame (Dame...)
You say, "It sounds real good"
Jumped in the car
And rolled around the hood
Let's go to work
I ain't got time to do it
I'm 'bout to fly down south to Miami, fool
Ain't nothin' new
Man, she's better, player
She could sign autographs like an entertainer
That's what they do {Yeah}
You see 'em all in Vegas
They like to ball all night, and then they call us players
Cause when you see 'em {We hot}
We be all up on 'em
Fell in love with a girl from Southern California
In L.A.
It happens everyday
A million diamonds in the Golden State (Hey, hey)

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz *slowed down*]
"All the dame pieces, dame pieces to the dance floor"
"All the dame, d-d-dame, pieces to the dance floor"
"All the dame pieces, dame pieces to the dance floor"
"All the dame, d-d-dame, pieces to the dance floor"

(Verse 3)
[$hort]
I met a dame last night and had big fun
Put her number in my phone and tried to get some
Her man kept calling, "Baby, what are you doin'"
But she ain't coming home no time soon
Biotch

[Down]
Yeah, she rollin' with the boss now, super fly lifestyle
Dames in my hotel, flow like a wishing well
Pockets full of federal
Ain't nothin' personal
Send her back, to ya man, Down never kiss and tell

Repeat Hook

Repeat Chorus

[Too $hort (LaLa in background)]
Shoutout to all the bad bitches
All the dame pieces (Hot diamonds, diamonds)
I know your boy $hort Dawg love you girl
I'm in the house with my homeboy Down (Hot diamonds, diamonds)
A.K.A. Kilo
You know what it is

[LaLa (Too $hort in background)]
So daddy, don't stop
Tryin', tryin' (Yeah)
Until you get yourself
A diamond
A hot
A hot diamond (She's a dame...)</pre>
