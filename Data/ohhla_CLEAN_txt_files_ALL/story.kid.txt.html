Yeahhh.. mmhmm
I don't know what's goin on
Everybody tryin to flip
All they need to do is do the right thing
Put it where it's supposed to be

News story.. open to the media
Crime bosses, do or die, or either ya
live like a convict on the rock
You get SHANKED, battered and brusied you get dropped
in the bang, just livin like a savage
And at the same time, your body's damaged
Made a move on a brother from the Boogie Down Bronx
He was a bully, that beat up punks
in the cells, and caught a couple of the C.O.'s
Snatched a brother by his neck 
and knocked him down and broke his nose
Here's the bumrush - twenty at a time
Started somethin new just when the brother dropped dimes
Huh, this is a brother who's a drug kingpin
Made millions and millions, again and again
Used to, stitch a snitch just to get him switched
But the brother didn't know, that snitches get stitches
Had a Jah had a Benz had.. plenty of friends
Had.. fifties and hundreds stacks of twenties and tens
He was evicted, mother probably did time long style
Had her workin with the chain gang in the coal mine
Did the bid came out, but the brother was broke
Had connects so the brother started sellin some coke
And vials of cracks he sold it, to all the new jacks
He sold, buddha and stuff, meth sloopies and smacks
He wore Polo and Guess, dressed the part and the style
Whole teeth were clean, every time he would smile
He had a.. girl named Josie was a beautiful chick
Ended up bein a girl in a, porno flick
Tis the season to be skeezin, the girl made me sick
Wanted to kick a little flavor so the flavor was kicked
She's a girl from around the way that likes to play
Spendin his dough, eatin out every day
Wearin jewels expensive clothes so on and so on
And my man didn't know that the girl was a hoein
Now she got a little pot I guess she's goin for self
Tryin to make brothers lick her, below the belt
Takin trips to Virginia with a key at a time
Makin 42 G's at a drop of a dime
Now she's thick but what about the brother that put her on?
And gave her, jewels and furs and treated her like a Don
She forgot all about him, so now he's mad
He got a thirty-two clip and when he find her she's had
But that's the life of the fast lane
There you just might gain
A house and cash, and either jail or chump change
I've seen it before, my buddies went through it all
And because of that, I don't see em anymore
Twenty-five to life, doin crazy hard time
And in the jails, what's yours is mine
Huh, and as I say I need a moment of silence
The almight Kid Capri says.. stop the violence

Stop the violence
All you gotta do is put it in effect
Put yourself where you're supposed to be
Teach others, save the children
And all that
Big shout.. to the Trooper Love Crew
Rest In Peace, to my main man, Chuck G
Pop Duke
This is the Kid Capri, and the Lords of Funk
And we outta here... see-ya!
