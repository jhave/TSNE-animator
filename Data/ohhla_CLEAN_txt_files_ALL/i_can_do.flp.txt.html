Song:   I Can Do Dat
Typed by: CashmoneyQueen02@aol.com

If I spill drank on my clothes
I can do dat
It dont matter cause I buy me some more
I can do dat
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall
I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall
I can do dat
I'ma stop weak niggaz from rappin
I can do dat
I'ma rock all my teeth in platinum
I can do dat
I'ma show my Rolex and tattoos
I can do dat
I sip drank and eat a lot of junk food
I can do dat
I'm eighteen and I got a Bentley truck
I can do dat
You will never see me with a empty cup
I can do dat
I'ma buy the whole neighborhood bikes
I can do dat
you know Lil' Flip gone do what he like
I can do dat

(Chorus)
So you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it
If you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it

It gets me drunk off one beer
I can do dat
Drop five tapes in one year
I can do dat
Buy my grandpa a new house
I can do dat
With all this ice man I got a blue mouth
I can do dat
Come home and take my shoes off
I can do dat
Behind my house I got a pool and two dogs
I can do dat
I ride candy red on Yokahama
I can do dat
I get head from yo' baby mama
I can do dat
Blow indo in top flight
I can do dat
Keep drivin when I'm at the stop light
I can do dat
Throw twenties on my Excursion
I can do dat
Next year I might buy Worthing
I can do dat
Throw a four and a can soda
I can do dat
I talk shit cause I'm a Cloverland soldier
I can do dat
Buy me and hump a new Benz
I can do dat
You know the one with the big blue lens
I can do dat
And I throw money at my shows
I can do dat
Prime with my platinum Johnny do my golds
I can do dat
Next week I'ma buy a Volkswagon
I can do dat
And I'ma keep my Girbauds saggin
I can do dat
I let my chain hang to my nuts
I can do dat
I go back and slang on my cut
I can do dat
Every year I'm changin my skills
I can do dat
I'm the one with my name in my grill
I can do dat

(Chorus)
So you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it
If you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it

If I wanna start pimpin
I can do dat
I wear iceberg with Bart Simpson
I can do dat
If I wanna take a trip to Honolulu
I can do dat
I step by wearin platinum Fubu
I can do dat
If I wanna ride on dubs
I can do dat
Everyday I ride with thugs
I can do dat
Keep rappin' so I can make more dough
I can do dat
Watch out cause I might take yo hoe
I can do dat
Sittin' sideways my blaze go chop
I can do dat
Sell a 100,000 the first day I drop
I can do dat
Buy me a house at the beach
I can do dat
I get all my shoes from Active Athelet
I can do dat
My ring look like a coo cut
I can do dat
I got my jag stretched like a school bus
I can do dat
Everyday I buy new stuff
I can do dat
Until I die I'ma stay screwed up stay screwed up

(Chorus)
So you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it
If you see it you want it
Buy it own it
Drive it flaunt it
Factory chrome it</pre>
