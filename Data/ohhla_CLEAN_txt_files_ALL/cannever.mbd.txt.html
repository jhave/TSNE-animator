[Prodigy]
Naw, you can never feel my pain nigga
And you can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel my pain nigga
How do I start it

[Verse 1]
Nineteen seventy four, motherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
Cause I ain't feelin you at all, your pain isn't pure
You cryin cause you broke from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
Im talkin bout permanent, physical sufferin
You know nothin about that
You just complain cause you stressed
Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
with morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine
Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga O.D.
Beggin God for help, only to find
that I'm all by my God damn self
Ay you can never feel my pain nigga

Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga

[Verse 2]
And the females ask - P, why you always look mad?
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm tryin to stop those
Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
It's like nuttin that you ever seen or heard; so look listen
When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, nowadays I hardly talk
It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicap took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13
And doctors called the cops on me
Cause I be throwin IV poles and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep
Do I sound insane... if I do, then this here was written for you
Cause you could never feel the pain nigga

Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Could never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga</pre>
