[Wiz Khalifa]
See there's a big difference between the star life and your life
hahaha me I live the star life you smell it when I come through...
Yeahhhh what up taylor gang! yup
it's the captain of the spaceship... star power... young khalifa man... mr spacely

[Verse 1]
Yeah and you know that but you can't stand I
t out of this world I'm from a different planet
See how I landed?
big ol chain on
tight ass white tee
black chuck tays on
I make great songs
my shit classic
see ya'll cd... walk right passed it
calm me acid that's how I do ya'll heat niggas up till I can see right through ya'll
never slipped out goons right by me
hear niggas talk shit but they don't try me
can't do front door don't got I.d
straight up the elevator to the V.I.P
drink my drink up
blow my weed smoke
bitch don't say shit let my team poh
bout my money you see me grinding
there go a hater YOU SEE ME SHININ?

[Chorus]
When I come through watch me put my game on
fresh from my head down big ass chain on this my life it's gon shine bright
yaa I am a star looks like my car they know who I am
I'm seeing it from a far
don't act like you know I know just who you are
admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 2]
Rocks in my charm look like boulders young rich so my hos much older
me I'm cleaned up
tats all over
know I'm getting it. home girl told her? no not sober
need my weed lit
keep my blunt rolled
ain't no secret
roll like 3 zips
me and po run
brand new guccis
big ass chain on
where my plane goin? down Miami
sun gon tan me
palm trees fan me
takin pictures where my fans be
niggas sit down
they can't stand me straight from the burgh taylor gang my family
hustle heavy that's why we cakin
get my shine on that's why they hatin
as soon as I pull up ya'll can't say shit</pre>
