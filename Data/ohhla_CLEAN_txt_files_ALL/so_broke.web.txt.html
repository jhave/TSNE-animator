Song:   I'm So Broke
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Damn, man
I'm broke as fuck
Yo Akon
Why don't you throw me a couple bucks
Or some shit, man?
Fuck, ay

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
'Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
'Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
'Cause I'm so broke

Shit
I'm broker than the dropped antique [?]
Haven't had a fucking dollar
In a God damn week
And not having a buck
It straight up sucks
How you gonna pay for weed
When you can't afford the dutch?

How you gonna buy a sandwich
When you can't afford the bun
'Cause your bank card keeps saying
Insufficient funds?
Fuck, you think my 98 Altima's fast?
Hell no, but how would I know?
I can't afford the gas

And cigarettes went up
Another dollar last week
If I don't quit now
I'll be living in the street
I know it sounds funny
But this shit's no joke
So but your bottles in the air
If you're straight up broke

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
'Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
'Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
'Cause I'm so broke

Anytime I do have a little money
I'm spending it
That's why I'm spending Spring break
In Connecticut
For me, beaters and sweat pants
Is dressed to kill
Either new clothes
Or pay off the electric bill

But still I rap extra I'll
So yo, don't hate
Unless you're my girl
Bitching how we never go on dates
Thank God I'm good in bed
And a lovable dude
'Cause I ain't taking you nowhere
I can't buy myself food

Unless the dollar menu
Gon' be cool with you
If that's the case
I could treat you to a burger or two
And then we'll go back to the crib, babe
You know I get it poppin'
But you are on the pill, right?
I couldn't afford condoms
(Yeah, my bad.)

I get it in till the sun rise
But all I got's a dollar twenty five
And I don't even gotta ask why
'Cause I I I'm so broke
And I know that it sucks ass
'Cause I ain't got enough cash
Shit I ain't even got one mother fucking dollar
At all
'Cause I'm so broke

Psh, yeah I'm broke
But fuck it
Yah know?
I'm a keep grindin'
I'm a change that
You already know</pre>
