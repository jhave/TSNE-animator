I stand alone
Burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming and I've been running
trying to function fine with out my mind
climbing out this fucking corner
I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals

A forgotten rebel

Passed through the absence of parentally hands
to develop an evident level of benevolence
so it's probably better I sold my sold to the devil
This is a message to anyone I met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand any of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look Mom no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fear

that I might go nuts this year
If I don't swell up I'll see you one my way
One day this shit'll kill me but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all fate in a world so full of hate
I don't fucking love music I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
and putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bumps I had behind my smile
I'm angry at the universe for the way she treats me now
And keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hanse's disease
Not human in this century, I'm ill until the entity
Who built this penitentiary, It's filthy as a centipede
And guilt was in his sense cause he was willing to

just let me breathe, While I wore a game face
In 10 years don't check for me I'll be in the same place
This planet is just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walks around constitutes another obstacle
So here it is I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure by every facet of the existence
From my addictions, to the conditions I choose to live in
Who you kidding I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
and I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
but I've been trying disregarding my insanity
Every form of hurt isolates me from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
so Fuck education for a decade and 3 years

of headaches from my peers
Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea
So I leave with golden hope
to rip the beast that holds my focus
but the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 ft or 100 ft
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
So people say I've changed, and it's harder to relate to me
Good, I never liked you our friendship was make believe
I'm peeling the mask back and revealing the rap thespian
Feeling my organs drilling distorted short portions
of morbid acid keeps the torture unfortunately crafted
interests to orbit my portrait and inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, the walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on but with clothes pins
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look all right but in the inside its so wrong
I want life to change but I don't know if it can
for a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am
I stand alone burned every bridge over the trouble water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die in my life then come and stay
in madness' favorite little corner
Cause even Shadows have Shadows
and my secrets are eating me eagerly feeding

I scream in my dreams Away but they keep on defeating me
Even Shadows have Shadows
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
Even Shadows have Shadows
I'm about to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see

and I can't feel what I hear
Even Shadows have Shadows
So don't judge a book by it's cover
Cause my story is fucked up as any other!</pre>
