Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?

[Chorus]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isnt
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how Im living I just hope Im forgiven
It seems like you dont want this love anymore
Im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up with them bitches
I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'll never make you feel like that

Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love</pre>
