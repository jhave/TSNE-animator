Move over bacon there's somethin meatier
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over
Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova
I'm not tryin to say that I'm number one
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back 
in ummm... Kindergarten!!
Some played with Lego's, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect em like padium and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?

	Cause I can do it right (4X)
	Yesssss I can!

[Big Daddy Kane]
Step up girls and get somethin to treasure
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure
And if you're wonderin if I want it --
I got a Kraftmatic with your name written on it
I reminisce sayin I take em eight to eighty
But I was just kiddin, no you have to be a lady
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body
I just don't go to a Similak party
So all those of age, we can get intimate
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
I treat girls just like pastry
Mmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
A well known player, but not for the Yankees
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role
But I'm up to top two and my father's gettin old
I'm takin love to a brand new height
And if lovin girls is wrong I don't wanna be right
Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime
You know why?

	Cause I can do it right (4X)
	Yesssss I can!

[Big Daddy Kane]
If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because She's Gotta Have It
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack
that charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her
And bring about that feelin of passion
to have her on my body like modern day fashion
Layin next to me, in pure ecstasy
You're like a door and you know that sex the key
So send your man to the lost and found
I'm bringin somethin that's world renowned
In other words - good lovin that's major
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager
Runnin around sayin, "Please me, please me, please me"
That's why I say it ain't easy
But I've been able to maintain my status
with ladies mackin without if's and's or maybe's
And other players just can't understand it
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
I always end up with them on my shelf
*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself
You know why?

	Cause I can do it right (4X)
	Yesssss I can!</pre>
