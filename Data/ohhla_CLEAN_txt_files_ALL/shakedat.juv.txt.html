Second Verse:

Now when the sun goes down in the C.J. Peete,
I'ma hit the door, lookin' for me a H-O-E,
The first bitch I see, I step to her quick,
I'm tryin' to find a way that I can run up in her shit,
Now she don't wanna have no conversation,
She sayin' I'm beginning to be an aggrevation,
Called her boyfriend, he was comin' out the store,
He walked up to me and confronted me about the hoe
I said "Look here the bitch was standin' so I thought she didn't have a man",
"So let's get that an understanding",
He looked at me crazy, figured he could fake me,
I reached in my draws and quickly grabbed the three eighty,
Now he's another nigga gone,
Lovin' these hoes, you fuck with me and now it's on,
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga,
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga,
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga,
Ain't nothin' wrong, with bein' a Juvenile nigga,
