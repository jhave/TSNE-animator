[Pimp C]
Like that, like that
Bitch you know you like that, bitch you know I like that
Like that, know you like that
Bitch you know you like that

Uhhh! Bitch gon' get down on the flo'
You ain't gettin paper what you twerkin it fo'?
All I see is a bunch of ones
Need to leave with a pimp, time to have some fun
All these niggaz is really lame
Just talkin to a nigga cause you like the game
Later on you gon' bite, that
Bitch you know you like, that

[Chorus One 2X: Pimp C]
Bitch you know you like, that
Bitch you know I like, that
Bitch you know I like, that
Bitch you know you like, that

[Bun B]
Well it's Big Dick Cheney and Tony Snow
We go Mighty Joe Young upside a hoe head
And fuck her emotions, I want the whole bread
I ain't payin attention to what the hoe said
That hoe can go 'head, if she ain't feelin it
She ain't goin nowhere, she love how I'm drillin it
I throw it up on her she throw it right, back
Yeah bitch you know I like, that

[Chorus Two 4X: Bun B]
Bitch you know I like, that
Bitch you know you like, that

[Pimp C]
Bitch I see you lookin at the chain
Can't take your eyes off the big ass rang
Bitch I'm standin on the top
Like Rick in the 10th, young bitch I'm a pimp
And you like everything I stand fo'
Bitch don't use no hands, hoe!
All jaws, pull it back
Bitch you know I like that

[Chorus Three: Pimp C]
Bitch you know you like that, bitch you know you like that
Bitch you know I like that, bitch you know I like that
Bitch you know you like that, bitch you know you like that
Bitch you know I like that, bitch you know you like that

[Bun B]
Let me do what I wanna do let me do what I feel
C'mon ride sidesaddle with the king of the trill
All this damn conversatin ain't worth the breath
Just lean to the right while I work the left
Vice verse and reverse then it's upsy-daisy
Damn this pussy drives me fuckin crazy
I'm fiendin to hit it baby like, crack
Cause bitch you know I like, that!

[Chorus Two]

[Outro: Pimp C]
Bitch you know I like, that
Bitch you know you like, that
That, that, bitch you know you like that
That, that, y'knowmtalkinbout mayne?
Hold up, bitch you know you like that
Ah-ha ha ha ha, is you a crazy muh'fucker mayne
You crazy!</pre>
