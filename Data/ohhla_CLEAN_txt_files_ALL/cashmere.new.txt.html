[Intro]
Wait hold up, J, you see that chick?
(Which one?) Right there whit them big ass lips
(God damn!) Uh-huh (How she get so thick?)
I bet she used to be skinny 'til she got some..
(Diss my girl again lil homie while you talk that ish)
(I'ma go game her up and take her back to the crib)
Waitin for me (nah bro) but she know the biz (yeah right)
Real talk, watch a pro do this

[Verse One: Legacy] + (Ben J)
Umm excuse me, girl, yo' style is dope
You got swag too, noticed that a while ago
My name is Legacy and it's my first day here
I was wonderin if you could be my first date here
(Um, huh, excuse my friend)
(He's kinda new to meeting girls cause he's used to men)
Used to men!! (Girl this dude is stupid huh?)
Yo I ain't gay (Man why don't you tell the truth for once?)
She want me (you don't even got a mustache yet)
If you don't shut the hell up with yo' buff-ass neck..
So anyway, wait hold up see you made her pissed
Aiyyo come back before you leave let me tell you this

[Chorus: Legacy]
Cashmere, Cashmere, you know I'm really diggin yo' style
Cashmere, Cashmere all I wanna do is see you smile
Cashmere, Cashmere, you don't need that dude Ben J
Cashmere, Cashmere, but yeah you wanna be my babe!

[Verse Two: Ben J] + (Legacy)
See it's like this, 5'11 with good sex
And unpredictable and keepin them girls guessin
Know that Earl was the bomb, I'm makin Oprah plans
I got the world in my palms so I can't hold my hands
(Nah bro, 5'8, swass size great)
(Long as hell I can make you lose weight)
(But your body off the chain, make me wanna scream)
(Even Keisha and The Game ain't even feel that much pain)
That was lame (you a lame) your momma (say what?) Nothin
But here c'mere girl let me give you some +McLovin+
I feelin you a lot and you the baddest thing yet
And my love ain't big enough (psh, hat's what she said)
Can you stop? (Stop what? Shea lookin boreder than me)
Ans you lookin like a Hobbot off of Lord of the Rings
Damn! Now back to what's important to me
Aiyyo where you goin girl? I got some more on my sheet

[Chorus: Ben J]
Cashmere, Cashmere, you know I'm really feelin yo swag
Cashmere, Cashmere, I want me and you to make it last
Cashmere, Cashmere, Legacy who? All you need is J
Cashmere, Cashmere, but yeah you wanna be my babe!

[Verse Three: Legacy]
He a dog girl, all he do is run and smell
You wanna buff Nick Cannon or a young LL?
That's the point I'm tryin to make cause he dumb as hell
And I can make you fall in love after one quick meal
Then she stopped, paused, stared in my eyes
And for the first time moved her mouth to reply
She said that she kissed a girl and she liked it
And ever since that night she was a full blood dyke chick
(What? Wait huh, did she just, what she say? Hell nah!!)

[Chorus: New Boyz]
Cashmere, Cashmere, that's why yo' breath stink
Cashmere, Cashmere, what the hell's wrong with yo' teeth?
Cashmere, Cashmere, when I said I liked you I lied
Cashmere, Cashmere, I'm over here, uncross yo' eyes
