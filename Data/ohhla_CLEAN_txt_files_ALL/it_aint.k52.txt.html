Song:   It Ain't Easy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Some days it sure aint easy
Waking up and being tweezy
I'm goofy tall and skinny
They said I rap too cheesy
But I'm used to losing
Used to dudes just booing
But I'm thinking about just suing
VH1 they got me ruined
Oh you think I'm fooling
What would you be doing
They said they loved your music
And they was like you rock John Reuben
They think I'm kidding
When I say I rap for a living
On top of that it's Christian
They like ... you must be tripping

It aint easy
Being tweez
Being tweez
Being t-t-t-tweezy [2X]

Next story it's all true
Backstage getting food
When I ran into this dude
"And he be like hey man who are you?" what are you talking about?
"You with that fifty two?" What?
"Oh man I love your group." it's not a group
"Which one are you?"
What are you talking man, I'm just one dude!
"What instrument do you play
Drums, bass, DJ?"
KJ Five Two that's my name
"Ah yeah right" then he walked away
My life can be so lame
Like the movie Snakes on a Plane
Somethings will never change
Anybody else feel my pain?

It aint easy
Being tweez
Being tweez
Being t-t-t-tweezy [2X]

So what's the difference y'all
Between me and a superstar
They got rims on a brand new car
And I got a scratched up used iPod
All I got is God
And really all I want is God
Really all I drop is God
Even if you think that's lame and odd
I know it's strange and all
But I'm still remaining calm
Even when it's just straight up hard
Don't plan on changing y'all
Still standing straight up tall
Don't plan on fading nah
He's all I'm claiming y'all
Even when I'm just stating y'all that

It aint easy
Being tweez
Being tweez
Being t-t-t-tweezy [2X]</pre>
