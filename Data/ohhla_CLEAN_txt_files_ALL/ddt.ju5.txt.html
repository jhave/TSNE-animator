Ahhh!

[Kool Keith]
I look at rappers with maximun equation
X-ray vison invasion
Rhyme connects perfects insects
That crawl and try to bite my rhymes
Pesticides I'm the double D combine the T
Thats DDT
A chemical more to better to burn
Roaches, germs, mouse, lice, termites and percunious bugs
Or try thugs who perpotrate
Nothing within contaminate
Got my gloves on
So bring turtle doves on
Watch me pluck em and pick em
Stick em kick em and vic em
I see you're featherless
You got the birdy disease
Bite any rhymes that I have for ya
The poison is bad for ya stupid
You're equal measure to dirt dust grime and puss
You're just a rappin infection
Dirtlizin my section like a six-legga
Ya betta step off and walk ya pure roach
