	You do not dig them, so you say
	TRY THEM! TRY THEM and you may
	Try them and you may, I say..

[Pete Nice]
Slave drivers on your dollar bills that builds upon your ignorance
Significant, you never beat one-two one-two semblence
Since I ain't supposed, no boastin
I'm keepin soaps in my mouth like coke stem
For the silence of the swine, sittin slick on my slim chews
Liquor on the lamp, sippin booze as a cow moves
Lose my head over speak of a censor
Morse code but Three had no family credenza
Friends of mine align swine on the backstab
Grabbin greedy, now it's Rikers or rehab
My walkin stick just flips, it's a stick up
Misdirected like Charlie Babbitt, mixed up
Three-fifths, three-fifths, like this
He used to roll, a man with three-fifths, a man without his soul
So is this equal or blowin up your ass
smoke sticks who got your vote and rather slit your throat

	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."

[MC Serch]
No no no, green eggs and swine
But they keep edgin to my plate, I step back and say,
"Thanks, cause I just ate," not that I would eat it
even if I was hungry -- all the ills of the streets
that could have done me in I stay clear of all the evil all the envy
And ex-homeboys who used to be friendly
Pretend to be down, but changin real fast
So heed the word, heed the word of my FOOT up your ass
Kickin a bone out, castin a stone out
Makin water ripple but got nothin the middle
So now you sit there, makin big waves
Talkin about my ancestors used to be from caves
It's time to wake up, bake the cake, and turn the page
For now is the birth, the birth of the mind age
We you and me -- all in a new time zone
and give you somethin much better to dine on

	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"

{I will not eat them with Prince Paul
 I will not eat them with Low Rawls
 I do not like green eggs and swine
 I do not like those 3rd Bass rhymes}

[Pete Nice]
My loops and loops and rhymes you never censor
I'm scramblin eggs on your family credenza
Attend to your owns or you're blown to bits
You're eatin green eggs while I'm swallowin the grits
You sits on your bony ass I'm passin on the rhythm, I give em
Gassin me, you try to geez I'll SWING em
Like a 40 ounce the choice is constitutional solutions
arrest in domes of ignorannce full
I'm dickin down swine, I stick my neck out
Give a slap here, and shorty'll put your head out
Five G's explicitly you see the story tells
You put a sticker on my record and my record sells
Sam I am not, with the not but Sam Sever is
So the critics all think they know what clever is
I never seen you 40'd up at the corners Pops
So what a Senator knowin about hip-hop?

	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Try them.."

[MC Serch]
Freedom of speech that is spoken in loose lips
to those who appreciate large tips, tippin the scale
Slum is in favor of the man who can't stand the live flavor
Bob's a jerk and he worked for the ex-friend
Not X-Clan, but wax get taxed even if it's bland
Branded for educated street credentials
And can't talk about life's bare essentials
Put it to plate, cause the plate they won't deny it
But won't give you a chance, or even a place to buy it
Cry for freedom, but music's not free, it's choking
Could never could ever could say what needs to be spoken
Put this out, before I depart
Before I hit the Killdrews, he started with the arts
I got much much better things, to do with my time
than to worry about the green eggs and swine "Try them.."
The green eggs and swine
Much much better things to do with my time
than to worry about the green eggs
the green eggs the green eggs and the swine

	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"
	"Try them.."	"Bacon souflee!"
	"No I ain't gonna eat none of that"

{I will not eat them here or there
 I will not eat them anywhere
 I will not eat green eggs and swine
 Hehehehe... BUT MY BALLS ITCH!}</pre>
