[Lil' Mo] (Chorus) 
When I cry, you cry
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together
Said I cry, you cry 
We cry, together 

[Ja Rule]
I love my life, I love my wife
A bad time to prevail, it overwhelmed me
I'm livin in hell but livin wealthy 
And know these hoes love me
Because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Mar-tin
Let's get the party
Cracking right here fuck V.I.P
Now when my baby loves me
Home wit tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies
She ain't surprised at me
She just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be 
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
Cuz if I cry, you cry
We cry together

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin school gettin high wit da hottest bitches
Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin 
The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin 
You and I then made a killin, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus]

[Ja Rule]
Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I put it on everything that I love
And my pain it's my love
And I want, this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin
And every night she just looked at me
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
"I don't want me baby to die"
Brought so much pain to her life
Gotta make it better
Cuz when ma cried I cried 
We cried together

[Chorus]

[Lil' Mo]
Oooooohhhh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, cuz when 
Ja cries, Mo cries 
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together</pre>
