[Cormega]
Yo, I'm contemplatin'
My soul is in a custody fight with God and Satan
The rap or crack, I go hard for paper
Niggas ain't even as smart as Daja
And think they rockin' me to sleep or poppin' me with heat
I don't even take you serious, I think you envious
I feel it, I was born to deal bricks
And come through the hood in ill whips
The Realness, who you think you deal with
I don't fear shit nigga, fuck around and get hit up
Ya blood stains the pavement like paint from a portrait I painted
Ya moms seen the coffin and fainted
You swimmin' with the sharks and the water is tainted
If you feel it in your heart (bring it)
My infrared beam is on ya head
My Desert Eagle severs people when I squeeze it
I measure keys, you smalltime, barely felony
Only bigtime with jealousy, my mind tellin' me
Fight like a mantis, you triflin' badgers wanna see me in a casket
Stop dreamin, life's a bitch I'm not leavin'
I'm not even, cheatin' on, or bring it on, so I can start squeezin'

My nigga Biggie must have prophesized
When they said somebody got to die
My nigga Pac must have felt deception
When he asked nigga do you wanna ride or die

[Cormega]
Y'all niggas better duck when you fuck with me
Trust is a luxury, I can't afford it, so I prepare for war
I smear the wall two of ya mans with plans you sweared were flawless
I turned kids to orphans and live with caution
You can't match the status, in a Jag with 10 crack commandments
Blazin', fake niggas can't stand it
I got shit established, strugglin' your hustlin' skills are average
Look and learn bitch, my cooker turn
A key to a key and a half, and he don't even use a lot of heat on the glass
I surpass Nino, blast like Callito, die slow
Cuz Sass like to even up the side or blow
Like a nigga who need time on the phone, you get it?
Forget it son, I'm in a zone, I'm a live nigga
When I decide niggas, must die, kiss ya loved ones goodbye nigga
It's fucked up, but it's just the thought I got cliques
That go through brick and whips customized motherfucker
I get money, sit on bricks and twenties
Niggas ain't takin' shit from me</pre>
