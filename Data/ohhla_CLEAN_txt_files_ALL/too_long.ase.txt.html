(Masta Ace - talking)
Man, I was starting to think I wasn't never getting out of here
But, umm, I'ma do things different this time, believe me
I ain't never trying to come back here again

(Guard - talking)
That's what they all say
You'll be back, they always come back
We'll save a cell for you too

(Ace - Talking)
Fuck that, you ain't gone never see my ass again
Mark my words, this time I'm staying out

Y'all waited too long for this (x4)

(Masta Ace)

Aiyyo, its been a long time just like sweet revenge
Never thought that I'd be seen on these streets again
It's been five years at least
Waiting for a piece
Bouncing off of these walls awaiting my release
Pacing like a caged lion
With rage prying
All them days trying to engage with the iron
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place
I got down on my knees, looked into God's face
Its really not the same, is it?
With low digits
And y'all ain't hold me down, ain't paid me no visits
New cats claiming shit just like they bought stock
And y'all let em move in and take over the block
I heard y'all be out there spending dubs with em
Out all night long, going to clubs with em
I guess thats what I get for having a kind heart
Today's when they life end and mine starts

(Apocalypse)
Sometimes waking up is even kinda scary
Some foul deeds I find necessary
Like the Christ and the Judas theory
I feel the hurt and scream loud but nobody hears me
My broken body bleeds heavy plus my mind is weary
Slipped the mickey when they first gave me sex
Addicted to the trees, Henneseys and cigarettes
Inhaling the toxic gases when I breath
Study words of higher deity cause him I believe
I don't pray on my knees
Just in case the evils comes like D's
I'll be ready to blast and make him bleed
In high double-digits I go back to the essence
Leave my rhymes behind so you can use em for lessons
Like a new Revelations chapter
You ain't moving slow, it's just that in my mind I'm moving faster
Sick messiah like I'm David Koresh
You done picked the wrong nigga to test
Now pick - the trey pound or the tech

Y'all waited too long for this (x 5)
