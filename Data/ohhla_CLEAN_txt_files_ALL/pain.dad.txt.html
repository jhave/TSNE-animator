There's times in my life where I just
I just wanna run away, I just
I just wish the pain would stop
I don't wanna cry no more
I wish the pain would go away

Start a day, bad hands make it hard to deal
Sometimes I wanna pull it, end it all with a bullet
Hard to live life to the fullest with all this bullshit
Mad as fuck, a nigga had enough
From jump street, saw my father murder massacre slain
One shot took half of his brain, I recapture the pain
Twenty-three years, three when it happened
Twenty-six now, still I can't stop the tears
Then my mood switch, thinkin about this sheisty bitch
Kinda funny cause they fake it when they callin you honey
On your dick when they think a nigga, might be rich
That's when I shit, cause I know you fuck with me for my money
Learned the hard way, ain't no correctin the grief
Baby moms starts sexin, my so-called beef
Don't give a fuck if they Marked me For Death like Steven
or relievin your breathin, long as I'm even 'fore I'm leavin
Pain...

	I wish this pain, would go away
We're talkin about the kind of pain that
	I wish this pain, would go away
just gets all up in your heart, and in your soul
	I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that makes you feel like you can't go on no more
	I wish this pain, would go away
The kind of pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone

I can't relate to them cats who hold gats at the gate
Is it my fate, am I that nigga, that they love to hate
Solely, slowly, cause I rock a Roley they want my brain gone
Cause of a fuckin chain on?
Migraine's on, now the pain's warm, I stagger
And I'm hopin I don't know the cat with the dagger
Penetratin my heart, rushed thoughts etched in grief
To the City College deceased may you rest in peace
To the families, I never meant to cause no pain
I know the truth, but if you want, then I shoulder the blame
Overcome at times by uncontrollable flames, and multiple pains
Now it seems like I'm goin insane
For the love of you and hip-hop I expand the news
But before my shit drops, I stand accused
Don't you think I wish we all was rich?
One for all it's pain to see your people when they all can't ball
The pain..

	I wish this pain, would go away
	I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna give no more pain
	I wish this pain, would go away
I don't wanna receive no more pain
	I wish this pain, would go away
God, please take the pain away

I can still hear the shots that left my man Big layin
on my knees cryin and prayin, then I said
"God why?  Got to know how hard we try
 Don't let him die, please don't let my nigga be dead"
But it was too late, California sealed his fate
Gone now, hard to move on now, fuck making songs now
Wish I could die, I could fly
If they don't give a fuck, fuck it why should I?
That's when Big spoke, pulled up in a glistening 3
with platinum wings and said, "Puff listen to me"
He puts his hands on my head and said "I live through you
Make hits continuous, this is what we do
I know it might be strenous and times is hard
Just keep the faith cause now we rhyme with God
Plus you owe it to yourself and don't forget the kids"
That's when I opened up my eyes and new Bad Boy lives

	I wish this pain, would go away
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
	I wish this pain, would go away

[Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm tellin you man
now don't let these motherfuckers fuck your shit up God
I don't give a fuck WHO it is
Don't let em fuck yo' paper man, please Big
Focus your mind man, do your albums, make them hot joints
man fuck these niggaz man
Fuck these niggaz man
And I'ma tell the same thing to you
When you get your shit done, watch your money, and
hopefully, I pray for you, you be the shit
And soon motherfuckers start screamin your name out
like they screamin all these other, so-called hot niggaz
Never take your eyes off that shit yo
Try to get everything you can out of these motherfuckers yo
Ain't no guarantee they gonna love you next year...

	I wish this pain, would go away
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day the pain is gonna stop
	I wish this pain, would go away
One day there's gonna be no more pain
