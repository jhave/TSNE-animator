Song:   Worm in Her Vein
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She's in love with the dark, escapes with art
Where do you start when you can't stop him from writing in your chart?
Exchange for a fist hard, she would get a gift card
In a hospital gown looking down for a discharge
She's so sweet, she'll kill you in a heartbeat
Just to taste your tongue until she starts to eat
Your head in her hands calmly, she'll eat you probably
Be a good idea to flee from a zombie

[Chorus]
And you know it's all inside your head
Can't change your mind, a lie is what you meant
Can't take your words back, they've all been said
Won't bring you back to life when you're this dead

And you know it's not inside your head
Can't change your mind, a lie is what you meant
Can't take your words back, they've all been said

[Verse 2]
She's so awkward, she's awesome, an orchid in her hair
She stares off like there's something there
She's not even alive, I'm a fish she happened to hook
Worm in her vein holding my hand dragging her foot
Look mommy, boyfriend is a little scarier
Cause I chose to stick around and not bury her
Needle in your arm to preserve you like the world deserves you
Apparently so much the worms do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I should let you go, I already miss you
Felt your arm and held the rotting tissue
Get a feeling for your frailty, it's alive in you
Sitting shotgun, axe murderer driving you
Ran off with a piece of me, a piece of meat that was aching
Weak, was just sitting in my chest making beats
I know I found it wrong but thought I lost it right
A trail of blood, my love ran off in the night

[Chorus]</pre>
