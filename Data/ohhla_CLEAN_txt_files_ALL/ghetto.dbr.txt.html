Typed by: OHHLA.com

I had some problems 
That no one could seem to solve them 
But you had the answer 
You told me to take a chance 
And learn the ways of love, my baby 
And all that it has to offer.. 
You told me your secret love won't let you down 
Ohh allll my love baby... 

Da Brat: 

Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change 
Between you and your boo. 
Put a hold on me ever since I held you 
What compelled you to be my nigga 
Besides passion and love 
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust 
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us 
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga, 
When you stickin my stuff 
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber 
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin. 
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak. 
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights 
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much. 
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch 
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters 
Hit you so you don't forget us 
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella 
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation 
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby... 

CHORUS: 

T-Boz: 
And all this love, is waiting for you 
My baby... Sweet Darling... 
And all this love is waiting for you 

Da Brat: 
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down 
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around 

Da Brat: 
Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word 
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese, 
And pissing me the fuck off. 
The first thought of committing a felony never left 
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L, 
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I 
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers 
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you 
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun 
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne 
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home 
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness 
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation 
If I'm incarcerated 
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous 
Who tell us the opposite of that, 
Forever you and Brat 
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame 
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...
