First Verse (K.C. Redd+Junie B.):

(K.C. Redd)

I'm the Hot Girl to shake it with the shake 'em up
I'm the one that give 'em away and still catch a buck
I'm a Hot Girl tighter than your fitted shirt
I'm the one you see draggin' haters in the dirt
I'm the Hot Girl that gets rowdy like a band
I'm the one you booted up when I took your man
I'm the Hot Girl that sparks like a Rolex
I'm the one who pulled the Hot Boy with the Lex
I'm the Hot Girl jumpin' like a jamboree
I'm the one who sting you like a patch of bumble bees
I'm the Hot Girl chargin' like a Primeco
I'm the one you saw twerkin' in the video
I'm the Hot Girl bustin' through your man door
I'm the one who tell them haters "Get In Line Hoe"
I'm the Hot Girl that cut you off like a phone
I'm the one that have you buckin' when you hear my song
I'm a Hot Girl that shake my ass like some dice
I'm the one that say "That ain't really nothin' nice"
I'm the Hot Girl strictly bout makin' cheese
I'm the one that tear it down like Junie B.

(Junie B.)

I'm the Hot Girl that's shinin' like a marble floor
I'm the one that's smokin' haters like an opthimal
I'm the Hot Girl that's mellow like a saxophone
And I'm the one that's quick to kick, like a silver prone
I'm the Hot Girl, that's shinin' like a Take 'Fo chain
And I'm the one that led you on, now you all deranged
I'm a Hot Girl that's thinner than a gold rag
However I'm clever, whenever, look I'm quick to bust that ass
I'm the Hot Girl, that's creepin' like the A-T-F
And I'm the one that broke you up and made you wanna step
I'm the Hot Girl, that's hotter than a steamin' iron
And I'm the one that's buckin' hard than a second line
I'm the Hot Girl that's shinin' like a jewelry store
And I'm the one that's runnin' game like a 64
I'm the Hot Girl that's sharper than an army knife
And I'm the one that pick my ugly friends up at night
I'm the Hot Girl that back it up like Jubilee
But I'm the one that's from the three, represent T.C.
I'm the Hot Girl, that cut it up like barbed wire
And I'm the one they jock, cuz I know I'm on fire

Chorus (K.C. Redd):

I'm that Hot Girl, that's done right
That Hot Girl from the Wild Side
I'm that Hot Girl and I know I told ya
Bout this Hot Girl, out that wild Magnolia

I'm the Hot Girl that's always cashin' checks
I'm the one that keep a fresh pair of Airmax
I'm the Hot Girl that's always in some drama
I'm the one who gotta tell your Dad "I love your Mama"
I'm the Hot Girl and I know you can't stand me
I'm the one who represent my whole damned family
I'm the Hot Girl that back it up and get jiggy with it
I'm the one who told you on the hustle you can muscle with it
I'm the Hot Girl that'll hit you where it hurts
My girl Junie B.'s comin' with the second verse

I'm that Hot Girl that all the haters wanna be
And I'm the one who stomped them down in the solja rees
I'm the Hot Girl that keep them dogs on a leash
And I'm the one that represent that wild T.C.
I'm the Hot Girl that get rowdy all the time
And I'm the one that tear it up, with the ??? mob
I'm that Hot Girl that get more play than PlayStation
And I'm the one that knock you off, if you bout that hatin'
I'm that Hot Girl, that break your heart if you can't please me
And I'm the one they want, cuz I know I'm off the heezy
