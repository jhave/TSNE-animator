[Intro: Joe Budden]
The alternate route is a long one
But ultimately in the end it gets you to the same exact destination
Yessir~! The journey's been long
And the wins have been short
But today, none of that matters

[Joe Budden]
The time is now, zoom, get close
The ego is gone, the room is for growth
The talent is there, the feelin is new
I mean, bottom is gone but the ceiling is too
I was higher than Whitney, headed toward the top again
E'rything I write crack like it's with a +Bobby+ pen/pin
But it's more than what you hear in a song
The wings are extended, the fear is gone
Hold up, the clips are loaded, safety is off
The business is in the black, I ain't takin a loss
Hold up, standards are high, hoes never hold out
The tourin is cool, the shows always sold out
The foes are mad, but fuck it no one else cares
The kicks are custom, you'll never see 'em elsewhere
The stakes are high, the risk is crucial
And they love to hate me, but I love it when they do too

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
I've been waiting here for so long
Gotta take what's mine
Since time will never wait
Who am I to stand up fate?
It's my time...
It's my time...
It's my time

[Joe Budden]
Look, I've been hurt, I could pull up scars
Now the Earth is my pull-up bar
The journey was long, the roads were slim
Though I thank God today I probably owe it to sin
Uh, streets were hungry, I was torn apart
Even though them jails were cold they warmed my heart
Was livin the worst but prayed for the best
Ain't have a thing given to me, had to rape success
Had to be used for approval, had to use whatever was useful
Had to act old even when youthful
Money don't make me, that ain't what I'd kill for
Cause I was richer than I'd ever been, and was still poor
Some never thought he would propel
Some talked to me just to speak to themselves
Some broke they arm all while reachin for wealth
So when you come in the game make sure you leave with yourself
Joey

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
We all got demons, a few I rivaled
Looked 'em in the eye and they became suicidal
They thought it couldn't happen, they were too prideful
His head's an ornament on the wall as proof I survived you
Bills were high, money was low
Strip club was poppin, wasn't money to go
Goin nowhere fast, but drugs was a one stop
Couldn't shine sellin that tan, I had my sun blocked
Now I'm on acres, the house, and a loft
The women are foreign, their blouses are off
It's a whole new me, I redefined my style
And since yesterday's gone I guess the time is now

[Chorus]
