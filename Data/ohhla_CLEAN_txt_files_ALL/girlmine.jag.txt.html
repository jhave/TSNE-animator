[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
See I'm sick of all these
No game having
Gold chain wearing
Last year clothes wearing niggaz
That keep sweating me
Cause their bitch want me
It ain't my fault nigga

[Jermaine Dupri]
You need to stop calling my house
We ain't got nothing to be talking about
It might be tough to swallow but that's how it be
Nigga your bitch chose me
Fellas

[Jagged Edge]
The girl is mine, can't you see
Know the game cause your bitch chose me

[Jagged Edge](JD)
Somebody please tell me how
How is it everybody knew the
The rules to how we get down
Now he wanna act a fool now
I'm the first to say
She gotta (what?) man, gotta leave her long gone, run away
But still she wants her way
It ain't my fault, it ain't my fault
She chose me

     You need to stop calling my house
     He ain't got nothing to be talking about
     It might be tough to swallow but that's how it be
     Nigga your bitch chose me
     Fellas
     [Jagged Edge]
     The girl is mine, can't you see
     Know the game cause your bitch chose me
     The girl is mine
     [Jermaine Dupri]
     I know you're mad dude, but your attitude needs to halt
     Cause ooh it ain't my fault
     It might be tough to swallow, that's how it be
     And you know the game, your bitch chose me
     [Jagged Edge]
     The girl is mine, can't you see
     Know the game cause your bitch chose me

[Jagged Edge]
Many girls go around
Actin' like they got nobody
You better find one that you know stays down
One who's eyes ain't wandering
If her eyes fall on me
Then I know she's coming
You better find one who wants to be with you, oh
Girl it's really too bad for you
Says he's not enough for you
Baby you should let him know
Baby you really don't wanna try me
J-E maybe we'll be
Together for eternity
Reside till I d-i-e, till I d-i-e

[Ja Rule]
Ja's flow so hot, niggaz don't wanna be near me when the bomb drops and I
Knew niggaz would fear me from the time I spit on wax
Niggaz was leery like who the fuck is this cat?
Ja baby, understand that, Rule one, second to none
When y'all bitches start stuttering I hit it and run
Cause I'm destined to cum on your tongue while we sexing
Like lubricant ruff ryde with the X-man
You be hollering, it could all be this simple
Know what? I'm gonna kiss you, cause daddy gonna miss ya
Now that's love when a nigga not wanna pimp on a hoe
But sometimes this love shit is claustrophob
And I love thy, love to send you hoes the money
Love bitches with attitude, a hundred miles of running
New York thugs, and my niggaz is pimps too
And your bitch chose me before they chose you nigga

Repeat 1 (2x)

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, uh-huh yo
We're here to make y'all rock
We're here to make y'all rock
We're here to make y'all rock
Shit it's nothing</pre>
