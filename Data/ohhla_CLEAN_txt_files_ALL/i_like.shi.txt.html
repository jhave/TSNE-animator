[MC Lyte]
Yeah
Soulpower
Shiro up in the house
Ugh, yeah, uh

First on my wishlist, missin you with the kiss
First time I seened you, you was looking fish
Raw deal is I'ma treat you like a four-course meal kid
and get you all up in my biz
Not too many more times I'ma let you know
You're on my mind day and night like how the moon glow
Won't see ya grow, I like to watch you over come up
Nice and slow, never do you have to run up

	[Chorus - Shiro]
	I like the way you make me feel
	You know that I like it
	You know that I like it baby hey
	I like the way you make me feel

[MC Lyte]
Yeah, ugh
Shiro come down

[Shiro]
When I'm feelin down, and no one's around
You're always there, I don't have to worry
And even at times, when I'm not myself
You'll never leave me, I could never be no one else
Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows
Takes all my cares away
Oooh boy, you turn me, ohohohwoh
Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows
What more can I say? I really like to feel this way

	[Chorus]
	I like the way you make me feel
	You know that I like it
	You know that I like it baby hey
	I like the way you make me feel (Uhhuh yeah)
	You know that I can't baby yeah

[MC Lyte - first line starts during chorus]
I got to feel it for ya baby now
They shoulda told you I'm a different type of hottie
Gimme the bot-ty, wan' the bot-ty
It's natural for me to give it what I got
I'm takin care of the circumference while I'm sittin on the top of the
world
That golden girl, true dat now
You give that ass a smack and I give that boo a twirl
See I'm lovin what you do to me, you're soothin me
and it's soon to be ecstasy when you're movin in me

[Shiro]
Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows
Takes all my cares away, boy you turn me, round and round
Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows
What more can I say? Ieeiei like the way

	[Chorus]
	I like the way you make me feel
	You know that I like it
	You know that I like it, heyy, ohh
	I like the way you make me feel 
	You know that I can't baby 

When you're around, your love is so good to me
I think about you every second of the day
No one can compare, to the joy that you bring to me (bring to me)
Can't nobody do me like you do

	[Chorus - Shiro (MC Lyte)]
	I like the way you make me feel
	(I'm diggin the way you make me feel)
	Like the way you do
	I like the way (ugh) you make me (ugh) feel 
	Boy don't you know, I like the way

	(Check it out y'all)
	I like the way you make me feel
	Round and round we go, where we stop nobody knows
	(Nobody knows)</pre>
