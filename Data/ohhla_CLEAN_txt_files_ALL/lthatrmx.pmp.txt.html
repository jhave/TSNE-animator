[Webbie]
Like that, like that
Bounce ya ass like that, like that
Bounce that ass like that, like that
Bend over, let me see it from the back

[Hook: Webbie]
Like Beyoncé, like Trina (bounce that ass like that)
Like a big booty ass black diva (bounce that like ass that)
Like a stripper, up and down like Flipper (bounce that ass like that)
Bend over, let me see it from the back

[Webbie]
Double shots of Hennessy, let it get you groovy
Gone work yo' ass, do ya thang, I'ma do me
I done switched to doja and the swisher, got a room key
Act like you auditioning for a video or movie
Bend towards the floor I want your hands where your toes be
I'ma squeeze all on you booty, all nasty
Done made 18, girl I'm legal, you can harass me
Cash and a Beamer, I can't seem to find a bad beat
A big fat ass like Trina make me happy
Titties shake, thighs shake, vibrate while she dancing
Like to shake her ass like Ciara real fancy
Wonder can Ciara shake that ass on this nine piece
Betcha Jada Pinkett shake that ass real classy
Ain't ready for the real, betcha she be lettin Will have it
You see me I'm picky, I rate that ass
I gotta ask 50 how Vivica shake that ass

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Pimp C]
I sent my bitch to Las Vegas, go and hit that lick (hit that lick)
I'm still tryna put some dick up in Vanity 6
Apollonia too (too), you know I'll bust you up (bust you up)
I want some three-way love, head, pussy, and butt
Ain't no shame in my game, I need a porno star
Lemme hit ya in ya ass and play it back in my car (back in my car)
I'm talkin Jeannie Pepper, I know that she feelin me
Take dick like a champ like a bitch named Kennedy
All it takes for me, bone, neck, and lay in they house
I know you real pimp niggaz, they know what I'm talkin about
Tell that girl Keyshia Cole she need to give me some pussy
She "shoulda cheated" with Sweet Jones 'cause that nigga's a rookie
'Fore I sweep through ya pussy like Rita or Katrina
Bitch thought Sweet Jones just might hit her
I told her like this, she can swallow this skeeter
Now hoe move around 'cause I really didn't need her

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Lil' Boosie]
I want a face like Beyoncé, a smile like Ashanti
Boosie and Paris Hilton, a caramel sundae
Bust it back, wide open, lemme see yo' inside
And lick yo' tongue at me (ooohhh!), that make my temperature rise
Lookin for Teairra Mari, I can "make you feel good"
Ciara can get it too, Olivia I'm feelin you
I need lips like Fantasia, put me to sleep
Talk nasty like Trina (ooohhh!), I need me a freek
I like to lay back, fuck bitches with two or three Georgia Peaches
They argue before they eat it, like Puffy they need Jesus
Like to smoke a purple blunt while you play with that cock
And while I knock off yo' top, I want Lil' Webbie to watch
Yo gon' let Webbie see my candy, yeah? Girl that's how we play that there
Eve? I better not see yo' tail nowhere
'Cause I'ma talk that koochie out the drawers (say what!?)
You want me to be Santa Clause, you gon' have to break it off like...
