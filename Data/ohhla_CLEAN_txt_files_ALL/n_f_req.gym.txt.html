[Verse 1]
I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another myspace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit 'send'
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing, honestly it made me only want you more
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labled 'urgent'
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name
But the fact that you're hittin me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moments
And now I'm emailing my love a dozen digital roses

[Chorus]
So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Just click approve, you're killing me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's face it, it's a sad situation
when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis
Love you to leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of 1 to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damnit, I'd been waitin too long
I even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)
But its hard for me to not hate
When I'm on myspace I never see my face in your "Top 8"
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a "lol" matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?
If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back
and forth for three days (rephrase)
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and "Ichat"
Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet (shit)
And be persistent until my name is under "who you'd like to meet"

[Chorus]

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smittin with your pictures wishin you would feel the same
I'll admit I get a lil jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense
Make me out, romancing the thought
of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin you out
And if you love then what I'm speaking about, then say something
I check my inbox 10 times and there ain't nothing
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah its time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, xoxo dash Travis
