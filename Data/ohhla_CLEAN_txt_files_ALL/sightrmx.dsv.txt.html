Inhale... Waiting to ex. from the speculation
As my mind rotates in that 360 rotation
Verbal sedation's eliminating the hesitation
From the fascination that I'm facing, 
but why am I facing fascination in the first place?
The first taste of simple rejection would be the worst case, in my thoughts...
The first taste of should be the most unforgettable
But the curse is laced with strict questions thats hypothetical
Like how pathetically am I facing this situation?
Will I ever make it real, 
or forever will it be a simulation of constant struggle and frustration
Immediate thoughts of lost motivation fills my brain capacity
While drasticaly i'll put in effort, and your response is fast asleep
But still many men are passing me, really it has to be
An offering that you can accept
That I possess, but still I stress 
and ponder the thought of you just saying yes
But we all know that will never be cause qualities in my anamotomy
Could all be postive and that still wont matter see
And again and again I try, you say no, and I say why?
Then I try to lie to myself and say you're really not that fly
But then I face reality and come to senses with my self
And put my egotistical ways, way back up on the shelf...
Cause on my impulses I'll act
With a major effort to get my sight back

** Hook ** (X2)
If love is blind, why can't I hand it vision?
And how did I get myself in this position?
But I got to keep switching...Back and forth, forth and back...
Side to side with an effort to get my sight back...

Elevate while my thoughts stay between that fine line
Which be seperating life from love and hate
I close my eyes and slowly meditate, hesitate, trying to set it straight
Taking in big pictures while observations try to evaluate
The scences that revolve around me, suspiciously
Worshipping qualities religiousley, while physically not catching a vibe
It seems that I'm always so underrated
Cause the longer that I'm waiting lets others start escalating
To the plateau that I had so anticipated
Then I finally reach my peak and find the premises evacuated
Obstacles that were faced left me infatuated
Fascinated at the third degree, you see...
I plea and contemplate, try to rebalance my situation, 
Words merely for conversation
My feelings are based upon a pure relationship
Blew a kiss then said peace and salutations

** Hook ** (X2)

Paradoxically elusive, but yet intrusive into my life
This girl as wife...conductive to nice, love to seduce this
Abusive? I'll never get, girl bet
Hard to hit somebody when you're steady lying up in bed for weeks on end
Which succinctly describes our scenario
Moving together at a rhythm that be very slow
Up and down 'til we reach that delectable crescendo
Somewhat like a sexual merry-go-round
On the agenda next? More sex I suspect
At least that's what I select
Might as well my shit remains erect for hours on end
With the power to bend girlfriend
Like wilted flower stems
When were done we take a shower and then
Mutual backrubs to ease those kinks
From kinky athletics where the stress is on aesthetics
But never prosthetics cuz I can't get with incisions
If the love ain't natural, I'll leave blind and keep the vision missing
