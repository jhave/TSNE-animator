Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  (x5)
2Mex (x37)

Los Angeles lungs, love in lower lights
Oceans of organic opals overwright
Subliminal sorcerers satellite

Attempt sacrificion after life, after light
Not natural night
Giggling girls, gigabytes
Earth ending, extraterrestrial heights
Lyrically lines lynch the laptop leopard
Each execution emphasizes effort
Synonym surgery, satellite sits

Heatedly(?), I'm hearsay, hollow point hits
Indigenous idiosyncrasies
Pulling pistols upon political enemies

Hard-hider(?) holding Hell's history
Older organs, odd and ?older league?
Pathological purgery

World wide emergency, why wouldn't we
Introduce ideas instantly, intricately
Live and lift off a linear leaf
Leveling off illogically

Several sonic subjects asleep
All audible angels alive asking
Vibrate invisible visionary vaccine
Escape exactly

Tackling those that try to track me
Heartfelt hello to hard heroes hacking
Everyone evolve, elevate eye

"We won" is worth the wait, we wonder why
Obstacle absorb outside
Re-revolutionize your rubbery ride
Leave losers lurking in levels of lye
Don't doubt dissention, deserters will die

Word, word... word, word, word, word
Word, word... word, word, word, word
Mum's the...   (x8)</pre>
