Wu-Wu-Tang the-the-the Legion of Doom

[Method Man] talking
Yo!
L.O.D. Killa Beez Wu-Tang
Baby Yeah!
50 Grand Method Man

[50 Grand]
They say L.O.D. this and L.O.D. that
Its L.O.D. when I walk L.O.D. leaves tracks
You better love L.O.D. L.O.D. won't fail
L.O.D. gang related half a mill for bail
Feds like the soundscan wanna see what I sale
L.O.D. know how to do it big without no mail
And they all wanna see how L.O.D. be wilin'
Wit the Ticallion Stallion from Shaolin Island

[Chorus]
Meth:  And it was what it is when it was when it wasn't
       And if it ain't that Grand what could it be?
Grand: And if it ain't that Meth what could it be?
Meth:  And if it ain't the Wu?
Grand: Yo Its the L.O.D!

[Method Man]
They sayin Wu-Tang this and Wu-Tang that
But they dont fuck wit Wu-Tang cuz Wu-Tang got straps
Like hos in hair salons boy Wu-Tang got wraps
I'm dope syringe in your arm the boy got tracks (Ya Heard!)
I'm noddin' on beat, I'm mobbin' on streets, the method
Be starvin' to eat, cigar in my cheek, forget it
The L.O.Ds in here, the Killa Beez in here
If you ain't drinkin' and smokin' you shouldn't be in here

[Chorus]
Meth:  And it was what it is when it was when it wasn't
       And if it ain't that?
Grand: Meth what could it be?
Meth:  And if it ain't that Keith what could it be?
Grand: And if it ain't the Wu?
Keith: Its Keith Murray!

[Keith Murray]
They sayin Keith done this and Keith done that
But they don't fuck wit Keith cuz Murray'll snap
Its the mack maniac rap insaniac
L.O.D skull and cross bone on my back
Its no hassle, you could killed for 500 dollas like Alfalfa
From the Little Rascals
I'm like the drug that was your worse enemy
Came back to be your best friend
And fried you in the end

[Chorus]
Meth:  And it was what it is when it was when it wasn't
       And if it ain't that Grand what could it be?
Grand: And if it ain't that?
Meth:  Keith what could it be?
Keith: And if it ain't the Wu?
Grand: Yo its the L.O.D!

[50 Grand]
I crush everything and everyone within my clutch
My speech break bricks in half I'm still out to lunch
L.O.D wit the Method we fuckin' wit ninjas
Bit wit the rap bug caught the influenza
Lyrically I'll air you out, Meth clear you out
You like a mistake when I'm writin' gotta smear you out
I go ballistic on second thought I give you a break
Cut you into little pieces and mail you to every state

[Method Man]
We off the meter off the block or straight off the street
We in your party like when pit bulls of the leash
Yes, when Meths wit the Legion of Doom
Pack your shit up your life will be leavin' you soon
Picture big dick daddy in a big sick caddy
My hoe even sicker wit a big thick fatty
Lord! Somebody pinch me this can't be real
I'm ill like action flick stars that can't be killed

[Keith Murray]
And I ain't never met a sucker and we got a long
I ain't never smoked no blunt that wasn't too strong
We been D4L before D4L
Rock wit the Funk Doc shut down the whole jail
When Plus got killed L.O. rushed the courthouse
I'll smack that talk back in your mouth
The L.O.D's in here, the Killa Beez in here
If you ain't gettin' rowdy you shouldn't be in here

[Chorus]
Meth:  And it was what it is when it was when it wasn't
       And if it ain't that Grand what could it be?
Grand: And if it ain't that?
Meth:  Keith what could it be?
Keith: And if it ain't the Wu?
Grand: Yo Its the L.O.D?
