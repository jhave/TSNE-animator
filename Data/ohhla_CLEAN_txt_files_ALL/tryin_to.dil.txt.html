Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

[Chorus]
Just tryin' to breathe
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
("I'm just tryin' to breathe")

[Iriscience]
The summer felt like the winter, and I ain't talkin' bout weather
I see a "Cold World" like the GZA
It's a blizzard out here - you holdin', twist up
But don't sneak tobacco in my rizzla
I'm from where they jack cats for their turkish links
Swatch watches, Fila and (?)
They took Jordan 1 and 2's right off your feet
If you fought back and warranted you caught more beef
The '80s was so crazy, cats are still afraid
of Daryl Gates, the chokehold, crack and gangs
I hustled but I made it through a crack in the game
While a lot of homies got trapped back in the day
From where ugly polution brings a beautiful haze
Sunset rays, orange-lavender fase
Tryin' to keep my chips up and protect my plate
But the police watch every breath I take

[Chorus]
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
("I'm just tryin' to breathe")

[Evidence]
Yeah, tryin' to live, tryin' to eat
I stay up, sometimes it's hard, try to sleep
I'm a livewire in a cold world
I'm no liar, just try to bend the truth to girls
So far doin' my job, gettin' it done
Up before the sun, try to come home before the sun
Shit repeats, days turn to weeks
The object, try to have doe to show for them beats
I was told the world gets colder
Colorado air is thin, sold-out in Boulder
Much more in control gettin' older
And much music love if you cross the border
Once the coast is clear we smokefest in here
Clouds so thick you can see the glare
Peace to reef, we got blessed on the beat
West to East, we share the same air, tryin' to breathe

[Chorus]
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
("I'm just tryin' to breathe")

[Evidence]
Prepare for the worst, expect the best
Haven't pulled the heat but still wear the vest
Expansion Team's like the firm 'til death
They want last laugh, we want last breath
We all Stereo, T-H-X
On the radio, station gets respect
It's love and war, we accomodate those
We could both breathe or step up, you're next to go

[Iriscience]
Some breath control, watch 'em get exposed at shows
A lot of cats are born in studios, it shows
I inhale and exhale magical flows
Jump off stage, hit the booth to capture the globe
Accurate, spectacular though
I feel like the industry is tryin' to capture my soul
I feel like Muhammad goin' at it with Joe
For fresh air we bring it to you live on the road

[Chorus]
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
It's my world 'til it's time to leave
Just tryin' to breathe
("I'm just tryin' to breathe")
