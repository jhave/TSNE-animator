Her name was Stephanie something
She lived out in Richville, right off of Portland
I'm talking bout back in the ninth grade
Still had a pony tail, couldn't grow a high fade
Used to take the 5 way out to the suburbs
Waitin at the bus stop, there was my lovebird
She would get on, sit down, scoot me over
And smile with a jheri curl restin on my shoulder
And we would hit the mall together
Maybe hold each other's hand or share a Dr. Pepper
And all we ever did was kiss, no sex
But in our defense, there was never any stress

On the phone late at night when I'm supposed to be in bed
Mama doesn't know I'm talking to Lynette
I had a lot of sweet nothing to say
You could say a whole lot of nothing has changed to this day
We was fourteen, but she had breasts
Although we was both too young for anything sexual
Just wanted her to know that she was special
She used to write me notes, do you like me, yes no?
And I don't know if it was practice for later
But both of us would break up back to spend time together
I don't ever remember trying to make her feel bad
Back then we didn't see things like that

There used to be a spot called the Boulevard theatre
And as a kid when a movie came out I would see it there
Sneakin in to the R-rated feature
I think I was fifteen, that's how I met Lisa
She showed up with a group of fly girls
So me and my crew was in superfly world
After the flick we all went outside
Paired off, took a walk into that night
I can't imagine that happening now
The inner sense is gone and all the magic ran out
I wonder if my son will get to understand the fun 
That comes from the summer with the one you call the one

There used to a be a fear and a nervousness
But back then it wasn't cause of domestic disturbances
It used to just hurt your heart
But now it's not enough until it rips the universe apart
Got to see a lot of love when I was a kid
Heartbreak made me wanna die but I never did
So this is for my own babysitter, 
Wanted to sneak out and fall asleep by the lake with ya
Smells like candy, felt like family
For every girl that ever held me in the back seat
Used to vision being love struck with em
Till I got blindsided by these grown-up women</pre>
