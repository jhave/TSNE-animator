Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
"I got my swagger right, I got my swagger right"
(Mike Jones!) {It's a Big E beat}
"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I got my swagger right" (let's get 'em E)
"I got my swagger right, I got my swagger right"
"They said that I was broke, now they lookin sour right"

[Mike Jones]
I swear befo' the money came - all the girls were dissin me
Now they see me on TV and now they run up kissin me (ha ha)
Swagger to the ceiling I just did a show in Italy
My swagger worldwide, bet they know me if you mention me
Because

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"I got my swagger right, I got my swagger right"
"I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I got my swagger right"
"I got my swagger right, I got my swagger right"
"They said that I was broke, now they lookin sour right"

[Mike Jones]
I swear befo' the fame came - I was "Ballin' Underground"
Makin money independent 'til my solo came around
"Who Is Mike Jones?" My swagger to the ceiling
{I screwed the world down} when I sold a couple million
I'm flossin and I'm tippin, Momo woodgrain I'm grippin
I'm Gucci over butter while I'm purple drank sippin
I said I'm flossin and I'm tippin, Momo woodgrain I'm grippin
I'm Gucci over butter while I'm purple drank sippin
Because my swagger to the ceiling, swag-swagger to the ceiling
Two-fo's on the Bentley now my swagger to the ceiling
My swagger to the ceiling, my swagger to the ceiling
They say that Mike Jones fell off but I'm so on in my city
Because

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I'm so shiny, foes so glassy
Hoes they want me, yeah they so nasty
Swagger up high in the sky when I ride
745 on 22 inch tires
Your hoe she on my ride, your hoe she on my dick
She be like "Mike Jones he the shit," hop in my 5 and hop in my 6
She on me because I'm it, love the fact that I stay rich
Love the fact I come through candy-painted drop the bumper kit
She already know I'm paid, house blades, Escalade, with a maid
that'll clean up and do me and you right now because I'm paid
(Because I'm paid) I ain't trippin about what these haters say
I just keep my swagger up and let these haters fade away
Because

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
Lil' momma love me, she love my big ol' chain
Love the way that my paint get blang when I'm out in my drop on swang
Love the way that I grip that grain {lil' momma she in love with my swag}
{Love with my swag, love love with my swag}
She love that big ol' chain, love the way that my panky rang
shine when I'm in the turnin lane, always be on me hard
When I come through on the boulevard, lil' momma she love my swag
Lil' momma love me, lil' momma love me
{Lil' momma love me}

[Chorus]</pre>
