Intro: Puff Daddy

Every day I wake up
I hope I'm dreamin
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole knot
I saw your son today
He look just like you
You was the greatest
You'll always be the greatest
I miss you Big
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again...

Yeah... this right here (tell me why)
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved (c'mon, check it out)

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be (uh-uh)
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend (uh-huh)
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living your life, after death 

Chorus: Faith Evans

Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missing you

[Puff] I miss you Big

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

It's kinda hard with you not around (yeah)
Know you in heaven smilin down (eheh)
Watchin us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
Til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you friend
Memories give me the strength I need (uh-huh) to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define (can't define)
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the 6, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me taking flicks
Makin hits, stages they receive you on
I still can't believe you're gone (can't believe you're gone)
Give anything to hear half your breath (half your breath)
I know you still living you're life, after death 

Chorus

[Faith Evans] Somebody tell me why

Interlude: Faith Evans

On that morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

Outro: 112

Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
Every night I pray, every step I take
	[Puff] Every day that passes
Every move I make, every single day
	[Puff] Is a day that I get closer
	[Puff] To seeing you again
Every night I pray, every step I take
	[Puff] We miss you Big... and we won't stop
Every move I make, every single day
	[Puff] Cause we can't stop... that's right
Every night I pray, every step I take
Every move I make, every single day
	[Puff] We miss you Big
