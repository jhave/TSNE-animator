Verse 1: Dray

Well I'm suprised, open your eyes because it's me, G
I mention I sling the slang wit me and my man just like it's a frisbee
Ya flimsy, my thinga-majig is the illest, I throw it like Willis
Heiman, when I'm rhymin I'm makin the pape's like Simon
says ta, my stick it ta master, I still be the best-a
I figgity [fuck] the flame but in the sun, now time for Esther
So hi-ho I'm Silver, I'm makin the pape's when I kicks
the [shit] that'll make you muck when I lose his fleas, lice and his ticks
For the chicks, I be on my good foot, you get that ass kicked
So yibbida yabber yoozy, [fuck] that floozy Suzy Chapstick
So here boy, here boy, come get some, it's Krazy
I'm swingin my Dukes of Hazard just like ???? on Daisy
I'm swayze

Chorus

Verse 2: Books

Aiyo well here's the story, niggas is sleepin, nighty nighty
Lord almighty, I'm bringin it live G, see I be
flippin and rippin a tongue but some niggas don't seems to digs me
so I switch, B, like Billy Bigsby cos I'm the [shit], G
U hoo Dixie, they dribblin in they Timberlands
I criminal mix styles, oh I flow like adrenaline
Yikes man, the nigga is nice man so thinkin I lost it
but I be icin crews wit the flakes til they frosted
So hip hip hooray, wantin me while I do a
new way to school a new jay, you say
"Holy Shamrocks, the man rocks with no beef or ham hocks"
Oh yes-in, send the rest in, peace to grandpops

Chorus

Verse 3: Dray

Well um, knock knock, who's that? Guess what? My crew's back
rippin the hip-hop, Penelope pitstop
Doin the bitin, the shit I be writin, you're givin me rabies
They oughta be usin my terms for sperm and makin babies
Hey ladies, I know my A-B's, I'm makin CD's
I heard you was eatin your spinach boy, you better be eatin your Weeties
Comprendo, so let your friends know I'm losin my noodle
cos when it be time to doodle, I lose my scruples, ask my pupils
I'm the slippery slang slipper, quick to clip a QB
Shooby dooby dooby, I do that new G
So you be Kool &amp; The Gang and I puts my slang in
Hangin loosely, oh yes G, niggas be wantin to test me

Chorus

Verse 4: Books

Hear ye, hear ye, don't look any further G, see he here is
Still mic checkin [shit], still Dead Serious
Hello there, I didn't go nowhere, whatup with the static G?
I be damagin niggas' fronts like them creases in your cavity
For real though, jumpin jallopy's, I'm rougher than hockey 
I drop these bumpy cos my style is knock-kneed
So me and my-a, I'm flyer than the witches sweeper
Jeepers, keep ya jump, jump into it like Aretha
I Boogie Bang bang the thang like a cramp style slant
Niggas be tryin to hang but they can't G
Will agains, I'm gettin elegant with the skill again
It don't mean a thang if I ain't got my philly, kid

Chorus (x2)
