Hey yo put your hands up
Put your hands up

Put 'em up
Hey yo make some noise in here man

Give it up for G Unit
No no no
I want a warm Jamaican tropical welcome
Give us a warm welcome
some hospitality for the GGGGGG G Unit
DJ Whoo Kid
You know we smoke yo

So you know I got to do something
Drop a beat man
Hold it hold it
