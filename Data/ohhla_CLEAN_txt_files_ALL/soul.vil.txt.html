(Verse 1: T3)
There I was sittin there lookin, waitin
Waitin for the chance to get to date you
I'm sayin, I'm sick of games, sick of solos
Sure need you around when its all those
Listen, I'm not sayin this to offend you
But since the day I met you I knew I would bend you, over
Not sayin its about that
Its about us bending like vocals on ill tracks
Classic, like a novel by Stephen King
Always restin by the revel where a social reign
Sex, its the farthest thing from my mind
I'm thinkin how we get together like the starter line
Fiction, to all the ladies that want it real
A breif description on how a nigga might feel
This is, one page out a black book
This is, how it goes when its all good, sista

(Chorus x4)
And back, forth and forth, back

(Verse 2: Elzhi)
Just keep the sun in my storm clouds
Appreciate you as a man I was born child, young
Lookin for young girls to party with
Make your body shift, shake up your cartilidge, women
I wasn't satisfied with just one
I'll rip your valentine and having time adjusting, its hard
I thought not a soul could change me
You honor roll, I was down with hoes in grade C, level
I guess there is roses in the ghetto
Gotta find them, always meet the dozen not he dimond, coal
Been supportive now my days shorter
When they was longer dealin with the side effects were calmer, mistakes
I tripped over in my early days
Making the skies over few look a pearly gray, dirty
Until you came along and laid it on
I'll stick with you even if my man say its wrong, for real

(Chorus x4)

(Verse 3: Baatin)
Since its my last joint I guess I gotta put it down
For the queens who fiend for the kings who come around
I wanna extend the jewels to the crown
Behold you are soul that is lost never found
Still a virgin cause you untouched
Fukin around with low-life niggas, gettin fucked
You need a king to put it down right
I know you want something thats more than just a one night
Stand tall never fall for the less queen
Nieve niggas with tired ass raps stuck in his dreamstate
With his truck and his real estate, fell for the bait
Not knowing he's tryna change what's sealed in his fate
Just a mouse lookin through a crack
Of the gates to a soul never coming back
Cultivaters never laid to realize self
And when its done the queen of queens will complete your wealth

(Chorus x4)</pre>
