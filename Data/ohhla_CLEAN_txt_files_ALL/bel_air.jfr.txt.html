now this is a story all about how
my life got flipped turned upside down
and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I become the prince of a town called Bel-Air

in west Philadelphia born and raised
on the playground is where I spent most of my days
chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
and all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
when a couple of guys who were up to no good
started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mon scared
and said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
she give me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
first class yo this is bad
drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
is this what the people of Bel-Air live like
hmmm this might be all right
but wait I hear they're prissy ???? and all that
is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat
I don't think so I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

well uh the plane landed and when I came out
there was a dude looked like a cop standin' there with my name out
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightening disapeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
the licensce plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
if anything I could say that this cab was rare
but I thought man forget it yo homes to Bel-Air

I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
and I yelled to the cabbie yo homes smell ya later
looked at my kingdom I was finally there
to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
