Hahaha, OWWWWWW!
We just keep smokin and smokin and smokin
Hehehe, I enjoy myself!
I eventually expect to fall out one of these days
But fuck it... whattup?

M-I-double-L-I-O-N's
Got cash, can't trust some of my old friends
Niggaz ain't walk this path of my old Timbs
Let me find out it's my lawn that there's potholes in
Cause P ain't Posdonus, smoke blunts like a rasta
Hold uzis in a mobster suit
The Bugati got ostrich seats, my gosh I'm loose
Pick up 50 G's a morning with my orange juice
Now, you don't know me and you don't want to
Cause - six in the mornin, I'm comin to hunt you
Give it a little time, I have the country sewed
Cause I did more dirt than a country road
Frankly I don't give a damn like, Humphrey Bog'
20 bricks, 50 pounds that's my monthly load
Nigga watch the pump explode, you can jump if you want
But I'ma dump 'til I ran the globe (c'mon)

[Chorus: T. Waters]
Who's that makin that God damn noise?
That's S.P., Waters and them D-Block boys
Don't worry 'bout a scrap daddy, we pop toys
So don't go fuckin with them D-Block boys
Now now now who that makin that God damn noise?
That's S.P., Waters and them D-Block boys
Don't worry 'bout a scrap daddy, we pop toys
So don't go fuckin with them D-Block boys

[T. Waters]
Street dreams consist of triple beams
A vest'll connect with the best for red seams
A M-16 for fiends with heavy habits
Why wait on him when Waters already have it?
Spread to the West, started with petty traffic
Get a gassy nigga ass and dead him with some matches
Now he ashes, no need for a casket
Fuckin bastard, I'm the greatest, young Cassius
Squeeze first or get hit 'til your knees hurt
And do top {?} free work on your t-shirt
Usually with bitches I start with the beat first
But I'ma show these niggaz that beef hurt
Now now now, I stay true to my tattoos
One life to live, forgive me T. Waters a fool
I used to sell weed, half quarters at school
Put some bread on his head, I'll slaughter the dudes, ya heard?

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
You don't wanna be in the coma
Fuckin with this Ruff Ryder artist, D-Block owner
Any liquor I drink I chase with Coronas
Rap so hard niggaz tryin to clone us
Needed a Ghost Rider you just shoulda phoned us
You really ain't gangster cause you been woulda showed us
Whattup homey, whattup cuz
I keep a orange boxcutter and I don't cut up rugs
Mad beef jumpin off is what a whattup does
If I felt like the vibe was wrong, that's my word
12 gauge mausberg, your side is gone
Now some of y'all is joinin, some of y'all retirin
You need a hit man, I'm the one for hirin (call me)
I keep the dutch and the gun, still firin
Watch out for niggaz, cause feds got 'em wired in
First second third and fourth, I hear si-rens

[Chorus]
