Got the black and red seats with the Georgie tuft
And I got my helmet hanging out the window
Ready to bust the head of a fucking pretender
Nigga as soon as I enter you know I'm making noise

A-K bustin', I ride the whole clip

To sank ship is what I live for

[Young Buck]
Born in the dirty, dirty, stop and they still spinnin'
They tried to hit me like 50 but bitch I'm still livin'
Flinch and I get ya hit, do it like them Georgia boys
The A-K with the rubber grip, it's something they ain't seen before
Look Jon I think they scared, let's bring them down south
And show 'em how the Chevy's look and how our hoes bounce
Shorty don't want no trouble, shorty don't wanna fight
But let him keep talkin' I bet ya shorty gon' die tonight
I planned on gettin' put out the club before I came
My hood down for whatever, we all ride with them thangs
Breakin' bottles across niggaz heads, fuck what a hater said
Them gangstas don't live long as the ones that ain't breakin' bread
I tried to keep it up, just quit and let my man's get it
Don't see no bricks but I still got my hands in it
Cash then I turn a key, I told y'all I'm a blow it up
G-Unit soldier, my nigga, now come and throw it up

[Lil Jon]
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up

If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club</pre>
