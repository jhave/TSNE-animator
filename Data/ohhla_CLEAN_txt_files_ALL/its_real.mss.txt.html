[Intro]
Yeah, ohhh-ohh
Yeaahhh, yeaaa
I love you more then my mouth can say
I'll take a flight to kingston, anyplace
Just to be in yo face

[Verse 1]
From new york city to japan
I'll be there ba-by
Just call my phone and I'll come flying
On the next plane to you
Never worry cause I'm ya woman
And I promise ba-by
I promise you will be my man

[Chorus]
Cause baby it's real (real)
So real (so real)
Can't you tell by the look  in my face, yeah
Oh baby it's real (it's real)
So real (so real)
I hope your feeling the same
Cause baby it's real

[Verse 2]
I'll follow you right to the moon

Just so we can be close as cousins
With my heart out to you
I love you more then words can offer
Pay attention ba-by
I hope this never ends my lover

I don't wanna spend a day without you
I don't get tired of being by you
