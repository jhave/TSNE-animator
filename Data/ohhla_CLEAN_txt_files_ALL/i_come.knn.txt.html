Song:   I Come Prepared
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Set to high
Now calling all revolutionary youth
Dam Marley alongside K'naan
Gunpowder philosopher what some boy feel like

I made the list this year
I'm honour roll, you ain't know East African rock 'n roll
You don't know what time it is like your clock is old
You know ya'll packin' like the block is sold

How could it be from the deepest darkest of zero
To become king of New York like De Niro
And he ain't even from New York that's what's weird yo
But where he's from they just ratatatatatata

So come now don't you try to play the hero
Around here we've got pirates with torpedoes
Alongside all the warlords and beardos
The only city nigga's blacker than tuxedos

Baby girl let me get all up in your earlobe
And if you shut me down you can kill my ego
Which is my enemy makes you my amigo
So either way you and I are button and needle

And they say I might become big as a Beatle
But I don't let it get to my head or feet yo
And I got more street cred than legal
But just in case we keep a big, this eagle

Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, always
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared, yeah Zion youths
Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared

What was I on before this flow or sequel
Somethin' about how I thought I was a Beatle
I'm trippin' but it was something lethal
It was fresh but possessed something Medieval

I came solo I ain't even bring my army
The type of niggas that are always ruining the party
You know those socially inadequate Somalis
Who walk in uninvited in your VIP

And Africans love them some B.I.G.
But Tupac is official H.N.I.C.
And my job is to write just what I see
So a visual stenographer is what I be

Superman, superstar give me super-fat dough
So I can be super-rich and super phat so
But maybe not super fat but super stacked though
So I can fix some money shit on super back low

How many immigrants are this here sedan
And is anyone carryin' any contraband
Not really but I'm late for my concert man
And here's a card for my lawyer Mr. Sam Goldman

Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared [4X]

[?]

Cause the Marleys and Somalis are some mad people
We a travel with some long strap in a vehicle
And a screech across the border like a Latino
Moving through the LAX's and London Heathrow
Wait, man a gangsta we no star freak show
No gimmicks nor shenanigans a real street flow

Fi mi women ha fi hier than a Flamingo
Real bullet we a bust and a no Placebo
K'Naan have so much gun him open gun depot
And we take way boy gun just like we a gun repo
So tell some tosse MC there's no more free throw
Soon as we finish a clip another clip reload because

Yeah, I come prepared, I come prepared, I come prepared [6X]</pre>
