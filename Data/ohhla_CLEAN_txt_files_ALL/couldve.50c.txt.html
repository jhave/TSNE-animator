[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah! 50! 

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I gave her books to read, fed her mind with knowledge
Gave her street smarts, shit you can't get in college
She's a reflection of me, 'til you know she the shit
If I'm a star she a star, If I'm rich she rich
That's my dog, I tell her stay she wanna go
I tell her go she wanna stay
That's my dog, you a bitch don't usually mean nothin to me, that's right
But that's my dog I go left, she go right, I go up, she go down
She couldn't listen that, she ain't around
So ungrateful, screamin I hate you, she must got amnesia, bitch I made you
Now, just think, just think that could've been you
Just think, that should've been you
Yeah, wit me, I share the world with you
But you ain't ride with a rider so I ain't fuckin with you

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too now how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
But you trippin, while we sippin, in the back of the club big tippin!!

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Some say it hurts when you supposed to win, then you lose
You were supposed to be sure, baby you was confused
I had a thang for ya, I had a ring for ya
House, cars, kids and a pet, and name for ya
Pussycat told ya I make it, you ain't believe
I guess 'cause comin up was hard, it was easy to leave
Now think about it, maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Either way shorty, life goes on (For sure!)
When you around, my smile's a grin, my thoughts are a sin
You ask me can we try again, I ain't fuckin witchu (Naw!)
It's on, the club jumpin, I'm tryna get my liquor and
You wanna suck the dick again, I'm starin at your thicker friends (Wassup ma?)
I guess I'm like Will Smith in "Pursuit of Happyness"
In my hood, we all hustle and in pursuit of the same shit
Now just think (Just think) That could've been you
Now just think that should've been you, with me
I share the world witchu,
but you ain't ride with a rider, so I ain't fuckin witchu

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Say, say, say girl, come here, no, you, no, her, yeah, you, gooooo!!
The reason you didn't get dick
because you got your nose up your ass like your smellin your shit
But tonight you met your match (WHOOOOOA OHHHHHH WHYYYYYY!!!)
Cause I be smellin my shit too nut how you like that?!
You could've had this dude and anything you choose 
And now girl you lose cause I ain't fuckin with ya
(Could've been you!!!) Shoppin sprees, drop top hair blowin in the wind
(Could've been you!!!) Livin lavish instead it's your girlfriend
And it ain't no other way to put it except
I know you understand it girl it's so...
But you see us in the back of the club
poppin bottles and it could've been you, but nope!!!!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Said it could've been......could've been you yeah!!!!!!
Said it could've been......It could've been yooouuuuuuuu!!!!!</pre>
