Look, up in the sky (SOOP-soop...)
It's a bird         (SOOP-soop...)
IT'S A PLANE!!      (SOOP-soop...)
Nah motherfuckers   (SOOP-soop...)
Hahaha

[Verse One]
I was, flyin through the motherfuckin sky
With my blunt full of lye, boom-ba-zee on five
Code name beez the Soopa-Man cock my Luger
Blast on state trooper, I'm on the run G
I've got these hoes spreaded, from Japanese to diabetics
Toes stay painted because of my foot fetish
You damn right, they had to ban me from eatin pussy all night
W-W-F and then just
slammin in the rope like Sean Mike
I can't be touched bitch, I disco in kryptonite
Shit I'm broke as hell
I had to buy all my girls fifty-fo'-eleven Reeboks at wholesale
Almost got caught boostin out of Bodell's
Bitches on my coattails like they coat rails
Can't even go in a jam without a bitch grabbin my hand
and squeezin my ass sayin "Youse the man!"
That's who the fuck I be
I got a, college degree, on bomb-zee and wreckin MC's
Makin shit happen like Lil' Cease
I come from a land of fontum leaf, bark from trees
that stick in your hand, and lakes rollin sea-weed
Criminals be up to no good
So I tuck a heater
Bulletproof suit still in the fuckin cleaners, but anyways
I bumped into my neighbor Johnny Blaze
Told me there's a bitch up the block who got more cock than AK's
The bitch just moved in, in building 210
Right next door to the Fantastic Four, and the Penguin
Good lookin Johnny, five-oh's right behind me
Let me act like I know and get ghost
Tuck in my Nina-Ross, get my cape and shades
Now I'm off with the Soopaman Three antidote

("While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse")
Cause I am so cool
("When I raise my trigger finger all y'all niggaz hit the deck")
Cause I am so cool
("Cause ain't no need for that, hustlers and hardcore")
Cause I am so cool
("Raw to the floor, raw like Resevoir Dogs")
Cause I am so cool...

Aiyyo word up *cough cough cough hack*
*sniff* to make a long story short
*cough cough cough* and shit, I went
to the bitch house, and this what the fuck happened

[Verse Two]
Aiyyo, knock knock, "Who is it?"
"It's the Soopa, here to pay that ass a visit
 Heard you wasn't givin up your pussy
 So I got the right dick to get with
 Where yo' man at bitch?"  "He's out of town flippin biscuits"
"Well open up the do' den, before I start unloadin
 on your pussy from here and leave it swollen"
"Aiyyo how I know it's you?"  "Aiyyo check my credentials"
"I eat yo' gun lead and shit out number two pencils
 I ate a ton of dog shit ain't never got sick
 Bitch I even know how many keys your man flip
 I'm low down and dirty, but not insane
 I know all these pussy ass cops by their first name
 Smoked a pound of Purple Rain and kept control
 Bitch I was the third nigga on the grassy knoll
 And you askin me, how you know it's the Soopa
 Open the door, I just blast on state trooper"
She opened up the door, and I walked in
She grabbed the hammer, and nailed it till I'm locked in
I said, "Yo whassup bitch?  You must be trippin
 You must wanna see how this thirty-eight be spittin"
"Nah nah boo, it's my ex-boyfriend, he be buggin
 He can't take it no more than I don't wanna fuck him
 I was gonna get this nigga Faride to snuff him"
"Well if he come back through, I'm not talkin I'm bustin
 Zip my zipper down bitch and start suckin
 Get your anus wet for long dick fuckin"
"Oooh, I like the way you talk, just Put It In My Mouth"
"Yeah, and I'ma keep that shit in when I'm comin"
Fucked for thirty-six minutes and twelve seconds
"Hit it from the back yo" oh yeah bitch no question
Turn that ass around, she had tattoos of names on her back
She said, "I keep track"
I started readin her back I couldn't believe
I read one name it said EPMD
I turned her ass around I said no it couldn't be
It was the J-to-tha-A-to-tha-N-to-tha-E
Her pussy walls grabbed my dick so I'm stuck
So I burnt that ass from that blunt hash that I lit up
"Owwwww!!" She jumped up, puffed up, started yellin
I smacked her, cracked her, put her in a full nelson
"Okay, okay, okay, okay, I give up
 Besides Soopaman Luva, I think I hear my nigga"
Aiyyo car pulls up, he steps up *skreech* and stick his keys in
The door opened, I snatched him up for no reason
Gave him a two piece with a biscuit, laid him out
Oh shit, it was that nigga Parrish Smith!</pre>
