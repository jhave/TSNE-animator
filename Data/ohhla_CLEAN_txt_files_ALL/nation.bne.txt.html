Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog 
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Krayzie: 

I've been tryin ta gather my niggaz from battle 
We outta control we can't be handled 
We sick of police and these scandals 
44. Magnums bust'en at random at em
In the Middle of the Chaos 
Tell'em we bust'en our shit at the mayor
If he get caught up there's nothing ta save ya 
Gauge a spray ya break ya down to were
In front of the parkin lot 
I'm murderin niggas that point to shoot it 
If it aint black owned than we loot it
Burn this bitch down, lets do it 
We ain't marchin' we ain't talkin' 
We keepin' an eye on the target
So as soon as the shit get started 
We gone poppop papop that riot 
Pumpin that Violence-ee (Violence)
POPO don't want peace 
They want this robot in the streets with me and my T.H.U.G's
BITCH you freeze 
You under arrest and you got the right to die
And guess who's pullin the switch 
And I can't wait ta see ya fry

Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog 
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Layzie:

I never did have no love for the system man 
Them laws ain't built to protect me
I'm just a nigga tryin ta live the american dream 
When you wanna arrest me 
And for WHAT
BeCause I'm shinning Blinging 
Mad because I'm rhyming Singing
Got too much money Got too many guns 
Yo pitiful life ain't got no meaning
And I know you Scheming 
LIL Burna done got legit now 
Bitch you sit on the ground you get on the ground
You ain't talking that shit now 
Wanna spit rounds we can go there
Capo bring that regime and handle it 
Capo just strapped wit Tec's and nine's 
For busten in the sky gotta grenade launcher
Ain't nothing to do today 
So what i'm a do im a bust on tha cops 
Shoot tha street lights out on the block dial 911 sit back and watch 
I can hear them sirens comin 
I'm a teach these fools not to fuck with me
And The outcome was a catastrophe 
Do this once a week till my brothers free

Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Bizzy:

United we stand divided we fall 
For the same bullshit like snipers on Whitehouse lawn's
On that goodshit 
Niggas from Compton to Africa 
On that thug shit 
Reginold Deney No Comment
I lost my blood with the death of Carlos Davis Lord 
I can't love shit 
Thats the fullest extent thats giving
I'm above this deception I know they intentions 
With sworrrds made by Smith N Wesson
Pullin me weapon embracin me Lorrrd 
Feel the spirtual ressurection through my porrres 
When the souls of the Outlaws at war 
No College Scholarships jus' Calibers and Clips 
On the Blockwarrior plottin on Kingpin Licks 
Flip Burgers I jus' can't see it 
I'm a face mo c.r.e.a.m. with BONE THUGS in one night 
No Secret 
Fuck The Feds it ain't no love at all for me 
They pull me over with Police Dogs 
Lickin my Scrotum

Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog

Wish:

See Young Thug could tell me nothing 
Ya Fuck up I Shed blood 
Gotta leave this world with somethan
A realer nigga with more than I can handle 
The Drugs was at so thats were a mack Got caught up in a scandal
Police ain't right and we ain't neither 
Everybody want something equal 
Listen up my people
We gotta down get down for, right Now! 
Nigga fuck yo people 
And this is how we all (all) dream to get paid (paid)
Got us thinkin he's one of a kind he's better than everybody destroyin dreams
But don't you listen we can rise above it above it 
Nine times outta ten don't fuck that 
Cause they gon love it 
Quit fuckin with my people 
Wonder why
We react
These strong need to be left alone 
Yeaa 
And thats a fact

Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog 
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog 
Got no love for the Law-But I shed blood for my dog</pre>
