B.G. talking:
What's happening?
The Hot Boy$ got some feelings they like to get off they chest
And if these niggaz feel like we feel, then y'all niggaz real
Cause we feel like this here

B.G.:
I feel like niggaz can't fuck with me
I feel like someone wanna be B.G.
I feel Lil' Wayne will burn yo block so quick
I feel Turk will be quiet and take yo shit
I feel Juve will catch you slipping and unload the tech
I feel a big ass helicopter on the set
Sometimes I don't even know how I feel
But I feel if you hating shit goin' get real
I feel like goin' buy me a brand new car
I feel like the neighborhood superstar
I feel like goin' buy me a new rolex
I feel this album goin' bring a big royalty check
I feel this nigga mad cuz I fucked his bitch
I feel like this nigga could just suck my dick
I feel like we taking over the industry fo'' sho
I feel like this bitin'' wannabe soldiers already know
I feel like Fresh is the best at beats
I feel like when you hear this shit you goin' feel like me

Hook:  (B.G. and Juvenile)
Nigga fuck you, I feel just like you (3x)

B.G.:
You fucking with the B.G., you fucking with the whole crew

Young Turk:
I feel like niggaz trying to size me up
I feel like niggaz trying to bust me up
I feel like "Look, I can't be stopped"
I feel like me and my click too hot
I feel like hitting the block with four niggaz
I feel like the whole CMB made niggaz
I feel like hitting the ho after this ''cert
I feel like niggaz can't fuck with Juve, the B.G. and Turk
I feel like we bout to blow up in this world
I feel like if I gotta hustle I'mma sell some ?furl?
Sometimes I just feel like jumping shop
I feel if my rhyme got beat, I'mma ride
I feel if a nigga flex up I pop the ?tro?
I feel like I could a nigga ho if I want
I feel like just getting it how I live
I feel like respect my mind lemme feel how I feel

Hook

B.G.:
You fuck with Lil' Turk, you fucking with the whole crew

Juvenile:
I feel like I'mma lose my life for this
I feel like I'mma have to fight for this
I feel motherfuckers they goin' say I'm wrong
I feel niggaz goin' get buck when they hear my song
I feel like puttin' 20's on up in my car
I feel like taking these bitch niggaz to war
I feel I deserve me a platinum plaque
I feel I shouldn't have to ask for that
I feel y'all hos know a nigga want here
I feel y'all bitches know I'm holding my dick
I feel y'all know I'm bout to hit me a lick
I feel like goin' to Texas for me some brick
I feel the policeman making me sick
I feel like the law don't wanna see a nigga with shit
I feel like walking on my judgement now
I feel like ??? on a budget now

Lil' Wayne:
Nigga I feel like that everything I write somebody else will bite
I really think its the south fresh tracks they be tight
I just can't explain I feel like when 200 0 come it'll be out my way
I feel like the Hot Boy$ them should be the president
I feel like burning up yo body to leave no evidence
I feel like money is the most important thing next to my seater
I feel like I should have no bald head tramp up in my beamer
And I also feel that I'm also real
Ain't no rollie like my rollie, noone live like I live
And I, I feel that I'm one of a kind
I feel like niggaz call shot but they ain't got bitches like mine
I feel like tonight I'm goin' ride, ride
And if you feel you goin' die, die
Now baby, baby, baby what the deal
Respect my mind I'm just telling you how I feel

(the rest is talking)

I feel like letting 'em just bust that bitch out

Baby:

I feel like getting that ?alley goat? by myself
