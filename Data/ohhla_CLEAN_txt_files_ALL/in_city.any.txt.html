[Verse 1]
Somewhere out on that horizon
Out beyond the neon lights
I know there must be somethin' better
But there's nowhere else in sight
It's survival in the city
When you live from day to day
City streets don't have much pity
When you're down, that's where you'll stay

[Chorus]
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city

I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the city lights)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (I need a blunt so I can get high)

[Verse 2]
I was born here in the city
With my back against the wall
Nothing grows, and life ain't very pretty
No one's there to catch you when you fall
Somewhere out on that horizon
Far away from the neon sky
I know there must be somethin' better
And I can't stay another night

[Chorus]
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city (what, what, whoop, whoop, hey, hey)
In the city

I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the city lights)
I know there must be somethin' better (far away from the neon sky)
I know there must be somethin' better (I need a blunt so I can get high)</pre>
