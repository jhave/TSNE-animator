You don't wanna fuck around me dogg

I'm the hardest thing out here, watch a young nigga doubt this here
About this here, nothing really taking me out this here
I got this here, smoking plenty pot this year
You see this afro, sometimes I stash my rocks in here
I keeps it hot in here, I gots no fear
Let me give a shout out to my boy, bitch my glock in here
Who really wanna test the tank, well then come stop this here
A lyrical come come this Jones is on top in here
Get a glock in here, who say my beats don't knock in here
Womp, womp, swerlin birds about your lock in here
Not in here, nigga watch this here
I keeps the dub about the give it the fuck up
Cause somebody gonna pop they top in here.

You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
I don't think they hear me

Got up the game for bigger cash, keep one up in the hand just to let that 
trigger blast I'm smoking weed just to keep from whippin ya'll niggas ass
Wanna picture that, a bucked up coming out faces screaming out gimme that 
You wanna get it back, to the streets ain't no such thangs as lend me that 
Cause where I'm from, these streets is where you kill to be pealed
And what you claim bitch you better be real
Heard me, uh, and the way I feel I need me a bill
And you should know tank doggs don't heal
Uh, I'm the ghetto vet, my partner car pullisin', lately listenin' back
I woulda turned firm when a mack that would didn't blast
Fiend, Get It On Jones, ain't nothing sweet
Your guns from heat cause No Limit still run the streets
Woo

You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
But I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
But I don't think they hear me
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
You don't wanna fuck around me dogg
But I don't think they heard me</pre>
