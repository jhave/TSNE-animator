(Intro: B-Real) 
You know, there are times when, you run out of weed 
There's no one you can call 
But at last there is one person you can call - Weed Man 

(B-Real) 
I've had drop dates with no weed to smoke 
No roaches, no nothin' when I need to toke 
Damn, where can I find some shit to puff on 
damn I need the kye cause it's gettin' tough on me (me) 
Cause I'm a lumberjack and tree's 
get chopped up and packed up and sold to D 
Bolo's are free, did you hold one fee? 
Herchers for the herbics no waterin' the seeds 
Some of your friends just really see me 
cause sussin' this, losin' no GHC 
The pigs always wanna PH me, my gush hits harder than some GHB 
But some of these swine wanna hit off mine 
I just sit back, recline, and never waste time 
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man 
Call me and all inhale- "The Weed Man" 

(Chorus: Sen Dog) 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!! 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!! 

(B-Real) 
You can always call me all day, all light 
Service with a smile, make you feel all right (yeah!) 
From college-heads, co-ex and dreadlocks 
lawyers, teachers, doctors buy my stock 
So many call on me for what I got 
So many try to compete to take my spot 
Caked out, how many dimes dropped? 
How many times I lost one of my plots? 
The competiton was to knock me out 
The D.E.A. want to lock me out 
Broke in my home tryin' to sock me out 
But the true blue stoners never locked me out 
I'm easy to find, call me whenever 
You need some green and I'll make you feel better 
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man 
Call me and inhale - "The Weed Man" 

(Chorus: Sen Dog) 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!! 

(B-Real) 
I'm the most well-loved, bringin' the bud 
Stickin' the club up, everybody ridin' my nuts 
What? You say you want credit? You must be high 
There's no free rides on my supply 
Unless you're one of my friends you need no ends 
just sit back and wait for the joint to begin 
But if you know someone in need of this weed leaf 
You can take my number down and beep me 
I'll hook you up if you look me up 
Just don't give my number to a rookie huh! 
Then I'll cut you off and brush you off 
Never trust you and won't dicuss your loss 
I'm the lead man, you read man, you need man 
Call me and inhale - "The Weed Man" 

(Chorus: Sen Dog) 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!! 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), Weed Man, Weed Man 
(Inhale, exhale), gettin' me HIGH!! 

(Outro: B-Real) 
There it is motherfuckers, you run out of weed 
Call somebody like me and I'll hook you up 
No stems, no seeds and things that you don't need 
That's right! I'm the Weed Man 
Don't trip I got gush, for a high price hoe... </pre>
