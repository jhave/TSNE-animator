[Intro]
Uh, ayyyy~!
Duane DaRock good lookin out baby
Ayyy, feel so beautiful
This is the appreciation - I love you
AH HAHH!
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*} uh-huh
{*"How I feel about you!"*} Yeah
{*"How I feel about you!"*} Uhh, yeah

[Jadakiss]
You had a dream that the feds got him
Woke up went and bought every pair of the red bottoms
Yup! Your new beamer is black
You ain't on Madison, you at Neiman's and Saks
At the gym or the salon, food shoppin wit'cha mom
Over one of your girlfriend's house, sippin wine
Why risk it, when you could come home to a Don?
Leave Potsie alone and come home to the Fonz
Gold medal feel so much better than a bronze
You don't have to say nothin, I feel your response
You can get the ring and the house too
Cause that's how I feel about you - hey!

[Chorus]
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*}
{*"How I feel about you! How I feel about you! Yeahhh"*}
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*} uh-huh
{*"How I feel about you!"*} Yeah
{*"How I feel about you!"*} HA HAH~! Uhh, yo

[Jadakiss]
Slacks with the heels (mm)
Air Max, nice pair of sweats and a ponytail just give me the chills
Yeah - we got our own special handshake
Muah! And she know how I like my pancakes
Off white, three piece with the tan snakes
80 large make her ring finger stand straight (ha ha)
Now I can have a good time with her (yeah)
Chill with me in the spot I used to grind with her
Uhh, that's on everything I kill for her
Say what'chu want, that's just how I feel for her - hey!

[Chorus]
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*}
{*"How I feel about you! How I feel about you! Yeahhh"*}
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*} uh-huh
{*"How I feel about you!"*} Yeah
{*"How I feel about you!"*} Uhh, yeah, yo

[Jadakiss]
I gotta play it cool (cool)
Mosaic tiles at the bottom of the pool (mm)
I got 'em cause of you
Washing set, you up under the dryer
Winter time cuddled up under the fire (woo~!)
Still there after all that I put her through (yeah)
Don't smoke but sometimes she take a pull or two
Heh, I don't know how I would feel without her
Nah, I just know how I feel about her - hey!

[Outro: repeat 2X]
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*}
{*"How I feel about you! How I feel about you! Yeahhh"*}
{*"I'm gonna tell how I feel about, you"*}
{*"How I feel about you! How I feel about you!"*}</pre>
