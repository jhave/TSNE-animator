[Fantasia]
I don't need anybody else but you, come on
Boy, stop playing tricks on me
Cause when I think I've found the right one I end up lonely
So don't judge me before you get to know me
I don't wanna share your love, make me your one and only, ohh

[Fantasia]
I don't want nobody else, I want you to myself
You can call me selfish if you want to
I don't need nobody else, don't wanna share your love
I wanna be the only one you run to

[Fantasia]
My heart can't take another heartbreak
Cause everytime I fall deep in love somebody go and hurt me
So this time there will be no mistakes
If you allow me to prove myself boy I can make you happy, ohh

[Fantasia]
I don't want nobody else, I want you to myself
You can call me selfish if you want to
I don't need nobody else, don't wanna share your love
I wanna be the only one you run to

[Missy]
I'm stingy with my man, I'm stingy with the goodies
If you think my style fly then check the way I boogie
This one tough cookie with shell toes and hoodies
Will approach any chick that walk up to my man
Never understand my man be my man
I shut the game down, this dude is mines now, yep
Bring it to the ring, K.O. in one round
Misdemeanor and Fantasia with the breakdown, uh

[Missy]
I want to be the only one
The only one that you run to
I sure don't need nobody else
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
I want to be the only one
The only one that you run to
I sure don't need nobody else
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, you're the one

[Fantasia]
I don't want nobody else, I want you to myself
You can call me selfish if you want to
I don't need nobody else, don't wanna share your love
I wanna be the only one you run to</pre>
