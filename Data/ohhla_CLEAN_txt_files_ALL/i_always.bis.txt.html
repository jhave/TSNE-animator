[Verse One]
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Besides a fuck up, drop out, my mother's disappointment
Broke with no employment
Hope rarely visits so the ghetto get's avoided
Necessity the mother of invention
Dad's missin'
So I guess that makes it father too
A hair pick couldn't show you what I been through
Hell and back
Then back again
Matter of fact
That's my point of origin
Never see Heaven
Only felt the flames
Wonder why God ain't come when I used to call his name
But I was off the hook, my phone, He felt the same
Bad service
We got disconnected
See I'm livin' life
Life ain't livin' me
Fuck the negative, I switched the polarity
Made lemonade with every lemon handed me
Rap wasn't plan A
It was plan C

[Chorus]
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the hood, Hollywood to the big screen
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the bus stop bucket to a Bentley
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Even when my teachers used to say I wouldn't be
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Block star to rock star, momma look at me

[Verse Two]
See you wanna be a rap star
I just wanna be happy
And know my momma's proud when she look at me
Raised in the dirt nigga
Barely watered still grew like a Redwood
Stronger even harder
I lot of niggas I knew and know didn't make it
Struck down on the block
Struck out and got locked
Strung out on that rock
The way of the world crushed they dreams
Rewrote they scenes, re-casted they roles (Damn)
What a fucked up world, I know
Got you feelin' like God ain't watchin'
God ain't listenin'
Life's so parallel to Hell you hear the Devil gigglin'
I remember at times, gettin' so drunk out my mind
Watchin' the night sky, wonderin' where we go when we die
The homie Zack has a scuffle at the liquor sto'
Fell back, cracked his skull, coma, he ain't here no mo' (rest in peace)
Now every soul that we lost, that's what I'm livin' fo'

[Chorus]
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the hood, Hollywood to the big screen
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the bus stop bucket to a Bentley
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Even when my teachers used to say I wouldn't be
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Block star to rock star, momma look at me

[Verse Three]
Single parent home livin'
All I ever knew
No Huxtable shit, no Pudding pops to get me through
Just my momma
And my brother
Then he had to move for awhile we ain't see each other
Used to hate my father
For what he did to momma
Used to see her cry when she died
Fuck my father
Said he'd come and visit
No show, didn't bother
Bags packed, he didn't call back, man fuck my father
Had my hopes up
And never showed up
It's no surprise if we bad fathers when we grow up
But I was just a baby
Couldn't understand
Nobody's perfect, you wasn't perfect, you was just a man
Then I became a man
See you every time I take a look in the mirror
How could I hate you?
Wouldn't be here without you
And through it all I love you pops
And I'ma shine for you

[Chorus]
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the hood, Hollywood to the big screen
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
From the bus stop bucket to a Bentley
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Even when my teachers used to say I wouldn't be
I knew I was gonna be somethin' 
Block star to rock star, momma look at me

[Outro] [Bishop talking]
Look at me! Yeah! Motherfuckin' high school drop out nigga
Hehehe. I love it. Hi to all my teachers and shit. Let's keep it movin' though
Real is all I can give you nigga. Real is all you should ever want nigga
Let's go deeper. I give you my life. I give you my soul
BANG! It's the Pope Mobile</pre>
