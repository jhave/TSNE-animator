[Verse One: Princess Superstar]
The music makes me so hot
DJ watch my body rock
Don't stop, rock the beat

Flippin' boom song, all up in twaga
Two techs, swiss sets
Big S come and hit that, bend that

Attack the beat from the back
All FUCKIN' fly boys gettin all next to me
All the fly girls gettin mutherFUCKIN ecstasy
Which mutherfucker is sexin' me?
All the yet from the front to back
DJ Stratch, nice and quick
So use these fingers, so finger it
Can you handle it?

With this fast gat cheque
Like fast from my click
DJ rock the decks, spin Sex Boyz
Get erect, uh, it's how we get it yet
Out the bass, studio on the tech's
Get on net tech bet till my pussy get's wet
Don't forget when the fear is on
Long one, until I get what's goin on
Oh, and the DJ takes me higher, uh

[Repeat Hook: Princess Superstar]

[Verse Two: Princess Superstar]
I'm Princess Superstar
Get the party started right
Hip-Hop all in line tonight
When the radio blasts tight
And car lights like
"Last Night A DJ Saved My Life"
Got him in hand and I rippin him right
Music my lover, my husband, alright
Spot runnin hot like a oven aiight?! (aiight!)
Spinnin these damn tracks you lovin all night
DJ Stratch the beat back
Bring the seat back
Put the heat back
Track repeat that, eat the meat rat
Baby, dawg, work it out, nice to meet that
Pump up the bass, one-fo-twee-don
Sit up the seat like we sit up on your face
We ain't stoppin the place
The beat's is poppin
Rubbin' on the vibrator
Don't stop it!
Baby you rock it
Put your hands in my pocket
No pockets, will just rock it
When you be up in my lock it
The roof, the roof
The roof is on fire
And we don't need no water
I'mma 'bout to fuckin' cum

[Repeat Hook 2x: Princess Superstar]

[Verse Three: Princess Superstar]
High in the crowd
Side in my sounds
Rise reconize your face in my thongs
Feel sounds, realise all these guys get down
Double-O, all this track pumpin now
So please, you can't just go and say no no man
Your tile tame, your sweaty lil' game, you act like
Act like Prince hittin a track like "Purple Rain"
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire *sexual noise*
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire *sexual noise*
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire *sexual noise*
And we don't need no water, daddy
No, we don't need no water

*Dance Breakdown*
