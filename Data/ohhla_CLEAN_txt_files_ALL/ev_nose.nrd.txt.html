[Intro: Shae]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the, (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

[Pharrell talking]
Yeah, I know it's been a minute since, um
We expressed ourselves
Takes a lot of courage to say this, but um
I see sounds

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
You and your girls are going out tonight
Y'all been plannin' this all week right?
You got somethin' boys can't deny (Here's a hint)
Its like applepie
Cut you open and your just wired
You ain't tired, you wanna cause a riot
And who can say no to you?
Wait til they get a load of you

[Chorus]
A hundred dollar bills look  Ashoo! Ashoo! (x4)
Because
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the, (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
Superstar ask you what you have
Bartender get the drank we just laugh
He talkin' bout an autograph
He just wanna dance in you reckless paths
Close your eyes see colorful things you wanna
Let go for the wonderful things just a
Bit more just to get in the lane
So we can answer the brain and you can flip wit da pain

[Chorus]
A hundred dollar bills look  Ashoo! Ashoo! (x4)
Because
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the, (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

[Bridge: Pharrell]
Baby, you partied all night in sixth gear
Just so you know the AC, is blowin' over here
Don't worry
I won't blow your high
Talking 'bout your life
And how it is all wrong
Just know if you go outside and see the sunrise as all the stars are gone
Tell your friends, they can go, you're okay, you're just chillin' with me
Here's a towel
Wipe your face
Cool down... have a drink its on me!

Here's a towel (Here's a towel!)
Wipe your face (Wipe your face!)
Cool down (Cool down!)
Have a drink its on me!
Here's a towel (Here's a towel!)
Wipe your face (Wipe your face!)
Cool down (Cool down!)
BUT YOU WOULD RATHER PARTY CUZ!

[Outro: Shae]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the, (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!

All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!
All the girls standing in the, (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom!</pre>
