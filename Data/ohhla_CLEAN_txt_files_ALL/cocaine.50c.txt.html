[Intro: conversation between two men]
Where did you get this stuff?
  Columbia
Oh, uhh... well, do you mind if I, do a line?
  Yeah, go ahead; fuck it, let's all do one
{*all sniffing*}
I can't feel my face
I mean I can touch it, but I can't feel it, inside

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + (Robin Thicke)
(Cocaine) I know police is watchin
(Cocaine) Hustlin I'm not stoppin
(Cocaine) I got to get my money, you think shit is funny
Me I'm 'bout my business (cocaine)

[50  over Chorus]
I see 'em watchin
I got the E
You muh'fuckin right

[50 Cent]
Columbian girl, Peruvian chick
She make the money roll and I love the bitch
Know she ain't a virgin, but she pure
For the right price I'll let you fuck with her raw (yeah)
A lil' like a pimp, I'm your pusher man
She could make us both rich nigga, yes she can
You want your own spot, let's talk locations
Then talk market and the public relations (ooh)

[Robin Thicke] + (50 Cent)
Everybody's watchin (yeah)
But no one talks about it (shut your mouth)
Right now - that's all it was, anything call it
She said, sex just ain't the same without it (woo!)

[Chorus]

[50  over Chorus]
See 'em watchin
I ain't stoppin
I got the E

[50 Cent]
Every little step I take (c'mon)
You will be there
Every little step I make (look bitch)
We'll be together
So grateful (yeah) so faithful (uhh)
Every gram in the hand's more paper (c'mon)
I'll cut it, you sniff it
Or smoke it, terrific

[Robin Thicke] + (50 Cent)
Movie stars, models and, blondes and, cocaine (yeah)
New York, L.A. is, all the same (c'mon, c'mon)
The angels look the other way
Cause they can understand my pain (pain)

[Chorus]

[50  over Chorus]
I see 'em watchin
Naw I ain't stoppin
Yeah, c'mon, business

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You niggaz got a problem, yeah
A big motherfuckin problem
At a minimum
I'ma have a nigga put speedknots all over your motherfuckin head
Ya dig? Oh shit
