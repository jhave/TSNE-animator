Mike Jones, Jones
Mike Jones, Jones

[Hook - 2x Big Moe]
I stay flossing in that candy paint
Blowin dank
Sippin drank on 84 swangers
Tearin up the lane, tearin up the laaaaaaaane

[Verse 1: Mike Jones]
Lil daddy you can tell I'm ballin
From the way I'm flossin 84s I am crawlin
Screens fallin as I slide up and down your block
With a chain full of rocks and princess cuts in my watch
Mike Jones
I'm hot now a lot of people callin
But back then they left Mike Jones crawlin
I'm rising they fallin
Cuz I stayed up on my grind
Didn't have time to whine
Had to put it dine (down)
I'm Mike Jones
Who...Mike Jones
Who...Mike Jones, Jones
And I'm a stay putting it down until the end
Pimpin pens
Tryin to put a brand new benz in the wind
Cuz

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 2: Mike Jones]
I pull up in a drop top holding grain
Parking lot pimpin mayne
I ain't even trippin mayne
Screens rain as I slide up and down the block
Ride daily holding glock
Cuz I know haters plot
You might see me SUV on 24s
Or I might be flippin tippin on four vogues
Mike Jones
A lot people now mad cuz I'm hot
But they gone be even madder when that jag leave the lot
I stay grindin so I can stay ballin
Cuz Lord knows I can't picture me fallin
I'm crawlin
Candy paint on fours
Doggin all these hos
You handlin the road in my wide body load
I'm a baller shot caller 20 inch crawler
Catch me on the highway or about to tear the mall up
My album Who is Mike Jones comin soon
My album Who is Mike Jones comin soon
Cuz

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 3: Big Moe + Mike Jones]
I'm pimpin flippin that candy paint
Lane switchin sippin that purple drank
Screen fallin dubs crawlin
I guess that's why the girls keep callin
My phone
I roam and hop in my maybach

[Mike Jones]
Haters knock cuz we on the grind and they not
Big Moe and Mike Jones
Who..Mike Jones
Who..Mike Jones
Who..Mike Jones Jones
