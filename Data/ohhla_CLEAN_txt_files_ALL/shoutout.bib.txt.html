Song:   Shout Out
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus - Lil Herb]
Shout out my connect, he give techs to the set and my shooters the wildest
Boa I be so fresh like I'm ready for death man shout out to my stylist
My shorties they on it, they blowin', keep scorin' like that white boy on Dallas
This money keep pilin', shout out my lawyer don't know what a trial is
[x2]

[Verse 1 - Lil Herb]
Shout out to lil bro, cause for me he gon' blow
He'll let that 40 cal spit
I got so many hoes, I can't trust 'em
I don't let know where my house is
Gotta keep a gun on me, cause I be pourin' pints of lean
Smokin' dope by the ounces
Fuck nigga bet not run up on me
Imma let this 30 squeeze til that bitch go silent
Cause I be countin hunnids, lot of hunnids
So many hunnids I'm tired of thumbin'
We got choppas that hold a hunnid
We tired of drummin'
Always fyin' onna oppers so they tired of runnin'
High speeds with the jakes they be tired of comin'
I got a lotta haters think I gotta buy a Uzi
I be buyin' 30 clips, I never bought a movie
I was rockin' Louie inna video wit' Louie
Bein' stuipid smokin' doobies we just need some booties
Tell the squad they could get a pic wit me and Louie
Dumb bitch you can't pick, you fuckin' me AND Louie
Fucked a bitch like 26 and I was still a juvie
I was totin' 30 clips when I was still a juvie
Smoke asked who up next, I said him and Juvie
And this bezel on my wrist it look like crystal rubies
And I never been a bitch so you gon' have to shoot me
Fuck nigga!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - King Louie]
My shooters shoot shooters
They stay double breasted they should work at Hooters
I smoke out wit' Herb
I be ballin' wit' Bibby, these niggas is losers
Got 40s wit' 30s, the shooters is shorties
And on that bitch rollin'
My life is a movie
My name is Louie, but they call me Tony
Buy some new choppers for oppers
Black card it ain't got no limit
On Essesx wit' the No Limits
Before rap I was gettin' money
Finesse you right out yo money
No exchange when I'm wit' Armani
I keep some killers around me
Young Bama just got out the county
They can't keep real niggas down
Run up and drill niggas down
Roll up the dope where the bitches
Snitches get bullets not stitches
Yo BM give my dick kisses
You kiss her on IG pictures
I go to sleep wit' my Nin
In case they tweak in the dream
AK gun hit up a team
Get on that wit' that machine
Face shots put him on the screen
Tell and they might kill yo mama
How you gon' live wit' that karma

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lil Bibby]
Underdog like Rocky
Go hard till they drop me
They know they can't stop me
Sprite dirty as the opps be
Operation lookin' sloppy
The feds tryna watch me
And they say they got me
Servin' on camera
I told 'em that it's not me
Get a deal if he cop three
I'm hotter than the block be
Me and Herb inna drophead
Middle finger to the haters
Tell 'em drop dead
She gon' do the whole squad
Cause we got bread
All my hittas got dreads
Look like mopheads
You can catch me ridin' in the Jag
The hammer in the stash
Holes in the skully
We use it like a mask
I just make a call
Have them shooters on yo ass
Gotta brand new 30
Fo gon use it on yo ass
Kick a nigga door, where the weed at?
Cause we need that, best believe that
If he act dumb, bro squeeze that
Where the money and the loud and the keys at?
Niggas snitchin' but my lawyer gon' beat that
You don't even gotta ask, nigga we strapped
Plus my young niggas know where he sleep at
You'll never catch me slippin' cause I keep that

[Chorus]</pre>
