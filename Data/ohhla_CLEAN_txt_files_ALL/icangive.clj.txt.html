I seen this girl, walkin down the block
I said, "WAIT!"
"Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?"
"Have some donuts and milk?"
"Listen to a pop tune maybe?"

Please be his ex and be my bride
Don't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried
Love you claimed to share just wasn't there
You're too good for that, and it wasn't fair
Love's taken its toll, your heart he stole
You was fooled by the face of a phoney role
But I'll take up the slack, support you, baby
Now the knight in shiny armor can only be me
I cry out your name as you hold his hand
If you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned
I'm lookin out the window at the stormy rain
And the rush of the water makes my eyes drain
All alone in the room, and it's makin me sad
Fantasize of the love we could have had
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I pour wine for two, even though it's just me
I tried to reach you, but blind men don't see
Your man is the devil, but he gave you a ring
So you believe you saw an innocent angel sing
You're the type that ignores the destiny of two
It's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you
You're bein handicapped by a Don Juan rap
You can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more
Yes girl, I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

The time has come, the decision's yours
This super love story ain't workin no more
Can't you understand that my love spans
Higher and further than any man's
You're lookin a gift horse right in the mouth
This time hear me out, I don't care if you pout
You're my only desire, I fight to the death
And I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath
Ain't gettin on my knees, but I'm oh so close
To our love I toast, all he does is boast
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

A knock on the door and a tap on the glass
Tells me you see it my way at last
You used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me
He called you up and said, "Yo baby, why you diss me?"
Meanwhile made romance on the sea shore
You want more of what you used to ignore
During this love affair, girl, it gets steamy
Three nights in a row, and you still wanna see me
Make love at night, coffee in the morn'
I be the only blanket that's keepin you warm
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

I hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight
But my agony continues till it reaches night
Sweet image of your face appears on the wall
And the scene is so eerie I run through the hall
I look at the sky, then I search for the moon
Realize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon
So I dress to impress, exit the house
Go up to the school and watch the kids come out
In the middle of the court yard there you stand
With the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more

You're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction
You won't get used if you follow my instructions
Your scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm
Make love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan
And that'll be eroticism, highs die down
You will find your best friend finally is found
I caress ya at night like a virgin in white
Cause the new world I found is oh so tight
And tender and young, soft and wet
It's hotter than any fantasy could get
Cause I never met anyone like you before
And I can give you more</pre>
