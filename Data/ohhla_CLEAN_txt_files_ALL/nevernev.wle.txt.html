Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Folarin, go
They say never say never, but forever is so far away
Penny with a hole in it the bubble on my Hardaways
Is one away, all the way, always go for dolo
I'm goin' bloody insubordinate up in the polo
Jordan prolly bored doe, music got me more dough
Si papi, each of my crew gets gluteus as gordo
Maximus, Maxima, Acura to vroom - fuck it
Got them got you open bars like open [?]
Hoppin' out the new [?], 11 like whoever can get it
I'm goin' in, you eatin' Checkers for dinner
I soak it in as a moment, I'm on it, temporary forever
Twitter bitches livin' for me, they be carpe diem-ing
I'm a writer, but arsonist really
I get dollars where humble niggas with positive energy
I'm the voice of the city, Rozay, Stalley, and Milly
She know I'm mongoose, she start ridin' my willy
No really, used to whip the Bentley 450
Go up Bowie, and tell professors they better get me
G-get me doe, somebody get me doe
Ice cold frigid flow, iceberg history doe

[Chorus]
Never, never, never could they fuck with me
Never, never, never could they fuck with me
Never, never, never could they fuck with me
Never, never, never could they fuck with me

[Verse 2]
Never, never, never could they fuck with me
It's like I'm in the clouds and they fearin' heights to some degree
Got a bunch of sneaks, a nigga be flossin' too much
Never keep broads for too long, women be talkin' too much
And to be honest niggas get smarter when I be drivin' what's up
Nigga we're talkin' stupid moolah 'til the Gallardo pull up
I'm out my mind and I know it, bad joant got some roll-up
Every joant that I'm shown in built up like Mrs.Bozak
And that's a Martin reference, you don't get it carry on
I'm a drop it real on you lil niggas, Tommy Strong
I just be flowin' a little when I be on the strong
And occupy a couple coroners after the song
You can't compete with me, I won't compete with y'all
My queen from out a magazine, your joant from out the mall

[Chorus]</pre>
