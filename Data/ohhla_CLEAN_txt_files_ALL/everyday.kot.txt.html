This one's dedicated, to the big LT and the reality of life 

Take a moment smoke a bowl, let's talk about life (What's that?) 
Simply reality of life, now death to the motherfucker that causes strife 
R.I.P. Uncle Roy God bless your wife, 
R.I.P. Uncle Mark God bless your wife 
I guess we can't call em in this life of the strife 
Now my pops was there when Uncle Roy got buried 
So my pops was there when Sheila got married 
Represent for his brother AKA best friend 
I was there for myself and Big Hoss in the pen 
In this life of sin it takes me gin to get by, no lie, 
I steady blaze and forever stay high 
Don't try to understand it, this life you can't plan it 
Just don't take it for granted 

Life, to live while you live 
Death, to give what you get 
Pain, the reality of change 
I wonder whether, things will ever get better 

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me 

I picture life as a dream here today gone tomorrow 
Love equals hollow, hate equals sorrow 
Now follow the real as I take you to a field in my mind where I journey 
Sucker bitches can't burn me, bring an attorney 
Cuz since child birth I've been raised to do dirt on this earth, 
yes it hurts 
To find out that i can't get away from all the pressures and pain 
And misfortunes that I've gained straight 
Sometimes a fire grows inside, hatred starts to rise, 
Still i can't despise all the lies I've been told, the secrets they hold 
The government control, man fuck five-O 
So I say, keep your faith in the J, Saint Dog and great smokes a pack a day 
Keep your faith in the J, every day I pray 
Keep your faith in the J, man pass it this way.. 

Everday, there's more pain that comes my way 
And so I pray, the lord to take me away 
And if I lay, in the casket 6 feet deep 
I ask to be at ease and please don't mourn me </pre>
