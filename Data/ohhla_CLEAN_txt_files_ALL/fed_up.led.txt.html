[Usher] 
It was all a dream 
Yeah homie I'm on my job 
And you can't take that away from me 
Yeah I got my team 
And I got all of my niggas behind me 
And they give me the love I need 
Yeah I got my foot in the door 
Still hustling for more 
Checking the game 
Yeah I'm back in the life 
Yeah I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired 

[Young Jeezy] 
I am absolutely positively on my grizzy 
Even though I'm sick of them tired, I gets busy 
Started 62, what ended up a frisbee 
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy 
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me 
Left my glove, so why you thought I brought your man with me? 
'Bout to paint a purple picture like I brought the frame with me 
I give it all up before I let the fame get me 
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me 
(?) they exactly, what who'da thought never knew me (?) 
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me 
I'm fed up, it's why I'm acting like the ol' me 

[Usher] 
It was all a dream 
Yeah homie I'm on my job 
And you can't take that away from me 
Yeah I got my team 
And I got all of my niggas behind me 
And they give me the love I need 
Yeah I got my foot in the door 
Still hustling for more 
Checking the game 
Yeah I'm back in the life 
Yeah I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired

[Rick Ross] 
I'm sick and tired of you suckahs so now I'm fed up (Ross) 
Somebody catch the chain; I'm 'bout to tear his head off 
Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up 
Before you let your top back, get your bread up 
Made history, but now we claiming victory 
Get ya out da white house; go back to your efficiency 
Suckahs finny and I know you haters hear me 
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin; yilly! 
With them brown bags, circulate so why I perpetrate 
We shinin' than the bottom cuz we're down to twerkulate 
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right 
Oh (?) you better be broke cuz the time's right 

[Usher] 
It was all a dream 
Yeah homie I'm on my job 
And you can't take that away from me 
Yeah I got my team 
And I got all of my niggas behind me 
And they give me the love I need 
Yeah I got my foot in the door 
Still hustling for more 
Checking the game 
Yeah I'm back in the life 
Yeah I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired 

[Drake] 
Ugh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em 
We leaned over and told 'em to go retire on 'em 
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em 
And when they love you to death, never die on 'em 
And the question still remains 
Have I counted all the money that I managed to obtain? 
Dedicating overtime and damaging my name 
And somehow I'm still the hottest, muthafuckah on the game 

[Usher] 
Yeah I've been in this bin breaking records since now proof
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I've brought 
Records that I hold 
Records that I've sold 
Man I'm fed up with these niggas, believe in my lingo 
Yeah, don't bite the hand of your provider 
You see that lying, you a liar 
I'm on fire; you used to light up 
You're gonna wake up and realize- 

[Usher]
It was all a dream 
Yeah homie I'm on my job 
And you can't take that away from me 
Yeah I got my team 
And I got all of my niggas behind me 
And they give me the love I need 
Yeah I got my foot in the door 
Still hustling for more 
Checking the game 
Yeah I'm back in the life 
Yeah I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
Hey I'm fed up 
I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired</pre>
