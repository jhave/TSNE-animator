Rollin' over..

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Hell motherfuckin' yeah bitch!
Hatchet chops straight to your motherfuckin' face!
Rollin over..
Wicked Clowns got that illllllll shiiit!
What up doe?

[Violent J]
I come floatin' in this bitch wit some wings like a pegasus
Got the shiny SV on my chest, what up
Violent J the clown, I'm goofy for a second
But then your bitch headless, I'm on top of her naked
You know my status, I'm Juggalatus, and we the baddest
Here to severe your melon, it's wicked shit that we sellin'
We off the track now, give your bitch ass a bitch slap now
Nobody never steppin' down, we bout to enter second round

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Runnin' backyards up a wall, Shaggy 2 Dope in this motherfucker
You talkin' to your boy, the silence is for suckers
So I'm out there, throughout the year I'm right here
Don't stare like a bitch, bitch buy me a beer
Nobody wicked like me, I do this terrifically
And my motherfuckin pimp slap will knock down a tree
So clown love bitch, I've seen it tatted on titties
We forever on tour, clown love in your cities
Rollin' over..

[Hook]
Rollin' over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind
Rollin' over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind

[Violent J]
I got 3 bodies in my trunk, I'm blowin red lights
And bet I'm blowin heads off before I've read any rights
Baby I'm outlaw, painted up and packin' the bombs
I stomp cracks in the streets and sound fire alarms
Bitch run for your life, we keep it wicked and scary
And we welcome to our world anything that you bury
I throw meteors and fireballs through brick walls
And got a 3 foot dick for all you chick jaws

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Walkin' through the sun, bout to strangle someone
Maybe it's a custom, gotta get it done
I live like that, spirits talk to me like that
I'm lost in the Ouija board, ain't never comin' back
Ooh ooh drink some liqour, I don't care
When it comes to paranormals, get up outta here
They try to speak to me, I say don't bother
I'm doin' somethin else, I'm rollin' over

[Hook]
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind

{I keep it bloody, me and my buddy beyond nutty}

(Droppin' brand new wicked shit) Rappers-R-Us

[Hook]
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
So much time, so much time
Rollin' Over
I look up there's still so far to go
It's show time, blow your mind
