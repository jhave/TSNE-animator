Yo Damien yo hit the sticks
Slim you hit the base
Yo, are you ready to kick it
Here we go
Check 1-2, Check 1-2
Turn it up just a little bit, well all right
Let's get a little base

This is the sound grab your partner and get down
Everyone must know
We've been here before and we're gonna give you more
Its time to let it show
Music is funky, girls are so fine
So sweet and vidal
Gotta get the booty (gotta get the booty)
Oohh it's to late
Can't belive a thing about the new jack swing

Chorus:
New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

When the party's over and it's time to make that move
Somebody gotta win, somebody got to lose
Stop across the lady, hands on her man
In a new jack city their's no hesitating!

Chorus:
New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

Swing it, swing it
Swing it, swing it
Swing it, swing it
Swing it, swing it
New Jack City, oohh yyeeaahh
The new jack swing, the new jack swing
The new jack swing, the new jack swing
New jack city! New jack city! New jack city!

Chorus:
New Jack City! New Jack City!
New Jack City! New Jack City!

New new new new, jack, city!</pre>
