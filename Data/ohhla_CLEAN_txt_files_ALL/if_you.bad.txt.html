Shit go out to all my muhfuckin' niggas'' 
Got nothing but love for ya' playa' 

(Ungh) 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
My niggas', my niggas' 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
My niggas' 

My niggas' be dem' niggas' thats cool as fuck 
Wont start no shit but'll fuck you up 
My niggas' be dem' niggas', smoke dope all day 
Same time collect the habit in the field without pay 
My niggas' don't kill til' our life in danger 
At that time don't give a fuck if you a cousin or stranger 
My niggas' be with me on my last dime 
My niggas' gon' be with me on my wealthiest times 
My niggas' earn they respect like I earn mine 
Me and my niggas' do honest shit, but still commit crimes 
Unfortunate me and my niggas' still do time 
For a costly-ass mistake or some sissy-bitch lyin' 
Thats why me and my niggas' stay secluded 
Dem' niggas' that fucked us up last time got up-rooted 
Booed about the south like it was never they home man 
I can't tell you where dem' bitches done gon' man 

Yeah' playa hit me wit' cho' best shot 
We ricochet everythang that chall' send nigga' what 
Got beef, better keep it to yourself like a secret 
Don't even go and get to introduce 
to twenty-one episodes of shock treatment 
My niggas'll bring the head rush 
And take y'all niggas' to class like a muthafuckin' school bus 
Even Atheist be sayin' "Oh, my God" 
When Baeshaun spat a bar arrest your cardiac 
So know who got the most heart 
For verses y'all caught us at a bad time 
We gotta show y'all niggas' the real meanin' of ragtime 
Step up and take a fall 
Let's brawl 
Talkin' shit about cha' cause' 
I heard that half of y'all went AWOL 
Retaliation for this naw don't bother 
We got niggas' in this clique old enough to be your grandfather 
You don't have to like it just respect it 
Get a bunch of don't give a fuck niggas' 
then we set shit off like Vivica, Thelma and Louise shit 
Got hoes that'll run up in yo crib and wont leave shit 
Scared to death make em' holler like promotin' Scream 
Get up off that crack, weed and that muthafuckin' cream 

(ungh) 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
My niggas', my niggas', my nigga', my niggas' 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
My niggas', my niggas', my niggas' 

In this day and era, it's more terror than you can bare 
So I tote a baretta to handle personal vendettas 
Takin' drastic measures 
Cause' niggas' be wantin' to wet us 
So we put holes in sweaters 
Thought we was the goodfellas 
Moms use to tell us, the street is gonna get us 
Though I respect my elders 
I'm tryin' to strive for something better 
So grams I had to measure 
To keep cheddar like Bank Tellers 
And still keep the hollow-heads flyin' like fuckin' Delta 
Run for shelter, or do your dumb-ass know no better 
When I pull out this pistol, I'mma do more than scare ya' 
I'mma tear ya' a brand new asshole 
So grab a firm grip and never let go of the double four 

You daamn right I'm with my niggas' beyond the end 
And don't think I don't know dem' niggas' who ain't my friend 
Me and my niggas' been through it all, good or bad 
Shit, eatin' or starvin', (what) happy or sad 
Shootin' at niggas' or gettin' shot at 
Beinglazy not doing shit or making progress 
Beatin' the streets or lettin' the streets beat us 
Gotta be the nigga' kickin' the dirt, fuck kickin' the dust 
My niggas' got high expectations for me 
Just as I do for dem' 
Watch dem' shabby hoes, they swear to God a nigga' raping em' 
So while you fuckin' em' homeboy make sure you tapin' em' 
Show the judge you was willin' you wasn't makin' em' 
We stand together shit we wont fall, 
you come to fuck with one you come to fuck with us all nigga' 
Stand together we can't fall, 
you come to fuck with one you came to fuck with us all, my niggas' 

                             (Repeat 4x) 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
You come to fuck wit' one you came to fuck wit' all 
My niggas', my niggas', my niggas' 

My niggas' believe in death before dishonor 
My niggas' bout' 26 hours, nine days a week, overtime niggas' 
My niggas' is trill, raw to the bone 
My niggas' wanna see all of us make it 
My niggas' 
You come to fuck with one you came to fuck wit' us all 

All my niggas' in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee 
Florida, Louisiana, California, Alabama, New York, Virginia, Oklahoma, 
Nevada, Jersey, Texas, Kentucky, DC, Utah, Detroit, Chicago, all my niggas' worldwide 
Know what I'm sayin', yeah, like that, better believe that 
You come to fuck with one you fuckin' with all playa 
It's just like that there 
All dem' niggas' in Anderson, Greenville, Spartanburg, Greenwood, 
Newberry, Columbia, South Carolina baby 
It's like dis' here,  ha ha 
They didn't want us to do it like this, we did it anyway 
Ha ha ha........ </pre>
