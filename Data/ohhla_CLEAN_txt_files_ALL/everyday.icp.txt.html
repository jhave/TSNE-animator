[Violent J]
Time, is all I have anymore

[Verse - Violent J]
I tried to visit Shaggy, I stepped up off of my porch
And it was dark as fuck I couldn't see, not even with a torch
I hear the streets talkin', and they aware of my move
They whisperin' and swingin' from the trees, above I hear the loons
I try to jog a little, crow eyes glow like cats
Demonic zombies runnin' up on me, I slap 'em with the bat
But my eyes keep bleedin' from the rays of the darkness
They powerful and burn you somethin heartless (uh!)
I hear a giant thumpin', some kind of ogre or somethin'
I see the phantom screamin' as this giant behemoth is comin'
And it swung at me, I felt a rip my head went spinnin'
And flippin' and rollin' and finally landed in position
I could see my body still standin', headless as fuck
It finally fell but what the hell, still got my nugget but I'm stuck
I can't move fuck I'm only a face, why even try?
On top of that, it's a centipede crawlin' in my eye
I wanna die..

[Hook] - x2
Everyday I die
Back to the start, another try
I got the time so why should't I?

[Violent J]
I got too much time on my hands

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
I tried to visit J, I walked out into the cold
I see they don't collect they dead, they all up over the road
And some are fully rotted, and some they must've just spotted
I seen a headless body that resembles J's, but I doubt it
I seen a centaur, I threw a pitch fork at it above
I watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood
I'm fuckin' 'bout to hurl, I close my eyes and walk on
It's giant crows swoopin at me, got me carry me on
I cut it's claws with the hatchet that I keep in my hand
Even in Hell, you best believe I keep the hatchet in my hand
And as I'm fallin' now, I see the Witch is ridin' my chest
With its claws on my neck, screamin' I should've confessed
I slammed down into an iron gate, a demon statue near me
Four points stickin' out my chest, I'm hangin' there dearly
And the hungry goblins, they got a fire beneath me
They cookin' my legs, to make myself eat me
I wanna die..

[Hook] - x2
Everyday I die
Back to the start, another try
I got the time so why should't I?

[Violent J]
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands
I got too much time on my hands

[Hook] - x2
Everyday I die
Back to the start, another try
I got the time so why should't I?</pre>
