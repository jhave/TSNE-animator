[Chorus: computer voice]
Games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel - ohh

[additional computer voice]
.. games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games, you don't have to play, games with me girl
You, know, how, I feel
Ohh games

[Verse One]
Hi there good lookin, pretty sweet thang
I really want to put you under my wing
But everytime I try you give me a hard time
Like I'm a murderer, or commitin a crime
I try to do everything right for you
You're always givin me excuses, makin me blue
When I met you at Cancun, at Fiesta Americana
You lookin tasty like strawberries and banana
I asked you your name you said Lee-Lee from San Fran
She said, "I have friends but I don't got a man"
I said, "Really?!  As good as you look?
Lookin like somethin out a Playboy book?"
I thought I struck gold, ching ching, the jackpot
Just the thought of you it be makin me hot
When I step to you, you act funny style
You need to marinate on this for a while

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Now let me tell you like this baby doll
I never guessed you would act off the wall
Give me a chance for a little romance
We can dance and dine in Jamaica or France
Somethin in the way you make me feel
I like your personality, and your sex appeal
But it's all hard, not bein witchu
You're playin hard to get like catch 22
Some people got time to play them games
but I don't, so don't call me no names
Like all I want is sex, and take you no places
And, why you always up in girls face
You know, I'm the B-I-Z, this is my job
Fans nibble on me like corn on the cob
Let me tell you somethin, my word is bond
Like "Bonita Applebum," you gotta put me on

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
If I didn't feel you, I wouldn't send you roses
Jewelry, furs, and designer clotheses
You know you got me, that's why you do what you do
Stressin and depressin, me and my crew
You know it's got to be real like Sheralyn
Or you wouldn't be askin for an encore again
I know you like me!
So you might as well "Do the Right Thing" like Spike Lee
Because I love you more than human eyes can see
Cause you got what I need, "OH BABY!"
I don't know why you give me real rough times
Cause you're the one that rings my chimes
You bring me joy like Mary J.
I wanna do the same thing to you every day
So stop playin your games like Barry White
You know, you know, YOU KNOW!  AIIIGHT?

[Chorus] - repeat to fade</pre>
