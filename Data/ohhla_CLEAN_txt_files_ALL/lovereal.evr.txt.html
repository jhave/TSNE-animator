Song:   Love for Real 
Typed by: EattWhtysWhytyFrd@aol.com 

Her skin is salty sweet, she wore sandals on her feet 
Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed 
She stepped inside of me, she said don't ever lie to me 
This heart of mine can be yours 
Yea that's what she said 
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole 
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head 

Chorus 

Do you want to be loved for real, do you want to be loved for real 
Do you want to be...loved, (Yes, I wanna be loved for real) 
For real, (Do you want to be in love for real) 
(Yes, I want to be in love for real) 

Now, I'm down by the river, taking off my shoes 
Jump in the water, wash away these blues 
Now out into the ocean, the current takes hold 
Words already been spoken, tales already been told 
Heart's already been broken, wounds already been healed 
Do you wannabe loved, do you wanna 
Do you wannabe love for real. 

Chorus (2x) 

Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound 
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke 
She help to ease my pain, she stayed through pouring rain 
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke 
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love 
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke Chorus (4x) </pre>
