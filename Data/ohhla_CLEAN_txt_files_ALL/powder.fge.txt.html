I asked my mother why do you cry
she said your brother had... he just died
Well I told him not to go outside
he said he had to fight for his country's right
But don't you know that mo-mother
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no
Because the war is not over
until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (pow)
my brother's been dead ever since
I didn't beleive it, but when I saw him I was convinced
Two shots to the head he was already dead Lord, 
I headed for revenge in the city of Port Au Prince
Screaming bro-brother
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no
Because the war is not over 
until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (Pow)
Zion's gunpowder (pow)
L.A.'s gunpowder (pow)
I wanna know why
Christians pray for a new day
we don't need no, we don't need no, we don't need no
But its still the same way
I wanna know why
ghetto people pray for a new day
hey, hey, heeey
and its still the same way
But the preacher man told me
good things come to those who wait
do good things come to those who wait?
I wanna know tell me 
good things come to those who wait
do good things come to those who wait?
we wanna know, we wanna know, we wanna know [pause]
Pe-people
don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no
because the war is not over 
until you can feel love, peace, and hear the silence
but I smell gunpowder (gunpowder)
Brooklyn's gunpowder (gunpowder)
Shaolin's gunpowder (gunpowder)
Uptown's gunpowder (gunpowder)
Jersey's gunpowder (gunpowder)
even New Zealand's gunpowder (gunpowder)
Australia's gunpowder (gunpowder)
Brixton's gunpowder (gunpowder)
even New Haven's gunpowder</pre>
