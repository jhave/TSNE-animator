Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ain't nobody fuckin with me
First degree murder, you can get your degree
Motherfucker
And you ain't gotta wonder 'bout me wonder woman
Tune gonna ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggaz gon hate
Pound of the Kush call that bitch pound cake
I hit it from the back
And make that bitch about face
And then I gotta split
I'm sorry baby, sour grapes
She wine, baby don't leave
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody tripping, but I ain't never tripping
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talking about money and the power
Power and the money
This shit is magic Stan Van Gundy
Ima run this shit till I'm the last man runnin
Mack light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money motherfucker yeah
We the shit, yeah Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X I smoke O's tic-tac-toe
And I stink cause I got alot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie, is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand infront of the clock
Cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off
And send your head to your mom
I ain't playing with niggaz, no sir not me
And they can't blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah I was locked up, but like a bird I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello Goodbye, where are you Wayne?
I'm somewhere inbetween joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now ain't that about a bitch?
It ain't never about a bitch
Ill take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G ass niggaz
And I just bought your girlfriend some knee pads nigga
Eagle street where the real niggaz hung
Ima rep that shit till Kingdom come
Yeah Sharp brang the drank, I bring the blunts
Fucking with me its blood, brains or guts
Fuck yall for real though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I'm done peel off like velcro, Gone
Baby I'm stoned, smoking on the strong
Got a huge ass bong, swag off the hook
You can't use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
One time for the G's, the niggaz got it lock'd
The niggaz with the keys, The niggaz on the block
The niggaz on they P's and Q's
Put your bitch ass on the evening news
Jumping in the game better read the rules
High as a bitch yeah that's me on the moon
Fuck with me die soon, not late
And I'm sorry for the motherfucking wait
