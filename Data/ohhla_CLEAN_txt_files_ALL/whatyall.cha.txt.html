[Chamillionaire]
They gon' just get upset
When I hop out the Vette
Throw the keys and tell the valet to catch
See gettin' green is a damn sinch
I'm the 22 inch grinch
I hog money, I'ma ball hog while haters is warming the bench
Fall in love with a gold-digger, for what?
Nigga my guns my slut
I finger the heat til' the barell gets hot, and bust a nut
And the best condum couldn't protect ya
When the gat is ready to sex ya
Say Hello to my little slut
take the clip out when I undress her
Came in the club with pat'nah we call hI'm Bill with the Big Head
That's Ben Franklin, bartenders bring drinks in a big keg
(Now What Y'all Niggas Gone Do)
Henessy shots I'm on 2
I'm sippin' drank after drank, like all of the dranks was on you
I don't need no ice, got ice on neck
ice on my earring, ice on my sleeve
Make my bracelet touch her weave, and give ya girlfriend *scratches and
restarts*

(OG Ron C talking)
{Now What Y'all Niggas Gone Do? (repeated throughout talking)}

I'm sippin' drank after drank, like all of the dranks was on you
I don't need no ice, got ice on neck
ice on my earring, ice on my sleeve
Make my bracelet touch her weave, and give ya girlfriend brain freeze
Haters get pissed when they see me, they say "That Son Of a Rich"
Nigga please, I spend g's on just one of my kicks
