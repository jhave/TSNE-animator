If it ain't live, it ain't me
Oh nigga, I'm too deaf to move a step through shards or slip and slide
Talk back and you get me for cussin', cuttin', bustin' bustin' me
Tried to talk 'em, but they really won't pay it
Found nothin',fuck 'em fuck 'em
Inside, outside, in a state of an abomination
Don't want no confrontations, making me hit you with combinations
Kicking in bloodier faces, compilations, occupations
Back in hibernation, yeah you suffer with complications
Too in to be losin' money, too old to be time wastin'
Man, people that don't even listen to rap still buy my tape
Only Beats By The Pound gettin' down on the drum
Wit' DJ Darryl and Moe, hollywood here we come
If what you are reflects your actions, bitch I'm a man
Ahh, shut up, I don't wanna here it
Cause I'm 'a fade you and your chance
You know what you did was despicable
I sick of you, they call me Mystikal, cause I'm Unpredictable

hook (x2)

I said what they thought that I wasn't gonna say
I did what they thought that I wasn't gonna do
I knew what they really not want me to know, I'm Unpredictable
Can't fight it, deny it, you're gonna get lost
Sure you can't follow the rhymes that I wrote
No one can stop me, uncover my flow I'm Unpredictable

Man, until you give it your all, you never will know what can happen
From nappy-headed ass Michael, to cold-blooded ass rapper
Sometimes the little kids be listenin'to me 
And I'm tryin' to stop the cursin'
Teachin' 'em bad words and then people be gettin' nervous (Oh my God)
Calm down, I'm not that type of rapper you'll see
Besides, I know some of y'all churn out that cursin' better than me
I'm ice-cold baby, I'm zero degrees
I'm like a lumberjack, cuttin' MC's like trees
Choppin' 'em down, knocking 'em down, locking 'em down
Four years, and six months later I'm still on top of the mound
Just more powerfully now, on time for that No Limit sound
Already know what you gonna say before it come out your mouth
Yee got's to stay awake, tidin' y'all no matter whats done
Old style-stealing copycat tried to bite and bit his tounge
You can't fight that feeling, it's irresistable
Never know what I'm 'a do next, I'm Unpredictable

hook

If you thinking the nigga done rolled with a other they'll take you
Nigga you heard wrong
Prime Suspects (who?), Mia X, (who?) Mr. Serv-on 
Oh, you want to ride in my Mercedes
But I ain't got no more room in the back (my bad)
Whole Gambino Family in their, Kane and Abel and Mac
Got C-Murder, Colonel, the Shocker, you don't want none
Oh hell, O'Dell and VL all of the funk sons
I'm confident, don't come in conceited, ain't got no Big Ed
I'm bad like Fiend, but I B. like Craig
So don't provoke me, if you don't want to get strong-armed
Big Mann and Champ, V-Dog, be worrying might do you some harm
All that ready to put a bullet in your belly-belly
With a four-ten two shells, Boswell and Kelly-Kelly
We ain't faking, making hits and gettin' paid
You can't fade the track that the tank just made
Mystikal, I'm Unpredictable
Shit, anything else is unacceptable
