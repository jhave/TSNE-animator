Killing us one by one 
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremly alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplished, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight 
Fight and die if we must like niggas

This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
"Emmancipation Proclamation?" Please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me, it's all about hyprocrisy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty

This is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
AMERIKA, AMERIKA, AMERIKKKA  
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people 
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience

Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy armed with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
Armed with the knowledge of the place we been
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
The american dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe 
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took out King
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom

NIGHTMARE thats what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for Four hundred plus years
You should be scared 
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
ha ha 
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
