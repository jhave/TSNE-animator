Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Chip Tha Rip, Ray Cash
Smoke something

[Verse 1: Ray Cash]
I said I'm chillin'
Sittin' on about a quarter million
All my niggas
All my guns
All my women
I'm trippin'
I'm sittin'
I'm workin' in the kitchen
100 pounds to the ceiling
Bought an AK and a clip hold a million
Damn I mean a billion
When you smell the loud in the place you know we in the buildin'
Chip said fuck niggas
And fuck how they feeling
Fuck keepin' it [?]
I keep it trillion

[Chorus]
Drop that shit bitch
Hands high
Drop that shit bitch
She got that ass
Damn, drop that shit bitch
Yeah, drop that, drop that shit bitch
To the floor bitch

[Verse 2: Chip Tha Ripper]
Yeah, my dap is worth 100 raps
Where them bad bitches at
Drop that ass and run it back
She onstage goin HAM like she hope I see her
Well they do that at
Shit, right over here
Haters gimme cold mugs like dentine
But nevertheless the 40 cal up in these slim jeans
You niggas hoes
We don't owe you nada
You niggas mad I push out something cold for the summer
She chose me that means she don't think she too cute
Do what you want
Don't wait for what you want to do you
Now its some ladies over here and some women over there
There's some hoes in this house bad bitches everywhere

[Chorus]
Drop that shit bitch
Hands high
Drop that shit bitch
She got that ass
Damn, drop that shit bitch
Yeah, drop that, drop that shit bitch
To the floor bitch</pre>
