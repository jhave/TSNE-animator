Tryin' to leave the club
Will they smoke some bud wit us?
Good girls like thug niggas
Po' nigga, I dare any one of y'all to try me
Even when I take a shit that pistol right by me (which side?)
I'll be, grindin' til they put my body in a tomb
Screens in my whip, bigger than the ones that's in your living room (yeah)
Candy paint shined up, twenty cars lined up (ooohh-weeee)
And they all cost bra (how much?) triple your house dawg (haha)
Call me Flip or 'Flipperachi' call me anythin' but broke
All I need is V12 nigga I can cook coke (yeah)

[Verse 3]
Yo my Chevy ridin' high boy
Twelve hundred dollar shades on my eyes boy
Twelve thousand dollar blades on my ride boy
Four 18's got me soundin' like a quire boy, haha
I slow the car down and speed it up
Hey chump, I slowed your broad down and beat it up, haha
So don't be playin' wit a G shawty
Cause I can make you disappear for a G shawty
They always talk about the kid in the street shawty
The kid got more beef than the meat market, let me park it
Cause I don't trust valet wit my keys
Let's make a bet for 50 large, who flyer than me? nobody
