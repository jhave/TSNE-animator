[Chorus]
Pull up to the club, and I'm so throwed on Dubs
Wide frame, fucking up the mode on Dubs
Candy paint, fresh out the shop on Dubs
Big six hundreds, missing tops on Dubs
Got niggas on the block, in a drop on Dubs
Hiding behind tent, trunk knock on Dubs
We gon represent the North to the South, on Dubs
When your bopper's on jocks, she get tossed on Dubs

[Dougie D]
Now what these motherfuckers really know about Dubs
I take a sip, and I flip in that candy coated bug
Showing out I'm showing in, its the daddy that they love
While the Ferrellis spinning, just like right here they on Dubs
The hoes gon bop, the tops gon drop for real
I slide to the detail shop, just to shine up my rims
I grab the remote with the Clarion, with the screens lit
When I swang by the block, little kids be like ooh he the shit
That's the way that we does it, down in the Dirty turning heads
Bubble eyed, customized, flipping that blue or that red
Niggas don't fuck with no 17's, we on 20's instead
Man you heard what I said, that's the way that we rolling until I'm dead
Up on Dubs

[Chorus]

[Lil B]
Wide body four do', skating up the block
Relax on buck eyed, while my bumper unlock
Its the way that we do it, on the Dirty Dirty South
Hit the club showing love, diamond grills in our mouth 
(on Dubs), we like to steal the show
Yokohama on the tire, a.c. blow snow
Underdawgs in the mix, sideways on a switch
Leaving all hatas sick, screens lit watching flicks
(on Dubs), I'm tipping up Few Quay
Turning up on pump slow, just to hit the beltway
Headed down I-10, candy paint in the wind
Riding twins they Lorenz, in a big body Benz

[Chorus]

[Lil Head]
I'm on Dubs, bitch I'm out here loving this game
Just like these bad hoes, how they loving my name
Y'all know me Lil Head, yeah done knocked the fame
I'm a Houston hot boy, peep the platinum chain
I'm on Dubs, when I hit the parking lot
Screens lit, trunk pop leave the do's unlocked
Will a nigga steal my shit, playboy best not
Guerillas ready to mob, and they will bust shots
I'm a certified nigga, nationwide nigga
Smooth and laid back, like some Moonshine liquor
Walks in Guerilla Maab, better show us some love
Paint the orange drop, pulling out on Dubs (on Dubs)

[Trae]
Bubble lighten up the night when I skate by (on Dubs)
Screens lit with a bad bitch on the buck eyed (on Dubs)
Chunking deuce out the roof, when I crawl (on Dubs)
More 18's, making hatas call the laws (on Dubs)
A four-four grain waver, a lane glass paint stainer
A pop trunk swang banga, plus a Screwed Up entertainer
A drop top rearranger, strapped up with one up in the chamber
A block to block curve banga, with bops on jocks like Drena
Cause I'm a Dirty South shiner, with fifth wheels on recliner
A princess cut that'll blind you, and looking Big like Tymers
If you don't know where to find us, the nigga with chrome on the twins
With glass drop a Benz, three deep with twins and a friend and setting trends

[Chorus]

On Dubs - 8x</pre>
