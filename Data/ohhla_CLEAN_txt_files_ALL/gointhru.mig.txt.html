Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Offset]
I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'm a always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

[Verse 1: Offset]
I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got [?]
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 [?]
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid

[Chorus: Offset]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm &amp; Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' [?]
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley

[Chorus: Offset]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "Fuck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond

[Outro: Takeoff]
I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win</pre>
