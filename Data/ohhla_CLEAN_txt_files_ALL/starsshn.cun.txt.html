You can only see the stars when it's Don Cheadle black 
When the chips are down, who dips and who reacts? 
Foldin under pressure ain't get us to where we at 
When all hope's lost you battle to get it back 
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine 
Without them sour grapes, there would be no wine 
Your ego dine, adversity for breakfast 
Zero pride, in settling for less than 
fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails 
Instead of wishin on a star, grab a comet by the tail 
Your ship ain't comin in, then you got to make a sale 
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin
'til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin
Those talkin 'bout failure ain't talkin 'bout nothin
You may weather the storm if you don't stop punchin
Reach for the stars and you might just touch 'em 
 
[Chorus: Rick Warren]
Stars shine, stars shine 
When you think you've lost your way 
Making for a brighter day, a brighter day 
Stars shine, stars shine 
Coming out to light the way 
Making for a brighter day, a brighter day 
 
[Deacon]
Follow me...ey...
Our money's funny, our change is strange 
These days ain't sunny and the sea ain't tame 
We playin games where the rules ain't clearly defined 
In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind 
Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream 
Try lookin for the stars when examinin your dreams 
Could go from street singers to pop figures 
From block niggaz to a brotha that is followin stock tickers 
To, grow in the night you gotta create light 
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight 
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam 
and you don't need a telescope to detect dream 
You blessed with a mind that can see through space 
On dark nights, in the stars you can find yo' face 
Just look UP and marvel at all the constellations 
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations 
 
[Chorus 2X]
 
{beat change as Warren harmonizes}
 
[Rick Warren] 
Stars shine until you're back into the, back into the {2X} 
Stars shine until you're back into the, back into the light, light... 
Stars shine until you're back into the, back into the {2X}
Stars shine until you're back into the, back into the light, light, light... 
 
[Natti]
Against all odds and against the grain 
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain 
In monsoon proportions, them moments of importance 
When victory's in vain/vein, it's the same the blood coursin 
Of course when, selfishness inside provides poison 
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment 
Poised when them black clouds come 'round, don't back down 
Let haters be theme music playin in the background</pre>
