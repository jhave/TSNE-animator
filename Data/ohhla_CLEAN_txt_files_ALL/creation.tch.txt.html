Yeah, haha
Se ha acabado la mierda (The shit is finished)
Bout to drop a def' cut
Yo, yo, yo, huh

Immortal Technique, disintegrates mics when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Gaddafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
Their pathetic attempts, didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleeding internally, burnin' D, durin' surgery, verbally
'Cause I'm a spiritual witch, devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said "Let there be light", I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason Earth is only 5 billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the skies starting raining, continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Undebatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Juswifu, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters
I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call, for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss
'Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist

Hahahahaha yeah, real oh
We about to crash somethin' now, yo
Yo, yo, yo
I'm the Stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me, so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends, 'cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes

Immortal Technique
Harlem to Canada
Lyrically damage ya
Te dije que se ha acabado la mierda
