[Gangsta D]
Hello hookers, ya trick tramp sluts
It's me Gangsta D that be tossin' it up
Tell 'em 2nd II None, 'cause the game is fun
Some thought it was over (well it just begun)
Now watch me clown and have these hoochie hoes spreadin' eagle
I mash on these hookers 'cause my game is lethal
Potent baby, 'cause I gots to have it
A end my friend, now pour more Henn' (yac)
Hookers relax as I do this here just like that
Why must the dogg chase the cat?
The is the procedure, we just us (mash that hoe)
Before I get it poppin' I let the bitch know
That I be the one they call Gangsta D
I'm still kickin' back in the CPT
Ain't no trick on this earth that can handle me
Because I've been a G since the age of 3
Now check it

[Chorus]
Ain't no room for a straggler
Straggley want a crack at a macker, then pay a fee
Tryin' to act like it's all that
Trick please, I know you're down for some dirty work
Get on your knees

(Where my doggs at?)         *woof!*
(Give it up now)             *woof!*
(Let the real say)           *woof!*
(C'mon nigga)                *woof!*

[KK]
Like I'm supposed to kick back and spit cap with these hypes
Hangin' out, actin' Hollywood, talkin' bout it's all good?
Put the real in it phony, don't trip like ya know me
The 2 will crack you down and have ya fallin' when around
Check the sound - we puttin' down on CD's and tapes
Each one, teach one and keep away the face, hey
Fuck what I make with your mental hate
And all that salt that you shake
Watch the young K break and get these hookers steppin'
Step back in the direction that they just came from
Nah baby, ain't no trickin' with the None, sorry mack
Stickin' these hoes up in packs
With so much code we sick 'em back

[Gangsta D]
Crack a jack
Cause they all on a mission and they fightin' for position
Lookin' for commission from a hustler
But I wouldn't try to touch you with my fishin' pole
Now trick git, hit the stroll

[Chorus]
Ain't no room for a straggler
Straggley want a crack at a macker, then pay a fee
Tryin' to act like it's all that
Trick please, I know you're down for some dirty work
Get on your knees

(Get down all my doggs)      *woof!*
(All the players)            *woof!*
(Let the real)               *woof!*
(All the gangstas)           *woof!*

[Gangsta D]
If you ain't with this here then back it on up
I don't kill 'em soft, I make them hoes raise up
Tricks worse this year, got these hoes full blown
Steady grindin' these niggaz; point seen, money gone
There he go, in the club spendin' all the dubs
Got shook by a hook 'cause he broke code for love
Uh-oh, that's the way things go
I wouldn't mess around with funky cock hoes

[KK]
Triple X, 900-976 number workin'
Tricky click, porno flick, college undercover wit yo' fine ass
I see you got some suckas on a mad dash for they cash
You still don't get a pass - I'm not your Cape Crusader
Blackman while you're Robin, hey
I can't save ya like them suckas
(What they do?) They bustin' checks for some sex
Blowin' currency away by the stacks
(Now what's next?)

[Chorus]
Ain't no room for a straggler
Straggley want a crack at a macker, then pay a fee
Tryin' to act like it's all that
Trick please, I know you're down for some dirty work
Get on your knees

(Now all my doggs)           *woof!*
(Where my riders at?)        *woof!*
(Where my doggs at?)         *woof!*
(Give it up now)             *woof!*
(C'mon)                      *woof!*
(I can't hear you)           *woof!*
(Say what, what what)        *woof!*
(Say what, what what)        *woof!*


[Gangsta D talking]
Hell yeah, 2nd II None
Classic material for yo' ass
And for you stragglaz, you still don't get a pass
Yeah... that's how we doin' it over here
What you mean "what's a straggler?"
It's a hoodrat
Oh, you ain't a hoodrat?
What, you more like a lab rat?
You special?... Oh is that right?
Ah, fuck it</pre>
