Good morning New York
Good afternoon New Orleans
Goodnight America
This is Young Money... Nikki Minage

[Nikki]
They don't make us, to break us, no I'm with the bakers
I'm gettin bread wit dread up in Jamaica
It's them young stunnas, Nikk and Lil Weezy
Nikk, I'm the chick that "Go Get It" like Jeezy
Fall back, cause I do this here
Step ya bars up or your through this year
Yup it's only right that the whole blocks there
Hopped out the air in the blue and white layer
I'm here, I'm lit, long hair - don't care
Steady starin at my ear, cause my ear on glare
Now it's now hard to fine me, top behind me
You be Harry Potter, and I'll be Hermione
I be early, I'm the girl they
Call The One, like I'm my first birthday
I'm in that Range Rov, honkin that Kango
That pussy red, cause it tastes like mango

[Hook: Nikki]
Can't stop, won't stop, reppin Young Money 
And we... we get down and we... we get down
And we boyz o' boyz, they love me
(Chromed out eleven hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop, reppin Young Money
And we... we get down and we... we get down
And we...

[Lil Wayne]
Ya... dig
So I guess it's my turn
And I'ma go at niggaz heads like sideburns
Big phantom on the road, make a wide turn
Big light, green buds, is what I burn
Nikki, since I've been rappin, this is what I've learned
All these other niggaz pussy, like dry sperm
And I knock this shit out like Tom Hearns
If it aint about money, me no concern
A paper chaser, 'till my thigh burn
And never give a bitch, what I've earned
Fuck I look like?
I'm lookin for a bitch that can fuck right, cook right
And if not, then left foot right
Foot get the steppin, yea bitch walk like...
And my hoes talk like "Hsshswash", and I just say "Right"
We don't fuss fight, she is just.. just.. just right

[Hook: Nikki]
Can't stop, won't stop, reppin Young Money (Ya digggggggggg!?)
And we... we get down and we... we get down
And we boyz o' boyz they love
(Chromed out eleven hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop, reppin Young Money
And we... we get down and we... we get down
And we...

[Lil Wayne]
I'm on tour, 'till my money's like the bus height
Ice lookin bright, see me comin like bus lights
Weezy!

Nikki..Minage..
