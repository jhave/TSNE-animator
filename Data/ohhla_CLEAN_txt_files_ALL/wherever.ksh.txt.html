Song:   Wherever You Are
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It was a summer night
The stars were all aligned
You, you, you, you showed up
And blew my mind

We didn't sleep at all
Played records all night long
That, that, that night
I kind of fell in love

Something in your kiss
Made my body electric
You set me free
That night, brough to life
For the magic that's inside
Of you and me

Wherever you are
You are forever on my mind
Wherever you are
Know that our love will never die

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Love will never die
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

Electric wire love
The sun was coming up
Red, red, red wine
And whiskey on your tongue

Tangled up in your sheets
You saw the real me
You, you, you, you give me
Something to believe

Something in your kiss
Made my body electric
You set me free
That night, brough to life
For the magic that's inside
Of you and me

Wherever you are
You are forever on my mind
Wherever you are
Know that our love will never die

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Love will never die
Wherever you are
Wherever you are

(Wherever, wherever)
Wherever you are

Wherever you are

Nothin' lasts forever
But I will always remember
Those nights we spent together
Wherever, wherever

Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Love will never die
Wherever you are
(Wherever you are)

Wherever you are
(Wherever, wherever)
Love will never die
Wherever you are</pre>
