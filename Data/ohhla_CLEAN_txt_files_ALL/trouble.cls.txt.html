[Intro - Classified - talking]
(Troubleeeee)
("Hypocritical")
(Troubleeeee)
They say my beats are (troubleeeee)
"Hyp-hyp-hypocritical"
(Troubleeeee)
It's got to be (troubleeee)
("Hyp-hyp-hypocritical")
(Troubleeeee)
("Hyp-hyp-hypocritical")

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, now I'll admit it, I'm a hypocrite (yeah)
Tryin to get a grip (what?), let me flip the script (ha)
I'm seein things a little different (uh), I was the one to never hit a spliff
Now it's like everytime it's lit, I need to get a bit
I go on fishing trips (yeah), but hate fish and chips (what?)
Never handle business but always busy in the midst of it (ha)
Shit I'm a animal but tamer than a house cat
Cheese don't concern me but I'm caught up in this mouse trap
Still unsure what I stand for (uh)
I'm just a man torn, walkin blind, caught up in a sandstorm (ha)
I always say that I'm a one man band
But I got more guys on stage than you can count on one hand
Damn I'm confusin, roll up the hydro
I hate cigarettes but I'm addicted to tobacco (troubleeeee)
Won't break the bank but I'll break some bread
And I don't want to lose my hair but then I shave my head

[Chorus - Classified]
Whether wrong or right, I'm a give you what you need
'Cause my whole life, I had to keep up to the beat
So I hold tight, I got to get in where I fit in
Hit 'em with the rhythm and when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
And when the beat goes on
And when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
("Hypocrit")
And when the beat goes on
("Hypocritical")

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Uh, yeah, now I don't do what I used but do things I never did
Still got my values but switched up my etiquette
This industry don't come with benefits
That's why I'm savin for a rainy day and tryin to stay ahead of it
I freeze time when I reach mine
And each line (yeah) is universal like a peace sign, so keep tryin (keep tryin)
I ain't a fighter but I love pretendin (uh huh)
Don't get it twisted bud I ain't a bitch, I ain't surrenderin (nope)
I ain't your everyday rapper with a love for foreign whips (yeah)
At the club scorin chicks (yeah), it ain't a skill I was born with (nope)
I usually stay at home payin off these mortgages
Watch a couple porn flicks, eatin bags of corn chips (ha)

[Chorus - Classified]
Whether wrong or right, I'm a give you what you need
'Cause my whole life, I had to keep up to the beat
So I hold tight, I got to get in where I fit in
Hit 'em with the rhythm and when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
And when the beat goes on
And when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
("Hypocritical")

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Yeah, now take a minute (uh huh) and take a listen (yeah)
From Enfield straight spittin, originate from Great Britain
Proud +Martimer+, drinkin in my neighbor's kitchen
Empty out the fridge, usually we overstay our visit
Used to think I didn't care what people said
'Til I double checked message boards before I went to bed and
I always said this fame won't go to my head then
I catch myself thinkin I'm that Dude like Devin
Shit, I know I'm goin to grow
'Cause it a love/hate relationship, some things will come and go (troubleeeee)
But yo, I learned to live, live and learn (yeah)
We all hypocritical, as far as I'm concerned

[Chorus - Classified]
Whether wrong or right, I'm a give you what you need
'Cause my whole life, I had to keep up to the beat
So I hold tight, I got to get in where I fit in
Hit 'em with the rhythm and when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
And when the beat goes on ("hypocrit")
And when the beat goes on it's - (troubleeeee)
And when the beat goes on ("hypocrit-hyp")
It's got to be (troubleeeee)
("Hyp-hyp-hypocritical")
("Hyp-hyp-hypocrit")
(Troubleeeee)
("Hypocritical")
It's got to be (troubleeeee)
(Troubleeeee)</pre>
