[Intro: Solomon Childs]
One more time, right?
Fo' sho, heh, reporting live from Nexus

[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
To the fellas in the place
Put the kitty cat up and take chase
Sippin' Perignon by the case, rep it for the west to east
Flossin' nothing less than a fifty cent piece
To the ladies in the place
With the dicky dicky hunting, take chase
Sippin' Alize by the case, flossin' for the fellas
Watching all them chicken heads get jealous

[Solomon Childs]
To the fellas in the place
I think I saw Halle Berry in the place
Gotta be amongst some of the most beautifullest women on the planet
Cheers, but they extravegent talent, Timbs and hits
Bouncin' around like Patti LaBelle
Ladies night, with Angie Martinez and Coco Chanel
You ever been to Club Cheetah?
It's getting hot in here, grey goose in the 2-liter
Daddy's little girl, and you don't wanna get involved with the thugs
Although we got nothing but love, although
In the club, there's nothing but love

[Chorus]

[Solomon Childs]
Ain't you Solomon Childs?
Yeah, I heard about your many styles
And I heard about your many tours
And I heard about the girls you go out for
What you think girls be yellin' about, talking about
On the phone conversating all day about
Listen, we just met girl
And that don't mean I won't thug you out
Hold you up, and hold you out
You better watch what you talking about
Shit, I'm a pimp, you ain't know, girl?
I can understand your repertoire, girl
And understand the ways that you tryin' get it tight, girl
How you try'nna roll around, girl
How you and your whole team in the club, bouncing
Around, through ladies night, doing ya thing
Shittin' it up and giving it out
Uh, hope that you giving it out
And oh, the DJ about to play the last record
And you know what that mean
After the club, it's the after party, and
After the party, it's the hotel lobby, and
After the hotel lobby...
I'm try'nna get you a MetroCard, boo... holla

[Chorus]

[Outro: Solomon Childs]
Uh, you can-you can-you got it, you got it
You can-you can-you got it, you got it
You can-you can-you got it, you got it
You can-you can-you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it</pre>
