[Young Jeezy]
Tryna get Boston George and Diego money (jeah)
And stack it all up like Lego money (ha ha)
Play with them blocks, call it Tetris (jeah)
Real talk, a hundred carats in my necklace
Look up in the sky, tell me what you see (the clouds)
Naw nigga not me (yeeeeeah)
I see opportunity, I'm an opportunist
Nigga ya heard what I said, I'm an opportunist (jeah)
Off the hard white and the cream (cream)
All these free agents, ya better build ya team (that's right)
I come and take the game like John Madden (jeah)
Cause I played in the game like John Madden (ay)

[Hook]
The world is yours and everything in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it (ay)
Hands in the air (Sky's the limit nigga)
Hands in the air (jeah)
The world is yours and every bitch in it
It's out there, get on your grind and get it (ay)
Hands in the air (Sky's the limit nigga)
Hands in the air (jeah)

[Young Jeezy]
Anything you put ya mind to put ya grind to
Forgetful ass nigga, must I remind you (jeah)
Men do what they want, boys do what they can
And it ain't no secret, I'm a grown ass man (jeah)
Put my hands on the Bible and I solemnly swear (swear)
Leave them all with more shoes than I could possibly wear (daaaamn)
Niggaz still hating, but they can kiss my ass
Still get a hard-on when I count that cash (jeah)
I give 'em the squares, you give me the bags (ha ha)
I give 'em the squares, you give me the cash (jeah)
And that's what the fuck I call a even exchange
And if there's anything extra you can keep the change (yeeeeeah)

[Hook]

[Young Jeezy]
Grind sun down till it comes up again
Stay down till we come back up again (jeah)
It's all in the game, the ups, the downs
It's all in the game, the O's, the pounds (ay)
The shit was all good just a week ago
Whole click was eating good just a week ago
It's all good nigga, give us a month
Thinking of a master plan while I smoke this blunt (yeeeeeah)
With the huse to the back, now everybody got coupes (ha ha)
But the word in the street that supply the troops (jeah)
I just call 'em like I see 'em
Serve these niggaz third person dog, I ain't trying to see em (ay)
