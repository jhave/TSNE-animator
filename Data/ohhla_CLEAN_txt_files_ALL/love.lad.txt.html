(If you can, you walk out that door)
Yeah,
It's like a cycle
Word up,
You know women dunn?
Can't live with 'em
Can't live without 'em
Uhh,
But one thing they have to understand
That knowledge is first
Word up, You know
Love...

[La The Darkman] (Mala Campbell)
We started off back in high school my new Boo
She stunted at first but I seen right through
Her whole chemistry so I behaved rather friendly
A fly rudeboy and she seen the truth in me
She was a natural beautiful skin and white teeth
Her sandals displayed her feet
I like her technique she wasn't in the street most of the time
Pure personality which labelled her a dime
She had a virgin mind 
Style wid good conversation
Knew the important virtue of patience
Stay wonderful respectable middle class queen
But I ran the street been indulged with other things
Time passed our relationship elevated
She wrote my man letters while he was incarcerated
I remember we thought she was pregnant one time
I stayed by her side and she wouldn't let me rhyme
It was love at first touch for me and this miss
She only complained about the time that I spent
In her hand I told her love understand as a man
I gotta live out my plan providing for my family is a must
And all I ask from my woman is love and trust
My life is difficult being a business man artist
I might be outta state but I think of you regardless
I'm bogged, I look into your eyes and get hard
I'll make you my planet and I'll be the God
Don't make me choose between you and my career
Gotta take this opportunity love while it's here
I care, completion is man woman and child
My people bass tips just to make me smile
I know every woman's dream is to have a ring
A strong man to hold and the finer things
Cause you can cook and clean keep the Power-U tight
Be a wifey I'm coming home on the next flight
But if you can't respect my laws and be what I need
The God have to leave cause life will proceed
I feel Love

(You walk out that door)
Word up
(If you can walk out that door)
To all the Boos out there love
You know
(I gave you all I had and all I have is love)
(When you're in love, when you're in love)
(I gave you all I had and all I have is love)
(When you're in love, when you're in love)

(When you're in love, ohoh)
(I gave you all I had)
(I gave you all I had)

(If you can, you walk out that door)
