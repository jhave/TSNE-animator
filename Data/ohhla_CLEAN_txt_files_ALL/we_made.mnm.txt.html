[Eminem]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp] + (Eminem)
When you walked, through the door (woo!)
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one, they adore
Who they came to see (who they came to see)
You're a, rock star (baby!)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player (ohh!)
Who can really blame you? (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

[Eminem]
Chka... ahem, back by popular demand!
Now pop a little Zan-tac, for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel? Is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just cause he asked to put his hands
on her massive, gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes he can-can, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2, you're practically a 10
I know you want me girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
The enforcer, lookin for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and, Charlie horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
have that I don't? Are you tellin me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler, and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby say hello to my little friend
Brit forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile, they got style but it isn't Slim

[Chorus]

[Eminem - singing]
And that's why, my love, you'll never live, without
I know you want me girl cause I can see you're checkin me out
And baby, you know, you know you want, me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one, for you {*fart*}

[Eminem]
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba, put her breasts on my mouth, blup
Wowzers, I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressin like Elvis
Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Lookin like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can ya blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
with a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
So baby baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, get down
Baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, down-down
Baby get down, get down

[Outro: Eminem]
Ohh Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha ha, woo! Dr. Dre! 2020!
Yeah</pre>
