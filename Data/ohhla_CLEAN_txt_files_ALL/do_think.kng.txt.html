Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I had the most beautiful woman
At one point in my life..
And somehow someway
I fucked it all up..

Baby I'm sorry, for always dissing you
Please forgive me, for the bullshit that I put you through
Now I'm going through this drama, with women sayin' they know me
They telling you all these stories, I'm telling you its my homies
Now I was feeling guilty and I can't deny
Somebody shoulda told me, I was kissing you goodbye
I sent you text messages, and never got replied
Fuck your Instagram pictures, this shit's killing my vibe
The fuck is wrong with you? uploading pictures at parties
I'm tryna ignore the pain, by tattooing my body
I go to sleep just hoping that, maybe ima see you, by the morning
Hoping that its you, when my phone rings
Your friends giving you advice, but its the wrong things
Put your pride aside, baby fuck what they all think
I promise ima change, cause your the one for me
Moment of silence, baby just tell me you got love for me..

[Chorus]
Tell me why we don't kiss anymore
Acting like I don't even exist anymore
Do you ever think of me at all?
Do you ever think of us at all?
Tell me why we don't kiss anymore
Acting like I don't even exist anymore
Do you ever think of me at all?
Do you ever think of us at all?

You were rite about that girl, I took to my shows
That same one that was in 2Tone's video
Yea I was fucking, intuition was rite
You went home early, I came home that late night
You woke up, when I walked in
Member we started talking, asking how did it go?
I said baby we had it poppin'
And I knew that I was lying when I looked at you
I changed clothes cause I smelled like her perfume
That was the reason for the flowers that I sent you
I'm a guilty motherfucker, I respect you
Cause you would never leave, no matter what they said about me
Your friends talked alotta shit, and you would never doubt me
Even tho I'm wrong, and we parted ways
It hurts so much, for me to see you walk away
Whats the purpose of hurting women, who don't deserve it
I guess I learned my lesson, cause I'm the one who's hurting

[Chorus]
Tell me why we don't kiss anymore
Acting like I don't even exist anymore
Do you ever think of me at all?
Do you ever think of us at all?
Tell me why we don't kiss anymore
Acting like I don't even exist anymore
Do you ever think of me at all?
Do you ever think of us at all?</pre>
