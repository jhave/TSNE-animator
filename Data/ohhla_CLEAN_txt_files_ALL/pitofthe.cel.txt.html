[Intro] [Some redneck talking]
God damn it Jimmy. You better get in this house and listen to this Equilibrium
This vinyl is the best god damn thing in your life
I'll slap you with that god damn vinyl piece Jimmy

I don't give a fuck about a parka. He's wearing a fuckin' cardigan!

[Celph Titled talking]
Yo, y'all know the fuckin' science. Equilibrium. Majik Most. DutchMassive
And yours truly, Celph Titled. We back up in this motherfucker for real
Fahrenheit 813, 2003. J.J. Brown on the motherfuckin' beat
Watch how we flip it on these faggot ass niggas

[Verse One] [Majik Most]
Oh shit it's Majik!
Most!
Yeeeeah
And I don't kick mama jokes
I kick it to your moms, slippin' Mickey's in her Coke
Everything I ever wrote, dope enough to quote
Your rhymes suck! 
I wouldn't play you as a joke
But crash my car to wreck yours no doubt
And if the streets are watchin', we shoot the eyes out
So fuck all that feminist stuff you talk about
No R&amp;B in me, see I give it to 'em rough
Find your wife knocked out, naked, wearing hand cuffs
About to bust, when your girl grabbed the Kodak
Took a picture of my bozak, I'm all that
Watch my raps give you cataracts until you crash Cadillac into a cactus patch
The flow's exact
Exacto knife raps
Slice through your backpack
Right into the fat, I'm the fattest on tracks
So make way, move back
It's skills that you lack
So yo bust this
You can sweat me, watch me, jock me and clock me but don't battle me
Cause you're not a lyricist bitch

[Scratch chorus]
Majik Most
Bitch
DutchMassive
Remember that shit
Celph Titled
Damn it he's ill
"Raised in the pit of the flame" - M.O.P. 
"Comin' real"
"And my team's strong"
"Battle mech ready to flex" - Apathy 'Chrome Depot Freestyle'
"Raised in the pit of the flame"

[Verse Two] [DutchMassive]
You won't find me in The Source for the quote of the month
Dutch
That's right, throw your weapons up
You can catch me shotgun in your car, puffin' a blunt
Dutch
That's right, throwin' upper cuts
I chuckle at the fact of what a thug would do
I stand right above you, snub you, take your girl and the mic from you
Ayo fuck you!
Sincerely from the whole crew
You're never comin' out, delete your vocals
Both my arms will crush your ego
I defeat foes by throwin' they body parts to the shark people
You want battle raps?
I cut kids heads off at they backpacks
And tell 'em I got jazz while Celph push they wig back
I just sit back and laugh cause where I'm goin', see, chicks don't dig that
And yo, I'm for the women FUCK THE CHILDREN
Building block Floridian, DutchMassive, Equilibrium

[Scratch chorus]
Majik Most 
Bitch
That's Massive
Remember that shit
Celph Titled
Damn it he's ill
"Raised in the pit of the flame" - M.O.P. 
"Comin' real"
"And my team's strong"
"Battle mech ready to flex" - Apathy 'Chrome Depot Freestyle'
"Raised in the pit of the flame"

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
We can stand up in a hurricane and still stay balanced
And give props to anyone that's stupid enough to challenge
Equilibrium, Tampa Bay's three wise men
Gamble with your life in our hands and let the dice spin
Tiger with ice pick claws 
That'll slow your roll
My clique is superstars, we get more head than a totem pole
Evacuate like Kosovo
I put bullets where they're supposed to go
All up in your face and leave a hundred holes
MC's can't cope?
Keep your third eye closed
Brace for impact that'll reverb from each verse I spoke
A true pimp, leavin' a bitches pants soakin'
When the last date you had was with a videotape and hand lotion
I'm nasty at bar fights so guard your gold tooth
Fuck tables
I'm hittin' niggas with the entire booth
My repertoire stay dirty south with filthy burners
Put my work on the streets and milk all of my earnings
I'm courteous
Even when it's your life I'm ending
I'll sterilize the razor and give you a clean cut image
Celph Titled, godfather of pan handled hip hop
But I can't handle this man's samples leavin' your man dismantled

[Scratch chorus]
Majik Most 
Bitch
That's Massive
Remember that shit
Celph Titled
Damn it he's ill
"Raised in the pit of the flame" - M.O.P. 
"Comin' real"
"And my team's strong"
"Battle mech ready to flex" - Apathy 'Chrome Depot Freestyle'
"Raised in the pit of the flame"

[Outro] [Some redneck talking]
Jimmy get in this house and feed this god damn bird. You wanted a bird
You gonna feed that god damn bird. This god damn bird is malnourished
It's god damn legs are bending when it gets on it's perch
You son of bitch. Get in here Jimmy</pre>
