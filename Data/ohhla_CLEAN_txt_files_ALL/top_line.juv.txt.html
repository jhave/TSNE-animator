Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus]
I wear top of the line clothes, drive top of the line cars
Fuck top of the line hoes, some top of the line stars
I wear top of the line clothes, drive top of the line cars
Fuck top of the line hoes, some top of the line stars
I'm top of the line {*3X*} I'm top of the line {*3X*}
I'm top of the line {*3X*} I'm top of the line {*3X*}

[Juvenile]
And nigga, I'm spendin all my dollars on my brand new wear
I talk to these bitches like I really do care
Any conversation 'bout the money you dare
Eleven hundred got a nigga look at two pair
The ice gotta sparkle if it don't lose layer
All I get is attitude and boo boo stares
Look, Juvie got E.G., they too rare
The Coogi hot {?} and they give me two pair
Sharp crease and lining like I'm growin new hair
Went Hollywood on 'em, I ain't have to move there
Somebody tell me that there's gon' be a new mayor
Consider me the King of New Orleans, true there

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Juvenile and Nino, Magnolia lean-o
A pocket full of C-notes, a black jalapeno
Yeah I got an ego, the nigga do his thing though
I got bad bitches, black white and latino
Hoods clockin, dogs rats and cats watchin
And they heard 'bout it, and they done told e'rybody
that they sure 'bout it, that it's better than your product
All in your project, even your homey Herb got it
And I ain't shy 'bout it, so tell me what you need
I got all the llello but my wodie got the weed
In Oakland got the fiends, and Brooklyn{?} got the river{?}
Shit goin sour then get some of your sugar

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Back in the saddle it's that boy from the booth
What's happenin lil' baby, what it is, what it do?
You know I'm had them boys that need somethin brand new
I ain't never had shit, that's how the hustle man do
Wild DJ's on the 1's and 2's
How niggaz blow they shit up and they all bad news
Don't tell 'em nuttin nigga that's a bad move
They a bunch of hotheads and they never act cool
I ain't {?} when I be bustin ass too
I'm a Nolia boy you seen the fuckin tattoo
I can get you hit don't put nuttin past you
Why you stuntin wit'cha money? Nigga I got cash too

[Chorus]
