[Mark Prentice]
I'm a young man, and I find myself in, sticky situations
And I, wanna do right, but wrong is looking good to me
Fighting temptations
Doing my best, to keep standing
But living this Christian life sometimes seems so demanding
But it don't have to be

[Chorus: Mark Prentice]
What would Jesus do (would he be playin' around, layin' around)
W-W-J-D
What would Jesus do (want ya Holy Spirit stayin' around, stayin around)
W-W-J-D
What would Jesus do (so I watch the way I get down, way I get down)
W-W-J-D
What would Jesus do
W-W-J-D

[Mark Prentice]
So many things, that we get ourselves in, could have been avoided
If we remember Jesus Christ, is the head of our lives
Jesus (wouldn't be in that bed) Jesus (wouldn't have said those things that I said)
I'm learning, I'm hearing, I'm asking, What Would Jesus Do

[Sean Slaughter]
Ey-yo couzin is ya crazy, double dub J-D
That's all it is, that's how I live, then life is gravy
You wanna spit bible verses, throw ya hands in churches
But ya never live like Jesus did so daddy check ya person
You got the whole game tight, title on ya name type
Loving all the fame hype, but ya ain't ordained right
Still flirting with women, habitual sinning
Instead of smiling, money you grinning, pro in pretending
It might sound offending, but thon I gotta call it like I see
Cause what I talk I walk it, God said it so I'ma be it
Defeated, if ya swapping character for personality
Real for non-reality righteousness for a salary
Christ is the battery that moves me on the narrow steadily
The kingdom of God, is like a bike that's screaming peddle me
Move with the melody, what would Christ do instead of me
Would he cuss and hate me now or would he love me readily
Would he hurt a child or would he heal him till' he's well again
Would he shout and brag or would he take the road that humbling
That 's my position, when it comes to holy submission
I rather obey and listen than push, an expedition
When a life test comes up, thonny throw ya dubs up
Christians tear the club up, shining bright when the sons' up
It's critical, that's why we walk out his life in the physical
Max it and never minimal, reaching for the pinnacle
He got me in a hold like tentacles, man I'm sold out
And if ya feel me kid, no doubt, soldiers fold out
It's just me and Mark Prentice, so put away all defenses
Double dub J digs, baby relentless

[Chorus]</pre>
