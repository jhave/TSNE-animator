Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's street dreams
I still got these street dreams
You feel me? Niggas never left their shit man
I'll never have to struggle
I'm still in it man
Feeling like I said, remember why I signed artist for a reason
Ross rapper, live for a reason
I wanna thank y'all for stickin with me while I'm still in the hood
Thuggin this shit out man
It's real

I'm dreaming for the day that I make it off rappin
Niggas posted in the hood, they gave they life to the trappin
Never seen a bad day but I know when it happen
Gotta keep your mind right or you lose your advancement
Gotta stay with your pace, I'm stayin in place
Niggas laughed in my face when I lost my race
How it feel when people closest is fake?
Niggas walk by the way,
How you doin? I'm straight
Niggas tryina be down, you a lil too late
You love me for the heart is what I'm meaning to say
It's so crazy that niggas, I'm shady and kill
Tryina take you out the game, envy they feel
I was made for this rap cause my life is a movie
Had the pistol to my head and they still ain't shoot me
I'm humble as ever, real niggas from the hood
Let's get this shit together

And all my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yea, street dreams, yea

What if I said I was really against it?
Would you look me in my eyes and walk past like a stranger?
Most people walk past like they life is in danger
I forgive a lot of people, I'm controlling my anger
You can't see but niggas waiting on you to fail
Man my life was so real, like water front derail
I just speak what I know, never say what I hear
When you talkin about niggas, they know I'm real
I would've had your attention if I was out here bitchin
Try to get out the hood is the only mission
I got a 6th sense to keep straighten the heat
Ask God every day that he did my beef
Niggas is so quick to handle court in the street
They wanna see me fail but the legend in me
They wanna see me stop but for sure won't stop
For life I'm a rep Lil B to the top
Yes

And all my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life
I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too</pre>
