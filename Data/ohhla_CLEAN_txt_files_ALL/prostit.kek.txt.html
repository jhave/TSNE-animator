[Intro]
Where the bad bitches at, where the bad bitches at
Where they at, where they at
Where the bad hoes at, where the bad hoes at
Where they at, where they at, where they at

[Hook - 2x]
I'm in hot pursuit, for a prostitute
I like 'em short like 'em tall, like 'em thick and cute
I like 'em jazzy classy, so sophisticated
Nasty attitude, make all the hoes hate it

[Lil' Keke]
I like 'em jazzy, ready to shine like me
Got her game face on, when she ride with Ke
36-28, when she step on the flo'
Got the tricks going crazy, everywhere she go
She's a head hunter, getting money for real
Make a nigga drop dead, she got looks that kill
Her name Candy, met her down in ATL
I was flossing in the Benz, passing through 112
So I pulled up, as I continued to slide
She told her friend hop in, they was ready to ride
We hit the strip, then I let the bang do the talking
20's looking good, they crawling and moon walking

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
A playa spit game, like the mack I be
She was looking for a pimp, now she working for me
Baby girl don't bar, she a killer fa sho
She already had skills, but I made her a pro
Houston Texas baby, it's time to make that switch
From a certified hoe, to a gangsta bitch
I'm the young Don, and I ain't got nothing to hide
When a bitch work for me, she better do it with pride
So I fired up a square, start thinking bout my feddy
Riding up one deep, got the 4-5 ready
I hit the club, oh yeah she doing her thang
Shooting that good game, representing my name
I got it locked down, on back to Chi-Town
Gotta swim with the big fish, or punk you drown
I'm a gangsta, and that's the way that it go
I'm a certified baller, I don't love no hoe what

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Now back, to the lecture at hand
She thinking bo-legged, got a hell of a stand
This bitch off the hook, so watch your checkbook
She always on the grind, she'll have you shook
She's a go-getter, every nigga wanna hit her
Spending bundles of cash, trying to get with her
This the episode, where it really get sto'
Airplanes and trains, keep a bitch on the road
It's money making, with no time for the faking
Pyrexes shaking, nothing but ki's baking
They hating, but I'm getting that loot
I got a super bad broad, she in hot pursuit
