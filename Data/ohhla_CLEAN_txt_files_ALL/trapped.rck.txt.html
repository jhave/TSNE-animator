[Slick Rick]
Yeah kid..

Well first of all, sit your, cause I'm Victor
The Ruler decorate a record just like a picture
Slicker licker isn't this vigorous
Motherfucker too Don Suave for any nigga it's
I sold that offender
Short killer note is that I wrote a tremendous
Old neighborhood chow, now Rick vow
even rich niggaz must bow now
Extrordinarily handsome, grandson
Pack your bags, suitcase out the mansion
Any time that you wish that - I flow that
A whole bunch of big shots bums, now you know that
Opinions, wifepiece - hers fat
You wish a rapper could be better than perfect
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

	Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
	Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
	Your rappin is trapped in me
	Your vocals is trapped in me
	Your voice gets trapped in me
	Your lyrics is trapped in me
	Your vocals is trapped in me..

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fecal sick of it, through the thick of it
Even my cat like, "Ricky you the nigga kid"
Certain rappers earned thou on shit
Watch them nigga ass squirm now in front Rick
How dare you figure it out one come fair
Nigga career, buried now somewhere
Gladys Pips and off her, force her
Even back when I was the fattest shit the world saw
DJ, attack the eight track
White black motherfuckin men RCA jacks
Royal, holla me, all y'all know I lead you
Follow me, all four
Centerpiece, narrow in the shit ass
White House bounces off the power that the kid has
While other rap plunderin under ya
You incredible, unstoppable wonder you
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

	Ricky your vocals is trapped in me
	Rick your voice gets trapped in me
	Ricky your lyrics is trapped in me
	Ricky your rappin is trapped in me
	Rick your voice gets trapped in me
	Ricky your style gets lost in me
	Ricky your lovin gets trapped to a T

Eyepatch and kneel, don't well that's a heel
Can't even go to the bathroom mat for real
Vision, won't patch eye kiss of the
three gay niggaz pushin up like prisoner
Can't stand it - and the Ricky is organic
On the real, got too much style for this planet
Woman hard mark, old charcoal nigga
don't make me get the jewels start sparkle
Anytime you hear the La-Di-Da-Di start
bitch underwear been flung off the bodypart
And find, they assembling grand rhyme
Can't find, I'm overwhelming to mankind
Why discrepancies erupt to
and play with intelligence you cannot measure up to
Candidate, who talk shit anyway
And this is what most bitch walk this planet say

	Ricky your rap gets trapped in me
	Ricky your vocals get trapped in me
	Rick your voice gets trapped in me
	Ricky your lyrics get trapped in me
	Ricky your lovin gets trapped in me
	Ricky your style gets trapped in me
	Ricky your lovin gets rocked in me..</pre>
