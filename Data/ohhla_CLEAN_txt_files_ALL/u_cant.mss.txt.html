[Baby]
Uh, what's happenin?  What
Uptown, New Orleans in this bitch with VA, you understand? 
With this hot girl, Missy 
Fuckin with these Uptown Guerillas, you dig?
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense
Do yo' thing girl

[Missy]
Y'all don't wanna gimme my props? 
I'mma have to lick two shots on my glock
Pop-pop the enemy 'till he drop
Make his whole body go hibbie-to-the-hop 
Well I won't stop 'till I get up to the top
Gotta blow any other state off the block
And I got a whole lotta chedda in my pock's
You better gimmie giimme five mics, gimme props
Say you sick of my clique and my shit
'Cause I got a whole lotta hits and no tricks
Just a bass line, few snares, few kicks
Make the whole industry wanna go and bit
I say you sit, we sit, I sit
While I go shit on a mix like this
Say you spit, I spit, we spit
But you can't fuck with a nigga like this 
Check me out

1 - 	Hatin' on us but ya can't resist
	If you come hard, better come legit
	We gon' talk shit 'cause we confident
	If you think not, then you bound to sit

 	Hatin' on us but ya can't resist
	If you come hard, better come legit
	We gon' talk shit 'cause we confident
	We gon' show you so you best believe it

[Missy]
Y'all don't wanna put me on front
On the front page, all the shit I don' done?
Now you wanna fuck around and grade my shit?
Let's talk about the million niggas who bit

It's only one Timothy from the V. 
And the whole industry goin' beep-beep
Now I gotta go change up my beats
So another nigga won't duplicate me

Yeah I got styles, got shows, videos
And my shows, it grows, it grows
And I sing, I flow, I blows 
And I know y'all niggas know 
When I come swift with the one-two kick
If ya got a blunt, got a light, got it lit
Yeah, don't stop, won't stop, won't quit
And I made 1.6 admit, check me out 

Repeat 1

[B.G.]
I'm that nigga that tote them AK's 
B.G. is what they call me
I be in them project hallways
Beef with me, you gon' be sorry
Me and my niggas'll shut yo' block down
We got K's so, put them glocks down
You scared to come outside
Them Hot Boys got you on lock-down 
This nigga here from CMB
Roll with a clique about 20 deep
Cause I made a mill', it don't mean
I ain't gonna keep it real with my peeps
All I have is thugs in my clique
All my nigga's, they come off the street
Now all of a sudden hoe's on my dick 
Cause I'm on BET and MTV

[Juvenile] 
It ain't no secret, this nigga be project
Getting paid, that's what's my object
Ain't none of you nigga's gon' stop this
Cause I'm 'bout makin' a profit
I'm all about getting it locked, dog
Don't wanna be on the block, yo
Cause bitches be makin' them tye calls
While I be makin' drop offs
Mannie Fresh, he hooked me up too
To the playa hater's I say, fuck you
You needs to worry 'bout you
Instead of what to not do
Juvenile don' hooked up with Missy
Bitches gon' hate me, bitches gon' dis me
Alota you nigga's gon' miss me
I'mma be here, you gon' be history

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Missy]
If you come hard, better come legit
(Say what? Oh, ah huh)
If you come hard, better come legit
(Oh, uh)
We gon' show you, so you best believe
