[Verse - Pharrell]
Unzip your skirt
Take off your blouse
I hope your toes are painted
Cause you gon dance in your undies all over the house

When your eyes are closed
I hope I'm the man you see (the man you see)
Cause if not, I want you to know
Tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

[Chorus]
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
Slow motion like a dream
But real time is what it seems
I love the way she dance
See I love the way she dance
Girl, I love the way you dance

[Verse - Pharrell]
I am in your aquarium
Are you a mermaid or something?
Is it possible to marry one?
Big tits, fat ass and turquoise skin

When your eyes are closed
I hope I'm the man you see (the man you see)
Cause if not, I want you to know
Tonight I plan to be
Is this for me? HO!

[Chorus]

Calling all cars, please arrest her
(She's a criminal in my dreams)
She just stole my heart
(It's an A.P.B.)

[Chorus]

[Outro - Pharrell]
Kissing you, kissing me, it's Euphoria
Remission two, remission three
It's kissing four of ya
(When sparks fly, sparks fly)
I think that's love
(When sparks fly, sparks fly)
Don't you think
Close your eyes
Hold my hand
Concentration
No destination
Just dance on constellations
(When sparks fly, sparks fly)
I think that's love
(When sparks fly, sparks fly)
Don't you think
Excuse me
But girl come with me
See you and I can be each other's company
Can't you see
(When sparks fly, sparks fly)
I think that's love</pre>
