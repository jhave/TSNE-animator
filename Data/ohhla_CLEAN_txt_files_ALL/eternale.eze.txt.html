Yo this is Yella

I wanted to make this one to remember my lil nigga E
I know he wanted this track on his record

so I finished for him peace nigga...

[Eazy-E]
We did a song fuck da police you know 
and everybody been hearing fuck sayin' 
fuck da police for years and years and years
and finally it took a muthaphukka to video tape
a nigga gettin' the shit beat out of him
for everybody else to say fuck da police
and we did fuck da police people put us down
and sayed we were ahead of our time you know it
took the video you know ya shot by accident
to tell the truth and open the worlds eyes
yes we do have a serious problem in L.A.
and other citys true retaliate happens all the time
people tryin' to change things for years but I don't
think anything is gonna help the problem is to deep
N.W.A. is just being brutally honest.

They swearin' on cable T.V. it ain't teachin'

learn shit you know it's not gonna be teachin'

[Eazy-E]
We don't tell you to go out and gang bang

know if you could go out stealin' and killin'
and beatin' up people all day but that person 
ends up dead or in jail sometimes he gets away

out and do that other thing or whateva it is
you know we aint tell you to be joinin' no gang
or whateva else.
