I swear to you Lord 
Same dudes used to laugh at me 
See me in the CL 6 with half a b 
They know that money begets money so naturally 
Me and Half could blow a couple of stacks hassle free 
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me 
'Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three 
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice 
With no copies made I got the master keys 
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream 
Could mould you rappers like plasticine 
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between 
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens* 
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team 
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene 
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here 
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's 
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears 
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears 
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall 
I run my bill up making executives calls 
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls 
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew 
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue 
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet 
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit 
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away 
You feel me?</pre>
