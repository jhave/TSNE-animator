[Iriscience]
I set it off dogg like a chow mixed with pitbull
Fifty-one cards, don't get ya shit pulled
Many get hit, they draw and hesitate
But I spit a clip of words so raw you levitate
(This for the record) I'm a Golden State Heavyweight
Hustled every way, in the struggle each and every day
A rollin' stone, wherever there's a mic I'm at home
(Just for the record, let it be known)

[Evidence]
Most don't understand me, they pretend
And I don't need family, I need friends
And I don't have a Plan B, my A wins
When we spit and Babu spins it sets trends
(Let it be known) Out here it's six minutes you're on
Out here you get elected don't mean you get the throne
It's the land of deception and the cancer's grown
Out here there's only one rule, handle your own

[Chorus]
"Just for the record, let it be known"
"Just for the record, let it be known"
"Just for the record", "Just for the record"
"Just for the record, let it be known" (Let it be known)
"Just for the record, let it be known"
"Just for the record, let it be known"

[Evidence]
Let it be shown what we did with a thousand and change
From the plants ourselves to Fat Beats changed the game
The last independent group still on a major
That's why rockin' with 1st Infantry is like second nature
(Let it be known) There's so many joints that people gonna sleep on
"Heavy Surveillance", "Insomnia", don't let me keep on
One of best friends is the best producer I know
(Just for the record, let it be known)

[Iriscience]
Rakaa's a rapper, a reader, writer and fighter
For belts, rings and titles (Just for the record)
Beats, raps and scratches, mixmaster package it
For you to take a couple home (Let it be known)
You in line at the store, on time or online
Even piecin' up their ones (Just for the record)
But uh, others have shown, they'd rather hate their own
They blind like Clayton Bigsby (Let it be known)

[Evidence]
ABB, Expansion Team put the cake up
Didn't go Gold but we made these cats wake up
Didn't go broke, we still made that paper
We still wake up before you, and go to sleep later
I'm more hungry, more determined than ever
And I'm from Cali, so I don't get sidetracked by nice weather
By the way dogg, that deal you got was a loan
(Just for the record, let it be known)

[Iriscience]
Comin' from the middle of the City of Angels
Angles, strangers and girls so dangerous
We kick raps, cop puerto on tracks
And grapple like a G rappin', LL scrap
(A-L-C) The team is 1st Infantry
(See L.A.) The fame and the infamy
(They'll both grow) These agencies are tappin' my phone
(Just for the record, let it be known)

[Chorus]
"Just for the record", "Just for the record"
"Just for the record, let it be known" (Let it be known)
"Just for the record, let it be known"
"Just for the record, let it be known" (Let it be known)
"Let it be known", "Let it be known"
"Just for the record, let it be known" (Let it be known)
(Let it be known)</pre>
