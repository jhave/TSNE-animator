[girl]
Sheeit, ju motherfuckin right
I'm the bitch that's keepin it live and keepin it hot
when you punk ass niggaz don't
Nigga Westside, WHAT!  Bring it on

[Tupac]
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV
Nigga my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

[girl]
What!! I'm bustin on you punk ass niggaz *automatic gunfire*
Run nigga run! *gunfire* I'm on yo' ass nigga! *gunfire continues*
Run nigga, duck and hide!  Nigga I'm bustin all you bitches!
Run nigga, yeah!  Westside!  Uh uh uh!  Die nigga die!

[Tupac]
My girlfriend, blacker than the darkest night
When niggaz act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we seperated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine, started out my life of crime
wit you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
that I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend

Chorus: Tupac

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
(repeat 2X)

[Tupac]
I was too immature
to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone 
anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend

Chorus

[Tupac]
I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend

Chorus 3X

Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind -- look for me
(repeat 3X)

Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
(repeat 2X)

ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND!</pre>
