[Drake]
I'm the fuckin man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money e'rybody actin like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City biiitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin hard, fuckin women, ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still gettin brain from a thang, ain't shit change
How you feel? How you feel? How you feel? 
25 sittin on 25 mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm +Feelin Myself+
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin paid, we'll holla whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggaz more YMCA
Me, Freddie and Marly Marl at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fuckin with her, I don't really need her
Ohhh that's how you feel man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean, maybe she won't, then again maybe +She Will+
I can almost guarantee she know the deal
Real nigga what's up
 
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know though
You Only Live Once, that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it e'ry day, e'ry day, e'ry day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga we don't really play
E'ry day, e'ry day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see him cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up
 
[Lil Wayne]
One, time fuck one-time
I'm callin niggaz out like the umpire
Seven, grams in a blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's, Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would/wood like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my M.O., add a B to that shit
I'm, fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, door knob
Talk stupid, off wit'cha head
Nigga money talks, and Mr. Ed
Yeah, I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the guns, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggaz on the street like hookers
I, tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet, water gun
Oh, my, God, Becky
Look at her, butt, Tunechi~!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Tyga]
Ah! T' raw, skinny nigga, big balls
Fuck around get dragged, RuPaul
You a funny +Lil'+ nigga, Duval
Out of this world, Total Recall
Call a bitch, ride dick, let her see-saw
Sorta like a donkey act an ass, nigga hee-haw-haw
Ridin 'round in a 'Rari with the top off
While you in the window, man, I'm prol'ly on my next car
Ha, AYE~! +Mighty Duck+ with the ice on
Real LA nigga, Chuck with the guns drawn
Drawin on ya face, you a clown, Jack-in-the-box
Boy, that's your bop, she my new pum pum star
Stars in the back and my homies they don't act
Actin brand new, fuck and never call her back
Matt Forte, got the bitch +runnin back+
Damn, that's the motto, you ain't know it's like thaaaat
 
[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Real nigga what's up...
 
[Tyga]
Hah! Real nigga what's up...</pre>
