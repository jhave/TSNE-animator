If you gone be down be down stay down 
get the fuck from round me. 
Nigga let me know if you got some type of fuckin' problem
we can solve it, wash it up and dissolve it
Up the pistol lay it down on the carpet. 
I aint come here for no fuckery don't fuck with me
Niggaz sly be ducking like PAC cause I'm a hoodlum like Skull Duggery
You cant get enough of me
Don't worry bout the pain bitch cause you gone die sudden
They be playin TAPS for yo ass at reveille
You aint gone need no "do not disturb" cause you gone sleep heavenly.
I'm reminess bout my baby, then I wipe my tear. 
Plottin revenge on one of these bitch ass nigga out chea.
I done lost it; I done surpassed mad
I can't keep still cause my nerves are bad.
I punch the brick wall with my balled up fist
I know I can't rest till I CATCH THAT BITCH!!!

There He Go, There He Go, There He Go

There He Go, There He Go Wit his ol' lady

but i got that nigga fine.
And yall gon have to forgive me. 
This Nigga here can cancel New Years 
cause he aint even much gone live to see Christmas.
Wrong! Wrong!!

I was beatin up his kidney with this motherfuckin 50.
A job well done make dick get hard.
I bagged that bitch with the pistol then I walked the fuck off.
Huh.  What goes around comes around my nigga.
So why I'm still here I'mma hold down my nigga.
This for the Gangstas and Killas, Drug Dealers and Wig Splitters.
This for my niggas Locked down and all the niggas that feel us.
This for the Projects and Ghettos with the scatter sight. 
And every street nigga thats duckin' them flash lights.
 
There He Go, There He Go, There He Go
