Remember when we met like a year ago?
When I was milkin' out trix like cereal
Fuck a Chon Don Nectar Imperial
Treat me right I'll show you wifey material
Never would of thought we'd get down like this
Said you never been this happy til you found this bitch
At the Ritz countin' stacks like pounds was flipped
In the morning go shoppin let me bounce the 6
Get a kiss on the lips when I'm around your clique
Get the feeling one day you'll be crownin this
You inspire me to lace all the nouns I spit
Compared to you them other cats don't amount to shit
Always kept it wet like Bangladesh
Turned me out like mesh when you spank the flesh
Got me rotten tricken 50% and bank the rest
Your name chipped out on my tennis anklet

Chorus:
You treat me right
You make me smile
I know you care
No one could compare
You show me love
You got my back
You always here
No one could compare

Ain't no nigga like the one I got my nigga
And that's from the heart my nigga
Cuz you brought me from the slums to the top my nigga
Show these bitches what you got done to my watch my nigga
Ain't a millionaire who could take your place
Got me screamin out your name when we shake and bake
Who dat on the other line nigga? make em wait
Everybody told me don't fuck wit you
But despite all the rumors I'm in love with you
Nothing's ever too little or too much for you
If you ever leave I wouldn't know what to do
Shit you for me open like the bank accounts
Started screenin calls, stopped hangin out
Everything about you got me blankin out
You keep satisfied plus franklyned out

Repeat chorus

You think you was the first to ever make me nut
Be callin you daddy like you raised me up
Maybe one day we'll have a lil baby us
Growin up listenin to jay-z and stuff
Cuz what we are- is a perfect combo
We done come too far- to let this go
It ain't gotta be a star- to be in my show
When my man needs me I run to it
When my man calls me I jump to it
Give up everything if it come to it
Got a ring on my left hand with lumps through it
You my best friend, confidon, other hand
Up in the bubble bath, makin each other laugh
I doubt,- if I could ever give anotha the ass
Ya'll mad- cuz this ain't what most lovers have

Repeat chorus</pre>
