(Roots Manuva)
Sin sinners, I got to talk to you about your sins
Sins on street corners, Sins in your shops
Sinny Sin Sins in your streets of yours
Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

I was raised in a pentecostal Church of God
My father was the deacon, he used to stand preaching
I used to to steal collection, I used to catch a beating
Forgive me Lord, I knew not what I did
I was just a kid, trying to hustle up a quid
Feeling kinda ashamed, riding in the Church right
Bible in my hand, dressed in my sunday best.
Reach a Churchyard and I'm feeling depressed
I'm in the midst of the well-dressed, talking 'bout singing, singing
thanks and praise to the king of the Jews
And I'm all confused, 'cos I can't see the sense
Why should I turn the other cheek and get beat?
Ain't no peace without war so who am I?
The faster drives benz,  got me looking to the sky
singing soon, very soon, we gonna see the king
Soon oh, very soon, we all gonna be blamed.

Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

Woke up one Sunday, feeling kinda raw
I said "Dad, I don't really want to go Church no more"
Soon as I said shit, I felt a slap to my jaw
He said "Son, as long as your living under my roof
Your gonna heed my interpretation of the truth
And the truth is right here
It's written in this book the Holy Bible
It's the key to survival so you best heed the word"
He said, "Do as I say, not what I do
And you'll see, goodness will follow you"
begrudgingly, I ironed my shirt, polish my shoes
Went to Chruch and I took in their far-out views
with their strange perceptions of Heaven and Hell.
To this very day I still fight down their spell
'Cos all that we pray, we still stay poor
With that leaky roof dripping on the front room floor.

Sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins.

Please don't get me twisted, I'm far from a heathen
This is just a simple song of basic rhyme and reason
It's not my meaning to demean or blaspheme
But most things in the Bible ain't as plain as they seem
Can I trust King James to translate these papers?
Do I need a middle-man to link with the creator
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Church band plays, now I'm spending my pound
Looking for a short-cut to the road to Zion
We can't fool God, but we wasting time trying
Two third of the truth is yet to be told
Two thousand years of corruption soon unfold

Sins in your eyes, sins gonna make you cry
Oh Lord, can you help me with my sins?
Oh Lord can you help me with my sin sin sinners?
There are no Sins like sins</pre>
