Intro:
You dogs wanna know the life I live
You dogs wanna see the things I did
So much in this world is this shit
It's just shit, just full of this

[Queen Pen]
Check it, on some down and dirty shit, Crown Height shit
Is you life thugged out Benji style shit
While you wanna front on your white style shit
Praisin all your dough on some real bullshit
I cops the high rent on land bitch
Without being platinum that's that smart guy shit
You talk about keys but never flip wiz kid
The first to cop a pleed, that's that real hot shit
Can't pick or choose wit click you wanna run with
On the up and up that's that real crab shit
Poppin mad shit on that mix tape shit
But when it's time to face a heat, you on that other type shit
I know what I did, what I seen, where I been
While you capitalize of this life you done lived
If you ask me that's some real bullshit
Record called me suppin me up, fake artist shit

Chorus: Joe Hooker
You will never be better than me
See you much too smart to me
You will never be better than me
See you much too smart to me

[Queen Pen]
Talkin about a life that you know you never lived
You a studio gangsta phony artist shit
Poppin twenty bottles but never leave bid
That's that show off, big trick shit
Makin trips outta town, I gotta survive type shit
Cashin in my stamps to make the ends meet shit
How do my niggas dose on some real legal shit
On the low that's that real have your back type shit
Stickin around with your baby daddy down in the shit
That's the daily life we live straight strugglin type shit
Wanna be with your don, on some Mark Pitts shit
Fuckin around wit my click, get that face lift shit
On your Ms. locked down, you outta bail type shit
You a snitchin ass punk on that deep cover shit
Never nigga

Chorus

[Queen Pen]
We gets down for I's on some ghetto star shit
'87, '99, we was legendary chip chicks
On I-95, pushin big boy whips
Six bricks in the trunk, that's that Braveheart shit
We done done it, lived it, wit you still talkin shit
And see a life thru your click, that's the fraudulent shit
On some flippin now shit, gettin money typed shit
Smokin purple haze every day, every night shit
Bitches holdin grunges on that childish type shit
And when the dough get low tell me where your click is
We roll 50 deep on that war type shit
Hittas in the trunk that's that real life shit
First trip around on some lesson earth shit
But this trip around, strictly QB shit
Bystorm shit, some more real shit
Up in ya face, stronjay type shit, ha

Chorus

Hook 8X
I'm that shit, you that shit
Everybody gonna wanna rock my shit
