[R. Kelly]
I hope y'all got cha'll playa's cards
Cuz y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do

[The Game]
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce, throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce, I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kell say

1 - 	[R.]
	Playa's only
	We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
	Up in the club where they get real naughty
	Take 'em from here to the private party
	Where there ain't nothin' but

	Playa's only
	Where the playas be spendin' alot a dough
	Honies got ass bouncin' on the floor
	This is how we do behind the playa's door

(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up

I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up

You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
Cuz tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got a bad red coupe matchin' the chrome

Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like the ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

Repeat 1

[The Game]
I'm still fresh like (Uh), Impala (Uhh)
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
In the hole with me, I had ya girl yellin' Uh
(Send her home with me) Kell's, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to ya, just how ya like it, girl

[R]
Girl you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business

Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it

Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'till the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'till we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot,  oh

Repeat 1

I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

Repeat 1
