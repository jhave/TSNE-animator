(Baatin)

I could picture you girl, in the back
Naked in my crib girl, so what's up?
You can see me, you can see me chillin in my black Puma
Ladies coming down my nutz-it-cuz, cuz
I never sweat it cause I know who they want
See we super-duper-duper, to the, Range Ro-va
Conant Gardens, Mac, Nic N-n-n-n-,Nic
Always making the ladies move and groove is my motive
The joint is on the scene and it's as long as a locomotive
When I'm on the Mic I never give up, up, up ,up
Make moves, make moves, make moves, yo check it out
All the ladies in the place if you got big breasts, breasts
Come over to my place we can play "chess"
