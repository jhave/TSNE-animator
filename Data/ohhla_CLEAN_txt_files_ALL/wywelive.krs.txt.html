[KRS-One]
"Welcome to hip-hop culture"
We stay hot like Tulsa
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, followed by a number ONE
These rappers they do-run-run
Lyrically they flashin two guns with new funds
But politically they do-run-run
When it's time to build, they chill, gettin nuttin done
But they mouth yes they do-run-run

[Chorus: KRS singing]
I've, heard, just about all that I can hear
We talk, and talk, but this talkin is goin nowhere
I've, been, to the summits and conferences
And the people man, they'll tell you man
Hip-Hop is the way we live

[KRS-One]
If you're down for this nation, Hip-Hop the nation
Three generations, fourth in the waitin
Look at what we facin, mainstream penetration
Everyone's a biter now, no innovation
No syncopation, lost communication
Here's what we gotta do to fix the situation
First step - know what you creatin
Hip-Hop the culture, the consciousness, a new civilization

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
Everybody, c'mon unite now
Turn on the light now, stop all the fight now
Time to unite now, a new type of life now
No stress no strife, no gun no knife now
No board no pipe now, we seein the light now
Bein the light now, the future is right now
Hip-Hop is like WOW, ready to fight now
Sick of the hype now, just about right now

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
I, hear, uhh, hip-hop is callin me
The fact you must see sir, rap is not all of me
I use that to reach ya, rappers be borin me
Redo the industry with a two dollar royalty
What's the agenda, to hip-hop and politics
Don't you remember? The violence we stoppin this
Kris will defend the, hip-hop populist
The solution is simple, raise up yo' consciousness

[Chorus] - sung without KRS

[KRS-One]
