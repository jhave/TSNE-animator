[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Goldy Hawn)]
Every horror movie they can attack ya ass
If you fuckin' wit the Ol' Dirt Dog
Bitch what's his name... in Wu-Tang
Bitch, if you didn't hear it muthafuckin'
You heard it now, on radio 98.7
	"Time to go to sleep"
(Aight, it's time for ya bitch ass muthafuckas to go to sleep, then
Big Bad Wolves, niggaz
Yo son, aiyo Dirt you ready, ready?) I'm ready, I'm ready
All you bitches ready to go steady
(Yo, hit them niggaz wit that shit, son)
To the girls over there (to the bitches)
To the niggaz over there (to my niggaz)
From the front, to the back, packed everywhere
Wanna get smacked out the atmosphere (you wanna get smacked?)
My name is Dirt Dog, bitch, I don't know where and how
My name is Dirt Dog, and in pilgrim, you smile
Bitch you get murdered from the first start
(Aiyo, God, you gotta fuck the shit up iller than
The that shit son, right there, man, for real man?)
Turn it up, turn it up, turn the headphones up
(Word?) One-two, one-two (one-two ya'll)
It don't stop ya'll (it don't, ya'll)
Won't stop ya'll

[Chorus 6X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Goldy Hawn]
Children sik 'em (children sik 'em)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Murder was the first artwork obtained
A nigga didn't know the seven half ounces of brain
You try to maintain, you didn't know the slang
My name is from the Wu-Tang, nigga, I kill a buttfucka up to slain
Nigga, Wu-Tang, you could never ever hang
I said it again and again and again
Nigga you fooled cuz you didn't know this
Cuz I'm the specialist

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (sampled kids)]
Children sik 'em (when they're gonna get you)
Children sik' 'em (when they're gonna get you)
Children sik 'em (I'm not asleep)
Children sik 'em (it's time to go to sleep)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You didn't have no power to predict in them
The Dirt Dog came wit the natural handsome and slim
Style that came wit the buckwild
Nigga, I taught 'em, nigga I treat 'em
Nigga, don't know how to reach them
My name is Dirt Dog I keep those speeches in
From down down Martin Luther King to Malcolm X
I make the niggaz come up and give recess
Blaow! She don't know my Elijah Muhammed style
Fuck a nigga up wild, I am up on the couch
The Dirt Dog nigga, never foul
Fuck a nigga up, a spirit attack ya wild
How? Cuz hip hop don't stop the groove, ya'll
I make a nigga caution at the smooth yard
Styles that make you wanna roll up in the streets
And go up in ya house, because ya streets and ya house is talkin' to you
You want to get a haunted house Amittyville
What you, what you say, and do

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I grew up, in the L.P. crew
Muthafucka, me, Ro' and Johnny Q
Nigga Johnny, attackin' on ya analog ass niggaz
Cuz you was on the dick and you wasn't fuckin' lookin' at me
Master Born, and on top of them niggaz, you was rollin' wit me
Shit, RZA came through and Popa Wu
Muthafucka, we ran ya whole muthafuckin' crew
Don't act like we didn't know what the fuck to do
Muthafucka, we taught ya bitch ass kung fu, too
What, what, you wanna talk about?
You won't know know no kung fu if I'm not in ya house
Dirt Dog, yo' Busta Rhymes I ain't got nothin' against you
But ya fucked my boo, it's all good, nigga, true
Dirt Dog, do it for you, hip hop don't fuck wit me, who
How, when, what, where, gonna get you

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
And if you ever go against the nigga, you die
Enough dyin', enough unmultiplyin'
White boys, white girls, when you hear this noise
Go crazy, attack a nigga like a muthafuckin'
Muthafuckin', animal, savage, beast
Comin' through ya muthafuckin' house
Bitch, you couldn't reach
This style that's fuckin' you up</pre>
