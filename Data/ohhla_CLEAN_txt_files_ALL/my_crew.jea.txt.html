[Verse 1]
My family dream with me
Under city lights
Pump the light
The screamers rights
Just work it out but ya'll ain't hearin' it
Words Travel deep in your spirit alone
I cruise the block
And use the box
To serenade the moonlight with the speakers
Niggaz lean back, deep in your seats and feel me
Cliques and crews n' hoods and gangs who love it
I'm, lovin' you dearly
Keep hustlin'
Jugglin'
Pressure, life, and success
Those who made it
Debate it
Until another's deaf
We buried ourselves under the jail
Without shovels, and dirt under our nails
Bubbles with crime and trouble tales
And street violence turned extreme
(Calling out names)
To rippin' joints on stage
To cuttin' fame time short
To life supportin' nothin'
But just realize what ya'll done
We've given 'em reasons to scream on us
And it's just begun
What happened to us in the bigger picture?
Don't you understand when one of us falls?
Step and we're all fallin' with ya
C'mon yeah

[Hook]
If you believe
Then I'll sing
And you'll believe that
(All I need is the love of my crew)
(Yeah Right)
That maybe you will do what you're supposed to do
Don't even say
That you're better than this
Repeat 1X

[Verse 2]
I represent for a nation, thought we was in it together
But I guess it gets strange when money rains in sunny weather
Tougher than leather
We're weaker than glass
And shattered on the side of the road
Trying to get a ride, but pass each other fast
Closed Aves'
Throw hash
Ice and Whips
Have blinded us
Never mind
How the mind just trips for glitch
Shit niggaz
Rich niggaz got us in tow
If it's not enough they gotta put us all on a show
Ya'll lost me
Somewhere between wakin' and coffee
That shit changed so quick
I didn't blink and it cost me
Fuck it, it costs us
Do you even know where we at?
Fuck you, and that we're here
You can't even open the map
Rap's dead
Rap sucks
But thanks to ya'll for
Killin' it
Grillin' it down
And spillin its guts
And fillin' it
Back up with trash
..Wait up I mean cash
Bangin (?) too synonymous
With media politics
(You know they love it)

[Hook]
If you believe
Then I'll sing
And you'll believe that
(All I need is the love of my crew)
(Yeah Right)
That maybe you will do what you're supposed to do
Don't even say
That you're better than this
Repeat 1X

[Verse 3]
What ya'll fightin' for?
For the light of the raw battle
Naw!
Can't be the latter
Cuz music just doesn't matter right?
Maybe I'm pinchin' emotions
To broken ears
And livin in years
When shit was spoken clearly
Without all the bullshit
Pullin' Clips
Replacin' games with court gestures
Bought pressers
Proclaimed the best is paid
And just forsake the rest
Who made it possible to be spittin'
If you got the same type of us women
That's grinnin'
Then the joint will keep spinnin'
I swear
It's like swimmin' with sharks
In public pools in shallow water
And some of these artists are fuckin' your youngest daughter
Feel me?
Aint no real fam
Niggaz is playin you
Trust me I wouldn't let my brother have his way with you
I'm only stating facts
Shit is plain as flood lights
We drop 10
I wanna fuck you, maybe 2, 1 mics
I'm just tryna keep it done right
One to Unity
I want our crew to be
Just like it used to be

[Hook]
If you believe
Then I'll sing
And you'll believe that
(All I need is the love of my crew)
(Yeah Right)
That maybe you will do what you're supposed to do
Don't even say
That you're better than this
Repeat 1X</pre>
