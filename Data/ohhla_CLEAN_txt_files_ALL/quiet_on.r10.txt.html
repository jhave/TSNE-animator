[Fat Joe] Terror Squad!!
 
[Big Punisher] 
This is goin' out to the mothafuckin' punks and broke ass tricks
Don't Tryin' to come up in here
Up in here pumpin' that shit, I will straight blast you
You better break yourself mothafucker
Shit!! punk ass tricks, bitch

Take it hard ---&gt;  Eazy-E

Yo, kick it ---&gt; Eazy-E

[Big Punisher]
Ruthless, plenty of that and much more
So at the party, Terror is controllin' the floor
That you step up and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangster scene
With a villain, doin' damage on a 24 track
With confusion to finish my conclusion
Arhytomatic rhymes from a Radio cat
You can't take what I got 
Cause I'll be takin' it right back
Ruthless gangster          ---&gt; MC Ren
Cold killin, you wanna know what it means? 
Definition... Villain       ---&gt; MC Ren
With the stupid dope rhymes
And once you hear one line, you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin'
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wonderin, why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts, while I'm constructin' the ground
That makes you movin' around, from the hell of the sound
Girls drool on me like a dyin'

[Ant Banks] 
Pun, tell them what you do when your ass start rhymin'

[Big Punisher]
I go to the party, I hip and hop the spot
I don't know what it is, but the girls kept knock the aspirin' 
Like they're on fire and
Their so-called boy friends with them are retirin'
And for this reason I'm a walkin' threat
So when I step on the stage, I want quiet on the set

[Break: Ant Banks scratching inarticulated Public Enemy's quotes]

[Fat Joe]
Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangster feelin' in mind is in session
The way that I'm referrin to this, makes you move your butt
But don't stand in a daze, you should know what's up
Anyway, I keep the clappin' along
Cause nothin' bad could go wrong because this track is so strong
I'm like throw you the.. you can ask for anythin' more 
When the Terror Squad is cold rockin' the floor
Like stupid, actin' like a retard
Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tips me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with hyped information
This is just a section of my creation
So don't say shit with finesse fination
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines 
It's mine, unpredictable, keepin' you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistable, meanin' that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, feel forward to sweat
Whenever I rip it up, I want quiet on the set
 
[Break: Ant Banks scratching quotes below]
Yeah, what?, what? 
Terror Squad, Terror Squad
Yeah

[Unidentified Artist]
Now I can be loud as hell, you think I will? Never
Ssssht, quiet on the set  ---&gt; Eazy-E 
Yeah, I like that better  ---&gt; MC Ren
Word                      ---&gt; Dr. Dre
That's what I can do, I think I earned respect
And if I didn't from you, that's what I expect
Cause if it ain't rough, it ain't me, it ain't me   ---&gt; Eazy-E 
So who really cares how you want me to be?
See, I'm just me, standin' at the top of the pile
And doin' soft known tunes, just ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how The Terror Squad makes the Ruthless Jam
Now first, we take an average Gun
Give it to Pun, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up the pad and the pen and begin to write
And lay down the lyrics that's promised to play
Hear everybody says:

[Break]
Check it in, check it out
Put it in, take it out
Make it out, yeah, Terror Squad baby
What?, what?, what?  

[Cuban Link]
Yeah, now Cuban Link is here workin' like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always thinkin' of you
Cause I'm the pusher, supplyin' the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm makin' obstacles, an enemy traps
To catch any Emcee, with the weak-ass raps
Crucifyin' their data, cause you're usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing of the game
If they tried to retreat, I catch them one at a time
Cause they're comittin a crime, but still promotin' a rhymes
So, you're in the back of me, just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance, or maybe a turn
My sideman wants to give a preview
So at my next concert, I wanna see you there 
Not sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with your hands in the air
Now I'm about to get out, but I'll be back
But next time expect the more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment, to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth, to start some discussion
To prove that I'm hype, now, you know that's a bet
So continue to dance, Cuban blew up the set
