Yeah, (ohhh), we got the hood rats in the house right
(Would you like a tongue bath babe)
They say they like tongue bath (from the back)
So, uh, we went and got Methron
But of course, it's the Ying-Yang Twins

Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

Forget about that Summer we stretched straight thuggin it up
In the tongue bath world we was loving it up
I've been told by the eye we were holding each other
To the room, sexual, of the Isley Brothers
Sippin' Alazez and Hennessee, straight thug passion
Licking nipples, got you gigglin', so you started to laugh
And now it's getting so erotic baby
All of a sudden so I'm kissing on your body baby
Admit it babb

See baby a tongue bath is what I like
Lick me up, lick me down, curve my appetite
Let me open up my legs, show me what you got
The way you licking on my body's got me really hot
And I'm loving the way you lick me though
Do it little daddy, let your tongue take control
You got me shaking like hell when you're licking my toes
From the top to the bottom, make your tongue roll

Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

The way you all on me, you get me feeling the heat
And when you lick it like that it make me grit my teeth
You got me grabbin' the sheets, and put the pillow on my face
Biting my lips and squeezing my waist
I'm calling your name and making that face
Cause you lick my bubble gum and had the taste
You got me caught up in this mist of the passion, you see
This tongue bath you giving me is like a fantasy

Baby please keep on moanin', keep on licking on me
You got me bitin' on your neck, look what this bath did to me
Now rub me down in your notion, with your deep freezin' motions
You bring the freak out in me, I'm out of control can't you see
You got me hot and now it's on till the early morn
Now this tongue bath, feed it to me, got me in the zone
Yeah

Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

Give me a tongue bath please, I want you all on your knees
I like it when you licking me, from the back constantly
You make me shiver little daddy when you're playing with ice
Turn out the lights little daddy, we can cut all night
I like it rough, if you tough, take it easy, that's enough
I want a massage with your tongue, make my body feel numb
Keep me hot, you know that spot
That feaky stuff you know I like
Ooh yeah, that's it, you're doing it right, that's tight

The way you licking me and kissing me
Hugging me and touching me
Rubbing me constantly
Ready to put your love in me
Do it like that, down from the back
Run a tongue bath, baby treat a hood rat
Slip and slide on my thighs, make your tongue glide
Baby when me and you collide, we'll make the temperature rise

Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

Uh, oh, I don't mind no
Anyway you want it, I got it
Tongue bath, from the back
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

Uh, come here shorty, stop please
Why you acting like you don't like it
You know you like it
You know you want me to touch it
For real, come here and let me give you a tongue bath
Haha, you like to get wet don't you
It's my way or the highway, ohh
Come on, for real
Would you like a tongue bath, oh
We ain't gotta do it that much, just let me do it a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit, it's all right
How low can you go, I don't mind
What you like, I don't mind no
If you're running you'd better catch it, oh, yeah</pre>
