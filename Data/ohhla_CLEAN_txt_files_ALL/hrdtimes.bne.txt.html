[Intro-Bizzy]
Yeah. One time. Man, I need to let you know, man, how much I love you, man
I... I'm... I'm kinda fucked up right now, man
And I just want you to know, you know what I'm saying, that you my everything
And, I'll do anything for you, man. I'll die for you, kid

[Chorus-Chris] + [Bizzy]
I've been living on the outside (In the rain, soaked in my game)
I've been watching from the inside [You and I, boi. Ha ha.]
(I've been knocking, ya'll keep watching me)
[Shit nigga, thats my bloodline, nigga, ha ha]
It's our time, talking about the hard times, times... oh, oh, oh
[Grandpa. Ha ha. Macedonia. Acting like I don't know you nigga. Watch this.]

[Bizzy Bone]
I've been known to rock shit, daddy let's get it poppin'
pop-lockin' in the projects, duckin' shots
Gangsta gangsta
They tried to kill me, my ego never been ragin' since they raped me, baby
Can you feel me? Fuck it, I can feel it; Love it or leave it
Heavenly Father give me your power, Bryon's stuck in this war
See the chloroform, neck tie, lions, and that's right
What did I do to deserve what a day? No question in my mind

[Chorus-Chris] + [Bizzy]
I've been living on the outside (In the rain, soaked in my game)
I've been watching from the inside [You and I. Ha ha.]
(I've been knocking, ya'll keep watching me)
[What's up ya'll? You ready to rock?]
It's our time, talking about the hard times, times...
oh, oh, oh [...?...]

[Bizzy Bone]
And as I ride for the prayers, rhyme sayers, time conveyers
I'm nothing but slime, Boo Boo, up in my prime
Drop a dime, make it work, babe, I'm nothing but dirt
Take the back seat, I'm lookin' for Jesus Christ for sure

[Chris Notez]
And you say that it changed, and you can't feel the rain; It's a shame, shame
I see the pain in your eyes, I can see it in the tears when you cry
You my blood, you got love, let the motha'fucker try
Yeah, it's been to hard livin', and i know that you scared
Take a look around, but feel don't nobody care
Look to the sky, but I feel that nobody answer your prayers
Yes, money with these houses and your friends disappear
And I know that you hear through the sounds in the air
When you pass by, I know that you feelin' those stairs
Let 'em try, you don't need 'em, you got family right here
When life gets ugly, you need beautiful, just look in the mirror

[Chorus-Chris] + [Bizzy]
I've been living on the outside (In the rain, soaked in my game)
I've been watching from the inside
(I've been knocking, ya'll keep watching me)
It's our time, talking about the hard times, times...
oh, oh, oh [...?...]

[Bizzy Bone]
They say I'm beautiful, and who the fuck I'm speakin' with?
Kiss me on the cheek like they' Judas? But Jesus, please keep it
Beat her all up against for, baby it's fine
Shot at mine with the world on its back, he still rides
Realize synchronation, and dedication of life
What life, nigga? I blacked out from drinkin' liquor
Where the circle at? Give me another, circle completed
Where the fee at? Give me another fee, don't delete it. c'mon

[Chorus-Chris] + [Bizzy]
I've been living on the outside [I miss you, man.] (In the rain, soaked in my game)
I've been watching from the inside [You were my best friend.]
(I've been knocking, ya'll keep watching me)
It's our time, talking about the hard times, times...
oh, oh, oh [...?...]

[Bizzy Bone]
From sea to shining sea, to the depths of the destiny
Keepin' on keepin' my boots on, you need me, it's on
You know, I'm there most certainly
Open the curtain, better believe that I'm hurtin'...</pre>
