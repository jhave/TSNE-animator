Aiyyo Swizz check it out
I'm shoot over to Cali, yknahmsayin? Check this movie out
Then I'ma check honey out
Then I'ma fly back to N.Y., see what's goin on in the projects
Then I'ma shoot down to Atlanta
See how it's goin down in the Dirty Dirty
Then I'ma shoot over to New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Seattle, Miami..

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to New York to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Atlanta done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told
But I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (say what?)
I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch (that's right)
Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now
I don't know, what you've been told

[Jadakiss]
But I'm on my way to Cali to see my bitch
and do a movie but first I gotta read my script
After that I get it poppin at the La Mentage
I'm gettin skull in the Ferrari, bottom garage
Then it's back to N.Y. to my project bitch
She like to do it anywhere, a real hardhead bitch
And she enjoy riffin when I'm gone
but love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn
{*beep beep beep*} I'm down in Atlanta to see my bitch
She go to college, she model, and she got chips
Rock La Perla lingerie
Tattoo on her ass that say that this belong's to Ja'
Now I don't know, what you've been told
But 'Kiss be blowin they mind and spendin they dough
And I'm goin on a lil' trip, I'll be back
Anybody lookin for me, just tell 'em that I'm

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
I'm on my way to New Orleans, for one whole month
to see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
but she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swingin through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the toy
Honey was a gangstress for real, gettin money off the board
Then I'm hittin Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze..
.. music please {*ahhh-hahhh!*}
Ahh, where was I? Oh yes
Off to the Valley so I gotta go West
My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yesss)
She talkin shit on the celly like she that bitch (yesss)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she gon' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece 'til I cum in her mug
I'm tryin to leave and she givin me hell
Told her bend over; I'ma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell
{*BONG!*} Now I'm on my way to Texas to see my bitch
I oughta be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nuttin stoppin Ja'
I'ma get the puss, catch the Rockets game, then be on my way
Now I'm down in Miami to see my bitch
She got her own beauty salon, and she strip
I'm proud of the girl, backside's out of this world
The bitch perform; besides that, her lips was warm, c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X
