Song:   Revenge
Typed by: Rebelins10304@yahoo.com

If it's possible I'll step in your obstacles

[Chorus]
Oh shit you better watch out for this
Revenge so sweet that you might wanna flip 
Ride on your enemies, bust they shit
Throw away the pistols throw away the clips

[Cappadonna]
Big grits, big ox snatch ice at Woodstock
Remember those kids that hold cries they runnin fast
Crack spillin out they sides
It's the Hill brothers that kill
And raps on a blue trap water bugs nothin but thugs
Cops circlin, two cuts on shorty mugged
Streets turn by the flyest of bug
It's switch the e-shit fucker
I take rhymes like a piss
Eat the beats like tuna fish
Stay focussed, your camp is dead meat and drop worms
Wu-Tang is up on it too big to back down
Defeat never heard of I came with the crowd merger
The super friends seek that revenge
Bout to fuck out, you kiss girls on the mouth
Over here all of my niggas is bout bout

[Chorus]

[Timbo King]
Call me straight up oak y'all niggas just plain panel
Guns from my Ceridoor ask mic ammo
Cross fire, bullets racashe horizontal
Brooklyn bridge pharazano niggas know the motto
Follow the path, knowledge the craft
Swallow a whole bottle of math
Since biology class
Grand achery, bow and arrow split your grand largely
Afro in ya heads, robin hoods drop goods in these wild lands
A desert eagle in a child's hands
Your style's planned, my styles blend earth, wind, fire, water
You never know my son might fuck Mariah's daughter
Ill visions of victory without a battle
Breathes through tracks like cold winds towards Seattle
Sound travels through fiber optics under gravel
Combinating six sixty and they try to handle
Niggas try to handle

[Chorus]  

[Freemurder]
Yo we always had a eight on us
Cold hands slingin niggas gotta pay on us
Co-froze our whole shit so you can skate on us
Niggas don't freeze long, start to rain on us
I'm the type tah hold the mac with one hand
Squeez that shit till the gun jam
Flow sickly rhyme swettin I'm too ill
Get blown quickly for two mills
Ice pick ain't too real sing your nice six swing to kill
Who runnin with the kid that brang me the pill?
Who runnin with the kid I'm like stainless steel
Frail nigga on some high and might, break your grill
Showtime there's a joke time I poll on the box
Poke lots of little holes in you like four little dots
Become my doja and baloon swallow them rocks
Shit out my profit hole by tommorrow you drop

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
There's a place out there where the enemies lurk
In the woods try to burn down mamma's church 
No love, they came to spread hate
The angels floried inside the pearl gates
The world got dark, a earthquake 
trembled the underneath of the feet of pedestrians
Rain, drops fire and snowflakes
Destroy homes that contain the mad evil
All of God's children ran towards the ???
For all of those who did wrong to the ???
Their souls were cast out into the deep
Bodies of the unholy covered the street
And all of God's creatures ate them like meat
Oh father have mercy on the weak
The ones that can't see and the ones that can't speak
The ones in the projects smokin that leaf
Who lived through slavery, families got beat
Bit by the dogs, shot by the police
Screaming for justice, screaming for peace
Brothers behind bars fighting with the beast
Third world countries plus the Mid East
We all gon die if the battles don't cease

[Chorus] X4</pre>
