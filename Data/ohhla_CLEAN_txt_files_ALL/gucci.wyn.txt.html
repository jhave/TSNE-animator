[Lil Wayne]
Uh, Fu' got the weed, Marl' got the gun
They say numbers don't lie bitch, I'm not the one
Hammers in your face, this is not a dream
and you gettin every page of this magazine
Bumpin UGK, talkin about a +Murder+
We roll the Dr. J and then we light the Julius Erving
I got pussy on the way, and pussy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes tryna lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga
Glock 4-tini, niña colada 
Suck, swallow, semen saliva
I'm goin at'cha collar, fuck you ho niggaz
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a fuckin dope dealer
You're a dead man walkin, Michael Jackson Thriller
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches, YEAAAH~!

{"One big room, full of bad..." - *4X*}
Uh.. Uh, it goes
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya..

Back where I started on my set, in black
All chrome Glock lookin like a platinum plaque
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra gats
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
'Til the wheels fall off, I can fix a flat
If ya scared, go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children, now don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggaz, and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker, call me Weezy, baby
And on the end of the barrel, I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands, skateboard and my Vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
I know what I can do, so bitch I do what I can
Drop that Sorry 4 the Wait, man, I'm just sayin
I-I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches, YEAH~!
HAHA!
