Uh huh. I just wanna thank yall for taking the time to listen
Ah-ha
I appreciate that

[Jadakiss]
Yo, from regular TV to cable; from bouncing label to label
Just trying to get the horse out of the stable
Was once part of the dynasty, at least I was trying to be
Think it was the time of my life when I was fine to me
Sitting in the spot with the dimes
Willing to do anything just to be a Bad Boy at the time (That's right)
Then I rolled the dices, naw the money didn't add up
But just that whole experience, it was priceless
No free rides to the bank, on top of that
Was the untimely demise of Frank (B.I.)
Then the 'No Way Out' tour, we was smoking outdoor
Me and 80 stacks off cee-lo, that's without tour
Videotaped it all, I still watch it now
Travel the world, learned how to rock a crowd
It ain't much but it beats poor
Things that I've been through is all I can speak for

[Chorus: Luther Vandross samples from "Promise Me"]
I can only speak for 
The things that I've been through
(Repeat 2x)

[Jadakiss]
Now I'm on Ruff Ryders/Interscope, same shit
Partnership, joint venture, fifty-fifty, same split
Jimmy put the money up, two singles off of 'We Are the Streets'
Then after that, seem like he was done with us
But it wasn't over yet, Stout had a plan from the jump
Which was to come out with my solo next
Things a little better, these the niggas that I've been doing it with forever
So I'm like whatever
First album dropped, promotions was hella
Every stage I rocked, the performance was stella
Had the whole world ready to Ryde or Die for me
And I wasn't even platinum, I was just side money
X was bringing in the moolah
I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler
Can't tell you about the evil that men do
I can only speak for the things that I've been through

[Chorus: Repeat]

[Jadakiss]
As far as The LOX, we all fine, seller is all wine
Selfish for me to say that Roc-A-Fella is all mine
Cause it ain't, I'm just another employee that's on line
Trying to get my act together and do it one more time
Twenty-one gun salute with all 9's
And I know it's on me to make sure we all shine
Fall back, let the weed contact your mind
Define bullshit in any contract you sign
If you from the streets though, there's plenty of loopholes to eat yo
Once they let you in, you suppose to keep dough
But I can't give you the formula, I'm on it though
Expect the worst, the outcome is enormous though
Stay humble, still keep your heat for insurance though
Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo
Yeah, this is what my heart beats for yo
Things that I've been through is all I can speak for

[Chorus til fade]</pre>
