You see I'm not real good at approachin girls
Sometimes I feel like I'm divin for ocean pearls
to the bottom where it's dark and it's harder to breathe
She laughed with a smile that you wouldn't believe
"What's your name again?" she told me, but since then I forget
cause I'd smoked a lot of beer and drank a lot of pot - I mean
She laughed again, I played it off like I meant it
She threw me a look and I knew it was cemented
This game I presented, it worked again
As long as the team don't act like jerks again
It's happened before, they cling to 'em like suction
Like vultures they circle waitin for an introduction
But not this time (nah) this one was somethin special
From her hips to her eyes to her lips to her freckle
to a tee - best of all she was jockin me
Until I heard, "Yo Nick!" and she was like, "Who is he?"  Oh

[repeat 2X]
Let me introduce you to my partner Oak
He's my left hand man and he ain't no joke
But yo, back to this interaction, what was that you were askin?
Let me take you to the back, where there's no distraction

[Big Oak]
Holllld up, aiyyo hold up Nick
Don't you think you should go buy this girl a drink? (see ya)
She can wait right here, I'll keep her company
If I play my cards right, maybe she'll be humpin me (ha!)
Nick shot me a dirty look, and the middle finger
But I don't care, I'm on some Jerry Springer
shit but it's legit cause last week Nick took my girl and split
and only offered me a shrug and a blunt hit
So I'll get him back tonight
Aiyyo honey follow me to the back to where there ain't so much light
I'm your Mr. Right, at least for tonight
.. or umm, hello?
I looked at her and she wasn't even payin attention
Mind off in space explorin new dimensions (shit)
She wasn't gonna hear a damn word I say
Cause she was starin right at my DJ

[repeat 2X]
Let me introduce you to my DJ Cheapshot
He's a both hand man and his feats are hot
But back to this interaction, what was that you were askin?
Let me take you to the back, where there's no distraction

[DJ Cheapshot]
Damn you look familiar, have we met before?
I think I caught a glimpse of you on the dance floor
As a matter of fact, weren't you freakin MC Nickolaus?
"No that wasn't me," my bad, now I feel ridiculous
You know it's kind of hard to see when I'm busy scratchin
Yeah, I've been rockin shows three years, thanks for askin
You wanna hear some Jigga? (yup) Funny you should mention that
Just got a call from him, told him that I'd holla back
Enough about him, change the subject back to me
I'm six foot three with the college degree
Plus this key to that Camaro double parked outside
If you carry my wax, I'll give you a ride
Now be a good girl, and go buy daddy a drink
And by the time you get back, we'll leave in a blink (yup)
Then it's on like Chaka Khan
And oh yeah, on the way out, say goodbye to Lexicon

Uhh.. did I say Camaro?  Oh my God, I can't..
I meant to say Ford Focus, how embarassing
Yea no-no-no, no-no, look, where you going?
Where you going?  No-no-no, come back
I know Jigga, Jay-Z, y'know a good tune
No-no-no, come over to my house right now
I'll show you his number, no
Don't walk, don't walk away, come on!
I know, please come back, please, please please
Please come back pleeeease
Aww geez, oh geez, oh geeeeez</pre>
