Typed by: Sekzclusive@aol.com

[Chorus]
You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Talking]
This is dedicated to all of my ladies in relations
Peep this out

[Verse 1]
I'm a lady who be keepin it real, you don't care
Take time out, see how I feel
When I be ridin in the SUV, I'm thinkin of you
When I be rollin up a fat one, boy I'm thinkin of you
You got me goin like uuuuuhhhh
I'm feelin the rush, I like to fuck
Let's get buck in the back of the truck, so boy what's up?
It's whatever when it comes down to you
Well it was, until you made it clear that I ain't for you
You just abandoned me, you left me strandedly
Heart broke, constantly
Hearin love songs on the radio, that remind me of you
They say a gangsta ain't 'posed to cry
But I'm sheddin tears and I'm a gangsta until I die
I'm tellin you boy, they say no pain then no gain
Now they call me playa because you teachin me all yo game
I say I ain't change, but then again just peep me out
(Talking)
Ay yo, I don't think this shit is gonna work...
I'm ready to leave you, get out

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2]
Just be a man about it, you don't have to lie to me
Nigga leave my house, you can get the fuck away from me
Take yo' fuckin car keys, get yo' fuckin clothes too
Nigga this mah credit card, hold up that's my bank book
Why you out here cheatin on me, I'm gettin my own creepin on
(Nigga talkin') Ay girl, why you ain't answer that god damn phone?
Uhh why nigga, I was gone
Nigga bout my ??? hea, pay my own light bill
I don't need you, got my own fingers for my sex thrill
Shit, I'm a mack, playa you ain't heard my real name?
Mrs. Pimpin Thang, pussy power to the fuckin brain
If you wanna play, get in the shower stroke yo'self
I ain't the one to be messed with, pimpin to my death
Slip in and slip out, remember how that used to be?
I would get so wet when you put yo' love inside of me
But that's the past now, no more freaky tail nights
No more poppin X, or sex asshole tight

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3]
I ain't tryina get caught up in yo games
Personally, I think that shit is lame
Whachu doin err' now and then when you wanna hit
I ain't givin yo ass shit, you'll be just another trick
On my list of busta's, diamond clusters
Rings, old game used to be so not told
With yo' frozen heart, boy you tore my soul apart
My XX plot, about a nigga from the ???
With yo' seven inch cock, give it to me don't you stop
I keep fallin for you, hypnotized doubt you get my props
But now I'm single, pussy bad tight
I ain't fuckin with no giggalos, niggaz ain't right
They wanna cut now, they wanna cut later
They ain't call yo ass then, they ain't call yo ass later
That's how it goes, I'm out the door, holla back
Hit me on my 2 Way when you ready
That's that on that

Repeat Chorus</pre>
