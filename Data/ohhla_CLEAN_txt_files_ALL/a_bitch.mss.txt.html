To the M-I prrrrrrrr, cat like a semi
Nigga stole my car, why'nt you get my
Give yo' ass a black eye
Oh, say bye-bye
I'mma give your body to the sky
Run through your clique
Nigga, you pissed on trip
I'mma have to bust you in your lips
And the whips better have a whole lotta chips
Cuz I ain't for no nigga givin' tips

She's a bitch
When you say my name
Talk mo' junk but won't look my way
She's a bitch
See I got more cheese
So back on up while I roll up my sleeves

1 - 	She's a bitch
	You can't see me, Joe
	Get on down while I shoot my flow
	She's a bitch
	When I do my thing
	Got the place on fire, burn it down to flame

Roll up in my car, don't stop, won't stop
I'mma keep in rockin' til the clock don't tock
I'mma keep it hot, light my ass on fire
I'mma grab a philly, go and roll it at the bar
Whatcha talk? Whatcha say? Huh?
Gotta flow, gotta move it slow, huh?
Better you runnin' out the door, huh?
You gon' be a long lost soul, whacha say?

Yippe yi yo, yippe yi yi yay
Put me on stage, watchin' niggas feel me
Put my shit on wax, watch it blaze like May
Go yippe yi yo yippe yi yi yay
55, 65, hike
75, 85, test the mic
95, Missy wild for the night
105, I'mma keep the crowd hyped

2 - 	She's a bitch
	When they say my name
	Talk mo' junk but won't look my way
	She's a bitch
	See I got mo' cheese
	Back on up while I roll up my sleeve

She's a
What? What? What? What? 
What? What? What? What?

Whatchu know about Timothy, lemme know
Eat an MC like Cease, lemme know
If he get drunk lean on me, lemme know
I'm about to bust like pee, feel me now
Anybody know my skills, what the deal
Anybody feel my skills, it's the real
Anybody wanna come fuck wit us still
Anybody gotta get the hoe by they pill

Repeat 2
Repeat 1</pre>
