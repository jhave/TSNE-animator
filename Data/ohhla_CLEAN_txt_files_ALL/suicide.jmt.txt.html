[Intro-Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, Vinnie Paz, baby, they call me Louie Dogs
Jedi Mind Tricks, Philly, Italiano mobbin' on you

[Verse 1-Vinnie Paz]
This is murder rap, I'll burn his back and push your sternum back
And have the doctor cover your head just like a turban wrap
A certain fact, you'll be prayin' on a Persian mat
Or hopin' Jesus or the police's bring the person back
I'm not the type of mutha fucka that's concerned with that
I only been in love once, then I learned from that
A ride or die bitch, said she'd never turn her back
Take these bullets with you to Hell, you dirty rat
Speakin' to me sideways, you get hurt for that
You gonna make me bring the Hologramic verses back
I'll put my fist into the ground, that's where the earth is cracked
Love is gone inside my heart, now it's a purplish black
You a clown rapper, just a circus act
But Vinnie rap like when fifty fuckin' Kurds attack
Who your group, daddy? I ain't never heard of that
Vinnie Paz, Hologram, where the purple at, fuckin' maggots, yeah

[Hook-Vinnie Paz w/KRS-One sample]
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
It's a Suicide if you feel we soft
We the truth inside, if you feel you lost
And the truth don't lie, 'cause we still the boss
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
It's a Suicide if you feel we soft
We the truth inside, if you feel you lost
And the truth don't lie, 'cause we still the boss

[Verse 2-Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, the heavy metal king, my lyrical an incredible thing
And I'm the forces in the four-chord pendulum swing
And anyway you wanna look at it, I send pain
And now they got you in the third density end game
That's why these men came, we rap saviors
Who tryin' to waken you from your spiritual laziness
I'm thinkin' outside the box from now on
Like different ways that I can kill the cop from now on
During day is when I used to sell boom to the tenants
And at night with dark shinin' and hallucinogenics
That's when I let the fight in me pass through
And when I let the spiritual light in me pass through
I guess this just somethin' that come when you grown
Like the positive and negative that come with the throne
But, fuck it, I'm stone, Pazienza the great wall
I'll be back, but now I'm drinkin' my 8 Ball

[Hook-Vinnie Paz w/KRS-One sample]
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
It's a Suicide if you feel we soft
We the truth inside, if you feel you lost
And the truth don't lie, 'cause we still the boss
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
It's a..."Suicide is a Suicide"

[Verse 3-Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I'm a new disease, drinkin' a 40, rockin' Judas Priest
I'm strong as ?, put you in your blueish fleece
You never see a pig around me like a Jewish feast
And every single fuckin' member in my crew a beast
But y'all should know by now the type of shit I'm on
Like, does the New Testament contradict the Qu'ran?
Does every Muslim in the world come equipped with a bomb?
Does every rap video have a chick in a thong?
I don't know if we livin' no more
I don't know if Pazienza even driven no more
Uppercut, right cross on the tip of the jaw
He a crumb, daddy, dump a fuckin' clip in the boy
And the man is the offspring of the weak
Like the lamb is the offspring of the sheep
We gonna grind 'til we seein' the fame
With a stronghold baby, 'cause I'm bleedin' the game

[Outro-Vinnie Paz w/KRS-One sample]
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
Ha, ha, Louie Dogs, Jedi Mind Tricks
We the truth inside, if you feel you lost
Enemy of Mankind on the track, what's the deal, baby?
We gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off
Vocab, where you at? Warchild, my man
We the truth inside, if you feel you lost
My brother Stoupe, that's how we get down
It's murder rap, yeah, they call me Vinnie Paz
Louie Dogs, it's dirty, baby, it's our fuckin' year
I'm tryin' to shine, baby, tryin' to feed the fam
Ha, ha, yeah</pre>
