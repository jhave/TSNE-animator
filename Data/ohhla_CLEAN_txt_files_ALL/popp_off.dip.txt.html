YEEEEA!
I mean I got to be the hardest, middle name concrete and shit like that, you know?
I mean thank you for the clapping, I know I'm hot, but you about to witness more greatness
Dipset Bitch, Welcome To Hell Rell!!!

[Hell Rell]
I got the metal pa', that's how I settle dram (drama)
Eyes "Jet Li" but I'm Afro-Ameri-can
I got a foreign bitch, sitting in the foreign whip
She don't speak English but she know how to slob a dick
Wrist crazy, neck retarded....yeah I'm flossing hard
Stepped my weight up, gave my own boss a job!
Yellow diamonds, looking like moron cars
Lawyer got in the ring what them cases afford 'em hard
Yeah he kept it real in jail, he a livewire
Hell Rell? That's the homey, official 5 rider
I'm the talk in all the hood's and every Barbershop
They say that boy go hard every bar is hot
So smoke ya haze cocksucker, take ya last drag
You about to die homo and you past fag
Crumble up ya rhymes, shoot 'em in the trash bag
AK's and bombs, my niggaz hood is Baghdad! (Weeks Block)
Now you see me in ya TV, stranger
And ya favorite rappers got me in his CD changer
I'm a general nigga, send ya greatest soldier
Uzi on the tour bus, please don't pull us over
I got weight, you need yay? I'm there
And ya bitch mad I won't let her braid my hair
I'm bout to cut that shit anyway, fuck that bitch anyway
Feds raided the spot, got another strip anyway

[Hook]

BUT IF YOU FUCK WITH ME NIGGA....I'M POPPIN OFF
HELL RELL I'M A CERTIFIED G BETTER ASK ABOUT ME MY NIGGA....IM POPPIN OFF

[Hell Rell]
In jail Bronx niggas is known for popping off
Them bricks got moved, YES I can cop a Porsche!
Rapper's I potty train them, I'll let the shotty blaze 'em
They tryna put Rell under the jail...Saddam Hussein 'em
Who the hardest?.......name 'em
If they don't mention the dude then who the fuck these fans listening to?
See a coward won't smack you but a gangsta will
I'm hot in the South like DJ Drama Gangsta Grillz
See you paying car notes I got gangsta bills
When did you get tough, you poppin gangsta pills?

[Hook]
