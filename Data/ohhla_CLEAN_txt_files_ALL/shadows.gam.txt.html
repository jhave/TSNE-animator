[Chorus]
Ohhh no no no no
(She said) no no no no
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no no no

[Verse 1]
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Like, (I can't remember), Shot's fired, rewind, please girl be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before we go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z &amp; Beyonce, my aunt say "keep the sex game picante"
So Aunt May, the Mary Jane that I was hitting on
We were trying to forget there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Put my hand in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'm a get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang, but homie, on the low
But your boy sound weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though [x2]

[Chorus]
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you [x2]
Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no no no

[Bridge]
I hope you understand, I hope you understand
I hope you understand now
When that beat drop
Oh no no no
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand

Won't let me call in the back
Why is he calling me black?
Why ain't you calling me back? [x5]</pre>
