[Intro]
Aiyyo
We about to bring this from the A-T-L to the S-T-L baby (Beatsta music)
{Ay Jibbs, watch this! Watch this shorty!} What up Fabo~!
Cause she do it with no hands, do it with no hands

[Chorus: Fabo]
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH!)
Girl smile, take a picture if you can (OHH! OHH! OHH!)

[Jibbs]
Oh snap she done posed for me
That flash run off and she did it on her toes for me
Put on a whole show for me
Like boom boom snap, boom boom snap
To my boom boom clap, boom boom (OHH!)
Fabo told her shake that "Laffy Taffy" and she did exactly
what they do in Georgia, so I brought her across the border
Cause she say she never saw that ARCH befo'
So I showed her how to pose with that six point oh
Yeah that's that new dance
That new dance, that'll make your whole crew dance
And the funny thing about it, she don't even have to move jam
Just jump left, jump right, show that moment
When you boom boom snap in that Kodak moment

[Chorus] - 2X

[Fabo]
She got a smile like a bowlin ball; go crazy when she see that flash
Lights camera action I hear Mystikal when she "Shake it Fast"
I've seen things I ain't never seen with her
I'm Richie Rich, Professor Keenbean gave me her
Violent thoughts in my mind, I'm losin control
She from heaven I'm from Bankhead, OHH! God's blessed me
First time I seen her she was dancin off a Nelly song
Smiled at me right then, I was in the zone
Go up in my station, I'll show you big dipper
Stop, two dollar stop, Fabo show her big zipper OHH!
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Make it "Tootsie Roll" (what's happenin)
Do it with no hands!!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jibbs]
Aiyyo.. I was chillin wit my boy Fabo
And I saw this chickalicka
I told her to come hurr, come and get up in this picture
I say smile for me mami and the flash went flicker
She snappin, do three-sixty with her snap dance
She can make it look like a tap dance
I'm in this deal what's happenin~!
Jump to the left, jump to the, jump to jump to
Jump to the right, jump to the, jump to jump to
Take a picture turn around, bump your shoulders up and down
Girl get up in that stance, you can do it with no hands
Pose like a model cause you're so so cute
Then make your body move like you in a photo shoot

[Chorus] - 2X

AY! {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
