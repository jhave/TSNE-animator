[Intro: sample]
Gambinos, no crime family in the in america as powerful
or more treacherous

[Bronze Nazareth]
I advise you to look out
The beef don't grill with no heat, so let's cook out
Look how we aint eat
So my niggas went the crook route
We still half free
Giraffe trees when the hook out
Black mask the crowns, we move in like a new house
Raw team court green on the scene like my new spouse
Praise due to self, know the truth's out
I'm self taught, only student in the schoolhouse
Can't call it a zoo, without a few, Llama's laid out
Well sought out, engulfed in linen like Rayful Edmond
I spray letters while DEA tethers track my sentence
Avocado champagne and blue grapes in Venice
Homicidal mind frame, in a house with shady tenants
Instant vintage invented, simply intricate intentions
The makings of a Wise Man, comprehension and lettuce
My ammo spray gracefully fake MC's send 'em a dentist
Never leave fingerprints, or hire a liver apprentice
Dire fire implanters,
Suburban cops guard city limits like linebackers
I take a passage from the roach the bible in my holster
Gun out, whether sun-up or sundown, that's back-words
Matter fact words could put the sun out
Splatter black pistol powder, missile shower when they sung out
Deep grams o' stanza, one line of mine equal to one ounce
Panhandle, candle wax flame brilliant thoughts out
All out the tropic sinner-hole, with violence deluxe
That make you igloo ventricle, and eyelid adjust

[Interlude: La the Darkman]
ayo Bronze.I got you my nigga!!
This L.A.D. uhhhhh!

[La the Darkman]
My thought don't differ much
Purple kush stuff my dutch
Rich nigga, beamer in 5 pop the clutch
Model bitches, Penelope Cruz I'm in them guts
Fucking high class sluts, I throw 'em a couple bucks
Laboring under correct knowledge, they call it L.U.C.K.
Sparkling black diamonds maker her starstruck
I never gave a fuck like Nicki in casino
La Trafficante, Embassy gambino
Las Vegas, Nevada, margarita's in Reno
Meditating, sipping chagga latte cappuccino
Got the carter like nino, I ain't never been a fool (uhhh)
Had the first 200,000 dollars back in high school
BMW, silk ropes, melodies sick quotes
Cash down no notes, cribs on both coasts
By the bay dock the boats, foot massage Dr Scholtz
Lay it down, not to boast, coach em like Lou Holtz

[Outro: sample]
Well guys who had been in the trenches
Robbing and stealing and killing and hijacking and everything
You know over the years, said "hey what about me?"</pre>
