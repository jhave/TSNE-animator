[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yea, It's me and T man
T at dot com, bitch
Tip fuck wit ya boy, hey that is my brotha ladies and gentlemen
T.I. and he is the King bitch, don't get that shit twisted
And me, I am the Best Rapper Alive, ladies and gentlemen, hello!
This is Da Drought 3, and it's been a minute since I rapped on a Mannie Fresh beat
But uh, I guess I'll go ahead and show these niggaz
what to do with one of the beats mayne

[Lil Wayne]
Listen, I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked
Ridin wit a bad hoe, with her girlfriend in the back
I like to get real high and I never look back
And you don't wanna try me and don't I look strapped?
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin wit it
Got black and gold soul, wit a fresh New Orleans fitted
And a collared polo and a pair of bally bucks
Young Money muthafucka, know you worred bout us
Cash Money muthafucka, see I'm all I trust
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw I bust
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus
What happens on my bus, stays on my bus
And that white widow weed, out the jar is a must
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar I'll bust
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us
Well not just us, a couple foreign sluts
Yea, we make this song a Noritwallin Dawllin
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin ballin
Yea baby we ballin, like Rawlins and Spalding
Pint of DJ Screw and that hawaiian
I am leaning like a 3 legged lion, climbing
Right to the top of the muthafuckin mountain.. counting
I'm gonna need me an accountant who counts it
Mannie got this fuckin beat poundin, it's poundin
But it was just lost, until I found it, I found it
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it
Put this bitch to sleep, fuckin right I night-gowned it
Niggaz talkin cheap, tell them niggaz pipe down bitch
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless
Beatin up this track like a muthafuckin round-fist
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'ma spit like a long kiss
I am just a martian, ain't nobody else on this.. planet
I know, see I live by my only
Say where my cheese nigga? Where my macaroni?
Baby I get up in dat ass, and act a donkey
Candy on candy, nigga grippin the grain
See I'm the only fire that can live in the rain
I am so so New Orleans
Like 1825 Tulane

[Lil Wayne talking]
Hahaha.. see you gotta be from New Orleans
To know what the fuck I'm talkin bout
And if you don't... fuck you
Say what I want, and I don't nothin.. cuz I got everything, bitch</pre>
