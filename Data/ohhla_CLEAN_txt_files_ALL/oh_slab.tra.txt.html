[Trae]
I pull up on the block, trunk knock the kits off
The fifth fly, but I'm still bout to get pissed off
Swangas on a everyday base, crawl by the law
I don't want another case, with the nigga named Grace
So we put it in they face, with the black drop
Low in the front, cocked up with the top up
Might as well hit the block up, 'fore the drop lock up
With a glock cocked up, when a hater pop up
I put the rock up, and shine they asses off
Like Roy Pat, I'm coming out the South
Got diamonds in my mouth, when I'm on my route
Throwback screwed up, know what I'm tal'n bout
Hey, niggaz say that they don't know about a G
But I bet they know a G, when I pull up on the D
U-B for the S.U.C., S-L-A-B
T-R-A-E, M double A B
I'm sick with it, niggaz never get with it
Brick and a mic, guaranteed I'm the shit with it
Better write hard, 'fore you try to come and spit with it
If not, be the next nigga that'll quit with it
A to the B to the N, attitude not a friend
Niggaz wanna try to blend, but they better think again
'Fore I put em in the wind, with a pad and a pen
God damn, Lil' Trae going at it for the win

[Boss]
You ain't never seen, Lil' Boss floss in the name
Lil' Boss, trying to get a bigger vault and some change
Stay G, cause playas get lost in the game
Niggaz try, to throw a little salt in your name
If I get the word nigga, then I'm off in you mayn
Have your partnas, trying to get my niggaz off of you mayn
Never had to call a nigga, cause it's off to the van
To the six foot ziplock, and off to the sand
The dope fiends'll get ya, if I offer a grand
Just to see up on the corner, with the soft in my hand
To the kitchen it get hard, then it's off with the grams
Throwed with my hooks, you soft with your hands
I know you niggaz seen us, looking awesome
In Austin cocked up, in a old school steady stalking
All my niggaz steady Cripping, some falking
My Blood niggaz on the right side, steady balking

[Hook: Shyna]
We Slow, SLow Loud And Bangin how we roll
Pop trunk, blow skunk throwed
How we do it down in Texas
We slow (slow), slow (slow)
Let's go, we be riding fo' do's
Come with the plex, y'all better go
We push y'all head down, to the flo'
Yo, fo's

[Grace]
Southside G's spin 24's, candy Cadillac on 84's
Top fall down and the trunk raise up, fifty side motherfucker that's how we roll
Raising hell at the detail spraying bams, trunk down chopped up on this Screw we jam
Turn it up let it bang as I grip on grain, S.U.C. we off the chain
Fo' do' Magnum when I roll with Trae, Ro and Den in a 3 Los on his way
Expo chopping blue candy knocking, Southside G's and ain't no stopping
Cause the rims keep going me and Trae keep flowing, doe keep blowing codeine po'ing
Oh yeah motherfucker know the South still holding, H-Town shining showing glowing
VS-1's in my neck and in my mouth, white gold blue diamonds know I'm talking bout
Cake runner after cash execute go live, one hundred to the end baby that's no doubt
Real till I die that's how that go, bout to get rolled with sto's a hoe
Play pussy get fucked they'll never know, body burnt toe tagged on a cold trip road
Let it bang and swang candy paint and screens, falling down from the roof we fresh and clean
Southwest side of Houston we got that green, keep a white cup full of that lean
Dirty South we clowning cuz, endo dro blowing killer buzz
On the seat technician punking jugs, going hard than a bitch you gotta feel that cuz

[Trae]
Fucked niggaz, really be about now-a-days
All out they do', running they mouth the fly way
But I know one thang, they don't wanna try Trae
Have em like Po-Yo and Paul, sitting sideways in a daze
I'm a representative, for the South
Never too good, so they know I'm paying niggaz off
Like a new set of fo's, I be wearing niggaz off
Elbows poking out, so I'm clearing niggaz off
Slow Loud And Bangin, like Jay and Boss
And you can tell I'm out that click, from the way I floss
The black whip brand new, but it still get tossed
I thought the top was a test, for that chick I lost
I'm on a flip through the Nawf, riding through the 4-4
See the homie Lil' Chris, Shep with the Vato
If it gotta get G, just know we got mo'
16 come fast, but the paint go slow
These hoes don't know, that I'm raw in the game
Raw on the block, still on Fondren and Main
Got 99 ways, that I'm grabbing the grain
For the 2-5, gotta keep my mouth in a maze
And now-a-days, niggaz say I'm lost in the game
These cats gon see, I'm a boss in the game
And I pack my weight, never soft in the game
Old G.P., I'ma be a hog in the game

[Hook]

[Shyna]
S-L-A-B, B-E see we
Slow Loud And Bangin, that's that C-L-I-C
K we spray on block on anyday, if your block got boys and shit
We play games on all of y'all, who wanna be talking shit
We in that kitchen cooking, watch out them po-po's looking
Get that do' slap a hoe, let em know his block is tooken
Throwed, in H-Town we riding slow
Slow (slow), we slow (slow)

[Paul Wall]
Grab the keys start the slab, chunk the deuce get some dab
Swang the block cut the corner, hand on glock mind on cash
Chasing after the American dream, all or nothing trying to stack that green
Nothing to lose if you ain't down with us, don't straddle the fence you on the wrong team
Grab a white cup and po' up the drank, so much mud I can hardly think
In a line riding slab by slab, ain't nothing but chrome and that platinum paint
It's Paul Wall and my partna Trae, Jay'Ton and that boy Lil' Boss
Keep your cool and don't cross the line, or it's guaranteed that you'll get fucked off

[Kendro]
Jamming A.B.N., so you know I ride slab
Back in the gap, I was crawling the AVE.
I don't slow my pace, but give a nigga some dab
I'm deuce out the roof, when I be flipping the loop
At 59, then bend the corner on some knot
And the Trae on Blodge, and laws they hot
Bro, I go tip through the Mo
Fuck with Shep Dog, out the 4-4
Pop your trunk, T-R-A-E
We still body rock, for P-A-T
I'm coming out the South, no ice in my mouth
I'm Slow Loud And Bangin, on a paper route
A lot of these cats, they envy me
I'm hellified, cool on G.P.
Rap shit locked, it's in a figga fo'
Name another young cat, that's thoed as Kendro</pre>
