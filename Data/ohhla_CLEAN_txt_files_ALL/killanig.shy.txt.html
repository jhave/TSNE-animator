[Intro: L.E.O.]
It's the edge, mothafuckas, on the edge, mothafuckas
Bust a head for that bread, we bed mothafuckas
Heard what I said, mothafuckas?
For that dead prez, they'll be some dead mothafuckas
BLAOW! Nigga...

[L.E.O.]
All I hear is hammers blowing, I'm from the land of murders and drug sales
Thugs yell when them nut shells bust over buck sales
Fuck jail, cuz if any one of you ducks tell
You be fucking with self in an odd position
My job description is to go and solve the witnessing
The mob's is lynching, whoever involved in snitching
Your jobs is listed, even the cars you rented
Could be tracked down, that's why our suave is listening
Just kidding, but at Rockaway the laws is different
The far is vicious, bodies drop and fall in ditches
Body parts is missing, body lost on pictures
Found weeks later from jaws and fishing
Nigga, it could be ya father or sister
Baby brother, baby mother, or even ya baby, sucker
Pleading, play crazy, baby, I want ya
Got a, young gunner, like Jay-Z, brother
And a, Young Jigga like I'm Jay-Z's mother
Nucca, I ain't gotta say nothing else to ya
Beef with Beyonce like you Jay-Z's lover
Nucca, I'm from The Rock and not Jay-Z, fucker

[Chorus: L.E.O.]
I come to ya block, know them tools is cocked
Here them shots, they yell (killas)
Them dudes won't pop, they go use the cops
Cuz they know they got us (killas)
We take they strip then we make it flip
Paper chasing (niggaz)
Don't mistake it though cuz we making dough
(Nigga, we G-Code niggaz)

[L.E.O.]
I take as serious, for ya ridiculous sentences
I just copped the four-fifth with the aim vision lens
And when inf get his, we gon' ring ya strip in
Have ya block looking something how the Olympics is
Niggaz is running, jumping, hopping the fences-es
We blowing pounds together like compound sentences
Multiply round, divide guys, division shit
Spirit rise high, like some real religious shit
Fuck ya inner sense, Genesis up in menaces
Lord forgive him for the committed sins he living in
Pardon me, larceny, taught me to eat off a robbery
Reach as far as a ki, Jif, dodge, narcotic seize
S.K.'s, A.K.'s, revolver, P's
We bring all of these, charge a pharmacy
Guarding them ki with them so lame armories
Things hit brain tissue, veins and main arteries

[Chorus]

[L.E.O.]
Aiyo, L.E.O., big nigga scrapper
Lay everybody out, carry guns like Iraqers
Large ones, massage guns like chiropractors
And Shy ya packer so scrapper ain't gotta clap ya
Ask what a scrapper, to pull it with the rapidly bullets
Have ya faggot-ass collapsing in bushes
Scrapper of Crooklyn, and no he wasn't raised in Brooklyn
But know gangstas in Brooklyn that bang in the booking
Then, go to the Four building, rain on niggaz cushion
Man, them fake lame with no name, brains get pushed in
For walking and talking, what portion you put in?
Nigga, who you for? Dog, ya softer than pudding
I got the, balls for war, the mind for crime
I saw it all before, you only saw behind my eyes
Dictionaries, obituaries, Donnie, I miss you dearly
Nigga tried to kill me, barely, and death still don't scare me

[Chorus]

[Outro: L.E.O.]
G-Code niggaz, E.D.G.E. G-Code niggaz
Old head, nigga, believe that, nigga
Put that work in, yanahI'msaying?
We hungry, you heard?
Pluck a nigga, pluck a nigga, for the love of money
Toughest nigga suffer, nigga, when this thug is hungry
Sucker nigga, duck a nigga, like they coming for me
I catch up 'til you fuck up, better have something for me
I'm coming...</pre>
