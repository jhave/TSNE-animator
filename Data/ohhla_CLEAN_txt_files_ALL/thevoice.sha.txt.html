Song:   The Voice of Power
Typed by: jostmatt@bluewin.ch

I come across louder than a bull horn, a full-born
Human ghetto blaster that has to move on
The voice of choice to pound the sound that Mark made
If you sleep, huh, you catch a heartache
Toot and scream, woofers blow when I flow
Biters bite actin like they didn't know
Rhymes I make take the cake, they have to be
Sweet like sugar, Strawberry D'Acquery
I'll dilute your brain like [Name]
Brandy I'm dandy if you can't flow, walk
Off the set, go and get
Reinforcements or new concepts
See if you can match the man that has to stand
Militant and armed, ready to cold bomb
Get in your stance, here's your chance
Now you're gettin a blast
From Lak Shabazz
The voice of power

See, I been waitin to catch you, now I got you
I'ma mop you, make you walk the desert like Jacub
( ? ) and slob
Any negative thoughts? Yo, save it, hops
For the wack ones, I simply attack them
Do what I wanna do with em and ranshack em
( ? ) your fortress, I run through y'all
You're nothin but a bunch of knuckleheads, screwballs
This were a contest for money you wouldn't win a nickel
Your rhymes are too wack, you whimsical
My impact is that of a nuclear
Explosion, I'm unloadin, comin through to ya
Loud and clear, proud to bear witness
To the fact that I'm packed with swiftness
Now what you gotta say for yourself?
You might as well pray for help
Rappers like you, I eat em with battle rhymes
When the dinner bell ring, it's chow time
I rush the stage, grab the mic and rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power

Rhythms I ride with ease to please a crowd
With lyrics that totally tower
When I was young I made a vow
That thou will always possess the voice of power
I kick science you're bein dropped on
Gimme the mic, look at how the props swarm
And see the brother cold undertake
Gimme the cue, watch me stun the break
I'm gettin fed up, you're so wack, dag
You're like roaches and I'm the blackflag
You little insect, I put heads out
Rappers check in, but they don't check out
You waste time, you should learn to make
Deffer rhymes so I don't have to exterminate
I wasn't made to be ruled by no one
And it ain't no fun if I don't get none
The voice of power longs for strong rhymes that penetrate
Listen as Lakim demonstrates
Vocals I flow styles, I like the track
I sound crisp and some whisper, "How's he do that?"
5'4" and a connaisseur, so step slow
While you intake a vision from a video
I'm known to rock a party for hours
I got the voice of power

Ah yeah
Flavor Unit in effect
1990
Lakim Shabazz
All that
You know what I'm sayin?
