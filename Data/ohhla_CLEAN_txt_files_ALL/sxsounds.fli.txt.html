[Intro]
See...
It's only one way I know how to describe this shit

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Touching, kissing on each other
Your bitin' and scratching me
Girl, you want this D
We gon' make sex sounds, yeah
We gon' make sex sounds, yeah
We gon' be making sex sounds, Annie
We gon' make sex sounds, oh yeah Annie

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
Who said my team wasn't winning, man
Left cheek, right cheek better get it
Annie, girl get ratchet
Back it up let me grab it
Get it, get it girl what you waiting for
Turn up, get faded at my table
Other Annie's hatin', gettin' jealous
All because they see I
Make you feel some type of way
I make you feel some type of way
Type of way

[Chorus: TeeFlii]

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
All my bitches say
Ooh, God damn Dolla $ign you the man
Pussy melt in my mouth, not my hand
Put my tip in and I slam
Turn her over, that's right bend over girl
Pop it for a nigga like soda girl
My mama taught me I should never choke a girl
But this pussy good enough to get a trophy girl
Ain't nothin' but a G thing babe
Walk around in my T-shirt baby
Cause I make you feel some type of way

[Chorus: TeeFlii &amp; Ty Dolla $ign]

[Verse 3: TeeFlii]
Annie, annie you turnin' me up
Poppin' that thing, poppin' that thing
There's a lot of niggas in here plottin' on you, plottin' on you
See, I'm about to turn this club into a function
Oh I, I, make you feel some type of way
I make you feel some type of way, type of way

[Chorus: TeeFlii]</pre>
