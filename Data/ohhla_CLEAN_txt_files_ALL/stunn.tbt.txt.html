[Verse1]
Nigga, now since my career be on shine
These haters be packin' they nine
But look nigga, I'm down for mine
Tryin' to catch me at the red light gettin' my shine
But I use my niner to protect me at all time
I just bought that new Lexus
1998 the bubble eye nigga with them 19 inches
See I'ma talk about my Hummer at the end of my rhyme
I just bought that new Range Rover with them 6 new ties
And every hoe I know, I done fucked at least one time
Now playboy, tell me, how you luv that?

[Verse 2]
Last night  I got a call  on my phone
Ike Turner wanna make a "gangsta-slap-a-bitch-pimp" song
He said, "I called you man, cause you the realest
Bitches runnin' round town sayin' how they love Willis"
Have hoes to suck toes and wash clothes
Niggas tryin' to fit ya like a pair of Girbauds
Bitches in the morn'  to brush my teeth
Lil' girls with curls love to wipe my feet
BLING! Diamonds glistenin' everywhere
It's alright for that girl to look at me, y'all let her stare
Baby, I know I'm gorgeous, cause I'm the largest
Jet skis and M3's in my garag-es

[Chorus]
I bought a Hummer that's sittin' on 32's
Fuck stun'n, we givin' these hoes the blues
Fresh got a Bourbon that's sittin' on 20's, fool
Wood grain, T.V.'s and it's all cool  5x

[Verse 3]
Now nigga, tell me how you can beat this
A million dollar worth of cars all on chrome, can you defeat this?
With all new homes, 8 of them
The Hot Boy$ new album, Get It How You Live!!, done jumped off strong
I spent 2 million buildin' my own home
With a million dollar worth of furniture all on wood grain, homey
See nigga, I ain't gotta stunt cause I can bag'em up, Believe this
Ask the police at Eastover, "Has he seen this?"
Nigga with diamonds and gold, all across the T-O-P
And every hoe in my path done seen that I done fucked for free
The pussy, I like to fuck it until it bleed
Cause I aim to succeed to be a top rank in this industry
And my Humvee
Playboy, I got so much wood in that motherfucker it need ot be a coffin seat
For 4 brand new T.V.'s with VCR
The Big Tymer, it come on tomorrow
Ridin' on 32's and you cain't miss these G's
All on chrome from the motherfuckin' U-P-T
When I get my big baller party
Player, I'ma let all my dicksuckers get in free
You can believe that

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Do you remember that day on the lake?
Hummer came throught like a motherfuckin' earthquake
niggas tellin' bitches, "What the fuck is that?"
Bitches tellin' niggas, "I told ya they be back."
In '98, I bought the Viper white,red, and stripe-ah
20 inch rims with the chrome dual piper
15 on my wrist, the lord can kiss
Where the diamonds don't shine, niggas make hips 
Wildlife gator fits, now that's the shit
Bourbon and Suburban with the wood grain kits
See ya bitch, I'ma stick her, Mike couldn't dick her
The way I'ma do her, screw her, then I'm gon' flip her

[Chorus then talk til the end]
