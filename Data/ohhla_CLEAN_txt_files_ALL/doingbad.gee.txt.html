Wassup
Ahh.... Wassup

Verse 1
Hard times got a nigga in all black 
I'm gonna jack for that silver pack where it's at
I need a hit nigga
I can't quit nigga
Get in my way and your shit get split nigga
Uptown is a cage for monkeys and killers
Got to be realah around all these guerrilas
But it's cool I'm a young thug nigga
Rough like a rug nigga ain't scared to plug nigga
I was turned out at an early age
On V.L. not afraid the rocks and the twelth gauge
Raised like a slave caught up in that thirteenth cage
On that dust ready bust
Plus blunts got a nigga don't give a fuck
I hope you got your vest on
If you don't when the K blast you won't have your chest on
Nigga now you get your rest on
Brains blown gettin' a yellow tape zone
Motherfucker

(Chorus)
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the silver packs Is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the twenty sacks ? Is it the silver packs?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is it the dime bags? Is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it Uptown keepin' me doing bad
Is the silver packs? Is it the twenty sacks?

Verse 2
All I wanted was to be comfortable with a lot of mil
(million)
And I'm risking going to jail and gettin' left stale
I'm gettin' tired of this all day block shit 
Cock glock with this rock after rock shit
Could it be me servin' for twenty, 
2-5, 11-5, or the muthafuckin' even 5
And I'm servin' 4 and a half to 28
And I might front it if you come straight it and not late
Try to play me I'm gonna bust your muthafuckin' grape
I ain't gonna be stingy with the yah because I ain't fake
But now all I got is the nikel piece now
Struggling with it tryin' to get on my feet now
I'm on a hunt for some A-K funk 
Double barrel pump full of that skunk ready to pop the trunk
Over this nigga they got a contract
I gots to have that give me the mad mask in the all black
Muthafucker

(Chorus)
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the silver packs or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the twenty sacks or is it the silver packs?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the silver packs or is it the twenty sacks?

Verse 3
My pockets empty and I'm loaded that just don't match
Two and two together that's why where the fuck I'm at
On my ass tryin' to make a power move 
Servin niggaz two birds of flour it's sour but it's a come up fool
I'm on that dope it ain't no secret but that shit ain't shive 
How am I stay high stay shive and get mine
I can't do it so I gotta try to kick the habit
Or that million I want I might not never have it
So I got to try to keep my muthafuckin' nose close
Or I'm gonna end up drove with no hoes 
It's all about the fuckin' feddy, the mil
The eight, and the seven grams that sale on the scale
I can not fail to hit the top of the charts
Young with heart I survive off street smarts
Play with me clips slide in the K
Play whit me I'll spin your bin every day
I refuse to lose I paid dues to jump
I'm on a come up I I got the twelth gauge on pump
Busted heads clips thrown my way 
Bustin' heads to let you know I don' t play 
I'm out to have things I spit rhymes to get down
Hands clap when I get down doing bad Uptown

(Chorus)
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the nickel bags?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the dime bags or is it the silver packs?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the nickel bags or is it the twenty sacks?
What the fuck is it keepin' me Uptown doing bad?
Is it the nickel bags or is it the dime bags?

Talking
What the fuck is it
I don't know 
Nigga
Don't let that stop you from handling your issues</pre>
