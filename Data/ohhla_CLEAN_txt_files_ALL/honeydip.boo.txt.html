[Chorus] [x4]
Honeydips in Gotham
Honeydips in Gotham
Represent

[Verse One] [Vex]
Twelve O'clock on my block on a hot summer's day
Asiatic dragonfly's passin' by my way
Sister Africa with oriental eyes here she come
Ebony rose from the Earth gettin' darker in the sun
Cocomo complexion brown sugar with the smile
Sun showers to the knees love flower by the Nile
Peace be ? the love survive
Coolin' in the park after dark with the tribe
Aww yeah
Check out all the honeydips in Gotham
Aww yeah
Chillin' with the deadlock crew
Aww yeah
Respect to every black woman I'm
Standin' on the street watchin' you
True
You know how we do
Chillin' in the aura effervescence just me and you
Out in Gotham, baby you fine
I think that I'm losin' my miiiiiiind

[Chorus] [x4]
Honeydips in Gotham
Honeydips in Gotham
Represent

[Verse Two] [Mondo]
A strong black complexion 
You draw me like a magnet when you smilin'
You check me cause I made it, might you be from the Island?
The eye of the beholder couldn't handle you, you're precious
Pardon me my man as I address this
Honeydip I'm clockin'
Right on time here comes the perspiration
I'm not the man, she has an aura of intimidation
If I can know you name perhaps tomorrow we can grow
Your eyes don't lie, I'd be a great African hero
He who breaks the barrier will be the one's successor
I'm claimin' you my cheese because I'm fresher
At night I pray to God, we'll walk the path of righteousness together
Natural potent, my dip don't be smokin' 
Patience is a virtue so I wait around for you
Honeydip in Gotham, I know there's but a few
Give me a day in the life of you, you smile with contemplation
Startin' off the evenin' with some pure conversation

[Chorus] [x4]
Honeydips in Gotham
Honeydips in Gotham
Represent

[Verse Three] [Vex]
All the lovely ones, bounce on the one
Switch on the two with the sister next to you
Now bounce with a new brother and rock with your crew
Honeydips represent, aiight
This is how we do
Coco butter brown sugar makes the underwater chocolate
Special dedication to the sisters come to rock it
The mind makes you fine so money can't buy it
All the ugly sister's be quiet

[Mondo]
Conversation is on the up rise 
Not ended until dusk
When we're tired and are arms wrapped will make Egyptian
Must niggas get mad? When they see the honeydip and me
In Mocodo shorts, but we know who niggas wanna be
Flyin' through the galaxy, you'll be the star beside of me
The temple of the energy 
The sister and I miss ya, when you're with me
Your my sweet and sexy thang
You're a honeydip to me!

[Chorus] [x4]
Honeydips in Gotham
Honeydips in Gotham
