[2 Pistols - overlaps last line of Chorus]
Ay, supermodel, lemme holla at you for a second...
Excuse moi, let me talk to you for a second
Lil' mama so fine she got the whole squad sweatin
Damn, how you fit all that in them jeans?
Was the question that I asked followed by let me buy you a drink (drink)
Young boss baby, I treat'cha treat'cha to the finer things
The neck bling, wrist bling, wedding ring - nah~! I'm playin
Might light you neck or your wrist
But'cha gotta ride nice dick and uhh, take trips with the bricks
She got it (she got it) she got it (she got it) that's what Pain said
Them other niggaz lame man, lil' mama I got the game plan

Shorty know she's got it (HEY!) got it, got it (HEY!)

Shorty know she's got it (HEY!) got it, got it (HEY!)
She got it (she got it) - {she..got..it)

[2 Pistols]
Damn she bad (damn she bad) damn she thick (yes indeed)
Five foot five, hazel eyes, redbone you da shit
Make a nigga wanna stop and stare, I just wanna pull your hair
Freaky shit, kinky shit, but we don't need to take it there
I'm a young boss girl, let me upgrade ya
He's a worker, I get work out, what you 'bout girl
Trips to Venice (Venice) what's the bid'ness
Bet this, Swiss your digits, and the rest is history

[Chorus]

[Tay Dizm]
I see my superwoman, nobody cain't do it like she can
And she got it, I'm tellin you like nobody YEAH
And I love the way she talk them lames out they dreams
Bestest thing in fresh Louis with the matching jeans
And I love the tatted down baby, I'm your fit
Can I be yo' appetizer, yo just her and me
Oh, she's on tonight, the baddest in the club
I grab that ass when she give me a hug cause
