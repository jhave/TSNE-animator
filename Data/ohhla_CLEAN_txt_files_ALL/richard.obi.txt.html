[Obie Trice]
Yeah.. Trice, Statik Selektah

O back around the corner
Got the crack, put in your orders, we 'bout to run up out the stores
It's +Notorious+ the way I got +Big+ spittin stories
BME's X-Clan, +Vanglorious+
We not your favorite fuck it, you know the system and you buck it
Have you revisitin, how you used to love it
A nigga spew through the music acoustics
Cool kid, used to pursue excuses
Truth is I was truant in school
So his influence is foolish, that was my views
I'm back at it, the rap addict by any means
We gon' get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain't a star, niggaz might be right
I'm so regular, nigga got his shit tonight
Bring it back Selektah, let 'em know it's Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight

[Eminem]
Chka-chk-chka-chk, and I would like
to introduce my-s-self, surprise! HI, it's Ike~!
'Bout get my Ike on, I come with a life supply of wife
beaters and my Nikes on, and a white tee over that Iron Mike
Lookin fly tonight, feelin like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, +Park+ my +Peter+ inside a dyke
Bitch actin like she got fuckin higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off of the motherfuckin Breyers ice 
cream with the pliers like (AHHH) only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, and stop on the way home pick up two big Bufords
Scrupulous girl you got a nice pair, but you're plum stupid
So when I pull up in that Benz don't try to pretend you ain't interested
to impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in, woman
and get slammed on the ground and SNAP like a pool stick against, cement
If you should get dick, pretend like it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a hoe, cause your pants are so
tight when you dance with O. Trice your implants explode
So cold to dykes the chance of snow, in San Francisco
Well I'm from Detroit City, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me, it's senseless mind babble
What, me apologize? {*babbles*} It's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fuckin take it back if I TIME TRAVELLED!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Just call me Richard, Richard
Cause I'm a dick, dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like 
you should pry your fuckin mouth up off of it, it (hah)
I said just call me Richard, Richard (yea)
Cause I'm a dick, dick (yea)
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock prick
Just call me Richard, Richard

[Obie Trice]
That's my motives, jumpin out the Rovers
All white like I was right up in the Dakotas
or Minnesota; did I mention soda?
When it's mixed with the yola watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier, from holdin a disposable toaster
Puttin holes in a nigga gettin close enough
BME 'til the credits roll
So my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O
Like a prosthetic third leg, let it go
This is Shady 1.0, Em let 'em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans, my balls'll never digress
I'm a dick that I brag about
I put it in fast and then I drag it out
World, I'll be your special friend see
Cause these suckers suffer from pseudo-penis envy... {*echoes*}
So

[Chorus]</pre>
