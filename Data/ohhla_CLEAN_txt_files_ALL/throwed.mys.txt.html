(Intro: Mystikal)
MAN!! (I ain't never felt like this before)
DAMN!! I ain't never felt like this before
I AIN'T RIGHT!!, fuck, this shit ain't right
Huh, huh, I AIN'T RIGHT!!, huh
Shit ain't right

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off (fuck), I'm throwed off (huh)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off

(Mystikal)
I'm fucked up in the head
but everytime I go on - bitch, ran my coat on
Bitch gonna take my clothes off
You niggas are crazy like roaddogs
You can do what you wan' do
and say what you want - just don't play wit' me
Go wit'cha flow go, just don't call me bitch OK?
BACK OFF, BACK OFF!! Mind your business
Damn dog, didn't know you were ever gonna drop
Nigga, soon as I finish, I'm gonna make your motherfuckin'
Record Store look like it just got broke with a crowbar
I ain't gotta stand up in this bitch, take your hands on - throwed off, throwed off

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off

(Mystikal)
Niggas be testin' the street like dick-birds
Then they start day-dreamin', watch my tons and hit curbs (oops!)
Then I fuck my eyes and spit in my face - they got bad nerves
I smoke - funny - ain't lust and use bad words
But I'm in another revolution - motherfucker seem with his ASS HEARD!!
If you ever in your car and you play my game, throw the password
cause it doesn't rest its head with an exquisite hand and they BLAST FIRST!!
I can't stand my next door neigborhood, so I'm here to get a transfer
They won't stay over my GRASS - fur, I ain't right

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed...

(Interlude: Mystikal)
Check this part out right here
Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum - I smell a sticky nigga roll up one
Get back if you ain't got none
If you ain't 'BOUT it, then nigga don't come

(Mystikal)
We tear this bitch up everytime we come through
Actin' stupid, bitch - you know what I do
Lookin' like I come from Artabozoo
Where the feeders gumbo and cross-fetch too, huh
I get down cause I come up around the checkin' line
Kell - stop that fuckin' track - I've lost my mind

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off (huh)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off (huh)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off (huh)
I'm throwed off (huh), I'm throwed off

(Mystikal)
Hickery-dickery-dock - get 'em - jump off my cock
Bitch - get out my face and whore - stay out my pocket, that's right
Everytime I come in the kitchen, put two in the kitchen
Gettin' fat, eatin' all the fuckin' food up but ain't washin' the dishes
The FUCK YOU MEAN do I have somethin' else to drink?
You just got through emptyin' the jug out the hands - its the same
THAT'S IT - gotta get the fuck out
bitch about to schold your hand to the door
Nigga, I don't play that shit, better ask somebody
Bitch - thought you know

(Chorus: Mystikal)
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off
I'm throwed off, I'm throwed off</pre>
