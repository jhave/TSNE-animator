[Static/Major - Intro]
Tip it, ah, ah, tip it good
Ah, sip it, ah, sip it, sip it, sip it, sip it, sip it
Tip it, ah, ah, tip it good

[Lil Wayne]
Hahah, let's roll, baby
I got dem greens and dem yellows
And dem purples in that purple
And my +Duffle+ like I'm in a +Playaz Circle+
And homie youse a square that's why yo' girl in my circle
When I be killin these hoes and she just another murder
I should be arrested, I should be molested
I told you I'm the best and that should not be contested
Flow so sick, how could you not be infected?
I got that dope dick, how could she not be injected?

[Chorus: Static/Major]
I got my, tailor made suit
I got my, rims on shine
I got my, goons in the cut
I got my, ahhhhhhhh 'ey

[Verse One]
Party like a rockstar, Russian cut rocks yaw'll
Yeah I got that gwap yaw'll, lookin for a hot broad..
..and she can get knocked off
Once we get our rocks off, it's a UPS drop off..
I'm ridin with the top off
a/k/a Boss Hog, they said I was a lost cause
NAWW! I'm ridin with the top off
a/k/a Boss Hog, watch me brush them haters off

[Chorus]
I got my, tailor made suit
I got my, rims on shine
I got my, dobbs with the feather
I got my, purple in the bag
I got my, bottle on ice
I got my, first class tickets
I got my, goons in the cut
I got my... block on hot, hey!

[Verse Two]
First I valet the car, check into my five-star..
Ho-tel, oh well
I got five hunnid horses on fo' wheels
and the ice around my neck'll give ya cold chills (chill)
BRRRRR! a/k/a Eskimo
Grew up on dixie loaf, but now it's just fillet mignon (non)
Ah, I chase it with a lobster tail
I insist I got the bill, I got the bi-yahye-yahye-ill

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We gon' play it like we at the fiesta
I go in hard at the grand Casin-a
Flippin chips to all my mamamitas
..let me see you shake your kiesta

[Lil' Wayne]
Check it, shawty do what I want
Who I want, how I want
The way I want, when I want
Even when I don't and now I do
So gimme you, all I want
for you to do, and all I want
for you to do, all I want for you to do is me, heh!
So dig that, find a shovel dig that
I say I'll just take the hit and you can take the weed back
You can make 'em in fact, if you keep me intact, and
I'll just play the friend, I got dem goons in the back

[Chorus]

HEY!</pre>
