[Big Boi]
Boy stop

[Brooke Valentine]
It's about to be a girl fight

[Big Boi]
Uh huh, uh huh Big Boi
(Uh Lil' Jon)

[Lil' Jon]
What

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight

[Verse 1: Brooke Valentine]
There she go talkin' her mess
All around town makin' me stress
I need to get off my chest
And if her friend want some then she'll be next
It really ain't all that complicated
Y'all walkin' 'round lookin' all frustrated
Want some, Tex come on let's make it
You actin' real hard but I know your fakin'

[Bridge: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]
I know you really don't wanna listen to this
Really don't know why you talkin' shit
You about to catch one right in ya  lip
It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight
I know you really don't wanna listen to this
Really don't know why you talkin' shit
You about to catch one right in ya lip
It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]

[Verse 2: Brooke Valentine]
We on our way to the neighborhood
The reason we comin' is understood
Me and my girls we down to ride
So when ya hear us pull up bring ya ass outside
And if tryin' to call ya cousin and them
Don't forget that I got some of them
I'm 'bout to go real hard, 'bout to swing them thangs
You 'bout to feel elbows all in ya brains

[Bridge: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon)]
I know you really don't wanna listen to this
Really don't know why you talkin' shit
You about to catch one right in ya lip
It's 'bout to be a (WHAT) girl fight

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]

[Big Boi]
Oh snap, these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor, now they preparing to scrap
They takin' out their scrunchies and pullin' off their Press-Ons
The one on the right is the girlfriend and the one the left is the other
woman
Someone please call security
These girls too purty, to get down to the nitty titty
I mean the nitty gritty, I mean her titties pretty
I'm trippin' bein' silly willy
Man go on let them hoes fight

[Chorus: Brooke Valentine (Lil' Jon) with variations]

[Outro: Brooke Valenine with ad-libs]
Don't act like you dont know
We break upside ya dome
So be quick enough to block ya dome
And you won't be talkin' that no more

Don't act like you dont know
We break upside ya dome
So be quick enough to block ya dome
And you won't be talkin' that no more
Bitch come outside</pre>
