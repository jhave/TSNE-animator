(Yo Son, this person's all on your shit)
Nah what's this?
(Nigga Nature tried to pimp you, yeah word em up)
Not that nigga, not that nigga that nigga's too pretty
(You gotta do somethin man, you gotta do somethin man, word up)
Take that nigga to war
Yo Nature, listen man

In a jacuzzi flashin, splashin like a uzi blastin
Much love for thugs, God bless B.I., askin
"Whattup with Cormega?"  Live niggaz keep askin
The exhibition, flexin, throw my extra clip in
Chrome bugotti VVS's, check it
Niggaz talkin bout, how real they kept it on record
Screamin out, Q.B.C. but don't rep it
Am I my brothers keeper or a faggot in love with reefer?
My Far Rock' niggaz would love to meet ya
"Life's a Bitch" but shit gets deeper, fuck gold chains and sneakers
I had dat, when cocaine was cheaper
Yo, who this fake nigga soundin like me?
You wanna be me, but can't see a thousand like me
I'm loungin, you're like bookies on housin
You see my team comin and your heart starts poundin
You shook, gettin paid off the book
Niggaz jeal-ous, my LS is off the hook
You see the Lex, you fake-ass thug, give me respect
or be another nigga that my fuckin heater wet
My poetry is manifest, the words be correct
My empire rise, now my enemies are vexed
Yo Nature you finished, yo Nas you next

Yeah, clear my little man
YouknowhatI'msayin, Nas
It ain't nuttin personal, it's all business yaknahmsayin?
You let your little faggot-ass man come on me            
But my man got a few words he wanna say to you
Yo son man

	Nature your fake ass, tried to be down and got your chain snatched
	Took the shit, and your little brother's tape back
	Now you against the Mega star, puffin hundred stacks
        in a Lex, LS, chewin on Escobars
        but they too sweet, burn my teeth
        Firm don't want no beef (yeah only three main people son) 
        Five stars, Q.B. to Desert Storm
        Tomorrow's exclusive, check the new kid on the next hit
        Find the illest kicks, play the strip, with the widest grip 
        Hover from night to light, now I push the tightest shit
	The tighest click, we airtight
	Roll deep and wear Air Nikes, some are scared some the fair type
	but we rock mics and jams, like gats we cock twice
	Runnin with the pretty boys, bitches say that's not nice
	Straight out the 'Bridge, my DeLorean, showbiz
	And if you want consignment you can find me where the coke is

I'm a nightmare to "Street Dreamin" (uh-huh)
Nigga your whole crew is twenty-two's, my dudes street sweepin
Prepared, never scared, ones to bolster Flex (for real)
I'm ill, everything's real, ain't no special effects
Yeah, bring the drama, I like the fuckin trauma (like that)
A gladiator rocking steel plated armor
Yeah, you wanna step to me, you'd better bring a referee (why)
My name is 'Mega, y'all niggaz scared to death of me
Yeah your man asked, I'm like a Columbian refugee
Murder any nigga in sight, any day or night
You see me in a jet black Lex, the coke's white
Lampin on the Hill, that nigga Nature thought he ill
I fucked his ass up like a Holyfield (just like that son)                 
For real the Real Deal, Montana, drama for short
Of course, yeah, the fucking boss
Yeah, that nigga Nature talk about he takin my spot
He took one punch to the face and just dropped

It's over La, I don't even know why you even won't try to come at me
This is Cor motherfuckin Mega yo                       
You know my status you fuckin faggot                             
That's why I fucked you up                                            
That's why my man took your fuckin gold chain            
and he's wearin your shit in the projects, you're a fuckin bitch 
Knahmsayin Nas?  You need to you need to you need to
get a fuckin fireproof fuckin van next time you come through  
Projects or they gon burn your shit down      
Y'all niggaz is idiots yo (word up faggot ass nigga)                         
Talkin about "Street Dreams" rockin a pink ass suit
(Yeah you talkin bout crack nigga)       
What kind of dreams you niggaz workin with, man?
(Them like a pink leather and shit)     
Yo man, last crack y'all niggaz sold was y'all ass!                 
You fuck with me, you're fuckin with the best, man, knahmsayin?
But y'all niggaz ain't ready for fuckin war man
(Y'all ain't ready for war man)
Y'all ain't ready for the motherfuckin, the gun battles
or the beatings on sight man
