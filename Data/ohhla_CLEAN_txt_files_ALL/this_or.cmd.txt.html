(talking)
Slang or rap, two sides to the story
What side you gone choose, it's on you ya dig
It's either (slang or rap) it's either this or that
But check it out

[Chorus]
It's either this or that, now what you mean
This or that, it's either this or that
Now what you mean, this or that
It's either this or that, now what you mean
This or that, it ain't no in between black
And you know I mean that

[C-Murder]
Ain't no in between nothing, now let me tell you something
You either love me or hate me and yes the streets made me
And yes, I must, gone do just what I feel
I guess you could call that, keeping it real
Cause gangstas don't live that long, I can't tell
Cause me and my dogs is a long way from hell
But not too far from jail it's either, this or that
You remember you gave me dap, of course I was strapped
Silly rabbit you know, tricks are for kids
My homie's facing years, too lifetime big
Now what should I do, that nigga said he was TRU
So with no hesitation I'm at the sub station
No rehabilitation, I wanna see you freeze
I wanna see you back at town chilling with me
And see, the laws looking for his family
It's either this or that cuz are you down with me

[Keala]
The ghetto made me famous, which way should I go
Wanna do the right thing but the streets all I know
So I choose to be TRU that's the way that I feel
You either love me or hate me cause I'm keeping it real

[C-Murder]
Say brah why don't you rap, just like a tree a need you
You know that G don't like me he's a dog you oblite me
Quit tugging on my sleeve, just like it's all good
See me I'm from the hood I'm never gone change it's all good
Papa didn't raise me, mama didn't care for me
I never left the streets my niggas they was there for me
A bastard child, no future, no hope
The streets took me in so I bubble up the dope
I'm not radio friendly, I guess it's not in me
I hate Officer Friendly, my charges still pending
It's me against the world, confessions to my girl
Ghetto pussy's quite tempting forgive me for gimping
I'm not Simon, ain't nothing bout me simple
I'll bust you like a a pimple, ain't tripping on your kin folk
I wish everybody in the world could be like me
It's T-R-U and Kevin Miller, rest in peace

[Chorus - 2x]

[Keala]
The ghetto made me famous, which way should I go
Wanna do the right thing but the streets all I know
So I choose to be TRU that's the way that I feel
You either love me or hate me cause I'm keeping it real

[C-Murder]
Now let me tell a little story bout this boy named C
A poor breaded child from the C-P-3
And then one day, got the powder from these dudes
And then he found out it could bubble up too

(talking)
Now that's how the hustle game started you heard me
Yeah, slang or rap, like that, and then I flipped it
And went to the rap game, you heard me
That's what I'm doing now
It's either this or that, slang or rap
Understand, love me or hate me, ain't no in between
TRU Records respect us Deadly Soundz forever
Nigga, yeah, yeah, peace out</pre>
