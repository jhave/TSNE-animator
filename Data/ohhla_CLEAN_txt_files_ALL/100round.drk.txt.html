[Chorus]
That street shit, I want it now I'm out here (why they ain't around)
They snatched me I can't make a sound
I just bought a chopper with 100 rounds
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
I just bought a chopper with 100 round

[Verse 1]
I Just bought a chopper, gave it to Numbanine
Living up in traffic that's the 1 to 9
I catch an opp on traffic I'm gonna gun him down
Posted up on normal on the summer time
My block my block, you an opp, you get shot
That drum beating like chop
So get back or get that
Now run up on me and get wacked, in other words get stretched
And if Durk is here he's gonna catch
Headshot, fuck a vest that'll traumatize him more
Shout out to them O-boys, niggas snitching like ole boy
Niggas ain't say shit, that family shit ain't mean shit
If you snitch, then you get stiched
That family shit ain't mean shit
If you snitch, then you get stiched

[Chorus]
That street shit, I want it now I'm out here (why they ain't around)
They snatched me I can't make a sound
I just bought a chopper with 100 rounds
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
I just bought a chopper with 100 round

[Verse 2]
Free my nigga mikey, he got bumped for murder
Niggas paranoid and bro ain't even worried
Judge on his dick, so he used the jury
I just hope they don't throw him the juror's life
Drama shit I finish a lot of shit, savage shit, poker face
See a stain, I'm all in OTF we all win, niggas say we ballin
Got them mad, got them niggas hating, got them frauding
That drug money, I need it now
I got these niggas mad, I'm around That drug money
I need it now, I got these niggas mad, I'm around (let's get it)

[Chorus]
That street shit, I want it now I'm out here (why they ain't around)
They snatched me I can't make a sound
I just bought a chopper with 100 rounds
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
That's why my niggas going bananas (that's why my niggas going crazy)
