[Intro: Bizzy]
My first, my first Briana
I named her after me and shit
Send shouts out to my family
Y'knowmsayin, my daughter Briana
If I never see you again baby, we gon' do it

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And I must fess up if I mess up, babe I want you back
B my daughter, get the babies, move the fam attack
And if we never see each other 'member you are the best
I'm still wit'chu, remember me, don't stress
If I mess up, I gotta fess up, boo I want you back
B my daughter, get the babies and the fam attack
And if we never see each other 'member you are the best
I still love you, I still love you

[Bizzy Bone]
If I had you in my arms and we had money to spare
I'll take you anywhere, ev-erywhere, it don't matter I don't care
You better do what'chu gotta do, you're freedom is so precious
Kisses and hugs and love, my beauty, you're excellence
Manifested in perfection, I can't say no more
Have fun for me baby, slammin Maybach doors
They broke my jaw in the club, Billy nursed me to health
She more than a friend, she showed me that I wasn't by myself
And I been broke, Keith blessed me with paper to go get fed
A hot meal and a bag of weed, plus some liquor with nothin said
Never asked me for the money back, my love I thank you
I'm very grateful when I'm lonely and I know that God loves me
Reminiscin on the good times, the best was good times
So misunderstood times, good times
And these are so misunderstood rhymes, woodgrain, get it on
And when I'm not in the battlefield you know that I still get it on
Evaluations wanna vision you and never rejoicin
Baby I love you, everything that I can muster, uhh
Evaluations wanna vision you and never rejoicin
Baby I love you with everything, no choices

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I scoop you up, up in the limo with a bottle full of Bacardi
12-pack of Bud Light, bumpin "Let Me Feel Your Body"
The whisk for the moment as the driver say "Where
are we goin, round the city? Roll the weed, I don't care"
We'll be feelin 'em, so in love with me, and yes the feelin is mutual
As I ride pass the graveyard, reminiscin over the funeral
My brother is here in spirit, made his peace with the Lord
You can ask Ninja when it happened, Capo loved the Lord
I put 'Pac on, all rap music we bumpin
Baby lookin at me chillin, she feelin me, makin a million
Pass the cup into my girl and Brandy, I mean Britney
Kinda tipsy on the backseat in the Lincoln stretch fizzy
I still love you boo, still true to the affection
Never abandon this protection, the fuckin direction
I still love you boo, still true to the affection
Never abandon my protection, the focus in yo' direction; what

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
We at the road, still chillin, watchin movies and we smokin
Baby she lookin so beautiful, "You comfortable?" "Boo, you know it"
was the answer that she gave me as we finished the spinach
Cause dinner at Ruth Chris, let's get drunk for the reel spinnin
Fi-let mig-non, big lobster, champagne was Dom
We need some Cristal, won't get it for now, let's get it on
And we kissin at the table as the patrons sip Patron
One patron told us go get a room, and go home
500 dollars on the table, we half-naked
Makin out, tearin our clothes off, the limo get to shakin
Better save it for the room, I can't wait no more
With the slow jam of "Secret Lovers" playin at the door
The star shinin so bright, they watchin from afar
You're a shinin star, forever and ever you are
We at the corner, I guess it's just like Ike and Tina
Clothes messed up, bra on backwards, I gotta see her, gotta see her

[Chorus]</pre>
