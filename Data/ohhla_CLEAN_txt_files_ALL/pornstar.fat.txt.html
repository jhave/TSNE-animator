[Chorus: Lil' Kim] + (Fat Joe)
My lips is thick, my hips is curvy
My body's sick, I like it dirty
Work it baby (uhh) work it baby (uhh)
Work it baby (uhh) hurt me baby
(I got you moanin, like a porn star)
(I'm all in, I goes hard)
(Work it baby) uhh (work it baby) UHH
(Work it baby) UHH! (Hurt me baby)

[Fat Joe]
I never seen a ass like that
No I never seen a ass so fat, tat-ta-tat UHHH
I'ma beat it 'til tomorrow
And all I keep tellin her is shut up bitch, swallow
Your legs is shakin, I won't hurt'cha
Now you can be the star of that milk commercial
Wipe your lips (uhh) wipe your tits (uhh)
Brace yourself I'm 'bout to hit you with this UHH
Ahh ha ha ha~! I couldn't say it
Cause the radio station, they wouldn't play it
I'm too perverted, I'm 'bout to hurt it
The jury's all in, that pussy's murdered

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Yeah, that right there, I'ma make it hot in here
I'ma do a dance in my freaky wear, looky here
How you want it daddy? Just let mommy know
Bouncin on that thang like hydraulics on a sixty-fo'
I got that juicy juicy, you gon' need a straw
The platinum pussy show a nigga what he trickin for
Skinny short thick and long when I ride that pony
Make it rain and lightning on me, anything I want just buy it for me
Cars and jewelry, I like expensive clothes
My Puerto Rican baby can you pay my house note?
It's that Murder Mami, Lil' Kim the Queen Bee
I got that voyeur baby I'ma make you need me

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
I go hard all in, get deeper and deeper
I beat beat it up, I'm blowin your speakers
.. and I ain't talkin 'bout a tweeter
Puerto Rican to the core, no boricuas eat the krika
Shit, I have you moanin
Fuckin your best friends 'til 6 in the mornin
She kissed a girl, guess what? She like it
Oh that's your girl? Go 'head and wife it
Now fuck her I did, I went and piped it
Put her on that video where evr'-you all invited
Fuck faces expressions get me excited
That pussy make me work, I don't need a diet
