Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All I hear is bitches ain't shit
All men are liars
You can only trust yourself
I know that weed is fire!
It can't last forever
True love died in '96
There is nothing left now
Replace hearts with business
Damn well...
What I'm meaning to seems I,
Think I met someone
But he ain't really my type shiiit
He only 21
His fingers do the talking
Where he's from, will be his coffin
Every time this homeboy drive me 'round think I might die on slauson
But,
I still wanna keep him, cook him breakfast in the mornings
We haven't even kissed yet
But that just make me want him more
Plus he love his mama yep
He a family man
And even though the ratchets love him,
I still think he a gentleman
Oh oh oh
Life's a trip and baby you the plane
And I'm just trynna get a seat next to you to stay
Put his fear in his nose
Why he do that? I don't know
I lost a couple friends to that
So I hope he is in control
Every time he swear he gonna stop
But I know that he won't wish
I could be the only angel he need to be strong
This, could be dangerous
Man I got a lot at stake
I ain't even graduate
So I don't have room for mistakes
No oh oh oh
Life's a trip and baby you the plane
I'm just trynna get a seat next to you to stay
Yes I am, yes I would.
When? For good? For you? For ever!
All my friends think that I'm crazy
They tell me I could do better
Fuck all that, boo
It's you that I'm trying to get to heaven with
They say that you're a hindrance
But I think that you genuinence

They say he's no item. Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em! '
But I don't give a fuck if my friends don't like him
I don't give a f...

They say he's no item. Please don't like him.
