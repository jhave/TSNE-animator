[Eminem]
Girl you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words
{*babbles*} My mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge, never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call a cause to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
{*tires peel out*} Thought I was pimpin, 'til I felt like Nas the first
date cause I think +I Gave You Power+, when I gave you flowers
in a vase, a box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
{*ding dong*} Probably should've never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should've been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her
Cause nobody's body's awesomer
I lust her and she loves me cause I'm popular
But you know this ain't love

[Chorus: Jamie N Commons] + (Eminem)
You know this ain't love - ohh no!
You know this ain't love
You know this ain't love - ohhhh no
You know this ain't love (what is it then?)
It's desperation! (She's lookin for Mr. Right)
Hey! (Wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation! (I can't even put up a fight)
Hey! (Cause I give in at the sight of her - and here I go again)

[Eminem]
You were obviously oblivious to me, I
swore I was just invisible to you 'til I went to the lengths I did to meet ya
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning now I'm in disbelief I
never knew that this could be such misery, ah!
Cause now you see nothing but me and
I don't see nothing but you and I'm about to flip cause we are
super-glued in! We stuck to, each other's hips and we can't
do anything individually which is to cling on, scared to be a-
-lone, can't specifically de-scribe it, I just can't seem to give a reason
that's definitive, just need ya, talkin 'bout "I live and breathe ya"
And you pretend to be as mentally and 
physically addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither
Bitch put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek cause
This ain't love

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else, ah
"What the fuck you whispering for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick I think our, relationship it seems to
be on the fritz, I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think you need to
finish developing a little more mentally too
Get the picture?" That's a negative Alicia
I will never give the +Keys+ up to the crib ever again, no Visa
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's, ya
better have an epiphany slut, guess what? What? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to disco-
-ver you were usin me for loot like I used you for looks, hoe thought you was too good for me, huh?
Yeah, toots used to be my, Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin you, I'm not coming back
She said "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
Steel toe, it would've put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights

[Chorus]

[Jamie N Commons]
It's desperation!
