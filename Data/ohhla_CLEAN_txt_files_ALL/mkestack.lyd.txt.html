[Lloyd Banks]
Too much thinkin, on top of that I'm gettin high and drinkin
I'm floatin, on cloud 9 watchin these niggaz sinkin
No blinkin, you blink too much you lose yo' turn
Sleep is the cousin of death, you might as well pick yo' urn
I been talkin my intentions, now it's time to go and do it
Take you where I come from, that influence on my music
Ain't no U-turns on this path, think before you choose it
Hold this autograph, come get your cash and try to use it
I came here unexpected, I wan' leave a legend
Brought up in this hell, I wan' breathe in heaven
I swear I feel I hear my niggaz laughin when I'm ballin
Woke up this mornin, the weed and alcohol callin
Livin the life of a mack, kickin them hoes out often
Ask 'em when they comin back, knowin that they done lost 'em
Hit them bitches from the back, I ain't with all the talkin
Don't be blowin at my jack - flatline on that cat

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Let's get this money, then let's make it stack
Then let's make history, cause they can't take that back
Back to ballin and spendin, runnin up in these women
Got a bitch out the movie, take a look how I'm livin
And do you know what it took? I'll take you back down that road
Before the riches and bitches, and the platinum and gold
I got it all from the work, no contract on my soul
I don't ball up and down, I bomb back on them hoes

[A$AP Rocky]
I'm tryin to buy my soul from Satan, I can't keep up with payments
Strange writings on the wall got me feeling like a caveman
Call that shit the days end, life is so degradin
But to my last statement I'll keep prayin 'til it's amen
Top is where I'm aimin, left the way I came in
I'ma keep on ravin 'til them Islands is the Cayman
And my bitch from Mexico, she don't know she next to go
Suit yo'self and screw yo'self, shoot yo'self - Plaxico
Bang, bang; thought you were a giant?
Couldn't hear the mornings but I bet you hear them sirens
First I close my eyelids, now everything is quiet
I could go out in silence but I would prefer the riot
I catch the first star with my fist raised, Versace shades, my French braids
Had six chains since sixth grade, safe to say that we been slaved
These niggaz try and shoot me, these crackers try and sue me
Wake up to yo' favorite actresses, my life is like a movie, boy!

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
Heat up in the winter so I'm cooler come the summer
We out here, gamble in Aruba money sucker
P.Y.T. and all way up to cougar, I'ma crush her
And I always been a rebel, never been a cuffer
You just talk it, you don't does it, so all those who suffer
You so humble out in public, computer make you tougher
I got Rosé by the bottle, bitches by the carload
Six or seven new ones, I'm switchin up tomorrow
Bitch I sleep in the Apollo, I'm always on stage
I should take my show to Broadway cause that hallway like a grave
Can't no bitch get in my mind, so I know it's physical
I kick out the dimes, I think I'm invincible
I climb to the top, now I'm pissin off the pinnacle
I pray to God that I get rich, gettin money spiritual
Diamond in my physicals, that's why I'ma stand out
You don't got your hand in, you just got your hand out, so

[Chorus]

[Lloyd Banks]
I bomb back on them hoes {*4X*}</pre>
