[Intro: Hue Hefna]
Uh-huh, yeah, Hue Hefna
Caniven, Shyheim I see you, nigga
Staten Island, joop, Staten Island

[Hue Hefna]
Pow, what a runner up, pow, with ya gunners up
Gun jammed, when he shoot, it sound like a muffler
Whole block covered up, nigga, what's the verdict?
Can my lawyer know statments, couple thou' for the cover up
Hue Hef, baby, make these ladies get they buns up
I'm somewhat superfly, pimping got my funds up
Gotta be the cane or the Jag
Like "Listen, chick, I'm the shit, just sit, like a lot of meat bags"
I hit the strip, for the flip, got Monopoly bags
Now listen, prick, so sick, you still copping them halves
Long dick, just lips, no cock in the ass
Ya baby mama, still popping that ass, but that's different story
Get the picture for me, make you visit pergatory
Workers'll be working for me, but that's a different story
They cock-blocking my fetti
I kill the streets cuz I ain't trying to do Life like Martin and Eddie, nigga

[Caniven]
Damn, it feel good to come up, rip big eighths
Every other day, I get off at half a K
Cambridge niggaz say I remind 'em of J
How I'm stuck in my hustling ways
Everything custom-made cuz customers pay
I ain't sell to a fiend in a whole year
Anything nickel, got my work, is out there
Either, under his building, or O.T. building
Stamp my dope Toyota, oh what a feeling
Flow gritty like the, coke spot ceiling
My how I've grown, I talk greezy, like the wall, that's in back of the stove
I'm a pimp and a hustler, what's fucking with that?
Use a throne as a slingshot, picture my crack
The outfits so hot, I could leave it on the corner
With numbers 'ttached to it and the bitches gon' call us
I'm always in my kitchen, cooking something
I cook so much, they call me stove top stuffing
My whole hood real, we give dap with the right boot
Everything's direct, see my hands don't move

[Shyheim]
Ghetto philosophy, that's what I write
Shit's been fucked up, I ain't lucked up my whole life
So I eat off the street, just like possums do
Niggaz watch my moves and say "Ooh" like I'm shooting hoops
Call me M-16 Shyheim, I cut more niggaz than a coach of a basketball team
Enemy, all sexy see-through lace
Short pussy, you should walk with a thong on ya face
I don't play games, I make niggaz ashes in a vase
Nowadays, niggaz wanna Malcolm X me on the stage
Let's blaze like haze, but I read and comprehend like words on a page,
I don't play

[IMF Blue Steele]
I break jaws, take phones up off of the waist
When I draw, I make sure it all hit ya face
I ate more, since that cake came up off of ya plate
Now all I need is my ice and cream, and I don't like gleam
But I still look nice in rings, watches and bracelets
Look, watches The Matrix
When I falls in the air, you gon' pause in the air
Alley oop, nigga, catch 'em all in the air
Now re-coup, niggaz, catching all of the air
Flying past your way, flying past your pit
"That ain't my girl", ya lying, nigga, cuz that's yo' chick
I grabbed that quick, switchblade on yo' ass
Soon that Mag'll go click-click-bang on ya ass
Cuz I move, slow, with the poked out gat
Cuz you know, po-po know where it go down at
When I throw, I leave four inside that broke down Ac
And now you acting like you don't know that
I bet you won't go back to that block, where I stopped and hit up
Popped ya whip up, pop holes in ya Aqua VW
Nigga, do you really understand?
Hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes or volcanoes
Couldn't match my destruction, I clap by the dozen
The clip, spits, when it's attached to the oven
Get trapped in the dungeons where the snakes just play... haha...</pre>
