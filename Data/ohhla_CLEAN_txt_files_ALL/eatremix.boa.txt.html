[DJ Montay]
Yeah
One time, it's your boy, DJ Montay, right
I'm a hook up with my girl, BoA
Flo-Rida
We're ready to do this for all my ladies
Let's get it

Hook 1: DJ Montay
Now, all my single ladies
Now get your hands up
Now, all my single ladies
Now get your hands up
Now, all my single ladies
Now get your hands up
Now, all my single ladies
Now get your hands up
Come on

[Rap Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Shawty got her eyes on me, (???) my swag
A full of attention, I got her, she think I'm a doggy dag
All over me like grub
Plenty food for thought
It's like dinner between us
Want a taste of the boss
Say, little mama, it's all love
So I can be your man
You invite some of your friends through
I'm a ready to get loose
Don't chase on my grey goose
Just what I relate to
Straight up out the gate, boo
Icin' on the cake, girl

[BoA]
(Verse 1)
When I first saw you, I knew
Nothing like it's used to be
Boy, you have to got to be
The finest thing in history (Oh)
The way I feel inside is
Just so hard to understand
You feed my appetite
In ways I can't explain

Chorus: BoA
I'll eat you up
Your, love
Your, love
I'll eat you up
Your, love
Your, love
Whoa-oh, oh, oh

Hook 2: BoA
I'll eat you up
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
So yum, yum
Whoa-oh, oh, oh
Can't get enough
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I think I'm in love

(Verse 2)
If you move any closer
Boy, there is no guarantee
What I will do to you
I feel it, and it's scaring me
Like I've become some kind of demon in the night
You look so tasty, I could eat you up alive

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook 2

[BoA]
I'll eat you up

[Rap Verse 2: Flo Rida]
You really wanna get next to me, come on, baby
Introduce you to ecstacy, that's what I'm on, lady
That's all
Game you sellin' me, gettin' that on a jelly
I gotta thank for you, girl, ain't no problem, I be your belly
She hot
Than the matter, I give her the full platter
Got her mad, it don't matter, Flo-Rida ain't tryin' to trap ya
You're just what I like, I'm a feed your appetite
Get you right for the night, I ain't trippin', take a bite, girl

Bridge: BoA
Can't stop thinking 'bout the
Things I wanna do to you
You move any closer
You've been asking for it, too
I want your love
I need your touch
So much, I
Think I'm in love

Repeat Hook 1

Repeat Hook 2

[BoA]
I wanna take you to
My room
I'll eat you up
Wanna take you to
My room
Whoa-oh, oh, oh

Repeat Hook 2

Repeat Hook 1

[BoA]
I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up
I'll eat you up</pre>
