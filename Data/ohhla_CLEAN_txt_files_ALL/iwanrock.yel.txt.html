Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's your Yelawolf partner catfish bizzle got these ho's poppin
Poppin up like an echo
Keep them gassed up yeah I'm pumping them with the petrol nickle bag dippin
I'll meet ya down at the Citgo yeah I sell a little
yeah that's how I lick em yeah that's what I give them
yeah that's how I sick em throwing a hot potatoe 
hese hot potatoes I ship em from a bucket
I lift them these home fries I hit em
ketch up you hungry then you better lick em
you wanna see a cracker up close there's a picked one 
peaking of a picked one we get up crunk way it up
freestyles bitch I can make a ton rappers like football
it's a tricky punt but kick it up crimson tides already won bistro
I'm a deadly gun rat rat rat pussy boy you a ready cunt
don't make me reach for my machette son I cut students cut
two bucks like I was Jackie Chan or Jackie chane
pull back and bang I'm droppin change
with a hand full of thoughts like I had a second brain
so go head and take a crack at Wayne
it won't drop that's a gun shot and you lack at aim
from the back of the train to the caboose ya pull em out the game
fuck bits I pull em out of the strange
fuck it I pull them out of there lane now your playing chicken
with a hot rod oh my god I went with a metal frame
faggots you need a training bra just look at how your titties hang
I'm a grown man I just let my nuts swang bust another tootha
hh that's another hockey puck slang how you get ice in alabama
man cause I'm the fucking truth
god bitch I freeze anything refrigerator parry is back again
spread grey pupone all over your fucking cellophane
I'm serving yellow like the dope man figure this motherfucker like cold train
middle finger thumb hear my pain when the horns blow
it's like a porn show I'm butt naked hip hop will never be the same</pre>
