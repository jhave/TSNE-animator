[SPM]       Que onda Frost, how you been, homeboy
[Kid Frost] Hey, what's up, dawg
[SPM]       Check it out, man, I want you to meet my number one soldado, Low G
[Kid Frost] Hey, Low G, where you from, holmes

[Verse 1: Low G]
Mi querida
Centro America
Aqui en Houston, ganando mi feria
En la esquina, la vida es fina
Le pido a Dios que me cuida a mi nina
Mira
Mi jale es la calle
Vendiendo libras que vienen del valle
Si mi madre
Me entendiera
Mi familia va primera
Mi bandera
Era mi guerra
It's whatever
Bustin' on cualquiera
Quiero, que sepas, que yo soy la muerte
Si te escapas, sera pura suerte

Chorus: South Park Mexican
Capish
Understand the touch
Let a G show you how to turn a man to dust
L.A. to Nueva York, que es puro amor
For all who got love for el jugador
Houston
To Nuevo Leon
Three bandidos on the microphone
Strike with chrome
True crime family
Enemies pay
Never die happily

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
Assault rifles, professional snipers
You got my rival shittin' in they diapers
You don't like us, cool, but don't show it
Who wanna fuck with this killer, slash poet
I blow it up
Like nitroglycerin
You bitches love talkin' out a pot you pissin' in
Chill, holmes
Cause you ain't that hard
Fraud
Flossin' in your own backyard
I'm worldwide, in the two tone pone ride
Your girl hide in my seat when you pass by
That's my life
Hater, heartbreaker
Life taker, smile now, cry later

{*phone rings*}
[SPM]       Dope House Records
[Kid Frost] Man, what up, Los
            What's up with my bitch Snow White
[SPM]       She's goin' for thirteen five
[Kid Frost] Cool, let's start with fifty then

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I'm in the sport, where we import, what you snort
Leaving court, goin' straight, to the airport
I don't chase paper
Paper chase me
Fez math, on the side, how I brake free
Take heed
To the rough neck tactics
I got you putos screaming worse than an actress
In a horror flick
He owe me for a brick
In this busi'
You better be rollin' thick
Holdin' shit down
Son, ain't no seein' us
My nina bust
Another human being crushed
Street genious, so, so serious
You're fearin' this
Deadly experience

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican]
Capish
