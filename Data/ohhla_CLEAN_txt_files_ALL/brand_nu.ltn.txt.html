[Refrain]
It´s a brand nu´ playa comin´ to town
So turn the babies [???] in a [???], mayn
The message is clear, let´s get down
It´s a brand nu´ playa comin´ to town

[Verse 1] Baby Beesh:
Now it´s about to be on, it´s about to be on
Chicano like a motherfucker, chop in you dome
I´m curvin´ off the Hennessey and I pull off that weed
I´m strikin´ through this motherfucker loaded and keyed
Laced up tight, now what you know about - that?
I come in peace, but now the hammers´ still cought back
Baby Beesh, can you like that tree?
When everybody wanna smoke with me?

[Verse 2] Jay Tee:
Now when I step up on the scene, you know I´m whipped and g´d up
Playa Jay Tee be gett´n ripped ´n keyed up
To turn you beat up, and let me find the hoe
Three cops, some indo´, and grind some mo´
Then go to Liquor store, no need to ride foo´
´Couse we gon´ parkin´-lot pimpin´ till they slide trough
I´m in that light brown prown with the kicks to match
And be the first young hustla to bomb a batch

[Refrain] 2x

[Verse 3] Jay Tee:
Now I´ma sellin´ game for whoever got some bread on he
and bomb that brogous, as long as she got some head on me
I´m sittin´ fat on it, at all the time that I will pimp it
Lookin´ just like my daddy, though without the limpin´
I would be simpin´, but never meet a salamanasier [
