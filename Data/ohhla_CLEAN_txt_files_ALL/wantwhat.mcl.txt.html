[Missy]
I can rock a party with a glass of Hennessey
I know I make yall sick with the way I boogie
My fake ass friends wanna hang out tonight
Ill tell em follow me then Ill ditch em at the light
I see em at the club, they wanna know why Im whilin
Cause I smoke weed now Im high like a pilot
Spendin more cheese than you throw on a salad
Hand me my mike, if you bout it, then Im bout it

[MC Lyte]
Mmmm, yea Im bout it
Dont doubt it, dont doubt it
Im the MC Lyte boo but please dont crowd me
Cause my security might get rowdy
Make em punch you out and watch your vision go cloudy
Now all you freaks wanna speak cuz Im back
Stick to your gossip like the glue to your tracks
I never liked your ass, by the way, cuz youre wack
Give a dog a bone so heres a Lyte snack

[Mocha - CHORUS]
Yo yo (yo) want what i got
Come through then
You at home wit a safe you aint got nothin in
Ask how I got it and keep it comin in
&gt;From hustlin, doublin and publishin (publishin)
Want what I got
Come through then
You at home wit a safe you aint got nothin in (nothin in)
Ask how I got it and keep it comin in
&gt;From hustlin, doublin and publishin

[MC Lyte - Verse Two]
Used to be a rookie singin Latti Datti
Now me and Missy beco-rockin the party
Flooded Movado aint I fly though
Never let em see you comin, thats my motto
Im on it, Im on it, I had the nigga goin
Said I was hot tomali, mind blowin
Its crucial, how some folks get bourgeois
Or bourgeois, did I lose you or did you lose me
Either way we miles apart
Im hittin the ribbon, you at the start
Im never, ever, ever, gonna let you think
That your shit dont stink
So dont come around here thinkin you cant get it
Youll be the first to admit it
How you got punked by hip-hops greatest
Missy and Lyte bringin you the latest, yo yo

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Missy]
I treat niggas like they my hoe
Blaze em then I go
Straight to the Nikko
Meet another Puerto Rico
Cute like tico
Copy me like kinko
You know Ima freak, yo
I dont love them amigos
Im straight to their pockets
Bow all their sockets
Im plush like carpet
They wanna stick the target
I dont give a fuck what you rock
Cuz you see what I got, want what I got

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Mocha]
Want what I got

[Repeat CHORUS]</pre>
