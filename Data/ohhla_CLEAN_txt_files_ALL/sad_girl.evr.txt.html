I seen her at a stop light on Alverano
Was sittin' in a pearl white Eldorado
In a gangsta lean she were revvin' the throttle
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano
She looked like Selena, the truth couldn't be plainer
She like a gangsta boogie, her mama calls her cookie

My friends call her a sad girl cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea

Sad girl living on the east side of the city
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

I seen her at the market she was pushing a stroller
Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder
She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil
She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel

She's a sad girl, cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea

Sad girl living on the east side of the city
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

Hey sad girl, we can take this slow
Baby what you lookin' for, let me know
You say you want a man that can give you some dough
You say buy my babyshoes and buy him a coat
And buy my baby food to put down his throat
I won't play you like a ho, it ain't like that yo
Let me holler at you later, we can go to the show
I ain't tryna rock the boat, I'm tryna keep you afloat

I seen her at the post office mailing a letter
She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater
She's talking on the pay phone and something upset her
I really wanna hold her but I only just met her
But I could tell she'd been crying, she said she felt like dying
She never been so alone no, she gotta make it on her own though

She's a sad girl, cause her man went away
And he ain't never coming back

Sad girl living on the east side of the city
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity
Sad girl got no one to rely on
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on</pre>
