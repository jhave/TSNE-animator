hook x4
Push 'em off, push 'em off in here

Chorus x10
Push 'em off, tear it up
Push 'em off in here

(Lord Infamous)
You better back up off this
We got custom made coffins
I got a bird restin' on my desk
Up in my office
I gotta make it babe
Miss rate me
Make you niggas hate me
Im goin' flossin' through these last days
My life is crazy
You call the army, the marines
You better call the navy
It's Kaiser Sosate from the thugs
And we were nominated
Because the nigga take his slaves
Up in the home of the great
We gonna push the magic button
Don't nobody behave
So get buck, get boogie, get wild, get naughty
We the thugs out of hell
And he sent us to party
Lord Infamous plus the Three 6 are pumpin in my blood
Tear this one
Keepin' me sober
Tearin' at the clubs
Kickin' tables, knockin' over chairs, gloves in the air
Sexy darears checkin' everywhere (?)
Off on the scrilla grind
So I gotta lose my mind
Tear Da Club Up Thugs
Ghetto love till the end of time

Chorus x10

(DJ Paul)
I'm finally busta free
&gt;From my enemies, nigga please
Got my cheese lucky from Tennessee, Hennessy
I be need only real, feel me
Busta bust until he bleed
(??) if you hear me
Holla if you hear me
Call you boys get your crew
what you wanna do
Dial in, I wizon wizon better get your gizon
Gizon is always fizon
Fizon is still wizon
Wizon all the women
Diss on, diss on
Now picture me wrong
Up behind you
Where'd I find you
With a 40 cal.
Like the silent style
On my way now to Rodmans house
Never happy, keep on rappin'
Got you hot, on the dot
In the beer boy
Set up scores
Plus our record spots
Catch me not, indy pot
Big away your stash pot
Got me gun, in me crotch
Burnin' cause the barrels hot
Ratta tatta tatta tatta tatta tatta boom
To the (??) no winnin'
Since I do rule, boy

Chorus x10

(Juicy "J")
I'm about to elbow a nigga, elbow a nigga
Cock the gun and pull back the trigger, pull back the trigger
Meetiing in the parking lot
I always wear mouth a lot
We can go toe to toe
To the floor, on the spot
Hope this spot is well standed
Left and right is how I panic
With a chrome anna canon
Peepin' game and now were standin'
Only land game I hated
Jealous cause we clockin' paper
Plus I used to hack
And now I'm ridin' fool, I'll see you later
Now I see you muggin' in my face
When I'm ridin' up
Say you saw the late nite video and tear da club up
Hopin' and wishin'
That the mafia is finished
Ho yeah know
We was in it to win it
And to you dirty freaks, paperchasin'
Now you on that jock
We don't want the blunts
that you lacin', that be gettin' you high
But I got a knife in my pocket
Would I roll it on
Let the steam
About to cut ya
Get a hustle
Get ya own, fool

Chorus x10

(repeats till end)
Push 'em off x8
Tear it up x8</pre>
