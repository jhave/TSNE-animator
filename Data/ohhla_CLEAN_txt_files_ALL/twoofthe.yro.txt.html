[Yung Ro]
And a one and a two and a three, nobody!
Who fuckin' with us in this motherfucker, nobody!
We young and focused, determined and thick
We got our mind right money right, we running this bitch
Yung ro nobody, think about don't do it
This is not just music, cause look theres nothing to it
How I talk about my structure, how I punish motherfuckers
Punchin' lines without no knuckles, cock back-

[Yung Ro]
And a one and a two and a three, nobody!
Who fuckin' with us in this motherfucker, nobody!
We young and focused, determined and thick
We got our mind right money right, we running this bitch
Yung ro nobody, think about don't do it
This is not just music, cause look theres nothing to it
How I talk about my structure, how I punish motherfuckers
Punchin' lines without no knuckles, cock back blucka blucka
Gyeah, and I'm just getting started, but I'm struggling the hardest
So I'm hustling the hardest
You think I won't, but I can and would
Fuck a beat, mac say I can rap and make the wind sound good
Now let me explain why I'm the hardest dog
I never sleep, sometimes but hardly naw-
Now let me explain why I'm the hardest dog
I never sleep, sometimes but hardly naw-
Now let me explain why I'm the hardest dog
I never sleep, sometimes but hardly naw
And I don't waste no time chilling with shawty gaw
I go get this cash, and you go party girl
I'm tryna rock some re-runs of marty mob
But boys playing games with me, oh lawdy lord
Marcus pop that daddy, and just record it dog
Now I'm seeing why Jigga laugh, nigga hawdy haw
Other teams are nice, but nigga are's is hard
We spit it all, from pain, street shit, to cars and brauds
Pausin' star, homie focus just listen
Now I'm about to teach and define Paid In Full edition
Two plus One, and later on another one
Paul Wall, Koopa, Fifty and your's truly yung yung
Dumb dumb, boy! I'm in it to prove
I race the clock and pass it up, every minute it move
I'm that young nobody, with a venomous crew
Get the mic hot make ?? C put a bent in the booth
Me and Twin get high, and show you what menaces do
Then you got Koopa to deal with, when we finished with you
Lil E put ten in a dude, he put ten and he cool
He a fag, a coward, a man who's feminin ooh
And any of them dudes, that give me the clues
They fixing to move, I merk 'em on site (pow!) now give me a coo
I'm skinny and rude, with a semi or two
With plenty of mood- swings, and I pity the fool
Look I'm on remy and goose, the gin and the juice
Henny and woo, stressed on the edge not friendly or cool
Slow daddy! we finished with you
Cocky koopa invest flip cash, and spending it too
We got them swangers and vogues, but we spinning them too
The paint change color four times shine, and blending the tool
Lin is my new, protege on the nobody roster
We the hottest niggaz out, and got a lot to offer
You got plex you better think boy, and pipe pipe dine
Fuck with Ro I play it cool, and wipe boys dine
Won't hesitate to squeeze the hammer
??? I pack and bake the powder, like arm and hammer
I'm on this bammer weed, in my home in Atlanta
Papperazzis and fast flashing when we on the camera
But on the channel, true you won't ever see me
I reup remain focused, cut throat and flee
I gotta payroll rotation, keep me mob style protected
I got workers watching workers, mob style connected
Me and Twin face to face, mob style reflected
I got a lot of love for niggaz mob style in Texas
Yung Ro nobody, you still ain't convinced
My arms folded hands shaking, and my eyes is squinched
Gyeah, you know who running the game
Paid In Full, them waterboys, Nobody and Color Change

[Slim Thug]
Boss Hogg Outlawz
I represent the Boss Hogg Outlaw gang
We one of the rawest clicks, that ever came in the game
Besides the fame, me and my boys on these streets
Best believe the truth spoke, when we on these beats
All that balling and ice, I really love that life
When people see the boss, they say it must be nice
To have a house that price, drive a car that price
I got four or five dimes, what I want with a wife
I done seen enough green, to pay for both our dreams
And done so much dirt, I can't afford to be clean
I been all around the world, lived fantasies with girls
Got everything I wanted, including diamonds and pearls
It's kind of scary, make a nigga wonder what's next
Is it normal for one kid to be so blessed
I'm impressed by what the lord gave me
And I'm thankful because the lord saved me
And he made me, the man I am
So maybe, that's why I am what I am
So why you other cats, trying to take my position
It's out of ya hands, man keep on wishing
Ask around what the click running the north is
Ask around who the mother fucking big boss is
It's like this, if ya hot ya hot
But on the other hand, if ya not ya not
Nigga
