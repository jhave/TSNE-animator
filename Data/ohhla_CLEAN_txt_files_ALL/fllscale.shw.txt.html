I got some new shit for y'all to flow to
I got some new shit for y'all to rock to
For my niggas in the streets to get the dough to

[A.G]
Check...you think it's sweet cause me make beats, and flow a lot?
Hope ya not, won't heso(tate) to throw a shot
Smoke ya chocs so get low, when we drop
Be spraying a whole block, blazing so hot
C'mon, let em know what's up when we come on
Show &amp; A, so come wrong and get dumped on
Back to these beats though, ayo I'm feeling it
Niggas off the wall, preach stuff and feeling shit
Know exactly what we dealing with
See my team got shorty in the middle, yo they killing it
All night, weed so tight, got me so right
Inhale it and hold it, like I hold mics
Can't afford no strikes, can't stand for life
So give us one, and plus throw mics
Yo, be no slouch, more stripes than half of you know about
We will prevail, Full Scale, no doubt

Chorus:
 This is for all of y'all, and you won't regret
 So pump it in your jeep, the street, so all of y'all can flex
 In the crib and the woofers it's the same effect
 We gonna show you how we do it when great minds connect

[A.G.]
We draw heat when they think it's sweet, and joke a lot
Front on the crabs that front, ya know it's hot
Mad cause the hoes we got, and frozen rock
I gets loot, it's gotta be, the flow is hot
C'mon, let em know it's us when we come on
Show &amp; A, we even shine when the sun is on
I get mine even when I'm being fronted on
One deep, one mind, you could be a hundred strong
Who want it, and get it, like Flight 800
I'm on my own dick, like sleeping in my stomach
Stand when I'm blunted, we can even run it
And pass on more shit than most of you come with
We can go pop and gain nothing from it
Now it's me and you, and you came with a hundred
Go mainstream and get the cream, heavily
That's what you say, but I say, "Never me"
GD repping me, while at shows I set the beat
Shit is still real, Full Scale is the recepie

Chorus

[A.G.]
We in the lab cause we scientists
Rolls attracting hoes we hit the clubs a lotta Chrys
And bottles of Moet for some minor shit
We get naughty, play Danny DeVito and Get Shorty
Flip shorty, nice size and weight
Bet money she's the first thing I see when I wake
So c'mon, let em know what's up when we come on
Show &amp; A, ain't nothing changed but the song
Ya outta your range, but we can still get it on
Full Scale, feeling it real, yo I'm gone

Chorus repeats
