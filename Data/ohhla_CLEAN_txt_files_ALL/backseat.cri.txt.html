Verse 1 (Cristiles):

Uh, it's been a long night comin'
if you thought I was takin' you home, I wasn't
and I can tell you like the sound of that
we both high feelin' like we smoked a pound of that
girl don't lie you've been thinkin' 'bout us doin' thangs
playin' hard to get would be a foolish game
and shit, I'm fantasizin' 'bout you undressin'
but let me ask you one question

Chorus (Dre B):

Have you ever made love in the backseat?
we ain't gotta get a telly we can do it right here
have you ever made love in the backseat?
you can see the windows tinted so you know I don't care
have you ever made love? ever made love? ever made love in the backseat baby
girl let's make love, girls let's make love
girl let's make love in the backseat baby

Verse 2 (Cristiles):

It's rainin', got the car steamin'
I'm tryin' to have the trophy by the time it's off season
believe me, I'ma have a reason
to have that thang numb until you feelin' like it's freezin'
but shit it's all talk, let's skip the conversation
found where I could park 'cause the street is hella vacant
pull up to the curb, switch the music on the station
rollin' up the herb, I can tell you gettin' anxious
lookin' in the mirror and you sprayin' on some fragrance
rearview shakin', every time the bass hits
pull the seats up, then we hop up in the back
we gon' start it off chillin' with you sittin' on my lap
once the blunt starts hittin' nu uh ain't no turnin' back
roll up windows that was cracked, once we finish up with that
then I lay you on your back
now we touchin' and we kissin' and undressin'
it all started with one question

Chorus (Dre B):

Have you ever made love in the backseat?
we ain't gotta get a telly we can do it right here
have you ever made love in the backseat?
you can see the windows tinted so you know I don't care
have you ever made love? ever made love? ever made love in the backseat baby
girl let's make love, girls let's make love
girl let's make love in the backseat baby

Verse 3 (Dre B):

Climb in the back, lean both seats forward
I'm ready to attack but I promise no torture
there ain't much room but we gotta make it work girl
starin' at the moon while I'm lightin' up the purple
ready for me to slide right up inside you
ready for you to ride, I know it's hella tight to
start to get a cramp? we gon' have to try another way
but baby I'll be damned if we have to wait another day

Chorus (Dre B):

Have you ever made love in the backseat?
we ain't gotta get a telly we can do it right here
have you ever made love in the backseat?
you can see the windows tinted so you know I don't care
have you ever made love? ever made love? ever made love in the backseat baby
girl let's make love, girls let's make love
girl let's make love in the backseat baby

Have you ever made love in the backseat?
we ain't gotta get a telly we can do it right here
have you ever made love in the backseat?
you can see the windows tinted so you know I don't care
have you ever made love? ever made love? ever made love in the backseat baby
girl let's make love, girls let's make love
girl let's make love in the backseat baby</pre>
