Yeah, yeah
I see everything
I see everything
YouknowhatI'msayin?
It's like when we come through
You better have your fuckin third eye open
You know, cause thats what time it is
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Cause it's like, when you walk
You striving for perfection
That's what we doing
Understand?
So all that little fake shit out there
We know the science on that
We done seen that shit from, from
From difference of angles
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, yo kid, for real
Wu-Tang, we set off a lot of shit in this shit kid
YouknowhatImean?
But you know, you know us
We play it calm, humble
YouknowhatImean?
But I just be checking out niggaz darts and I be like
Damn, them niggaz, them niggaz is
Really, really, really, really, really
They gonna stay shit!
Uh ha, uh ha ha
YouknowhatImean?
But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller
YouknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggaz, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggaz kid
Certain people rather, certain
Certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggaz fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the
Way it, it should really be seen
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
