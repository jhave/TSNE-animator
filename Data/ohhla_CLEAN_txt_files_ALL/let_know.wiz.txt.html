[Chorus]
Let Em Know

[Verse 1]
It's wiz khalifa and I gotta let the people
How a nigga feel grindin for the bigger doe
Put the city on my back
Princin that's official Yo
Had to let these niggas know
Youngin with a sicker flow
(Whoa) and you knew the name
You can call me who to blame
Forward I do to the game
Fuck it I just do my thing
And I been focused on this rapper
Since the mover came
I make that money come back
Just like a boomerang
You dudes are losers (chings)
Blowers puts a loser change
A black guy such as myself
Come and scoop yo game
The game is up for grabs
And I'm a be the next to winner
Youngin I'm a boss man
All you dudes are
Just beginners
And no soul when the flow is cold
I spit december
You fools closed with no souls
You such pretenders
I come through ya
The young dudes to tough ya tenda
Rostrum records spit a 4 1 2 representer

[Chorus]
Let Em Know
I was made for this
And gotta let the people know (where You from?)
Pittsburgh wiz khalifa bouta bring it home
Is he shakin fools (Yes!)
Is He makin Moves (Yes!)
Whatchu Gonna Do (what)
It's That 4 1 2
Let Em Know
I was made for this
And gotta let the people know (where You from?)

[Verse 2]
I was made for this
Hustled on the paid for this
Now the youngin next
Recieving checks and gettin paid for this
And where I'm from
A lotta niggas on some slavah shit
You know the chains and whips
They get the game and flip
And some niggas get the change and dip
Others get trapped up in the game
And their brain gets split
Even nat whore get knocked
And they man turn bitch
Take the stand and the man turn snitch
This is the land where you gotta keep the grass low
Fuckin snakes love to hate
Never let em stop the doe
Gotta learn to love to hate
Make the moves
I've been on the grind since the early teens
Spittin crack and servin feens
Nuttin but raw 16
And it's too late to start some shit up in here
What you crazy the whole steel city's in here
I got the streets on smash and the with me in here
You whacked up watch how quickly you pear! (what)

[Chorus]
Let Em Know
I was made for this
And gotta let the people know (where You from?)
Pittsburgh wiz khalifa bouta bring it home
Is he shakin fools (Yes!)
Is He makin Moves (Yes!)
Whatchu Gonna Do (what)
It's That 4 1 2
Let Em Know
I was made for this
And gotta let the people know (where You from?)
Pittsburgh wiz khalifa bouta bring it home
Is he shakin fools (Yes!)
Is He makin Moves (Yes!)
Whatchu Gonna Do (what)
It's That 4 1 2</pre>
