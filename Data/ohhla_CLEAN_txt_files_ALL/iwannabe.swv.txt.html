[Missy]
Uhh, uhh
Yo, yo, yo, freeky-freeky
Yo-yo, uhh, S-S W-W V
Uhhhh-huh, ah one-two
Uhh, ya know
Freeky-freeky, uhh, ya know
One, one, uhh, freeky-freeky uh

[Verse One]
Can it be I've stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Verse Two]
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've learned the meaning to your story
And is it not enough for me to stay

[repeat Verse One]

[Chorus]
I wanna be where you are oh
Any where you are oh
I wanna wanna be where you are oh
Everywhere you are oh

[Verse Three]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I will love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus]

I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh

[Chorus] - repeat until end</pre>
