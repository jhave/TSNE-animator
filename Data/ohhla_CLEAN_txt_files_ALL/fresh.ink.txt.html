Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
Fresh, fresh
Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
You know I'm fresh, fresh

Okay baby, outfit crazy
Make a nigga change clubs just like Jay-Z
Eatin' over here, yeah, everything gravy
Alumni rapping, ya'll ball JV
Uh, pass that, she's like a lab rat
New kicks, new chick, I won't ever back track
Eyes on me, got me staying like what's that
Feeling like the shit, put a finger to your moustache
Okay baby, outfit crazy, see you running out, I got a bush like Grady
Self named nigga, so you can never make me
I don't need a style every time you see me

Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
Fresh, fresh
Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
You know I'm fresh, fresh

Okay baby, outfit crazy, I don't do much, make you niggas look lazy
Take a picture then frame it like Banksy
On the blind side wearing everything you ain't seen
Ball like 2k, close the passport, straight from the UK
Gucci tax free, Louie V tax free, where they do that at, swear you niggas tacky
Okay baby, outfit crazy, even in the dark its clear in HD
Flyest nigga running through the city like it's safe
Need a pair of wings, 'cause every time you see me I'm

Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
Fresh, fresh
Okay baby, outfit crazy, outfit crazy, outfit crazy
You know I'm fresh, fresh</pre>
