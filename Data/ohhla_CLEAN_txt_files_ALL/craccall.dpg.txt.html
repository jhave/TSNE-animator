[Verse 1: Daz Dillinger]
The party jumpin', jumpin', jumpin'
The place packed
(???) 'round here, don't know how to act, act
We buy alcohol, nigga, buy the racks
We balled out, spendin' shit by the stacks
Can I get a hey (HEY!)
Can I get a ho (HO!)
Dogg Pound Gangstas and Bad Boy
Here we go
We bustin' heads with a Moet bottle {*glass break*}
Strike the ass out
Me and my niggas go full-throttle
Cause 'Cris naked
So we 'bout
To get it started
Get it, Dogg Pound nigga, we 'bout, to get retarded
And we comin' with them bangin' beats, (???) and dumpin'
Cause everybody know that DPGC, Bad Boy niggas run this

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
What they know about some gangsta shit
Bang some shit
Scrappin' lane to lane, some shit
Explain some shit
You on the strip, wind shit
Explain this, dick
When did you come in the shit
The ten in shit
Fifth and the ten-inch clips
I been in this shit
Been sinnin' shit, in and shit
We'll end the shit
Started, begin the shit
Horrendous shit
Stretch and bend the shit
When you attended, what the fuck did you intended, shit
From attendin' ship, been doin' this since ten and shit
Cock back and spin this shit, relentless bitch
And I'm a jack you and your heartless relentless bitch

Repeat Chorus

(Diddy in background)
[Snoop Dogg] Big motherfuckin' Snoop Dogg, I'm pimpin'

             Fat-mouth the Dogg and I'm straight up the heart
[Diddy]      Now everybody know that California and New York, we rockin'
             Never ever try to run up on us, cowards, you don't want it
             All the chickenheads scream where they hear "It's Diddy" (They know my name)
             Twenty thousand dollar jeans, when I chill with 50
[Snoop Dogg] I got the gangsta party crackin' in the back, in fact
             I got them dub sacs to highlight ya whole night
             Doggy Dogg is a hog, and a boss, and a gangsta
             Gangsta groove and rich, rollin' a cube, and boss up, nigga
