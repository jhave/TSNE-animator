Song:   Extraordinary
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Your so extraordinary [x3]
Somethings who's got a hold on me
Your so extraordinary
Somethings who's got a hold on me
If this feeling has emotion
Someone who's got a hold on me

[Verse 1]
Rumble anyday nigga pick a date
I'm feeling great, I don't walk I just levitate
I come from the bottom of the slum village
Where niggas make a name for being young killers
I hate the game and all the bullshit that come with it
Sometimes I wanna get the money and be done with it
But right now I'm feeling better than the usual
Flow so ugly make my bank account beautiful
They call me Gudda nigga who is you
Bedrocking every girl was a 2 for 2
That's right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We took the game to another level
Killing all these rap niggas time to get the shovel
I don't want this shit I want this shit forever
Until the game crown me king like Ms Corretta
Yeah. Chase the money with my eyes open
Cause I'ma die trying and never die hoping
Shit about to get critical
Its Guddaville 2, and the first one was biblical
F-ck the bullshit I'ma leave these niggas miserable
Spit the hardest shit till I start to see residuals
That's right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Propane thoughts; I spit gasoline
I be the first to come and the last to leave
Some of the realest shit I ever spoke
I hope your hearing everyline and catching every quote
Flow sick there's no antidote
Lock me in the zoo. They can't tame me: I'm an animal
There's no stopping me. there's no holding me
There's no games nigga. there's no controlling me
I know the Lord watching over me
Had to get the snakes from around me so it's more for me
That's right nigga the more the merrier
Extraordinaire. Extra-ordinary, nigga</pre>
