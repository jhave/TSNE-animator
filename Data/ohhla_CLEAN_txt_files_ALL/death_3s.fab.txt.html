Song:   Death Comes in 3's
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

R.I.P to the competition
I heard that death come in 3s
I heard that death come in 3s
I heard that death come in 3s
(There is no competition 3)

The-the grill, the-the-the grill
The-the grill, the-the...
The-the grill, the-the-the grill
The-the grill, the-the-the...

I think by now that you and I know
And if you don't
The motto in my hood is "Do or Die", ho
That just means you do or you die, but you decide though
Writing shit about me? Now thats a suicide note
I should drive a black hearse, with a suicide do'
Nickname that shit "Coffin Car", but keep your room inside though
Lights on, day time, and I usually ride slow
We on that "Boys II Men", its so hard to say goodbye, "Flow"
Hop out in that all black, they like, "Who just died, bro?"
I say the competition, but they ain't look too surprised though
They be talkin sideways, keep that to a side note
An L.A bitch, that ain't my fault, she wanna be crucified, yo
Jesus Christ, he's just nice.....
Wait, I ain't say that right.....He's just Niiiice
And I heard that death comes in 3s
Someone please, come get these
Little rapping bumblebees
Had they buzz, now its gone
That how it usually come n leaves
They was hot, I was cool, enough of that summer breeze
Some of these
Niggaz say shit, I tell em don't mumble please
Keep bumpin' your gums, I wish all you bitches gum disease
You know somebody hatin', give em this number, please
The number is, 1-800-Hum-On-These
Killed it once, killed it twice, usually I just come n flees
Killed it for a third time, (cuz I heard, "Death Comes In 3s")
Well, I'm back and I'm prompt, nigga
Arrogant and so pumped, nigga
In my world ain't shit free, there is no comp, nigga
Ridin round with my Bronx nigga
Who wanna come n romp nigga?
Can't kick a man when he down?
They ain't say we cant stomp niggaz
Flashlights, candles, be prepared for this black out
Black shoes, black suits, black skirt, black blouse
Car service, black 'Lac's
Couple racks in my black slacks
Dime bitch, Ace of Spade, I should be yellin' out Blackjack
BBM in my black Bold, yo bm in my black rolls
She look like Ms Universe and I'm 'bout to be in that blackhole
Get my nut, then fade to black
Damier the grey to black
On the road, we got the Heat, just imagine D-Wade and Black
You wanna play dumb? Black, thats cool
I'ma play HBCU, you can get yo black ass schooled
Welcome to the Funeral University
Death comes in the 3s, this the third CD</pre>
