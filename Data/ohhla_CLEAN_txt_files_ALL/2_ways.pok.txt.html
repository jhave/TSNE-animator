(Chorus) Repeat 2X
Body rock playa wit ya 2-wayz on 
I'ma ol' school nigga wit the new J'z on
All dat animousity I got my game face on 
And if your still standing in line your waitin too long

[Verse 1: Chris Ward]
U need to get in where you fit in, slide in the mix
Poke &amp; Moe is in the 'Gator, I'm guidin' the 6
Hi-sidin' the trick on stage it'z still great love
Jumped out in the lot me &amp; my nigga K-Love
10 candy cars behind all drops no tops
Half of 'em got chops the other half got hopz
Every body watchin' us like they workin wit the copz
Cuz when we rise to the occasion you know the party neva stopz so just (uhh)

(Chorus) Repeat 2X

[Verse 2: Big Pokey]
I'm the ol' school nigga wit the new J'z on
My 2-way fliez 2-wayin the phone 
It'z to in the mornin' I'm on to &amp; it'z on 
Body rockin' by the bar like I'm losin my dome
Wanna take sumthin home bowlegged &amp; sleep wit it
Dyme-piece or better I ain't scared to creep wit it
Star hoe, bad house &amp; car hoe
When she walk her azz jump like a drop in the car show
M-O-B up in the place snug on my waist 
Don't catch a slug in the face, everybody in the place
Bout to tear the club up
Wodie in the parkin' lot bout to tear the dubz up
I think bout in stalckin watchin me &amp; Ke' talkin'
On the dance flo' body rockin' &amp; C-walkin'
Mob Style dat'z the code 
22'' Sprewell rimz after hold
I use ta rock gold now I'm rockin dis plat'
Blowin Northen Light smoke out the top of the 'Lac
Wit the roof pushed back Tv'z fallin'
Gotta caterak problem if you can't see we ballin'
See we be crawlin' everyday of the week
When diz jam come on get up outta ya seat &amp; bounce (uh uh uh uh) 
Bounce (uh uh) Bounce Bounce (uh)

(Chorus) Repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Chris Ward]
We valet, no way I just park at the front
Let 'em stare at the wrist wear while I spark up my blunt
Electro-techno gadgetz wit the J'z to match
Ice jeans make history cuz my 2 way is attached 
4 beef we got heat a few K'z &amp; Mack'z
Dat'll make hataz start snitchin a few K'z &amp; hatz
See it'z us dat raise the stats &amp; change the game
Tha rulez, playbookz &amp; the playaz namez now say it maan!!
WE BODY ROCKIN' the CLUB!!!
While I'm in a big body rockin on dubz
If ya still wonderin how come they watchin' diz thug
Like a button down collar shirt I'm POP-ular cuz
We M-O-B'z (so) ain't no stoppin the buzz
When I wuz dropped at no stoppin wit us

U in ya car (Get krunk)
Whuteva it is do it when you hear us spit funk and.....

(Chorus) Repeat 2X</pre>
