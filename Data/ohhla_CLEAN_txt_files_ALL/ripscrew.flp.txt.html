Yeah (yeah, yeah) uh
Lil' Flip, Bizzy Bone
(First Eazy, Houston Texas
Then Pac, then Biggie
And now it's Big Pun
Now DJ Screw, Aaliyah)

(Chorus: Bizzy Bone - 2x)
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

[Lil' Flip]
I met Screw in 9-4 at a Fat Pat show
Back when Club Unique, use to be stadium bowl
I walked up to his car with a cassette in my hand
Then I freestyled for him cause this could be my only chance
Me and my partner Jason, we started doing mix tapes
We both smiled cause we knew this could be our big break
Then Screw wrote his number down and said hit him next week
Get your list together, and pick all your beats
Well time went by and my best friend died
Rest in peace Jason dog I wish your ass was alive
A couple months later, my second cousin passed
So that made me sit down and realize what I had
I dropped "Diamonds In Yo Face" and "Buy The Car, Buy The House"
And Screw saw me at a show and said boy you went off
Two hours later, I was making tapes at his house
And didn't nobody go to sleep until the mics went off

(Chorus - 2x)

[Lil' Flip]
I'm still on earth, and everything ter-rific
Pour me a spot, so we can reunite and kick it
People don't understand life, but one day you'll get it
But for now you better enjoy your one way ticket
And Screw, I wanna thank you for the help you gave me
We had a relationship like Lil Wayne and Baby
The day you gave me the plack saying Screwed Up Click
The Freestyle King forever is Lit-tle Flip
You let me rip, the mic while you was scratching and mixing
I wasn't trying to run shit I just played my position
We stood in the kitchen smoking, laughing and sipping
Getting high, me and you eating a basket of chicken
Before we shot fool you said Flip come get a ass whipping
I ain't gone lie, Screw could shoot with one hand without missing
I'm on a mission, I'm trying to Screw up the world
Lil' Flip gone hold it down baby that's my word

(Chorus - 2x)

[Lil' Flip]
Now the last verse, I ain't even got to curse
I'm use to seeing your Impala not you riding in a hearse
You set a trend, that'll never be forgotten
Just imagine Batman if he didn't have Robin
But I learned a lot, and I'm glad I'm in a click
And please believe, I still drop underground hits
I got your name tatted on me with a crown on top
You probably DJ'ing up there for Biggie Smalls and Pac

(talking)

(Chorus - 2x)</pre>
