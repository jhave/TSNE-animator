Intro:

Dead crosswords, puzzling your delf
(Get yourrrrrrrr headpiece strapped on tight) 
See, that's what I'm talkin bout
When you take the Johnny Blaze (you're dealing with Johnny Blaze)
(the Johnny Blaze)
and you take that game and you plug that here into Bobby Steels 
(ohh yeahhhhh)
Nowwwww you are playing with power
(yeahhhhh get that mouthpiece screwed on right dude)
(You're dealing with the Bobby Steels) with power
(the Bobby Steels) Now you are playing with power

Verse One:

I got your mind twisted
Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crosswords puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health (yeah) it's like a maze within itself
(yeah) Check the grimey, slimey, slimey
Crim-inim-inal indivi-dual I be
Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city (the city) he roll with jiggy
My crime committee, robbing every Gotham piggy bank blinnnnnnnd
Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler

Chorus:

Tax free money not a problem (that's no problem)
A price to get the ice not a problem (that's no problem)
A body for a price not a problem (that's no problem)
Hmm -- The Riddler

Verse Two:

Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-in, quiz
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
(wigs) Can I live
Corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddle
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler

Chorus:

Murder for the evil not a problem (not a problem)
To the gen there ain't no sequel not a problem (it's not a problem)
Big up to all my people not a problem (that's no problem)
Hah-hah, The Riddler

Verse Three:

Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill (yeah)
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil 
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels 
We was blazing hardware (hardware)
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeel *rehrrarrrr*
On that ass fast was the Batmobile (Batmobile)
I can tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming *ahhh*, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
trying to escape, code nine with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler

Chorus:

Talkin suicide, not a problem (that's no problem)
If you're speaking homicide not a problem (that's no problem)
You want to talk genocide not a problem (that's no problem)
It's The Riddler

Outro:

Word up, that's no problem
Stim-ulim-uli, stim-ulim-uli
Feel good don't it
And you know it
Got ta, hotter
You're playing... with... power
