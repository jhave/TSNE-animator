I was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO
my momma was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow
when it came to rap and R&amp;B and plenty more
check it, if it wasn't on gospel or apostle
or written in the Bible, then it go
So when they tell the baby don't do something then I end up doing it anyway
like, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today
but, I really fell in love with the sound that was coming out form the East Coast
So we got it and twisted it up a bit, now the industry's having a heatstroke
Some say that rap is dead, but when I get the white, black, and red
and jump on the tour bus through 58 shows, then I'm back with a big black sack of bread
Can't believe that that was said, cause Im here with a stack of fed
and I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg
So, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire
and I like my fans spending grands cause we got the fire
our merchandise, like 5 G's every half an hour
and you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier

When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)
(x2)

If it's negative, I don't wanna hear it
eliminating player haters with their evil spirits

I hear em talkin, they mad at Smurf and Souljah Boy
They hating big in the magazine, and dont even know the boys 
I know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people
Run up to the car, pull out the mac lethal 
Man thats a problem with the black people now 
What ya need to know is that, in the world theres a lot of dough to stack 
And the ones that wanna hold us back aint been outside they cul-de-sac 
Every nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back 
But notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at 
Hating on the south? Why? Trippin off them chips they got 
You don't like that it's screwed and chopped
but you wanna get off in they pot
Wanna be MC you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot 
Cause they 84's be poking out
What the hell is you cryin bout? 
Everybody wanna be killa but not for reala
bout the method of making money you gotta get the milla
by doin it like I do it do the work and believe in it 
when you do it to the fullest aint no problem achieving it
When I was broke, homie I went for mills 
Got on the mic with the intent to kill 
Stronger than ever, and you a gimp for real 
I drink caribou lou, and you drink enfamil CHUMP

When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)

You should be clapping when folk make it up outta the ghetto
or trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guero
but, you don't know how to be male
instead of a Timberland, you probably in a stilletto
better yet in a baby shoe, jealous of maybe you
sick of me cause I'm making dinero
and you dont wanna get clapped at
you want a standing ovation? I thought not!
you say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop
try to run up on me, cause a benzo will never be in your car slot
try to step up on the scene, my infra-red beam's right at your soft spot
if you was on TV and balling you wouldn't grown and trip
he'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip
Tech got long cream with chrome things on his whip
(????) with a chrome thing on his hip
but just know your hip will not stop the hop
cause when you look at the big picture, my block pops alot daily
so keep on thinking my clock stops the shots
and I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby

When I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)
When I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like
WAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)
