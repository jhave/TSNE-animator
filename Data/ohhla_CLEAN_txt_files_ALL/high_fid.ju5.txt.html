[Soup]
Well my name, Zaakir
I'm versatile
Plus I never eat the cow if ain't Hilal
While you rap or bit our styles in the third degree
Myself and 7even tight like cornbread Earl and me
Showcase with the voice that's Oh so fresh
And I can still serve a brotha in a minute or less
I can talk all day but I'mma save my breath
And let my nigga Marc 7even just do the rest

[Marc 7]
I'll do the rest
But I won't rest
Get fresh off of any beat you suggest
High tech with the combination we prepare
Rap concierge behind there kickin' the snare
Now check it
Marc's the word
7even marks the spot
Guaranteed to keep it hot
If you like it or not
MC's is ink blots
We verbal potshots
Takin' the top spot
We clutchin' top notch like...

[Soup]
And together we, will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switchin' the melody
Can it be
The Casanova speech therapy
That heavily puts the flavor right where it should be
My words have been connected to the poets of old
The way I utilize the pen I turn ink to gold
Keep it overly creative
Innovator of soul
Now check the flavor from the fader
Which my DJ holds

*Samples*

[Both] (2X)
And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switchin' the melody
Can it be the brothers that you rarely see
That got together for the better
Whether him or me

[Marc 7]
You better remember these
Incredible MC's
Our sounds invade spread plagues just like a lepresy
Our weapons be our vocals
Guaranteed to smoke you
Better think twice about steppin'
We nice
Never focused on ice
And still comin' off tight
It's like the color of night
I mean the beat is so right
Damn!
Soup and 7even
Infiltrate your heart
The beat that's compliment of DJ Nu-Mark

[Soup]
And it's the fifth element
Never repetitive
Highly competitive
Classy and elegant
Super intelligent we're tellin' it to ladies and gents
Never irrelevant now do I have to say it again

[Marc 7]
The fifth element
Never be hesitant
Totally accurate
Present or past tense
We immaculate in fact you get a whole crew
Backin' it
Hit 'chu with my two inch tape
And show you what workin' with

[Both]
And together we
Will forever be
High Fidelity
Definitely
Switchin' the melody
Can it be the way that we demonstrate
Our Wonder-Twin powers we activate

[Soup]
I'll tear a competitor
Pluck 'em like chicken feathers
I'm better than ever
Incredible poetical editor
Dead or be better
I bet'cha regardless the whether
Whenever with clever endeavors
When me and 7even rappin' together

[Marc 7]
Your style is post mortem
No decorum
Style pourin'
We explorin'
You ignorin'
I'm the foreman
Longshoreman
And I'm sure when you tourin'
That you whack and you borin'
