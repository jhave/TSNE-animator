[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Youuuu seeeee riiiight throooough meeee
How do you do that shit? {*3X*}
How do you? {*5X*}

[Nicki Minaj]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin, know when I'm cryin
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
from yellin at you, and gettin at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin them at you
Why are you speakin, when no one asked you?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Nicki Minaj]
What are we doin? Could you see through me?
Cause you say "Nicki," and I say "Who me?"
And you say "No you," and I say "Screw you"
Then you start dressin, and you start leavin
And I start cryin, and I start screamin
The heavy breathin, well what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin, I'm askin you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin, passive aggression
control my mind, capture my soul
Okay you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus] - 2X

[Nicki Minaj]
STOP! (oooooh)
STOP! (oohhhh)
Would you just stop lookin through me cause I can't take it
No I can't take it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Youuuu seeeee riiiight throooough meeee
You see right through me baby
You see right through me (do that shit)
You see right through me (how do you do that shit)
How do you (do that) how do you (do that)
How do you (do that) how do you (do that)
Baby</pre>
