[Intro: Streetlife]
Yeah, this is for my online universe, aiyo

[Streetlife]
I'm so calm, catch me in the trenches
I got's the thermoscope lenses
I could your body heat, try to creep through my streets
Get spotted infered dotted, y'all niggaz better watch it
I play a terrorist, catch me in, in Milwaukee
I'm in the basement, with the M3-Auto shotty
I see through your smoke screen, toss the flash bang
Fuck up your eye site, make your ears ring
Meet me at the crossroads, I'm on some vigilant
Snipin' out the window, one shot, I be killin' shit
Another sob story, these streets is like desert glory
I see remains of fallen soldiers, that came before me
I ninety-nine, need for steppin' out of line, niggaz
I got my mind on the prize, hand on the nine, niggaz
Fuck around and get fragged, y'all niggaz is fags
Stop ditchin', y'all whole style is lagged
Always bitchin', like my girl on the rag
Scream on niggaz like they old dad
Have niggaz campin' with they boots in the lab
Breach the gate, swarm like a sand storm
Cold like a blizzard, vendictive like a woman scourn
Abandoned in blood lake, it's a death trap in a rat's nest
Killed or be killed is the object

[Outro: Streetlife]
I'm so calm, catch me in the trenches
I got's the thermoscope lenses
I'm so calm, catch me in, catch me in
I'm so calm...
Yeah, green up, green up
I'm so calm, catch me in the trenches
I got's the thermoscope lenses
See y'all in the lobby, hustlin' in the lobby
Green up, so calm</pre>
