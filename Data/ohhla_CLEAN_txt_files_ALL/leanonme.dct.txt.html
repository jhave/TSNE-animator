[Oldie but a goodie]
[1, 2, 3, funky]
[True MC, True MC]
[Everybody listens to the True MC]

[Verse 1: The True MC]
True MC, no slack on the track
Here to tell the people that love's what we lack
In this family we gotta love like Christ
So precise in your life so take this advice
Brother to brother we need to learn to love each other
So lean on me when you're in trouble
I cast my cares on Christ 'cause He cares for me
So when you need a shoulder to cry on, just lean

[Props to my man speedy, 1, 2, 3]

[Chorus]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrows
But, if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

[Verse 2]
Please, swallow your pride
If I have things that you need to borrow
For, no one can fill those of your needs
If you won't let them show

[Chorus]
Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

You just call on your brother when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have some problems that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me, when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long 'til
I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Make it funky, make it funky
Make it funky, make it funky
Make it funky, make it funky

[Verse 3]
Cause I'm housin' this joint
Like a brother with an attitude
And comin' straight so you best give me latitude
Leanin' on my boys from the word get go
And bein' there for them cause the Lord said so
Many of us just don't know what to do
Well take it here and now from the boy named true
Don't dog a brother out when he stumbles and falls
Just be there to lean on y'all

Call me, call me, just call me
Call me, call me, just call me, lean on me
Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me
Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me
Don't you know that I'll be there, you can lean on me</pre>
