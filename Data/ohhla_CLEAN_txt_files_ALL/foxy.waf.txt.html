[Wafeek]
Ask me a dumb question, get a dumb answer
Catch me chain smokin like I really want cancer
E'rything spoken by a nigga on fire
as the flames gettin bigger still I feel won't die
Now I seen it all befo', ain't no need to reroute
I got it all memorized like the "Book of Eli," yo
Nowadays e'rybody wanna be the kid
That's the +Sign of the Times+ and the best +Graffiti Bridge+
I tell you somethin that you won't see
You tryin to question me, this ain't Palm Springs
Made yourself so easy to hate
I got this icebox baby so it's easy to skate
If you need to escape, from them CD's and tapes
Grab this iPod baby, new media's great~!
I'm a sly fox baby, I'm as greedy as {?}
But I ain't namin no names that's bein a snake
You got a star

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Say, would you respect; this is my heart, my soul, my dreams
And your last breath left will be the wind beneath my wings

[unknown rapper]
She from Alabama, love the way she talks uhh
A bad mamma jamma, as Foxy as Cleopatra
But I never seen her sober, now I just bend her over
She think I'm in my last year, she an instant classic

[Wafeek]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, {?}
Fuck you, I'm out {*echoes*}</pre>
