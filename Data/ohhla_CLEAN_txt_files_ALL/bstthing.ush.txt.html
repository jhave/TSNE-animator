[Intro: Jay-Z]
I mean, Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean even grass grow baby, you know?
Seeds become plant, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way
 
[Jay-Z]
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
Was my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how coould I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sorta like two door garages
It's like two broads menagin, you the best mama
 
[Usher]
Is there any chance that you remember, mami being more?
Just a horrible man, and would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second 
shot at romance? Aw baby, I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't till now I see how much i missed you
Girl I'm sorry I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it dawns the truth
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
 
[Chorus]
The best thing that ever happened to me 
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And you're all I feel in strength
Cause baby when you left, you took the very best
 
[Usher]
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva, I ain't got 'em no more
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, the same outcome as Chilli, girl, I let 'em all go
Oooh, no more trickin and kissin miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you; how much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once it goes that's true
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
 
[Chorus]
 
[Jay-Z]
Uh, momma try to told me "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose the your thing if you keep gettin round" 
Like pop need a partner when you ol' to hold him down
Ma, forever young was forever numb
Sorry Staci, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for the time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one, you the best mama
 
[Usher]
I can be fake, I can be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homage is slowly
I try to flex but I confess, that when you left you took the very best thing
 
[Chorus]</pre>
