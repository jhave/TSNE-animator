[Big Punisher]
I don't give a fuck!  Til I die, I'ma live it up
Hit em up, nigga what what, nigga what?
Better watch yo' ass 'fore I pull the choppers out the stash
and helicopter yo' ass, about a block and a half
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
Where you at Prop?

[Prospect]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
Let the blood-shed, cause all my thug sons'll bust lead
Yo I rep like one of the best, my Mac numbin your flesh
They on tracks but they runnin from death
Who fuckin with 'spect?  Yo dog, I'm the youngest to rep
Comin correct, niggaz know I blow my gun in a sec
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal Twin?

[Big Punisher]
Yeeeah baby!  Aiyyo it's off with his head
Slap the shit out the Devil and tear his horns off his head
Aiyyo it's almost over, few months we all gon' know Jehovah
Til then I'ma keep the steel in the shoulder holster
I ain't ready to die, bury me alive
But if my nigga got beef, we goin together tonight
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
What you say Twin?

[Prospect]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
Left a body stiff and dead with the infrared
It's hard to survive, ? armor hold ? this tribe
And takin niggaz lives, so what?  They tryin take mine
What I'm supposed to do?  Let shit slide like I was close to you?
This murder I write, pushin a hearse, let me chaffeur you
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal son?

[Big Punisher]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
Nigga I was born in the fuckin Dawn of the Dead
I always got my Dunn like I always got my gun
Fresh out the box, oiled and cocked, Glock 21
Once I have a gun to pop, I ain't gon' stop til I'm done
So either call the cops, or bust a shot - nigga uhh
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
Hold me down Pros'

[Prospect]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
Put that nigga to sleep and make a coffin his bed
I come from rough times where niggaz bust 9's and be like fuck rhymes
and puff dimes, slippin on front lines and lust crimes
You better trust mines, I'm down for the cause
Gimme a round of applause and hear the sound of the 4's
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
What the deal kid?

[Big Punisher]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
Cock the lead redecorate the crib burgandy red
Aiyyo I never front, I want whatever nigga let's dump
Whoever want it gonna get lift with the pump
I mention I'm dumb, my trigger finger fittin to jump
Got the whole left side of my face twitchin and stuff
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
Take us home Dunn

[Prospect]
Aiyyo it's off with his head
He ain't really want it so he lost it instead
"Picture Me Rollin" like 'Pac in the drop, my style too hot
to figure out, oh Lord, please don't make me put this nigga out
My trigger shout through your area code
The scary explos', your click get, leary of foes
Cause I'ma ride for my niggaz, die for my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz til I'm high with my niggaz
Now it's on Twin - now it's on Twin
Yeah, hah, now it's on Twin
