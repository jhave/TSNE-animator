[G-Wise * vocoder box effect]
Yeahhh, yeh yeh - G. Rap that's gangsta (my life nigga)

[Chorus: G-Wise * vocoder]
All of my life, I live
I'll be thuggin with youuuuuuu
Thug it out baby, thug it out baby
Don't stop 'til I die for this
I'll be keepin it trueeeeeee
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Kool G. Rap]
Yo, yo
Giancanna the name break it down simple and plain
Went from a small chimp in the game to gorilla king pimpin the game
Know how to tempt dames to tense in the Range
Hit the block to pitch rocks, the strength of the name
Limp with a cane, lactosin limp for the king
We even pack toast expend from the flames, my aim
Strictly about makin that bread pop (y'know) blocks red hot
from feds and cops, lookin for rock bottles with red tops
Tradin lead shots with dreadlocks
Infrared dots 'til their head drop, we fled spots
Word on the curb is when it came to birds we spread flocks (no doubt)
No tellin when the bloodshed stop, glide 'til the sled stop
Copped the latest every hot flavor in them crocs and gators
Somebody clique riff, pop the bravest
Out of town trips in whips I got from Avis, drop knots in Vegas
My plot for paper was crockpots of wafers

[Chorus]

[Kool G. Rap]
Nigga into warm mansion rooms, wall to wall with handsome goons
Half-naked bitches dancin to tunes (uh-huh)
Marble floor to the terrace nigga, glance at the moon
Play the jacuzzi 'til your hands get blue
Rugs tight, bright as the white sands of Cancun [yeahhhh]
Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom
Nigga we crop grams in dunes, Cuban cigar brand of grandest fumes
Prison niggaz that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan. to June, and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed, self built do
Down to the mink pelts, gator belts and silk suit
If I can't stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street, it's spilled juice
So where that Don be? (right here) In the calm breeze in the palm trees
Bomb G under the armpiece
Livin in harmony, coke farm pharmacy
Bulletproof armory, school of the hard knock honory
Washin the jackpot like laundry
Fuckin Don of the year nominee, honestly

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[G-Wise * vocoder box in background to fade]

Thug shit, Queens clicks
Uhh.. yeah</pre>
