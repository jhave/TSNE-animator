Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Super villain, outlaw, renegade
Smoking, drinking gin with my lemonade
Don't gotta chase these bitches dog they in a race
I make all this money throw it in your face
Said you know my name but you can't say it right
Long as you let me fuck then you can stay the night
I play the game, you playing safe, let's take shots try no chase
Then we slide like home base

Oh, so pick a time and please tell me where you wanna go
Don't need to ask no questions you should already know
Got gleecko by the bottle yeah we keep it popping champagne by the bar
Plenty sour diesel to smoke
Cause I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy,
I'm the bad guy, say hi to the bad guy
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl [X2]
The one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams

Couple of thousand dollars on this rosé
Like girls who came that far but don't stay
We can go to my house or back to your place
You bring a friend and then go both ways
Fuckin' with these niggas cause our money good
Superstar status plus I keep it hood

Aha, so pick a time and please tell me where you wanna go
Don't need to ask no questions you should already know
Got gleecko bottle yeah we keep it popping champagne by the bar
Plenty sour diesel to smoke
Cause I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy,
I'm the bad guy, say hi to the bad guy
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl [X2]
I'm the one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams

Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch with me,
Know how to roll a joint and live a life like a bring it back
Bad guy so I keep a bad bitch with me,
Know how to roll a joint and live a life like a villain

Some wonder how I could do the hard times
But I can do that, they say
I'm the bad guy, say I'm the bad guy,
I'm the bad guy, say that to the bad guy
And I need a bad girl, and I need a bad girl [X2]
I'm the one your parents wonder about the nigga of your wildest dreams</pre>
