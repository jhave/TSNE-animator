[Reverand Tom - Kool Keith]
Talk digital, all galactic iMax, start space
Demon of three dimension intro-respection
Shake the one..
The rap flow since the Scoob paid dues to G.O.
Capture the picture all out the end
Watch the cheap pendant bend
You face me like you've hittin the dead end
I listen to heater, talkin to probably my best friend
Smack your face like Tony Gwynn
The screenplay will never end
With {?}, Stoli, OJ and gin
Rocketship goin up to, count to ten
All galaxies will pay me salaries
Aluminum shirts and die cast shoes
Mercury, Pluto, Mars
Jupiter Saturn is on the news, NASA black hole
You face, the mantaur
The explorer, world controller
Adjusting levels, you can't face us
That's right you can't replace us
Undatakerz, no fakers
...
I think we're stuck out here, umm

[M-Balmer] Stuck?!  What you mean stuck!
[Rev. Tom] There's aliens on the ship
[M-Balmer] What's goin on Reverand Tom?

[Rev. Tom]
We gotta do somethin about it, umm - where are you located right now?
I've been walkin around for a long time
I can't find out anybody, where is anybody located
Come in, do you read me?  Come in... anybody come in
Red code one

[Thee Undatakerz]
I'm coming, closer
There is something wrong here

[Thee Undatakerz]
This is Mission Control
Reverand Tom!  Reverand Tom, what's going on up there?
M-Balmer, are you still at the controls?
Hey anybody! Al Bury-U?
Al Bury-U are you in the engineering room?
I'm getting no kind of feedback here

[M-Balmer]
Takin flight, is M-Balmer, the vicious, funk mistress
Warpin through yo' zone, zappin Amazon figures
The unidentified femme like that Big Bang Theory
I'm blowin up like the beginnin of time when I drop one line
Headacysm, mechaic-nism
I flow from A.C. to B.C., my enemies can't touch me
If there's a penalty like Space Gozer
I'm creepin quicker than a roller coaster, dumpin out the space Rover
Cosmo cosmic galaxy 'n all
But I'ma roll through cause he ain't with my black in the zone

[Thee Undatakerz]
I'm gonna stop, all the aliens
They're taking over the ship
I must get my weapons, ready
They will not, take over this ship
I gotta let the dogs loose
They've got the alien, cornered
It's a lot of them!  I need help
Please, we're in mortal danger!
...
We're all gonna die
I think this is our last, mission

"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</pre>
