[Ludacris]
Yeah
Welcome to Atlanta, jackin hammers and vogues
Back to the mackin and jackin the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it? I would happen to know
The one with the flow -  who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rolls and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down Old Nat, gat tucked and lean
I split ya splean, as a matter of fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneaks, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
I'm allergic to doc' prescribed antihistamines
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware I needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, I'm +Bruce+ with +Banners+
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon
The wooly mammoth sabretooth, bitch bite your tongue
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waitin for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin 'em up
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin 'em up
In fact I'm slappin 'em up, Cadallac'n the truck
I can't loose with twenty-two, bitch that's what's up
Runnin in the back to fuck, better tha-than the aquaduct
Chil-li-li-li-li-n.. fli-pi-pi-pi-pi-n, what?

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo

[Chorus: J.D. followed by Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin

Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, uhh
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
And I usually don't leave until the thang ends
But in the meantime, in between time
You work yo' thing, I'll work mine
I been puttin it down here since eighty-three
Since the Lake Show/MD rivalry
When +Frozen Paradise+ was the place to be
If you was ridin, you was bumpin to homie Shy-D
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballin-ist Player
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor
Monday night, +Gentlemen's Club+
Tuesday night, I'm up in the +Velvet Room+, gettin fucked up
Wednesday, I'm at +Strokers+ on lean
Thursday, +Jump Clean+, then I fall up in +Kream+
Friday, +Shark Bar+, +Kaya+ with Frank Ski
Right on the flo' is where you can find me
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in +One-Tweezy+
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in
Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, y-y-yo, yo, yo
Y-y-yo yo, yo-yo-yo
Yo yo-yo-yo, yo-yo, yo
Y-yo, yo, yo-yo-yo-yo-yo yo

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
