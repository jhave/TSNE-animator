Typed by: Cno Evil

[Shawn Wigs]
I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on

[Chorus: Eamon (sample)]
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is) I'mma try to (Hold on) hey

[Shawn Wigs]
I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cuz I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'mma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me

[Chorus w/ Eamon ad-libs]

[Eamon]
But I'mma try to, hold on, and be strong
Cuz this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone
All these tears, and all this pain
I'll never, never, feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on

[Chorus 2X w/ Eamon ad-libs]</pre>
