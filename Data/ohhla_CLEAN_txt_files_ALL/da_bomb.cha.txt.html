[Chamillionaire]
Big shots, we switchin' block
Big shots, we stretchin' blocks
So many, rocks in the watch
It looks like connect-the-dots
Cribs..we got more spots then dalmations and polka dots
You tried to, handcuff your girl, came home to broke locks
Swangers..just poking out, Chamillionaire is really seen
But if I seen with my heat, it's more then a scary dream
Carry green, santa claus be puttin' presents under me
I'm showin' so much green I'm glowin' like a damn christman tree
Strippers be, thinkin' the, Koopa gonna tip a G
Wouldn't see me tip a G' if the braud was a triple-D
Flip a ki, nah only flip I know is sucka free
I'm up in the club wearing more then jewlrey then Mr. T
Oohh!, I got to be the throwdest nigga to ever spit
Mama must gave me birth on the toilet 'cuz I'm the ish
Ice in the kiss, holmes know that Koopa grill is sick
Ice on the wrist, dick froze everytime I take a piss
Ice on the pinky ring, boy gotta color changin' chain
Don't call me out my name, gorilla not orangutang
Screens fall like uh rain
Everytime I swang the lane
You should've brought an umbrella nigga stop complainin' mayne
Hop out a gator quick, know why I make haters sick?
Cuz I'm glowin' hard then that beam on dark vader's stick
Cock back and spray the clip
Chew off the hater's list
22 that rarely fits
So I ruff ryde like Jadakiss
Screens in a drop-lick
Me in the cock-pit
In every conversation, Koopa's the topic
Plus I'm the top pick
"How the hell he got rich"
Pull a drop off the lot, or a yacht off a dock quick</pre>
