When the cats, awake
the mice will play
thats what the people say
all I know is doggs play anyways
cuz I play everyday
you do it too dont lie
soon as you're out my site
I seen you creepin by
while I was creepin mine
while I was checkin out
I saw you checkin in
I shoulda knocked you out
but I was with your friend

x2
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk
Because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off
x4
(Come On) Come on girl let me heed it 
(Come on) Meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded

Back in the days I used to like bitches
but I tell you nowadays bitches ain't shit
and if you wonder why I say this
I've had a few bitches and bitches think they slick
runnin around, playin all my niggaz
trying to split a brother from his grip
got all these bustaz watchin me
but I tell you right now hoe, I dont slip
I'd like to give a shout out to my favorite girl
but I wont you know why, because she's a trick
and if I give a shout out to a sneaky bitch
I got to give a shout to the nigga she's sneakin with
(and all my homeys say)

(Chorus x4)
Because I got a girl, dont mean we can't talk
(come on girl let me heed it)
because I got a girl, dont mean I wont break you off
(meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded)
(x4)
come on girl let me heed it
meet me at the deli thats if you're weeded

Cuz I have never met a girl
that I love in the whole wide world</pre>
