[Drake]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl and
She's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do...
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do...
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do...
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you, too"

[Chorus: Drake]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh-oh, you know it
Oh-oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh-oh, you know it
Oh-oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh-oh, she knows it
Oh-ohhhh I know it, we all know it
I need someone different...
Oh-oh, ohhhhh-ohh

[Drake]
We live in a generation of not being in love 
and not being together..
But we sure make it feel like we're together..
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do...
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do, whoa (ohh)
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do...
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you, too"

[Chorus]
