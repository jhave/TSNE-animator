[Bow Wow]
Holy shit look at the life I live (Damn)
I used to be broke like ligaments
And nigga I'm rich
And now that boy got chips
Like ruffles... Lays
And you can say I'm short
But you can't say I ain't paid
You want to talk cribs?
See my shit on the lake
Twenty thousand square feet
See that's a private estate
Helicopter pad for when I make them private escapes
So when it's time to get that money nigga
I'm never late
I'm still the prince of the O-town
Make them hoes go down
Since I turned 21
I don't kno how to act
Hopping out different whips
And smashing like err chick
I don't kno bout ya'll
But this the life I live
They call me

(Bow Wow)

[Bow Wow]
Yeah that's me

Fast cars
Watching hoes shake it up all night (I do it)

Fifty on the floo
A hundred on the table (Table)
Thirty in the stable
Getting mo paper

We some get money niggas
Get get money niggas [x3]
See one thing we have in common
Is that we some get money niggas (Hate)

[Soulja Boy]

White with the doors up (Ah)
Chain full of snow yeah that bitch froze up (Damn)
Sitting in a vet (Vet)
Gucci bandana (dana)
G4 jet (Jet)
I'm to hot to handle (Damn)
Space ship don't slip with the flat screens
Yellow diamonds same color as a taxi
Watch the girls joc with my two door pass (Pass)
And if you say something wrong
We gon do yo ass
S.O.D. money gang keep stacking
I leaked every song and I still went platinum
Need more purp now number on the speed dial
Money to long
I call that shit the Green Mile

BOW WOW

[Bow Wow]
Yeah that's me

Fast cars
Watching hoes shake it up all night (I do it)

Fifty on the floo
A hundred on the table (Table)
Thirty in the stable
Getting mo paper

[Chorus: Bow Wow]
We some get money niggas
Get get money niggas [x3]
See one thing we have in common
