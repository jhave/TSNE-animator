[Intro]
Uh uh
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
Get Money all over again
'99, Double Up, uh uh

Yo, when you look in my eyes, what chu see?
A sincere man or just a bunch of G
Why second guess, the brotha would last
They took a whole clique from the George and the Ave'
The booties in Aruba, boats and hoover crafts
So if Biggie could love the dough, Murda could love the cash
Butter Benz, gave the Tahoe to my other half
If she got the Benz then guess what mami have
Why dread it, tell the waiter too much ice in the crib
Blink's so drunk, he think we singing "Nights Like This"
He say when he grow up he want a life like this
Sleep all day and plus you want ice like this?
While girls throwin' head I ain't even touch dice
I ain't trust Don King, how my trust Mike?
I date bull daggers, ain't I don't trust Dykes
Need a cleaner nina, cuz they don't bust right
I ain't stingy, when everybody see the plush life
Buy rims before the benz so I look just right
Girls love me try to get the girls that love Mike
All I need is cup of Kool-Aid, I got enough ice

1 - 	[Cheri Dennis]
 	All I ever wanted was you for me
	Cuz that nigga who I'm with don't give a fuck about me
	And all I ever wanted was to be there for you 
	Cuz that girl who you with don't give a fuck about you

You unhappy, and I can see it when you cry
You look like your life has just been minimized
I ain't your man, I'm your man on the side
You just call me when you plan to slide
And if you ever feel like you wanna creep
All you gotta do is just give me a beep
Only way I won't call you back less I'm asleep
Gettin' my money or layin' it wit' a piece
We hit the block, shop alot
She see her man, but she don't wanna drop the top
And you know that don't really mean a thing to me
Can't no girl ever run game with me
You know Mase, got alot of places to be
Spots in Ohio, kick in NC
And I be wit older dudes and know the rules
So if a man pick up I know what code to use

Repeat 1

If you cheat on me, I'mma cheat on you
If you don't speak of me, I won't speak of you
I'll tell you now, we wait about a week or two
Then I know what we could do
We could just get our food and stay in
Cuz people on the block is hatin'
They know your man and know we datin'
So we gotta do this just to stay friends
(OK) Amen

[Both]
I lay back, I zone
You say that it's on

[Mase]
Then the girl try to snatch the phone
So I knew I was happier home

Repeat 1 until fade</pre>
