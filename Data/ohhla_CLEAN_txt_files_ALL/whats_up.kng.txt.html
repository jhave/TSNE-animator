King Lil G
Tattoo'd Guns in the building
That mob Life

My rival's know whats up with me
Mentally I'm fucken crucial
AK-47 logo, my clicka we reppin' sucio...
Gangster boy, music for the fucken ghetto (alrite)
Fuck all you bougie fancy rappers
Get up on my level
That bomb weed, california we got it
This is for the pandilleros, in the hood, in the projects (haha)
I'm drinkin on this 40oz, while I watch ESPN (okay)
Bitches trynna set me up, like my name was SPM (okay)
My respect..H-town I salute! (yea)
Tatted up, all up in the face, homies I recruit
Fuck it it's own, fucken with bitches thats grown
Fuck it I'm taken em home, drunk and I'm stoned
Forgive me I'm just tryna bone
Gotta admit that you don't know the feelin
Of having these multiple women at once
Believe it, the shit that i've done
Smoking on a fatass blunt

[Chorus]
Motherfuckers want sum beef with me
I'm like (What's up!)
Bitches say they wanna fuck with me
I'm like (What's up!)
(What's up)
(What's up)
Motherfucker (What's up!)
(What's up)
(What's up)
Motherfucker (What's up)

Sucio...Rifa
BLOOD COMIN' OUT UR SPEAKER!
BLOOD COMIN' OUT UR BODY
WHEN I POP THAT SHOTTY LIKE PANCHO VILLA!
Lines of cocaina, wantin' to copy
But they can't see us
The fact that these rappers, Ain't half of the shit
That they rappin' about don't believe em!
Motherfuckers is bitches they turn to religion
They crying to jesus...
I hate that corny line, that your g'd up from the feet up
I'm a hardcore cholo bouta get deported
For having a stolen visa
Got a bad bitch in Tijuana, her momma's names Maria
Drug dealer agreements, got my back, believe em
Get bitch slapped, &amp; kidnapped, living la gangster vida
Please excuse my espanol, drugs mixed with acid tone
Watching Primer impacto, they still looking for Chapo's home
Never heard of Big Meech, but El Chapo's cold
Lock and load, the hottest flow
Outta my control, here you go this microphone
AK-47 cartel music

[Chorus]
Motherfuckers want sum beef with me
I'm like (What's up!)
Bitches say they wanna fuck with me
I'm like (What's up!)
(What's up)
(What's up)
Motherfucker (What's up!)
(What's up)
(What's up)
Motherfucker (What's up!)</pre>
