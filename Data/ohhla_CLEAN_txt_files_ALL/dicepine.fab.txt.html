[Intro: Cassie]
Hello? What you doin tonight? Heh heh ha ha ha!
Oh shit!

[Verse One Fabolous]
Shorty so cold, pussy winterfresh
Reservations to eat, and you my dinner guest
Shorty clean up nice, never been a mess
To take a little paint I see them tattoos in her flesh
But I ain't tryin to hurt her 'cause I always been the best
At makin my shorty feel it 'til she feel it in her chest
Sex excellent get a hundred when I test
I'm a fan of her talents so I always been impressed
+Sex And The City+ on my black satin sheets
Wet as hurricane Sandy on these manhattan streets
Lit a few candles like my power hadn't reached
Then I took her places that her last nigga hasn't reached
Bitch so bad know her parents went through hell
Smart mouth when we argue you could swear she went to Yale
I wanna touch her, not usin my hands
Make her dance without usin the band

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy shit at least you're callin
Feels better when you let it out don't it boy
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

[Verse Two Fabolous]
The club poppin but, she ain't even go there
Her friends know where she goin everytime she goin nowehere
I'm the only one that get up in that V.I.P.
My money grown baby ain't no need to see I.D.
Slide her sum'n just to come through, host money
At least niggas know you gettin to the most money
Club my place you wear what you wanna wear
But you over dressed if you wearin underwear
Now turn up, couple j's to burn up
Couple spots to hide out nowlet that playlist ride out
Where I live on sunday? yo' place monday
Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy
Pull it out like a pistol yo, kissin on the balls like the dick a mistletoe
Told her do that thing I like, bet she listen yo
Bad bitch good girl around christmas though
NICE!!! 

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy shit at least you're callin
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right

[Verse Three: Trey Songz]
Pussy sweeter than some fresh fruit, she gushin I drink the best juice
I'm a drink it 'til nothin left to, and she playin with herself too
I've been thinkin 'bout her all day, she perform like it's Broadway
Yeah we hop in the range she off top with the brain got the windows down broad day
Just look at her spectacular
Throw her on the stove, flip her like a spatula
Other niggas want her but you see them niggas wack to her
Side bitch trippin 'cause I don't never get back to her
My bitch like bitches but none of my bitches bad to her
And she's a trigger why I never seen you with a bad bitch
And just meeting on these other bitches average
A hundred percent real all these bitches is plastic
Moroccan goddess she walk like she need her ass kissed
Walks like she need her ass kissed
Dice pineapples, super fine at you
If she givin head she throwin her mind at you
Fuck these other bitches nigga she don't mind that you do
Might just wanna watch I ain't talkin time at you dudes
Never fakin, why they hella frank
Keep it real with her yeah that's all she ever wants
Sum'n 'bout the outcoming, she don't never disapoint
London on the balcony we 'bout to smoke another joint
Miami on the yacht, she pullin on my pistol sayin how she love my cock 
Metaphoric bliss, shawty you the shit
Couple days with her man that's all I ever get
Yeah she got a little sister that's all she ever with
Huh! Game like a nigga man that's all she ever spit
Uh! Montreal was her first time, swear her pussy is like the first line
Scars on my back, she a left couple there
Spend a couple stacks, I done bought a couple there
Tried to bag mine, my nigga I double dare
Never retract statements nigga I'm never scared
Niggas be switchin up but nigga I'm never weird
Back on another leer
I'll leave you niggas here, all in another year
All in another lane, all in another gear
All of you niggas lame, all of you niggas here
Listen up bitch niggas bitchin up
Uh! Guess you doin what you 'spoe to, let a real nigga hold you
Back to my baby girl though, I just need you in my world yo

[Chorus: Cassie]
Call me crazy shit at least you're callin
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it 'cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right</pre>
