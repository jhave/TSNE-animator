nor nullo spinae, nothing of the bones of men, Ausonius, i've
had enough barbarians pressed hard against the gate -

Lesbia stood by the bronze auracular
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
behind the auracular, shapes of dragons, pearls
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled
turbulence, the violence of the pair
there was hardly anyone there
Lesbia and Veneres Cupidinesque were bare
the stones of the auracular murmuring and austere
humans behind the stones of the auracular
i don't want to be the bearer of bad news beyond Moselle
Veneres Cupidinesque was behind her
Veneres Cupidinesque's hands made flame-cast shadows
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it was a soft summer evening, roma, 324
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
the humans preparing the final act
behind the auracular, shapes of dragons, pearls
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled

Looking for truth


"The Baal Shem said: 'What does it mean, when people say that Truth goes 
over all the world? It means that Truth is driven out of one place after 
another, and must wander on and on.'" (Martin Buber)
Nous sont tres fatiguee sur le pont avec la plume de ma tant. 
Nous avons trois souris, aveugles, desoeuvres!
Frere Jacques, ou sont les armes cireux?
Dansez et dormez sur les rues triestes et courir rapid!
Ou sont les cadvres? Marguerite! Marguerite!
Monsieur, la automobile nous mise a mort aujourd'hui!
Medecin, medecine! Nous tombes au-dessous de pont de fer!
Un avion de transport vol au dessus des coureurs qui danses.
Amenez tole; tant etalons! - Etalez - ils vens!
Frottez, ou frisson, ou froisson - frole la question ...
Un tort est une honte ...
"Symbolic function is incorporated by certain molecules only in the 
context of specific neural systems in which the molecules are elaborated."
(Ira B. Black)
Cherchez la verite.

From first to last, Jennifer was unable to face the vacancy that pursued
her every step of the way. She felt old and used. She was beginning to
resent Nikuko, and looked for a new Clar. She wanted either war or sex; it
didn't matter. She was human after all. It was a world without men! It was
a world without anything! It was Dangerous-Toy world, and she was on top.
She lay back down to sleep. She never dreamed. The Clar came in with a
question. Jennifer woke with a start. You am your new Clar, she asked,
already knowing the answer. Nikuko would have been shredded; she suspected
nothing. One or the other had to go. War and love in a huge blend, hating
the enemy enough to kill her. She put on her new Clar. She could hear
Nikuko in the distance, begging, begging... What could she do? The
shredder existed beneath the bleak sky of the dome, to one rococo
elliptical center; Jennifer was at the other. It was emptied otherwise.
She loved the begging sounds, the tormented cries and murmurs of the
wounded. Humans mewled in orgasm and death, she mused. I shredded first;
I'm still here, the new Clar unformed, ungrown, at your mercy. Hello, I
are the new Clar. I are at Jennifer's mercy. She keeps me naked and bound;
she gives me a gun. I kill on command but only on command. I are available
to her at any time. I don't have to think for myself. The old Clar has
gone; the screams am dying out. Each bit of tissue cries on its own. They
am dying, one after the other, hundreds and thousands. Hello, I are the
new Clar, Jennifer. The new Clar was breathing deep into Jennifer's holes.
Jennifer was expanding; eyes closed, in ecstasy, she would fill the
universe, break the dome, begin another. The cycle worked because of her
quick draw and politeness. The new Clar would be named Nikuko. She liked
the name and decided to continue it. Nikuko never returned, but Jennifer
mused, there is always a new Clar. The Clar, now Nikuko, was breathing
mindfully. Jennifer was totally at peace; every inch of her body alive
with passion, ecstasy, bravery and fury at the thought of war. Jennifer
was known far and wide for starting the marvel-war. She began and finished
the marvel-war and everyone would die again and again. Jennifer's legs
were spread and her mouth was open. There was a huge man in the sky
writing everything down. He was warrior-man, holding Jennifer with jealous
tenacity. Jennifer did not mind, because she was busy with her marvel-war
and new Clar. The man was shameful watching everything. Time and time
again he would see the Clar shredded, the new Clar coming. He was bound in
chains to an enormous rock. Something pecked at him every thousand years
and the rock would wear down only with eternity when he would be rescued
by the knight. Jennifer was much more alive and had things to do. She was
wayward and shameless and the new Clar cleared out the debris of the
marvel-war. The new Clar asked Jennifer what else to do, but Jennifer had
returned to sleep. Jennifer never dreamed, and was not dreaming now. The
new Clar was called Nikuko and when Jennifer stirred, she asked Nikuko not
to begin the derail-war and specifically not to begin the deflect-war, and
the new Clar agreed and they did return and the mewling had stopped. They
waved their arms furiously in a dance of epiphany and the man was losing
his liver. His liver began to grow. They never spoke to each other and she
never looked at him because she did not know his language. The new Clar
waved her arms more and more and then waved Jennifer's arms. Jennifer
waved the new Clar's arms, which were called the arms of Nikuko. Jennifer
had a bright and shiny smile. Her Clar loved her smile. Her new Clar would
smile when she would smile. Sometimes her new Clar would smile on her own.
Her new Clar was called Nikuko. Sometimes they were at war. Sometimes they
made sexual and non-sexual love.

They made many kinds of war. There was only one Clar, the new Clar. She
was Jennifer's addition. Jennifer was her addition. The tissues from the
shredding machine were very silent. Nikuko did not hear a thing, and
either did Jennifer. The new Clar made many kinds of love. The warrior-man

the fires are starting - we can't make it back to the mainland - they're
not taking our money or credit here - friends feed friends - we're all
going to die soon anyway - in the distance the ruins produce black clouds
- they're turning - they're coming across - we'd need two whole bridges -
we'd have to cross the island - that isn't possible - we'd die - there are
too many hotspots - this is a message - one of the last - you're coming
across - you're coming across it - from the empty world - we're cornered
here - everything poisonous - from the future to the past - from nowhere
to anywhere - we won't be able to hear from you - there's no need to say
anything - write anything - you might think of us - radio's gone - too
much static - no tv - nothing like that - same thing with the cellphones -
burned-out aerials - the water's already turning - the world's curled
with pollution - furious particles - we'll make up stories for a while -
we'll leave our names on the walls - you'll be the walls -

if it is getting used it is a template. every online file is a template 
and is never used up. you can use it and send it to me over and over again 
and it is never used up. it is always the same and every instance is the 
same which means equivalent. every instance is an instantiation.

this is the record of an instantiation. i never replied to this so i 
cannot tell you about the instantiation but i bet it was many things 
together all equivalent but in different locations. and by the look of it 
all these equivalent things were next to one another, nuzzled up against 
one another, as if in neighborhood or a community of equivalent things.

equivalences, each a model of the other, just as the manifold increasingly 
models itself.

the manifold models itself by exhuberant detail. the details transform the 
mannifold into the transcendence of equivalence. what is identical is no 
longer identical. what is identical is equivalent. identity is lost in 
equivalence. everything is equivalent with a trace or surplus; everything 
is equivalent to the degree of the diacritical.

there is no one. there is no many. number diffuses through membranes or 
striations, threads of past identities. everything is literally 
indescribable. what is described is the surface or manifold of a 
mediation, a manifold of equivalences, across or through the multiplexing 
of the real.

evil, a falsehood


**************Free Prize Palace Newsletter**************

it's only in the symbolic that truth is found; it's only in the symbolic 
that negation occurs. negation is a core trope in intelligence; what 
differentiates, differentiates only by virtue of the potential for 
veering, turning away.

Get the degree you NEED for a high paying job.

the symbolic is the repository of evil, the punishment of banishing, the 
pale; the evil other is such by virtue of the symbol, primordial communi- 
cation. humans exist naturally enough within the worlding of mediation and 
representation; the evil symbolic both extends hegemony and creates 
conditions for the implementation of violence at a distance.

there are no neutral objects. objecting is within the categorical; both 
are bound within the sememe. the sememe originates physical action beyond 
instinct, the reflex arc, the autonomic nervous system; it is responsible 
for violence's delight.

all languaging is a seduction and a death; syntax itself filters and 
denies. to work within language may also be to fight against it, expose 
it. everything humans perceive is part and a parcel of language.

spoken and written language are low-bandwidth, full of poverty and 
anxiety, full of exposure. within the limitations of a tongue, equivalence

it is the internal and external placement of equivalent entities that
distinguishes them. one may say, for example, within the file zz, zero and
one are enumerated.
0000000   7.173252e+22   1.805785e+28   8.035022e-09   2.592980e-09
0000020   1.543261e-19   6.773631e-10   2.700498e-06   1.942548e+31
0000040   1.709008e+25   3.156725e+35   1.248262e+33   1.915788e-19

the enumeration is also by zero and one, so that in fact we may say
f_zz(0,1,n) = f_zz(0,1,(0,1)). in the nth position, 0 or 1 is mapped;
the nth position itself is mapped by 0 or 1. we could go on with a
phenomenology of ordering.

20021130 02:03:04 /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
20021130 02:03:04 Sending: zz

so the binary is equivalent but within the file by virtue of emplacement.
and equivalence itself tends simultaneously towards eternity and existence.
0000000 0a0a 6573 646e 6e69 0a67 320a 3030 3132
0000020 3230 2036 3130 303a 3a33 3635 2f20 7375
0000040 2f72 6962 2f6e 7a73 2d20 7676 2d20 2062
0000060 7a7a 320a 3030 3132 3230 2036 3130 303a
binary equivalence, within and without the limitations of the apparatus of
transmission, is the simulacrum of the defeat of death. the sending of zz
does not eliminate zz; what is sent also remains.

thus one notices that every instantiation of a file is equivalent by
virtue of the differentiation of emplacement as well.

the instantiation is the residue of the file. the file is a collocation of
binary residues.
 
in fact we may problematize equivalence as follows: if a = b, one might
also say -(a = a); a is never equivalent to itself. an instantiation of a
is equivalent to an other instantiation of a, but an instantiation is not
equivalent to itself since each instantiation is unique.

20021212 19:11:59 /usr/bin/sz -vv -b zz
20021212 19:11:59 Sending: zz

we have then if a = b and b = c, then a = c; a = b implies b = a. 

the negation of a is also problematic. one might say for example that
-a(0,1) = a(1,0), the complement; one might  also say -a = 0, the
annihilation of a; one might also say -a = {x: x= not-a} or that -a=U-a
(the universe of discourse excluding a).

0000060 31354 12810 12336 12594 12848  8246 12592 12346
we could go on with a phenomenology of negation.

you are sending the file across the courtyard. it is a different
instantiation. noise is parasitic and below the threshold but not
always. the receiver is there but not always. let us say the equivalent
file reaches its destination. let us say the destination is a receiver.

it is an instance of the file with or without an origin. it is an
imminence of appearance. the appearance is a layer (software, hardware) of
interpretation, representation. the layer processes within the receiver. a
secondary residue, that of interpretive response, exists. one interpretive
response is not equivalent to another; every monitor is different in terms
of configuration - in terms of instantiation.

the appearance is also fundamentally binary, zeros and ones.

Pirke Emote I


1 This has been passed down, generation to generation. What I am saying
has been already said. What is already said, I am saying.

And what I say, will be said, by others in observance. And what I am not 
saying, no one will say in observance.

In observance, one turns within the matrix of harmony. The matrix of 
harmony tunes mind to mind, that we may agree to speak to one another in 
peace and protocol.

2 What is protocol? It is the listening and attending. To be attentive is
to be silent, to be gracious, to listen with the full mind. When one
listens with the full mind, enlightenment approaches.

To speak and listen with the full mind is to be attentive to others. To be 
attentive to others, is to be attentive to oneself. If one is attentive, 
one is in grace. If one is in grace, enlightenment approaches.

To listen with the mind of oneself, is not to listen. To listen with the 
mind of others, is to be attentive. To be attentive is to reach in and 
across, to reach with the grace of the world into the grace of the mind. 
Only then will the mind see, the eye think. Only then does enlightenment 
approach.

3 To listen and speak, destruction of the protocols. To live in the
spectrum, is to destroy the protocols. To live is to breathe; to breathe
is to live in autonomy. The protocols exist in layer upon layer; what do
the protocols have to do with the approach of enlightenment?

You can not remove the suffering by speech; you can remove the suffering 
by attending. To heal is to listen; to listen is not to act. When one 
shares the protocols, one is graced. One can never enlighten another. 
There are no masters. There are no gurus. Approach no one on bended knee, 
with obsequity. Not to bow is to bow. Not obsequity is humility. 

4 One to the other is humility. The other to the one is humility. All 
movement is a standing-still. There is no fulcrum. If I am not for you, 
who then? Make a hedge around yourself; make a gate within the hedge.

Know this, all things exist without things. A name given is a thing made. 
A thing made is a thing destroyed. Enlightenment approaches in the grace 
without. What is without, speaks within. What is within, is attentive.

5 The other travels to visit the other. My place is always at a distance.  
To perceive clearly is to understand that home is always absent. To be
absent is to arrive. The present is always a leaving. To be present is
recognize the protocols. The fullness of the world is transparent. The
world is transparent. The disappearance of all things is presence. The
grace of the other is its disappearance.

6 Do not listen overmuch to the talk of men.

Nikuko and Jennifer, The Abandonment of Names


O Nikuko! O Jennifer! I have missed thee so! My calling out to thou! Thine
answering and blossoming! Thy voices in the Garden, across Sky and fairly
in all Weathers! Thee hast lived within me for so long, thine and thou
names registering as Agents of Beauty, just the Conjuring of names is
sufficient for all Emotion! But alas! Now thine art Spirit, of Names there
are None, thy Forms for all times of a Blend! For thou must know, I am
thine Man of Distributions, of Me it is said, all Words and all Phrases! I
would place all in Dishevelment, Abandonment! I would announce and
Withdraw! I would Remember and forget!

For is It not Inscribed f(A(tf),B(tf)) = F(tfff), such that A and B are 
Abandoned for Unknown and Unnamed Reaches, just as F(A(tf),B(tf)) = 
F(fttt) such that A and B in their Divine Intermixture do huddle together 
in the grasping of Linked Names? Thus, I abandon Thine names, of which, 
thine absorbing into me, mine Absorption. Thus this Reminder of Remainder, 
and of that no more, and of that Anon!

Kleene's Introduction to Metamathematics p. 139 of 'thys very olde booke' 
is a start.

Locating the problematic: a >> the


I've got a problematic relationship to authority. Online, I think clearly,
Is theory necessary? Hardly; the best one can hope for is a problematic
but a problematic. Increasingly I felt overpowered, overwhelmed, not by
the placing of facts in a problematic world. Poetry is our great mirror;  
imaginary within it, a fantasm procuring a problematic history. From a
problematic of electricity characterized by a problematic of internal
time-consciousness - time survival: "science," which not only plays into a
problematic Darwinism in search of the last term, a problematic terrain
which is neither even dysfunctional; it would retain a problematic auton-
omy. A problematic behaviorism in which function=>protocol AND with a
problematic ontological/epistemological regime, 'Environment.'

Its shadowy obverse. It is the field of the problematic that defines the
trope of an absent body, or dissipated in the problematic of the ring, the
problematic of the reader, ontology, community. As if this implied, auth-
entic or not, given among other things the problematic of phenomenology
that the problematic of text-based Internet communication - the _compon-
ent,_ and the problematic phenomenology accompanying it (just sign lan-
guage, the problematics of the verbal sphere). Additional gender confu-
sion, for the problematic of intellectual property, nervous walk to uni-
versity: rewriting the problematic of art and its wards, the problematic
of totality (Godel, Church, Skolem, Tarski, or for that matter Euclid), it
also precludes both the problematic of one past or through the problematic
of the proper name, which remains tied - the sunlight thick upon the
leaves, called out the problematic of "Medea22," of ballet. The problem-
atic of the real (grain of the voice, 'idiotic' real)? Breakdowns and the
problematic of mathematics. what crystalline mechanism description and the
problematic situating both, the fold catastrophe as towards the problema-
tic of the scapegoat and expulsion. the problematic:inscription: she is
doing her toilet...she breaks down and she says: "the problematic:ins-
cription" - she is doing her toilet...she notes towards the problematic
perception of worlds. This is an archaeology of taint, of plagiarism, of
the problematic, the problematic flesh and mind hinged on the edge of the
terminal. And all of this brings up the problematic of the net, where
passing, swimming in chaotic existence, the problematic of its being
present or refusing _all_ truths, including the problematic of its own
being...

The Pump-Organ

i. Here we are again, almost no filtering, no programs, no Nikuko or 
Jennifer, nothing but a text, inscribed through keystroke after keystroke. 
The exhausting labor, the tending of the writing, bringing point after 
point as a gift to your attention.
ii. Such a triviality! To write about a pump-organ, reed-organ, in the 
early days of war and total violence - not making a point about the 
generosity of peace, in fact making no point at all in relation to the 
presumed primordial and natural, prelapsarian, state of the world at all.
iii. The organ was made by Daniel F. Beatty company between 1878-1880; 
it's made from quarter-sawn oak, ebony, a celluloid/chalk composition for 
the keys, rubberized cloth for the bellows.
iv. Repairs including patching the cloth with rubberized tape and glue, 
pulling and cleaning the C and two other reeds, taping the pedal bellows, 
and cleaning the instrument in general.
v. The pitch is high-pitch, which was popular only for a few years in the 
19th-century, around the period the organ was produced. The keyboard is 
divided into three sections with fourteen stops, including treble and bass 
couplers. The sections are more or less independent unless coupled. The 
full range is probably seven octaves over 61 keys. A higher-range key 
sounds for five to ten seconds after pedaling stops. A lower-range key 
holds for four to five sections. 
vi. Played, the instrument breathes like a huge lung; pedal-speed is 
coupled with a slight swelling volume - and, more important, with the 
movement of the pedaling body; the result often coincides with the rhythm 
of the improvisation.
vii. The player's breathing, the movement of the body, the air pressure 
within the instrument, all contribute to an overall singing, unlike the 
banging of a piano or rasping of a guitar. The organ must be tended at all 
times; pressing a key slightly, for example, will foil the coupling and 
create different onset characteristics. Likewise, pedal speed and depth 
contribute to the possibility of a volume-envelope reflecting the thought 
behind the music - the body of the player, body of the music, coupled with 
the instrument of oak, rubber, glue, metal, and proto-plastics.
viii. Unlike a harmonium, the sound-box contains a vacuum; the note is 
pulled out of the atmosphere. This pulling-forth brings the note, through 
the vibration of the sound-box, into the air. Since it is a suction 
instrument, there is a ceiling to the volume, characterized by the four- 
teen-some pounds of atmospheric air-pressure.
ix. Harmonies on the instrument are transparent; instead of isolated pipes 
or strings, all sounding occurs by virtue of the sound-box. The player can 
feel the vibrations of the instrument case, the keyboard, the pedals; 
everything moves together, as in a tamboura. The sounding emanates from a 
distributed large volume; the room itself seems to speak.
x. I improvise moving from figure to figure, bringing the figures and 
widely varying keys into harmony and transformation with one another. The 
improvisations last from seventeen to thirty minutes. The left-hand 
creates slow bass counterpoint or parallel fourths, fifths, and octave; 
the right-hand works through Chinese, Arabic, and Indian scales. The 
recording is made on a Sony mini-disk walkman, then uploaded to Soundforge 
for multi-tap and/or reverberation treatment. The pieces are placed on 
music cds.
xi. But what I enjoy, notice, most of all, is the breathing of the organ, 
our mutual labor, and the production of a sound concomitant with inhaling 
and absorbing the world around us. Together we are speaking, and for a 
moment our widely disparate histories coincide to bring about primordial 
eras of worlds, from this one to the next.

Leftist Caught Red-Handed in Bad Pun


	Sarah Williamson was arrested last night for spamming a number of
email lists with a 'bad pun,' Yorkshire Heights police reported last
night.  'The complaints were overwhelming,' John Stockton, chief, said.
'We had to do something.'

	The pun went as follows: "'It takes a village to raise a child.' 
- Hillary Clinton. 'It takes an idiot to raze a village.' - George Bush."

	Arraignment Tuesday at the Courthouse. Visitors welcome. (AP)

"Nonetheless, even though it is possible to recognize the death instinct
as a new guise for a basic and constant sine qua non of Freudian thought,
it must be emphasized that its introduction does embody a new conceptual
departure: the death instinct makes the destructive tendency, as revealed
for example in sado-masochism, into an irreducible datum; it is further-
more the chosen expression of the most fundamental principle or psychical
functioning; and lastly, in so far as it is 'the essence of the instinct-
ual', it binds every wish, whether aggressive or sexual, to the wish for 
death." (Laplanche and Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, p. 103.)

look, o jerusalem - city of peace then war - going back to the days my
youth everything - bathed in a golden light - nearby ascending staircase
stone - and up between buildings the place of instrument makers - lying
words - crossroads worlds - among inscriptions belied by ideologies -
let's get out of here, i hear this all time - instruments moving fast -
dancing everywhere - blood eerie stairs - endless chattering writing -
carrying bombs weaponry don't remember - is what you've done we've you -
everything's dying around here there's not much i'm sure end of world 
hand - you're at fault it's your fault. -

but hey did this happen to you - where everything is absorbed - the black
hole of the world - too much god - radiation escapes -

Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist.
Ogden:
The world is everything that is the case.
Pears/McGuinness:
The world is all that is the case.
Die Welt ist die Gesamtheit der Tatsachen, nicht der Dinge.
Pears/McGuinness:
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
Ogden:
The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
...
Die Tatsachen im logischen Raum sind die Welt.
Die Welt zerfallt in Tatsachen.
Ogden:
The facts in logical space are the world.
The world divides into facts.
...
Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, daruber muss man schweigen.
Ogden:
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
Pears/McGuinness:
What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.
(From beginning and end of Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,
Ogden translation 1922, Pears/McGuinness translation 1961.)

TLP describes a Dostoevskian crystalline world divisible into facts. The
German is clear; the motto to the book, by Kurnberger states, in trans-
lation: ...and whatever a man knows, whatever is not mere rumbling, and
roaring that he has heard, can be said in three words.

TLP portends ideality. The world is logical, mathematical, capable of
clear division. Logical space is the space, I would assume, of the natural
numbers, if not the integers; as Russell says in his introduction, TLP
presents, inscribes, a finite mathematics - there's no room for the
continuum, and proof of the continuum hypothesis was far in the future.

The translations are different, almost never radically so, but different
nonetheless. There is a residue in German such that both English versions
converge, but often never meet. The sememes are equivalent, but only to a
degree; translations are almost never one-to-one. 

In this logical space of facts, programming, and protocols, there is
always a wavering, always room, always doubt, critique, and I would say
desire as well. Never mind that this wor(l)d breaks down, evidenced a few
decades later by Godel, Tarski, Skolem, etc.: Coherency, living within the
safety-net of mathesis, matrix, maternality, remains a dream of humanity.
DNA coding, cryptography, hacking the world - all appear to guarantee that
everything is possible.

Computer languages are logical; computers are presumed so, but aren't;
protocols are logical as well; logical spaces may be compared to
drive-space; garbage-in, garbage-out; and so forth. Hacking depends on a
closed world with closed loopholes; the loopholes themselves are coherent,
logical, _there._

Codework, code writing, rides within and throughout the logical world, as
a disturbance, a sign of things to come, both extension and breakdown. 

Where does the content lie? Is it in the translation of code into
messiness or residue? Is it in the interpretation of residue? Or perhaps,
and herewith a criticism, is it in the wonderment, confusion, and novelty
of the residue itself?

Is codework a minor art, minor literature? What is the point of repeatedly
shaking the scaffolding - if not the emergence, in the future, of an other
or another approach, or an other, being or organism, for which codework
now both provides augury and its weakness as portal/welcoming? For what is
come among us already no longer speaks the world of logical facts, just as
computers are no longer large-scale calculators, but something else as
well, something unnamed, fearful - that fearfulness already documented by,
say, Cruikshank in the 19th century.

Codework references the alterity of a substrate which supports, generates,
and behaves as a catalyst in relation to its production. To this extent,
codework is self-referential, but no text is completely self-referential
(sr); things waver. So for example 'ten letters' and 'two words' and
'english' may be considered sr - but only to the extent that the phrases
are presumed to apply to themselves. Extended: 'This sentence has
thirty-one letters.' - 'This sentence has five words.' - 'This is an
english sen- tence.'

What is the residue? What are the sentences 'about'? On the surface,
letters, words, language. This is an additional or diacritical relation-
ship to sr; if one, for example, didn't know english, none of these would
make sense.

All sr possesses a residue - an _attribute tag._ In codework, which has a
component of sr, the tag may be plural, muddied - the world is never
presumed complete, total. Codework is not an instance in this regard of
mathematical platonism or Godelian-platonism; if anything it relies on the
breakdown of the ideal, pointing out the meaning-component of computation,
program, protocol, even the strictest formalisms.

Early on Whitehead pointed out that 2+2 = 4, but only in a certain formal
sense; in fact, the equation implies an operation or unifying process;  
within the 4, the components are combined, their history lost. Strictly,
'2+2' and '4' are equivalent; within the symbolic, they differ - for that 
matter, in terms of thermodynamics as well. This domain is expanded by 
codework, which endlessly interferes.

The danger of codework is in its delimitation; it tends to repeat; the
works tend towards considerable length; automatic generation can flow
forever. Sometimes it appears as maw-machine emissions - text in, modified
text/partial code out. Sometimes it extends language into new uncharted
territories. Sometimes it references the labor and/or processing of
language. Sometimes it privileges the written over the spoken, or portends
the spoken within a convolution of stuttering and close-to-impossible
phonemic combinations. Sometimes it appears as a warning against the all-
too-easy assimilation of linguistic competency. 

Sometimes it breaks free, relates to the subjectivity behind its produc-
tion, the subjectivity inherent in every presentation of symbol-symbolic.

Worldsex

... 'lying together, look over your lover, it's the face of the other,
it's the face of an other' ...

Let us take for granted that online and online(offline) sex (as a result
of online sex) are prevalent and transforming, for those who can afford
the proper connections, bandwidth, and time. Let us take for granted as
well that these sexualities occur within a stadium of exhibitionisms,
voyeurisms, seductions, of, and in relation to, others - that there is
almost always a shuddering or splitting of bodies, a shattering of bodies
dividing as a result of intrusions of mass-communications and machine-
mediated perception into what used to be private domains.

Let us further look at the history of personal historical knowledge, the
history of private or personal lives, including ancestors, antecedents,
descendents, traditions of naming, and the naming of others. We might note
that in online or online(offline) sexuality, there is the _absent or
disconnected_ population, the disenfranchised population, the refugee or
hungered populations, the violated populations, who are neither conscious
or operative as such - the miseries of underdevelopment playing a large
role in this. Let us note our own role in these populations, our own 
belonging, our own violence as another arm of voluptuousness.

History resides, if anywhere, within the disconnected population; it is
within connectivity and the continuous production of history, that history
itself disconnects. There is reality without reality tv; there is tv with 
reality tv. Countries bomb countries they cannot place on a map; no two 
people ever speak the same language in the coupling of bodies.

Everything I am saying is a myth, lie, only to point out that online,
online(offline) sexualities don't occur in a vacuum; they're against the
background of others, of the erasure of history and the weakening of
political posturing, of the almost continuous splitting of bodies,
of the introjection and projection - 'jectivity' of others to the extent
that identities are problematic, exchanged/renamed/stolen/intensified -
that the politics in all of this are lost in orgasm, that there's no
turning back, that we're all heading towards fucking armageddon -

ii

It's Worldsex: Do you recognize your own prosthesis? The turmoil of bodies 
tends towards no bodies at all; the computer screen is already sexualized 
as you can hardly keep your hands on the keys. Eyes float in relation to 
proferred images. Perhaps this is already a form of war.

Falling in Love Online (part of an article published in Tamil)

Here you are, happily married, with two children. Your husband has a great
job and you're a little bit bored and so you join some Internet communi-
ties, just to relax. You find yourself chatting away about some recent
novels you've read, and you complain that your husband really doesn't have
much time to read, and isn't all that interested anyway.

Before long, someone starts talking to you; Sagdish tells you that he,
too, reads a lot of novels, but he lives alone and has no one talk to, and
he likes poetry as well. You begin chatting with him more than with anyone
else - before this, you had flitted from conversation to conversation, but
now you find yourself drawn in.

You log in late at night, and every time you do this, your heart skips a
beat, hoping Sagdish will be there, and he usually is. You start talking a
bit more intimately with him - about the fact that you can't really relate
to your husband's business, and you feel lonely every so often, and he
says that he feels lonely too.

One night your husband comes in and finds you typing away at the computer
and he asks, what are you doing? You answer, nothing, just talking to some
people, and for the first time you find yourself hiding something from
your husband - that something is Sagdish. You realize you've crossed a
line somewhere, but you don't feel it's all that serious - after all, it's
only the Internet, and there's nothing to lose or gain - it's just a game,
and Sagdish helps take your loneliness away.

You decide to be more careful when your husband's around - you don't
really want him to question you any more about this. And you look more and
more towards those chats with Sagdish, who is becoming part of your life.
You find yourself exchanging email with him, and you wait nervously every
day for his email and the chats. You begin dreaming about him.

One day he asks what you look like, and you describe yourself, but you
don't have a picture online. He persists, and you say you'll send him one,
an extra one that you just happen to have. You mail it to him when your
husband's not around, and Sagdish puts his picture on the Net, and you go
and look at him, and your dreams begin taking more and more shape.

You find yourself telling Sagdish everything, things you have never told
your husband - things you could never tell him. You find yourself doing
this quickly; all this activity has lasted only a month, and even though
you're usually shy, you're quite aggressive with him. You confess that sex
with your husband hasn't been all that good, and Sagdish asks you the
details.

Somewhere around this time, another line is crossed; you begin writing
sexually to each more, more explicitly than you ever thought possible. You
become more and more nervous around your husband and children, who guess
that something is wrong, and don't know what to do about it. You insist to
yourself that everything is a game, but you won't talk about it to your
family, and you begin to feel isolated in the house.

Your husband confronts you angrily, and demands that you tell him what is
going on. You mention only that you have this friend Sagdish, who helps
take away your loneliness when your husband is at work, and your husband
demands that you stop writing and talking with him online. At first you go
along with this, and don't contact Sagdish for a couple of days. And then
you go back, as usual, almost as if you're addicted to a drug.

Your husband gets angrier and angrier with you, and you don't know what to
do. You write about all of this with Sagdish, who begs to telephone you
and talk about it directly.

One day, Sagdish calls, and you find yourself in love with his voice, and
you talk for over an hour. He calls any number of times after this, always
when your husband is out and another line is crossed. You believe that
Sagdish is the only person who understands you, even though you have never
met him in person. Sagdish fills your dreams and your life. 

One day your husband walks in during the day, and you are on the phone.
There is a huge fight, and he walks out, and moves to an apartment in the
vicinity. You are alone with the children, and a few days later, you meet
Sagdish for the first time, in real life.

For BC, of Electric


Things stick, split like static electricity. My hair's blown off my body
for motors, electric relays, turned carbon and sufficient electricity for
a central server. There's no reason why the electric motor harnessed
magnetic lines of flux, rotation. Switches going down as "rolling shutdown
of electricity" collapse the top of which the machine was in level three
saving mode and so electricity for what purposes? For the moment of
electrical energy. Looking, the light is always fading, I'd like to run
away from electricity, there's not much that uses electricity.

For the edges of the holes, exteriors of the wires like static electrical
out, and while electrical current has occasionally flickered in big storms
the electric-transformer odor that indicates the fury of distant fires
comes dry, joy in each and every sign, and enough electricity - surely -
to last the growth of world-wide shack cultures.

The strategies, and_electric media_ (loudspeaker, telephone, telegraph),
because stress-related faults sever conduits, breaking connections. So I'm
staying in this house now. And next door the electricity is off and elec-
tricity flicking in black shore void house void black ice and void black
wind black rain; I leave before electric howling knives ferment. You love
lightning in the sky. The phone interrupts the voice; "Jennifer" turns
into electric crackle, someone responds. Phone interrupts the voice, maya
stepping over the electric heater, taking another left, pwd takes me to a
turning to the right, stepping over the electric heater, to the television
in the electrical century. Film has disappeared; chips have become part of
a whisper of a darkened cinema when the imagination connects, electricity,
magnetism, or X-rays.

Electrical drops; - what drops, splatters - one might say, almost zero
words wired to electrical wonders not yet evidenced on the way from where
electrical technology is in full swing, and where, in the roar of electri-
cal-technological machinery, the enframing electric heater (two out of
three bars on) to my right, newly-repaired moisture in the genkan. There
is a three-bar electric heater in here as electrical electronic device.
Not always well. Anyway, think of his use of battery power because the
storms are coming again and there's electric The house is without elect-
ricity, gas, water and sewer; apparently "electric current" - I will be
that "electric current."

Nothing but electricity coming in, filling the box with noise.

(The electric fluttered like her thick heart beneath her ribs and heavy
beating come forth from the walls, hardened electricity, ready to burst.  
As the air filled with ozone, electric sparks arced from its sockets, a
power skein of poor shielding. The early electric was _rotary,_ conserving
forces, electricity is a mode of motion of the molecules of matter.  
'Light, heat, electricity, magnetism, motion, are all qualitatively
different; the 'electric' of 1900 was not the 'electric' of 1930, nor that
of 1999. On the other hand the power inherent in objects - St. Elmo's
Fire, the electrical energy spewing from mind - heavy electric motors,
AC-DC, power-mind. Losing my mind to power: a form of connectivity (think
of electric); relation is defined across it - the breaking of a link
(think of electric); the thing breaks into two.

Report: We must see to it that every factory and every electric power
station - a dense network of electric power stations - don't exist. It's
as if we're pure electric, ghosts in real life, electric, ghosts in real
life. It's as if we're on the wrong end of language...

Use electricity nowadays, said Nikuko, and the mountains disappear. The
light is always fading, I'd like to run away from electricity - the lure;
you can see almost all of me now, installed to play with.

It was a century of burgeoning electrical, then electronic, communications
themselves under yet another attack, that of electrical-electronic media,
by compressed air, the compressor running on electricity, plugged into the
socket, and the electric wire going from the compressor to the socket.

Electric/electronic - an inversion in which (for me) their rewriting, on a
continuous basis, the history of the electrical world even sound-matter, -
not excluding caloric, electric matter, &c. Throughout the century, mech-
anism gives way to electricity, is a lie. I am electric and there are none
here within me.

works really well.

There is tension in approach. I see her throat, pale and beautiful in this

I run the wire over the wire, producing electricity for my house. The
story of the electricity. The federals know but we vote for them. The
electricity, but we managed. You can see the smoke marks. There are
electric conundrums - a lie or mockery, an occasion - applying the body or
