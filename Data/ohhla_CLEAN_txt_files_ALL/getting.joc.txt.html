That right~! Talk to 'em; let's go
I'm getting to da money twenty-four seven, ain't shit changed

I'm takin federal chances to make the bezel dance
Bitches lookin at me makin sexual advances

Got murder men for hire now the (MURDER RATE UP)
If snitches on the block, now the (TIP WAY UP)
Block E-N-T bitch (YOU CAN'T FADE US)
Keep the stacks in my momma attic, blow in the basement (shhhh)
Hellafied lawyers make you say where the case went
When it's showtime, pay them haters no mind
I can make my money flip fo' times in no time

[Chorus]

[Mike Carlito]
Every since I was a young boy nigga movin them G-Units
Got the whole city supplied with packs, and that fruity
Pop the trunk, money bags and crack, I keep it movin
Shake the stack, nigga chopper go BRRRAP, at your medulla
Who you niggaz know, get money like me Mr. Sun Choice
Keep them pots of boiling water straight drop, so place your order
Got them bricks I'm comin for ya, credit card to the savings
Tie your wife up in the basement, hundred thou' where you lay
Plus I, get to da money like casinos
A young, Robert DeNiro, six K off in the earlobe
Ahh - you know it's Carlito's Way, I hold that pimp yay
Girl and boy, fuck the drop, fake niggaz I can't employ

[Chorus]

[Gorilla Zoe]
Yeah, yeah
Shorty who you bank with - the streets of America
Who you roll with - the dope boys and dope girls I'm tellin ya
What that Chevy sittin on - oh it's them deuce-deuce Derringers
What about yo' connects - Pablo from South America
Where you stash the money - that shoebox in the closet
How you move the work - I buy it and you haul it
How you handle hoes - my nigga you call it
Tell 'em how the game goes - keep ballin and stop stallin
Eenie meenie miney moe the Phantom or the Lambo'
Pop the trunk niggaz got straps like I'm Rambo
And Zoe is getting money, know it when they see it nigga
I'm here now, you're old news, yeah this my season nigga
