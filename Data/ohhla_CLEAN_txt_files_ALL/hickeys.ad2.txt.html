Song:   Hickeys Around My Neck
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Milk]
I, always hated hickeys all around my neck
But it was feelin pretty good so what, the heck
The hickey went on, and I went home
I tried to brush it off then I used a comb
The comb didn't work it got bigger, and redder
Giz said, "Yo Milk man you shouldn'ta let her"
But I did Giz, and now I gotta get it off
I tried lotion but it just got soft
The hours went on, and on, and on
Man - I wish the hickey was gone
But it wasn't, and, my girl was comin over
I needed a plan, to try to get over
So I called King of Chill I said, "What's up man?
Got a hickey on my neck, I need a plan"
He said, "Yo Milk why don't you bust a turtleneck?"
I said that's wack but what, the heck
I ran to my room but I couldn't find one
Then like Star Trek, _The Search_ begun
I ran through my house from the bottom to the top
I got a bright idea, I'll ask pop
I ran to dad, I said, "What's up D?
I need a turtleneck, to cover this hickey"
He said, "Oh son that just won't work;
you'll feel real hot and you'll look like a jerk"
I said, "Okay - then what's your advice?"
He said, "Go into the freezer, and get a piece of ice"
I said a piece of ice, to put on my neck?
It sounds real cold but what, the heck
I went into the freezer, and did what he said
I hope it would 'ork, or else I'd be dead
I put the ice on and I waited, and waited
The hickey was gone - it faded, it faded
The time was then for my girl to appear
At the count of three, what did I hear?

One.. {*scratch*}.. two {*scratch*} three

It was the bell, as you can tell
As I opened the door, my eyes did swell
As I, saw somethin I thought I never would see
My girl chillin there with a great big hickey
I punched her in the mouth her lip I did wreck
That's how I felt so what, the heck?
What, the heck?
