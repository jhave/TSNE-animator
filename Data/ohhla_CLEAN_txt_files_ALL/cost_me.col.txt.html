Song:   Cost Me a Lot
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
What can I?
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot
It's cost me a lot

[Verse 1: J Cole]
Just one of them days
A nigga feel like flossin'
A Stone Cold Stunna, victim Steve Austin
Cool as Drew Breeze, I'm blowing a few G's
Just to hear them hoes say he's awesome
He's awful, yeah remember when ya fronted on me
Pulled up beisde me in that big body and stunted on me
Or when the bouncer just announced that it was bottle service only
Then he kicked me out the line, yeah he punted on me
Well look I'm back bitch, back with an attitude
Buying out the bar, cause I feel like this the shit I gotta prove
Last year the cashier told me my card was not approved
Now I'm tipping the server a hundred to show my gratitude
Easy, told you I'd be back baby, I guess you ain't believe me
Now I'm living just like the niggaz you see on TV
VIP feeling like this club oughta thank me
I hit the bar just so y'all can see I'm ballin', HD

[Chorus]
(It's cost me a lot)
Big chains, big whips with wood grain
(It's cost me a lot)
My God, my watch make momma think someone might rob
(It's cost me a lot)
Fast life and till the gas light
Copped the type of shit you couldn't get at half price
(It's cost me a lot)
Look but don't touch motherfucker, think twice
(It's cost me a lot)

Now I don't love no material things
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)
Now I don't love no material things
But I'm in love with the feelings they bring
I got em like damn (how, how, how he do that)
Damn (how, how, how, how he do that)

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Uh, knee deep in the game, my chain heavy
Somebody get the pilot and ask "is the plane ready?"
To handle all the weight on my shoulders we taking off
Don't wanna meet Aaliyah but yet I can't take it off
Cause how I'm supposed to shine without the proper bling
Remember when I did a show with Waka Flocka Flame
Felt naked cause the boy rocked about a thousand chains
Guess we rock a lot of ice cause we got a lot of pain
That's 5 hundred years of selling, I'm tryna tell em
Jacob the Jeweller is cooler now he a felon
Jay put a stamp on the nigga but wouldn't nail him
If he could'ntsell him, so what that tell him huh?

My chain heavy and my bitches look very thorough
Must be the money like dealing with the Jerry curl
White Range, call that Motherfucker Larry Bird
I got em hanging on every word

[Chorus]</pre>
