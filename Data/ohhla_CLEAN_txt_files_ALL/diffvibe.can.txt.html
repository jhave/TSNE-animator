Typed by: bootleg210@msn.com

[Chorus]
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A.
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A.
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A.
Doop-doop da-da..
It's a whole different vibe when you in L.A.

[Verse 1]
Yeah, cruisin down Melrose, hella slow in a yellow Marinello
Lookin for who sells shelltoes that I could match with my silk robe
I'm like Hugh Heffner at 26 years old, with clear goals
Yeah I'll take two pair of those
I love the way my toes feel in the cyberfoam soles when I'm doin shows
Who knows, I'm prepared to go to and fro
All I do is tell you dudes where the Western Union dough
You need my social security info?
Here's my tax I.D. number, it's worth ten fold
I remember my first album, it shipped gold
That's a insult, considering I did this one in Kinko's
I'm dying to see what this will sold
Will the critics diss it at all, or will they feed 'Bus to the wolves?
Like I haven't been there before,
but at least I'm on a different vibe now, this year it's on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's definetly a different vibe west of the Prime Meridian
Producers play with live instruments, rhymes are wittier
But don't sleep cuz in a heartbeat Cali is shittin ya
Someone'll put a hit on ya, this'll be where they bury ya
I think it's beautiful, I don't want to be scarin ya
The women are prettier and the climate is superior
Got a girl from Syria, smells like strawberries on her period
I'm serious - that's why I moved in with the chick
We on the top of Mount Olympus, sharin our interests
over a moonlit dinner, burnin some insense
She looks so innocent, next think I know she's pinnin me to the bed
like a scene outta Basic Instinct
Bought her a pink mink and a double link ring
She didn't know I was a rapper and I did my thing-thing
What a coincidence, she listened to Eminem and Nsync
Shaggy, Nelly, and the St. Lunatic clique, Uh-Ohhhh!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah baby, Canibus in the flesh
Everybody want a dose of me, come here baby stand close to me
Take a photo with me, take this address
If you develop 'em post one to me
If you miss me and you wanna kiss me then blow one to me
I like your incentricities, tailor-fitting jeans
Tennis bracelets from Tiffany's in Venice, Italy
Are you from the Middle East? (Oh)
I plan to travel there after my new release
I got Timbaland doin some beats
Yeah, his cousin goes to school with my neice
By the way I'm sorta starred, what kinda food do you eat?
Yeah sure hop in the car, we'll cruise the streets
Around here I know alotta cool places to eat
You off from what, noon to three, just roll with me
My homie Lou just two-wayed me from Lagoona Beach
You can meet the rest of the crew, a bunch of super freaks
We got to unwind, we 'bout to hit the road in two weeks, c'mon

[Chorus]

Doop-doop da-da..   [repeat to fade]</pre>
