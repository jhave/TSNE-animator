(Skee-Lo)
Bonsai and oh my
Yippee Kai yai yay
Hello, hello, hello
Hooray, hooray, hooray
I am here to interrupt your regular program
So hey man now don't you touch that dial
Unless we step in single file  
Keep it pretty slowly
Cause you know I like to focus on the ease 
And you can call me Skee if you please
So come on in, come on in 
Come in and give a pound mix and mingle with your friends 
Or just have a drink or just sit down
Get up stand up come on throw your hands up
If ya girl is throwin fronts then your brothers keep your chin up
Be cool with the flexin she's in the mood for sexin
You could pop the question but that's just my suggestion
And when the mood is right we can switch it off to candle light
But hold on to your girls cause if you don't well then I might
I know that you just might be in the mood-a 
To want to shoot a spark into the dark 
But this is just a start

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on 

(Skee-Lo)
Thinkin back black yo I could remember that high school flame
Now was it Nikki or Lorraine yo what was her name
Anyway she was so cute that back at school I tried to rock it
But she often put her purse to any brothers tryin to knock it
So stop it to get with I got with 
But what's this was honey just fakin it that kept me from my ducats 
Now the rain has gone I can clearly see
What was we enemies?
Not for long alone is what she wants to be
But what am I to do, what am I do to?
What would you do if you were in the same shoes?
With a bunch of bad news from my hoodrat
Sorry but I gotta scatter I'm movin from the East to the West
So please say God Bless and oh yes see I miss her very much
I wish that I could give her my number so that she could stay in touch
I wonder if she remembers me and what went on 
And if she does not understand word is born I'ma keep holdin on

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on

(Skee-Lo)
Well hello my honey ?dips?
See I'm back from my trip
All the letters you wrote I kept
Do you remember when I left?
I said, "I'm leavin on the next plane 
Don't know when I'll be back again" 
Kiss me, smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go my little trick-a-dee
Cause life is what you make as we take it as reality
Now we're reunited and it feels so good
You know were reunited and it feels so good
Through the centuries of time heal the rhymes and unwind
Melodies flowin swift with the jazz fill
Kill the lights move in closer to your loved ones 
Baby hold em tight like tomorrow never comes
Gaze into the eyes sympathise not the sympathy
Me and Mrs Jones got a marriage going on understand me
Everything is dandy so what can be wrong 
And if you now know the song then sing along  

(Chorus)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
(My word is true)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on
(I'ma keep holdin' on)
I'll keep holdin' on
I'll keep holdin' on</pre>
