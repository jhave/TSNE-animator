Punishment is painfull when you know that you deserve it
It's like a hustla on a clucka let me show you how I serve it 
Nigga I see you, it's the tall bald eagle
Representin somethin but you respresentin seagull
Pigeoun! Yeah you's a dirty flyin rat
You carbon copy cattapiller or should I say fax
Relax and get jacked like that nigga in Menace
Fuck around patna and get smacked like a tennis
Ball! Man did my niggas juss call?
It's 911 it's yo nigga Dre Dog
So nigga fuck around and get cut like a canteloupe
Try ta run and get chewed up like a cheetah on a anteloupe
Payback's a motherfucka sour dope deal
Targets make noise like a mutilated seal
Dead with a scared look on they face
1995 it's a cocaine race
The Firm! 
Mothafuckas doin that sherm
Slug ass niggas get treated like a germ
So when you see me nigga you'll refer to me as mista
Or brother in law nigga cause I'm fuckin yo sista

More bass!
And it goes like that
More bass!
And it goes like this
More bass!
And it goes like this
More bass!

Yeah, I chews gum and beef jerky
Eats chicken and turkey
Nigga you might wound me but you neva will hurt me
He's cut! 
The left eye's all fucked up!
One hitta quita got em walkin like a drunk! (hehehehe)
Skunk and a blunt nigga all rolled up
Tug boat nigga in the sea juss sunk
I'm a yacht
Mothafucka gimme what you got
All packed in like them nappy dreadlocks
Sardines, all cluckas get that cream
And ta get it outta you, man I fucked up
Raise up! 
That paybacks pimp's on the hunt
Darker than a tinted window, quiet like a monk
I wanna hear ya cry so I ain't gonna pop ya
I wanna see ya scream right before I drop ya
So check this out mothafucka when I got ya
I'm gonna knock the wind up out ya
Panic!
Mothafucka yeah it's the indo mechanic
Quick until ya start this
Colder than the arctic
Step up in the mind of a creep thief artist
Hungry for the bankroll
Stripes like a sergeant
And that's a piece of my mind</pre>
