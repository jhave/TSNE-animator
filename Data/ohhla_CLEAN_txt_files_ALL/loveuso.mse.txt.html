[Mase] 
Yo, now hum all you want to and all the simple hits 
Move, Cuda love, straight out the tenements 
Drop the joint with Puff Dad just finished it 
Would have did more without censorship? 
Talk to plenty chicks, on to many flicks 
Love when a girl say they wanna skinny-dip 
Call room service, tell 'em to send it quick 
Want gritz, don't forget, put cheetoes in my
Chill with the fellas that I came in it with 
Buy 'em all minks before December hit 
Player like Mase revoke your membership 
Cuz this a balla club that come with benefits 
They'll reminisce when lady used to dis 
Now everywhere we go all the hoes generous 
They must think Mase is on the rush limited
Dusty denim tip, is still the main chick

1 - 	Ooh Mase I love you so
	Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
	I can't keep my eyes off you 
	Ooh Mase I love you so
	Never, ever, ever gonna let you go 
	I hope you feel the same way too 

[Mase] 
Uh, uh, now ladies say he has this 
Tendency to B.S.'s for girls who put key scratches 
On brand new coups or E-classes 
Jet for ya'll, before I do a federal charge 
Name incorporated, no problem gettin' cars 
Whole entourage in the Mount Airy Lodge 
When you very large, never spend cheddar, you charge 
Get my daily menage , Halle Berre massage
Different color Benz in every garage 
Who would've thought? '95, earth spinned twice 
Mase be Billboard's hot merchandise 
Player like me must deserve this life 
Every girl a trick kid, if you work her right 
My click bubble, why you wish me trouble, so aight 
Bad Boy gonna have to shit you double 

Repeat 1 

[Mase]
Yo, if you never had a man than why try me? 
Niggas outta town wanna learn my G 
Understand me, the baller I be 
Need about three pages and caller ID 
When I come around, all the waiters get jippo 
Wanna serve Poppy, him a big tipper
Leave the restroom about six strippers 
Don't watch me, flip up your zipper 
I'mma good fellow, mellow 
Though I puff trees my teeth never yellow 
Hello, in the club jingle like I'm Jello 
With the kids, big as Tickle Me Elmo 
Next summer, stretch Hummer for the whole state 
Anything, buy no cake hold no weight 
I you ain't really seen Mase in the gold 8 
I really think it's time that you relocate 

Repeat 1
