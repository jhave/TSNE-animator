[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm sittin' real tall in my '69 drop
The Superman Chevy I'm too clean to stop
Make 'em lean and rock with it
I know I'm the shit
My police bitch take care of the tickets that I get
I used to ride spinners but too many niggaz got 'em
This Phantom cost a quarter mill I could do without 'em
I think I'm about to pop a pill get on that Patrone
I made enough today I can leave the block alone
These hos love a nigga so they playin' on my phone
She said I didn't speak when I seen her I did her wrong
I told her I was high the Kush had me in the zone
But call me when you home
And ain't got no clothes on
Mink on the floor, and Chinchilla on the seats
Theres wood on the door and theres room for a freak
See my clique kind of small cause I never did forget
That when a nigga was broke ya'll didn't give me shit
Bitch

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I know I'm the shit you ain't got to tell me
So when I'm in the club ho, tell me what you see
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
We don't even dance homie all we do is this
Make them bitches hate every chance that we get
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G

[Verse 2: Lil Murda]
See I don't sweat a bitch and I don't love hos
But I got to give mama my number before the club close
I told her "I'm a thug" she said "I love those"
A razor in her purse, and I got my snub nose
Drink in my cup, heat tucked on my waistline
I wish a motherfucker would try to take mine
How you want to act?
Nigga we could make it crack
We ridin' no seatbelts yeah but we strapped

[Verse 3: Hi-C]
Bitch 94 Ruger is that motherfucker gray?
Yeah, with the rubber grip look how I spray
A wicked ass nigga from Ten-A-Key
The rims say "Whats Up?", pants sayin' "Lick Me"
I swing through the hood give my real niggaz love
Diamonds lookin' like Michael Jackson's glitter glove
I'm hungry for this paper so I guess I'm fiendin' grub
Deuce in my boot when I ball up in the club

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I know I'm the shit you ain't got to tell me
So when I'm in the club ho, tell me what you see
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
We don't even dance homie all we do is this
Make them bitches hate every chance that we get
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G
I'm a G
Motherfucker I'm a G
I'm a G

[Young Buck]
Do it like a G
Nigga do it like me
Do it like a G
Nigga do it like me
Do it like a G
Nigga do it like me
Do it like a G
Nigga do it like me

Shorter than a midget on his knees
