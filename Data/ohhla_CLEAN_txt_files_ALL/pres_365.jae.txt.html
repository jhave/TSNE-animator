Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I'm all for presidents to represent me
Smoke something for a real nigga
Yea
Said I'm all for presidents to represent me
I'm all for presidents to represent me
Yo yo
Check me out yo

[Verse 1]
She said she would've hit me while she was a MIA
But she flew out here with her man
And in reprise said that situation's too normal
So baby girl I fully understand
We all creepin for all sorts of reasons
But ain't God I trust in money I believe in
On a paper chase, why these niggaz sleepin?
Cause they still bringing money while these niggaz sleeping
Every rapper in the industry beefin
But as far as that go homie I'm vegan
If you can't put 20 racks on a nigga today
You shouldn't be going to war anyway
But you can't tell these young niggaz nothing
All they care about is true religions, new J's and fuckin
But all I care about is that Ferrari with the button
If they don't feel me, motherfuck em
Buzzin

[Chorus]
I'm all for presidents to represent me
I said I'm all for presidents to represent me
Baby I'm all for presidents to represent me
I said I'm all for presidents to represent me

Millzie
Check me out tho

[Verse 2]
Money make the world go around
In the stack of it, I make a nigga curl go down
I learned that when I started getting it
Connects started to give it to me for when he was getting it
Yea, no tax no middle man
Just a I95 in a minivan
I'm a Harlem nigga, so that hustle in me
I'm a Harlem nigga, I adjust to envy
Too well, it's all way too familiar
When yo new coupe mack silver and all the women feel you're me
And why don't we poppin bottles, livin life on the high
Fuckin rappers' baby mothers and basketball wives
I be walkin through the airport, basketball fly
Jordan shorts, NBA socks, red sway 5's
No store Bostons, bitch I'm tailor-made fly
Until the day I die, just don't ah

I'm all for presidents to represent me
Now bring back the beat

[Chorus]
I'm all for presidents to represent me
I said I'm all for presidents to represent me
Baby I'm all for presidents to represent me
I said I'm all for presidents to represent me

[Outro]
Life good
Yea
We just tryin to get this money all day
By any means necessary
Kids gotta eat
Feel me?
I'm all for presidents to represent me
Millz
Yea</pre>
