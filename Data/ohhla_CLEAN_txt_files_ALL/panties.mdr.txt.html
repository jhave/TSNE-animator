I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off

(Mac Dre)
Hip hop, the hibbit to the hibbit 
Add Mac Dre and a lil' wiggy wiggy
Can you dig it? Or is it too explicit?
When I knock at the door she don't ask, who is it?
I'm bringin' Bridget, Rolanda and them
Tryin' to get a workout like I'm in the gym
Keep cumin' again, again and again
I done spent too many years in the pen
I'm livin' again doin' what I wanna
When I'm feelin Keith Sweatish, and I wanna
I'm in the sauna like a family boss
Quit trippin' take them panties off

I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off 
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off

(Vital)
It's a Friday night and I'm feelin' horny
Hopped out the whip with two chicks on me
All eyes on me, when I stepped on in
I saw all eyes then when I stepped on in
What's up girlfriend how bout you and friends
Meet me at the VIP in about five minutes
Freaky shit, yeah I'm with it
I gets live when I got drugs in me
Feel me, I'm like that 6-man touch
Feel me, all females get touched
Exhibit, I make women's thongs come off
I get a hard on from seein' all skin no cloth

I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off 
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off

Mac Dre:
Aight we done broke the ice
You drunk then smoked hella blunts tonight
Cut the crap now, I aint with this square shit
I told you way back I'm a playa biatch
You want a man, but I'm not the one though
I just wanna hit that ????? mundo?
Oh what you thought, this a dumb date?
Pump fake,  I ain't bitin' on that bum bait
Quit the horseplay and the monkey business
Let me call Rich, so we can pop some thizz's
Lets go handle some grown folk business
Ain't nothing wrong with getting it on for a minute
Lets go home for a minute, do the woopty wop
Let a cutthroat show ya, what he'll do to ya
I'll say it real slow so you can hear
Get buck naked lose the ear

I wanna know if you wanna get it on
Baby let me take yo' panties off 
And if you feelin' mile high
And you wanna take a ride
Baby let me take yo' panties off</pre>
