Song:   Get Fresh Hev
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Get fresh Hev (say what) and do the beatbox (say what)
Get fresh Hev (uh) and do the beatbox (aight)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev (check me out) and do the beatbox (check me out)
Get fresh Hev (say what) and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox!

[Heavy D]
Midnight, candlelight, hot wax drips on ya back
Dom P, empty, Cristal it's on it's way I don't play
I'm dead serious, aiyyo I mean this
Straight up ugly face in exotic places
My erotic taste is, outrageous, upstages, the bravest
of lovers, but this one's overweight, Waterbed, now get it straight
Sade' CD, killin me softly
You know Victoria's Secrets but speak it cause you want me
DK, PJ's, BKNY is where you stay
Always lookin lovely when you walk around my way
My boo be crispy, forever jiggy, forever with me
Half Puerto Rican (ay papi) ay mami

[Chorus]
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no question)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no doubt!)
Get fresh Hev, and do the beatbox (no question)

[Heavy D]
3 A.M. creeper, crawler, official baller
Hit me on my beeper, this is word to my sneaker
This shorty's dynamite, she's a shook one from Brooklyn
But I represent the Vernon (THE VERNON?) yeah money-earnin
Now 4th Street park after dark is DANGEROUS
Might get clapped, if you look STRANGE TO US
My main objective is to check, the sex
The Rolex, the lucci, Versace Coogi Gucci
Chicks dig me (no question) chicks love me (no doubt)
They be all up in my house nigga, now what's that all about?
Here's what I like - 138, that's 69 twice in one night
Who's jiggy, Heav' Diggy, no question
My sessions in sex, leave the honies perplexed
And I don't mean no disrespect but keep it warm and get ya freak on

[Chorus]

[Heavy D]
Well it's that big kid, with the gold front grin and, 600 Benz
Low pros, chrome rims, Manhattan condominium
Now I imagine scoopin dimepieces at beauty pageants
Protect your fertible, sex convertible, Lex and a Rolex
Content, on how to get jeans, I know thieves and criminals
Buff thugs who show love, backrubs from dimes and dub
Hotties with narcotic bodies, my style is urgent
A rap merchant, a major player with flavor
Well it's the H-E, you see me, A-V-Y, that be me
The dress code a pain, some things never change huh
I stay with bigness, sir jigness, who's in this
I win this hand's down I get down, for this crown

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
