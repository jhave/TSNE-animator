Album:  Down With the King
Song:   Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	Never let a punk get away with murder
	Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
	What's up?  What's up?  What's the word up?
	Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
	Ooh, whatcha gonna do (4X)

[D.M.C.]
A vain from my brain means I'm causin em pain
Comin rough with the stuff that's just a part of the game
The rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam
So I'ma pull my jammy out and I'ma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows
I said mine, headline or deadline
You see redline, here comes your bedtime
I lay it down, lay it low
Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow
I flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son
fill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one

	Never let a punk get away with murder
	Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
	What's up?  What's up?  What's the word up?
	Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
	Ooh, whatcha gonna do (4X)

[Run]
Now mic check and respect, come correct, and I can protect
You never knew (DJ who?)  DJ Run'll wreck
hard, God, may be dope you never knew me nope
Where you been your hand is sendin DOWN, can you really cope?
Forever makin and breakin it and cold wreckin it
As for my title it's vital, you're never TAKIN it
I throw a stand across the stage and you'll get BUCKED down
Like Kris-One said, I fly a head you better _Duck Down_
I sold good and then plenty like ? Charlie said
Like Mike I glove it you love it and now it's for my bread
It's goin down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn NECKS, now you gettin it
I see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin weak
And now I'm flippin the script and they can hardly speak
I bust a nut then run amuck all on a sucker COOL
Now whatcha gonna do?  Whatcha gonna do?!

	Never let a punk get away with murder
	Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
	What's up?  What's up?  What's the word up?
	Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
	Ooh, whatcha gonna do (4X)

	Never let a punk get away with murder
	Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
	What's up?  What's up?  What's the word up?
	Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
	Ooh, whatcha gonna do (4X)

	Never let a punk get away with murder
	Gun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a
	What's up?  What's up?  What's the word up?
	Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked..</pre>
