Forever like...
The first time I heard Big L speak
And Biggie Smalls did a song with some niggas from street
That's when I knew it was possible
Now what I got to do?
Fuck it I'm just gonna do everything that they told me not to do
Cause I ain't got a clue
All I got is Duke
And a whole city behind me who the fuck is you?
No slack from niggas that's how they come up
In my hood they shoot so much we don't even duck. for what?
Fitted king they be like damn he to clean
My city is shawshank and I'm andy dufrain my mane
Cause once you think I'm sleeping I'm grinding
I swear I hit the turnpike like every week to go find it
Some say the kid ahead of his time
But the only thing popping is birettas and nines
In the city where niggas slit wrists? and stay rich
Nigga might have it on him but I bet he won't say shit
The realest...</pre>
