	[Wyclef]
I wanna send this one out to my vanilla ice-cream chocolate pudding pie
That stayed with me in the hood, do or die
Refugee camp

	[Sharissa]
Yeah, this one goes out to my arm and joy
My banana that never split
The one that stuck with me

	[Wyclef]
Before I had the bling bling
I thought I'd hit up in Sing Sing
Who would have ever thought that we'd be doing our thing
I know I did a little cheating
But once I got caught
I send you a parcel of roses
You sent them back and told me go to hell

	[Wyclef]
But girl you know that, you take me as I am
Even though my fam don't understand
Why I put that rock up on your hand
That's cos you take me as I am (take me as I am)

	[Sharissa] (Wyclef)
You take me as I am (yeah, I'm a take you as you are)
Even when my girls can't understand
I choose you as my man
But you take me as I am, my, my man

	[Wyclef] (Sharrissa)
You're my girl (my man)
You're my girl (my man)
You're my lady (my man)
You're my baby

	[Sharissa]
When I was rocking jelly and had a little belly
Who woulda ever thought, you'd think I was sexy
I say it with an attitude, I admit I came off rude
But still you love me, I know I get on your nerves sometimes

	[Sharissa]
And I don't know why you take me as I am
Even when my girls can't understand
I choose you as my man (my man, yeah)
Cause you take me as I am (take me as I am)

	[Sharrissa]
You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are
Even though my fam don't understand (they can't understand no, no, no, no)
Why I put that rock up on your hand (girl)
That's cause you take me as I am

	[Wyclef] (Sharrissa)
You're my girl (you're my man)
You're my girl (you're my man)
You're my lady (you're my baby)
You're my baby (my honey)

	[Wyclef]
You're the ocean that breathes that I feel when I'm blowing my trees alone

	[Sharissa]
You're the sun that shines when the darkness strikes at night

	[Wyclef]
You're the love of my life, you're my girl, you're my wife

	[Sharissa]
You're mine, and I'm yours, you take me as I am
Wait a minute

	[Sharissa] (Wyclef)
Can't believe you take me as I am, am, am, no, oh
Even when they don't understand why you love me
I choose you as my man
Cause you take me as I am (take me as I am)

	[Wyclef]
You take me as I am, girl I'm a take you as you are
Even though my fam don't understand
My people on the block, they don't understand, no, no
Why I put that rock up on your hand
Cause I take you as you are, you're a star

	[Wyclef] (Sharrissa)
You're my girl (my man)
You're my girl (you're my man)
You're my lady (you're my baby)
You're my baby (my honey)</pre>
