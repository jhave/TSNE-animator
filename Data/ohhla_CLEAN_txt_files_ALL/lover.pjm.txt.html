[Intro]
Young Money

[PJ Morton]
This argument is just gonna keep goin on.. and on
And at this point, I don't even really care who's right or wrong
Uh.. I just don't wanna fight anymore
Even forgot what we're arguing for
And if you think this is the way to be
I'm sorry, this ain't gon' work for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, I know that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose
if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go
Cause you should already know that

[Chorus]
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter

[PJ Morton]
Don't even matter, what you're seeing
Right now I just need some time so I can do some thinkin
Will this be the end of me and you? Ohh, ohh
All I know is, that I'm stressed out
Seems like you shot everything, I gave my best shot
Now it may be time for us to throw in the towel, ohh ohh

[Pre-Chorus and Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
It go, I got that gin in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
Yea, don't fight that love
Just bare/bear with me baby like a white and black cub
Girl love is a must, so don't put up a fuss
I'm hard as steel, she wet, make it rust
Whatchu know about it? And I'm so 'bout it
Girl this thing in my {pants} deserve a bow around it
Yeah, eh-heh, and all we do
is fuss, {and fuck}
Uh, don't start, honey
I put that {dick up on ya} good and make you walk funny
Yeah, PJ he's Young Money
New Orleans in this {bitch}, don't start nothin
Won't be nothin, lemme see somethin
I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I beat that {pussy} up, Tunechi!
Hah!

[Pre-Chorus and Chorus]

[Lil Wayne over Chrous]
YOUNG MULA, BAY-BAY!!
I'm a lover, girl..
I wanna go outside, wanna go outside 
In the rain, in the rain
So no one, no one, no one, no one
would know that I'm cryin, yeah
Hehe... alright..</pre>
