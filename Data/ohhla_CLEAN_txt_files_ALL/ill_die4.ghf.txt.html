Typed by: Tha Masta

[Intro: Ghostface Killah] + (sample)
(What did I do? Was the thing so bad?) It's like...
Yo, there ain't too many people I would die for
That I would lay down for, you heard...
It's like my family, my closest friends that's here in my circle
YouknowImean? My moms and 'em, my babies, man
That's word to mother, son, that's what it is...
(I'll die for you, I'll die for you) Uh-huh...
That's right, man (I'll die for you) Just some real shit...

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'll die for the prophets and I'll die for the Lord
On the battlefield, wounded badly, holding a sword
With no questions asked, I already know, it's all for the cause
Just laying me facing the East, when I'm under the floor
I might've sinned in the process, from being, in the projects
Eyes swept from all the anger, that could've fucked with my conscience
And more or less, I'm a man of my word
My body is holding a couple scars on it, though I was never a bird

[Hook: Ghostface Killah] + (sample)
For Martin Luther and my brother Malcolm (I'll die for you)
And my ancestors picking cotton (I'll die for you)
My close homies that get it popping (I'll die for you)
You what time it is, nigga what?

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I'd die for my moms, and I'd die for my kids
If you, really my Queen, then I'd die for my whiz
Even my mans, if we that tight
Jump in front of a biscuit, snuff money with all of my mics
Or we can brawl it out and take his life
By taking his gun, no problem
Just make sure we eating when we on the run
Like slaves that's chained together, who killed master?
The dogs is coming, the pigs is gon' blast ya
I'd die for you, I'd die for my brother
Die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother
I put niggaz lights out like Con Ed, my verbal is barn
My bread'll blow you, show you who's real with the arms

[Hook: Ghostface Killah] + (sample)
Dog, you want revenge on that devil Satan? (I'll die for you)
We could do it now instead of waiting (I'll die for you)
We don't have to wait for revelations (I'll die for you)
We'll sort this out in other conversations

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I'd never jump out the window, lose my life for a lame ass nigga
That scene is bogus, it's not in the picture
You just can't feed me anything like "Yo, Tone it's beef"
Expect me to go all out, jump in and bust my heat
First off, drunk, you not my peeps
Yeah, I know you, we from the same town and shit, but we ain't that deep
We never stuck nothing, oxed something, ran together, popped something
I thought ya team was Wolves, cocksucker, stop fronting
You barking like you got the town in a smash
I'd never lay down for you, faggot nigga, you ass

[Hook: Ghostface Killah] + (sample)
Wop them niggaz that be yelling that (I'll die for you)
When they broke you be heating that (I'll die for you)
Just stick 'em for they packs, they be crying (I'll die for you)
And just bitch mothafuckas burn...</pre>
