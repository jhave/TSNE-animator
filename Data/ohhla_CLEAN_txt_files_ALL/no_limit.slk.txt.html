Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yo, yo, I come into the room like I was high on dope
Shit's Bitter
Rhymes out till my mutha fucka's call time out(time out)
I'm a tank dog plus I bank yall, plus I outrank yall
Like I can't ball, what the fuck yall niggas thank dog
I ain't sure I can't fall, nigga
Bodies full of tatoos, break all the rules
Too much to lose, I can't fall
So nigga how u want me to do it, mean how ya want me to rap
Want it fast flow, ROWDY, or laid back(shit)	
So is that all you sayin nigga sayin
Play back, can't beleive you'd say that
Been doin this from way back
Just 12 missions with 4 tracks
you know that i been with the in crowd
Business style, been while
Shit fuck the dumby, fuck the money
My earrings cost ten thou.
The taller i get the moment I get, in fact
If I grow 7 feet, shit I could retire from rap
So when I go on, hardcore never go soft
Shit i'ma throw the fuck off,
Somebody call me a shrink, don't even blink, I don't think
Djuo wanna fuck with me, like that cuz I'll beet ya ass so bad boy
Won't even think bout fightin back
I'll put one in your chest, done it for less
I want the cash, none with mental stress
Don't feel love, kept my heart up under my vest
If not the coldest, atleast one of the best(huh bro)	
I say thangs people scared say, Dj scared to play
But I'm Silkk the Shocker, get my doe from underground
Add it to my scale it's another pound
