[Verse One: Sheek Louch]
Rose by the one hand, other hand rolled up
Nice True Religions on, three buttoned Polo'd up
Club's packed all the ladies happy that I showed up
It's thug love, but tonight all my dogs hold up
Dutch burnin shorty got the club in a coma
Starin at me I can tell that mami like the aroma
Fifty thousand on my neck like I ain't got a diploma
But I'm smart enough to know what I want so don't front
Come here girl!!!!

[Verse Two: Demarco]
Shorty go!!! (HEY!!!) She already got her mind made up and she ready to roll
Tip top shape thick thighs with a small waist
She's independent, she can buy her own things but I'm tryin to take her home
Gotta make her my wifey, OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
(BABY YOU!!!!) Got the baddest look
(BABY YOU!!!!) Wanna get a nigga hooked
(BABY YOU!!!!) You should be ridin 'round town in the Phantom shorty what's good?
(BABY YOU!!!!) Can't complain
(BABY YOU!!!!) Sex is her name
And I'll be watchin you (SO SEXY SEXY!!!!) So ladies put your hands up!!!!!

[Chorus: Demarco]
If you sexy and you know it, and you really wanna show it
Just show it (OH!!!!) All you gotta do is show it HEYYYYYYY!!!!!

[Verse Three: Craig] (*Demarco)
She got so much swagger (SWAG!!!) Lookin so damn good I gotta have her 
See I know what I gotta do (HEY!!!) Know what I gotta say (HEY!!!)
Them other girls don't matter
Oooh baby take your rime (Time!)
I really gotta make you mine now (Gotta make you mine)
She's the baddest chick I seen in the club (Club)
(*BABY YOU!!!!) Got the baddest look
(*BABY YOU!!!!) Wanna get a nigga hooked
(*BABY YOU!!!!) You should be ridin 'round town in the Phantom shorty what's good?
(*BABY YOU!!!!) Can't complain
(*BABY YOU!!!!) Sex is her name
And I'll be watchin you (*SO SEXY SEXY!!!!) So ladies put your hands up!!!!!

[Chorus: Demarco] (*Sheek Louch)
If you sexy and you know it, and you really wanna show it

[Verse Four: Sheek Louch]
For maybe you, I bust a little baby you
In the middle of the street while I'm carryin heat
A chance to meet, sandals I'm lovin your feet
BPM me, you can pick the place to eat
Sexy summer Louis bag the color of flowers
Hair and makeup look like it took a couple of hours
Now we sittin in that four door Panorama
Body's crazy I gotta put that ass on camera

[Bridge: Demarco] (*Sheek Louch)
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can tell you a star
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can see you shinnin from a far
(*I see you shinnin girl!!!)
(BABY YOU!!!!) The way how you rock, the clothes you got (*You heard me?)
Class and I can tell who you are (*They ain't got nothin on you up in here)
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can bet you the best (*Yeah!) 
(BABY YOU!!!!) I can tell you more nothin less
Yeah! And if you know you look good (*Yeah)
All my sexy ladies come on help me sing the rest
(*Put your hands up!)

[Chorus: Demarco] (*Sheek Louch)
If you sexy and you know it, and you really wanna show it
(*Let's go!!! Heyyy!)
Just show it (OH!!!!) All you gotta do is show it HEYYYYYYY!!!!!
(*Demarco we got one family!)
You got me lovin you girl like crazy (HEY!!!)
You got me lovin you girl like crazy (HEY!!!)
Got my heartbeat tellin you my baby (HEY!!!)
