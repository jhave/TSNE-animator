My nigga,my motherfuckin',my wodie-May'ron 
My people like used to be runnin' with up in uptown 
What I see now the game ain't for me to be in 
So I'm pretend cause niggas can't (?) (?) 
Now I'm pretend in the middle of the projects it stings 
Cause niggas trippin' they really think that they could win 
I ain't wit dat, I'ont even want em' around 
I'm a 2x loser, one more time they go around me 

[Baby](Lil' Keke) 

Wodie, platinum pieces increases 
Nigga we the Denver Broncos of this rappin' season 
Fuck dapters,Clappin season 
Nigga wanna be a baller..playboy in nappy season 
I'm the motherfuckin' shot caller 
CMB be the reason we toting they heads makin' money 
We cooking bacon,fuck the bullshit we money makin'' 
Bitch nigga daughter breakin' 
Put yo money on the table playboy 
You can't fake it (Wodie)

I just don't give a fuck either I live or I die 
Until then I'm going all out and don't ask why 
Untamed guerilla,hard head and don't listen, 
Magnolia soldiers standing black two pistols by myself 
When I come and get ya 
When I'm full of that dope nigga,I'ma split ya 
Lil' Turk bout gun play and any day nigga whatever 
Light or daytime it really don't matter 
I'm a Hot Boy fo' sho' 
I'm bout' riding, I leave yo head bust nigga 
When I start Firing 

[Lil' Keke'] 

Wodie,Woody,Wodie 
All the playas in th club-try to bounce to dis 
Throw yo roley in the air-smoke an ounce to dis 
Its Lil' Keke comission out so lonely CMG's 
And now Cash Money,now u hoes feeeling me? 
Its going now from Michi to Uptown wit clowns 
Smoke a pound e-ve-ry these haters they buying out 
When I come around ,I know a scene wit bassment 
Strictly paper chasing 
Indo we raising, for info we wrote it in pens wit green letters 
With tha tasting its (?) Blue or Gold or better its whatever 
Creeping the pen-a freestyle 
Thats a block on fire wit Turk and Juvenile 
If the gold is mine and Safaris hard don't you ever mistake 
Lil' keke and the Hot Boys 
We some worldwide players from the dirty south 
Diamonds,Gametes and rocks all up in my eye 
This fo' real-violence it takes,we get payed 
And the drop-top Twista Rosa-Let the sun hit the face...nigga 
Woody Wodie Woody.......
