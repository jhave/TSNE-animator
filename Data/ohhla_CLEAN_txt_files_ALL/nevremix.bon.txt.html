[Chorus]
So I'm outside of da club and you think I'm a puuuuuuuunk
So I go to my loaded tech 9 that's off in the truuuuuuuunk

I ain't never scared (Southside!)

[Verse 1: Bone Crusher]
Who am I???
Bone Crusher, motherfucker!
AttenCHUUUUUUUUN!!! Where my soldiers motherfucker?
I guess the fight is on, me and you nigga (ha!)
And you (wha!), and you (wha!), and you nigga! (wha!)
I ain't scared of you bitches, I'll put yo brain in stitches
This remix for real niggaz who get money to trenches
Check my resume nigga, I got that one hitta quitta
And yo boys ready to flee like "Why'd you fuck with that nigga?!?!"

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2: Cam'Ron]
I tell her front (front), back (back), side to side
Never let a punk ass nigga slide, dawg
You get beat dead, that means you dead meat
I been on Wall Street, Beach Street, *Gregg Street*
That's Dallas, Atlanta, I style with them hammers
I wild witcho nanna, doggystyle on a hamper
You'll get ripped apart, that's it with darts, you kids ain't smart
Pop, pop, pop, I lit the dark
I'm the wizard dog, come get some heart
That's courage and brain, 'caine on several strips
Not from Houston, but shit, call me +Lil' Flip+
Cuz I flip a little, fa shizzle, you flippin' nickels
When I flip coke and flip boats, come live a little
And you best be knowin', pussy still is the best thang goin'
Any extra dough, come invest in hoe'in
But I clap that boy, kidnap and wrap that boy
Clap, "We reeeeeeadddy" I'ma mastered boy like Pastor Troy
But I'm stoned sucka, with my nigga Bone Crusher
Baby, we like to bone, all our chicks are bone crushers
We got guns in coupes, in case our sun'll roof
No basketball, when we talkin', run and shoot

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Aiyyo, the 40 cal' is full and I'm waitin'
No matter what county I'm in, Dekalb, Cobb, Fulton or Clayton
Muah baby, you know who it is, the kiss of death
If the world was sucka free, it just be me and my niggaz left
I ain't neva scared, I got big hammers everywhere
In places where you need yo passport at, I'm heavy there
It's time we get even here, when I put the game back
In it's proper perspective, this time leave it there
You can think whachu want, til I blow the back of yo brains out
and see if you can think with yo front
Like a new single, make sure you leak for a month
Treat yo face like a buffet, and tell my niggaz "Eat whachu want"
You'ono nuthin' about puttin' a couple hundred thousand on the table
And tell yo niggaz "Keep whachu want"
It's usually hate or somethin' stupid that a nigga die for
So whachu think we outside for?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Now all my soldiers (soldiers), thugs (thugs), niggaz (yea!), I know you want it!
Don't stop, get it, get it, bitches betta get up on it!
Sit up on it shawty, get up on it
See when I spit up on it, shit up all over niggaz like a Harley pick up
When I throw a get-up on it
Big up, all of my niggaz that ain't scared of the hustle
Throw anotha mill up on it (yea!)
I'ma cop a lotta land and I'ma cop a mountain and throw a lil' crib up on it
Yes, I'll eat yo food and you know I'm gonna CHOW DOWN!
Mothafucka, all yo niggaz betta BOW DOWN!
Mothafucka, 'fore I have to come and POW WOW!
Mothafucka, I ain't playin' witcha
So I let my niggaz touch ya, it's a must and we gotta rush ya
Shatter bones in yo body, when I bust, I holla Bone Crusher
Let me spell it out for you homie, I hope you came prepared
Cuz I don't care if you live or phony, cuz we ain't NEVA SCARED!
Flipmode and the Dirty South niggaz know whussup
Cuz we got you open dude
Fuck that, make a lil' sucka nigga, fallin' back
Layin' stiffer than frozen food
Two stop me means you have to SHOOT ME!
Get cake in the ? GROUPIES!
Watch niggaz acknowledge the general and all SALUTE ME!

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
