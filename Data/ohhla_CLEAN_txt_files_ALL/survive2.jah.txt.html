Yo, yo, let it go nigga!
What, niggas wanna motherfuckin play games?
What? Fuckin faggot, we gon play games nigga
Yeah, Ja Rule, yeah it's Def Jam nigga
Uh, it's top dog motherfucker
 
[Verse 1]
How many niggas, gon chop the blow?
How many bitches, gonna L-O, get naked for dough?
Uh, so many questions, y'all answer this
What's your hustle? And who the fuck you represent?
When you got in the game? And where was I when you was playin?
Why the love lost? Remember son, you got put on
Like (..?..) had you layin, flippin heron
When you got greedy, I let em know to remain calm
Who you are's on the strength of my arm, and I believe
You wouldn't deceive top dog supreme team
How and why would you try to fuck us? On the real
When and where was you goin with all a that fish tail?
Nigga when you was wack and broke who boost sales?
Who purchased the L for you to roll with chrome wheels?
Can you believe the inconsideracy of some cats?
You give em a deal, they want plaques
Now if I'm wack, would I be wrong? I'm just askin
Cuz when I bag em I'm a make him breath through the plastic
 
Fuckin faggot! Yeah, Ja Rule nigga, Ja Rule, yeah
 
[Verse 2]
Ja's in a stand still, cuz niggas fail to realize
This killer instinct in my eyes, ain't to be tried
Nor denied, the fact that I sat back and watched a lotta wack 
niggas earn plaques
Congratulations, I ain't hatin
Just know my LP's in the makin
Currently waitin to holla at the nation
This world ain't ready for me
My personal thought and questions
The Gods study lessons while the weak count they blessings
Cuz money's a must, not a preference
Use my resume as a reference and gain all acceptance
You wonder why, I, disease like cancer
Cuz you ask the questions I got answers, beeyatch
 
Yeah, it's Def Jam niggas, recognize
Fuck, niggas ain't playin no games
