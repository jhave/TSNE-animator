(Lil' James)
Crawlin' through the city Benz lit with Five screens....
Europeans sticky greens 
Promethizine that make me lean, it seems like a dream 
Dressed clean with a pinky ring
Hit the button, wave the trunk, my camcorder peepin' schemes
Blades chooppin' like karate, i done streched a mazarati
Sippin drank and join my hottie, screenz stalling wide body
Swang through the subdivision, screens fall Flex vision
As I ball for postion, makin a throwed decision
On a mission expedition makin'em have a collision
With lyrical ammunition wreckin all competition
Screens fallin' when im crawlin' through the Tre down Dalton
Lane stallin', shot callin', while the trunk be haulin'
Ballin' out of control at 19 years old
Give me the remote control i seen this episode
Game's throwed, minds blowed, when its time to hit the road
Lil' James is the name, I put the "T" in throwed.....

(Chorus)
Come out to play ridin' on 4's
Turbo graphics 16 with split screens in da door
Come out to play ridin' on 4's
Stoppin' at a sto doors open and close
Screens r fallin' down 
To da ground
Like da rain like da rain

(Lil Flex)
Watch out now da screens ganna fall
Watch them kay isolated 20 inches ganna crawl
Screens fallin' down on a hot summer day
All da kids screamin, "FLEX CAN YOU COME OUT TO PLAY?"
Everything is everything watchin' color TV's 
We roll blades, e600's, 64 chevy's on knee's
Televisions on da panel screens lit up like candels
Satellites, DVD's, T Y P on each channel
Fifth hangin' off da bumper blades slicin' like shredder
8 screens in the van watchin 2 double headers
Burnin' rubber, grippin' grain, shake da block, switchin lanes
(all together) We beatin' down da block makin' resident's complain!!!!
Swangin' wide bubble eye screens fallin' like rain
Cars bouncin up and down as I slide down Main

(Chorus)
Come out to play come out come out to play come out come out to 
Play come out come out to play
Come out to play ridin on 4's
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da door
Come out to play ridin on 4's
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close
Screens r fallin down to da ground 
Like da rain like da rain

(Pooh Bear)
Marble red watch ur head, da screes ganna fall
20 inches ganna crawl known for vibratin' walls
Trunk shake, scrape da plate, down da 288
TV sets, Ricky Lake, Moesha my date
2 Story with a Pond German Rott Home Alarm
AK's dat harm we ready to rip out arms and
Tough chests with bullet proof vests
Armed and dangerous ready to kill
One arm holdin' wheel other hand grippin' steel
Screens fall 2 X 2, watchin' winnie the pooh 
Change da channel scooby doo trunk beatin' da screw
Lil' Pooh nation wide I got infinite pride
My do's be suicide, blades swirl and slide
Wreck da scene, hoes fiend, ima throwed young teen
Creased up Dressed Clean in a marble machine
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do
Steady pourin 4's do's open and close

(Chorus)
Come put to play ridin on 4's
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do's
Come put to play ridin on 4's
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close
Screens r fallin down
To da ground 
Like da rain like da rain

(Lil Flex)
Like Warren G I want it all screens fall when i crawl
We Young We hard Knockin Pictures Off Da Wall
BOOM BOOM goes da trunk caues its a hard knock life for us 
20 inches leaving cars in da dust
Its a must screens drop as I skate real fast
I be watchin' Tom &amp; Jerry proped up on glass
Lexus Cope switchin' gears when I hit St. Claire
People see me drippin' candy screens fall form da air
Or da sky ridin high look im fly Oh My!
Screens fall from everywhere make you hoes wanna cry
Me and my cousin' Lil' Jermaral in a Benz or Camero
Flippin' all through out da land lookin for Dexter and Pharoh

(Chorus)
Come out to play ridin on 4's
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do
Come put to play ridin on 4's
Stoppin at a sto do's open and close
Screens r fallin 
Down to da ground
Like da rain like da rain
Come out come out to play
Riddin on 4's turbo 
Come out to come out come out to play
Ridin on 4's
Come out to play come out come out come out come out to play
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's turbo
Come out come out come out to play ridin on 4's 
Turbo graphic 16's with split screens in da do</pre>
