[Intro]
I'ma break 'em off real bad, I'ma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin slab

[Chorus]
I'ma break 'em off real bad, I'ma break 'em
I'ma break 'em off real bad
I'ma break 'em, I'ma break 'em off real bad
I'ma show 'em pourin up a duece and ridin slab
I'ma break 'em
I'ma break 'em off real bad, I'ma break 'em
I'ma break 'em off real bad
I'ma break 'em, I'ma break 'em off real bad
I'ma show 'em pourin up a duece and ridin slab

[Paul Wall]
Now I gotta work my wood grain wheel
Poppin trunks, poppin pills, still poppin seals
High up in the hill with my mind on millz
Piece of chain swangin, bank roll, shiny grill
Baby, I got million dollar dreams, with my mind on cream
I'm in that mean green machine clean on 19s
Flat screens in the headrest, swangin like a swing set
Brandy wine, paint wet, comin down tha's a fact
I'm in the lot chasin broads like a lesbian
Full of that Kush flower, I'm breakin off pedestrians
Higher than the street lights, floatin like a parachute
Buzzin like a bumblebee, mustard green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta, mack game sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin 'em off, makin all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up fully loaded and slabbin
Tryin to hit it and quit it
Walk off like Big Papi, break 'em off

[Chorus]

[Lil' Keke]
Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck gold mist five 50 slow buddy
Bentley continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's +Expensive Taste+
And 'em friendly ass fools we send 'em to MySpace
I'ma break 'em off until the backbones broken
Stainless steel drop phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the Kush done start burnin, better cover your clothes (that's right)
Concrete crumblin, glass shootin lazers
Crawlin and cuttin up on 24 razors
I'ma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin paper in the mornin, call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on then you buckle up the seat belt
Swisha House, Young Don, capital TF

[Chorus]

[Paul Wall]
Already
Higher than the satellite, crawlin like a baby
Maneuverin through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin on 'em buttons, I'm struttin and lookin fresh
Switch hittin like Berkman, this is ballin at its best
In dat Minute Maid droppa', with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground, and the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
My skillz is so ill when workin the wood wheel
Tippin 4s like a waiter, beware of the o'erseer
Wide screen mind frame, panoramic pimpin
I'm sippin on dat Osama, baby leanin like I'm limpin
In dat 2 seater feeder, it's me and a señorita
3 ounces up in the liter, and it's ten up in the heater
Mackin a mamacita, runnin game like a cheetah
I'm knockin 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter (Break 'em off)
