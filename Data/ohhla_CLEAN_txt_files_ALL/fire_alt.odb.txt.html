[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Two steps from the border line
Anything closer will kiss the nine
Think I'm out the game? You out of your mind
Cuz I stay on track, like transit line (FIRE!)
Keep it nappy or braided up
Dirty in the cockpit, blazin' up (FIRE!)
Stop frontin' when you made it up
Tellin' all my hoes, you can't spray it up (FIRE!)
Hah, huggin' nuts like tighty whites
Still trickin' on hoes like Heidi Fleiss (FIRE!)
You know why niggaz don't give you much respect
Cuz they seen you gettin' slapped with the empty gat (FIRE!)
Know Dirt, like bow know death
When I'm huntin' down, birds in rap (FIRE!)
Hate Dog, cuz I ate your cat
And you can eat my ass and have a coke with that (FIRE!)
Use a spoon, unless you want a fork
Pull my dick out, watch the room get dark (FIRE!)
Stay high with the zombie walk
Gotta sit my ass down, like Rosa Parks

[Chorus: sample (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
FIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Let me hear it)
FIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Ohhhhhhhhh)
FIRE, FIRE-FIRE, FIRE (Let me hear it, ohhhhhhhhhhh)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What can make a hoe, look more cuter
But, Hennessey shots, and smoke more Buddha (FIRE!)
Now you hungry, wanna eat right through her
But you better first track for a noter (FIRE!)
Like does she have a best friend, or a daughter
Has she ever tried fuckin' under water (FIRE!)
Misinterpetate, let me break it down
Two pulls make the your merry go round (FIRE!)
Touch your toes, show me that rose
Butt naked, in a Wu-Tang pose (FIRE!)
Wide open, girl, everything goes
Real freaky, when you powder that nose

[Chorus]</pre>
