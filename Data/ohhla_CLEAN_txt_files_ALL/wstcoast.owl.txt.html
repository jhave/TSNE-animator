[Knightowl (Talkin)]
What up big dawg
What's poppin
What's that WT life like fool
You know it's all about
The mothafuckin crazies
Mothafuckas that want to get some
Come and try it
You can'd fade us fool
Cause those bald headed criminals
SD style
We doin it

[Knightowl]
Knightowl be the fool with the sound
I'm throwin down sick try to battle me
And stick I what I kick
You must be confused
I'm the one they talkin bout
Runnin all things flashin dope diamond rings
Pockets keep fat I got money and the gat
For those talkin smack I gotta stay straped
I'm not the one that's bout to get caught slippin
I'd rather be convicted so you must be trippin
What you thinkin bout fool
You know I be the loco
I'm still with that wicked ass vocal
Think that you can handle all them things that I bring to the table
You's a fable
Cause if it makes no money then it makes no sense
Big Ballers like me need the dollars
It be my name that you holla
As roll in a 64 Impala when I strike like a rala

[Chorus]
This ain't nothing but a west coast party
So everybody it's time to get naughty
I got the W that'll trouble you
If you think you can get some
Then fool come and gets some
(2x)

[Knightowl]
What gives you the right to come and fight me
Tongith when I'm comin through throwin up that W
It's the K to the N the I to the G H T O W L, what's that spell
The sickest of them all
Be this man that be flowin like a river
I make some shit when I deliever
MC gather round just to watch me throw down
When I bump the sound everyboy's goin down
Falsely accused now you must get abused
Drinkin on a double duece
It's the minds kinda trippin
So grab a clip and point it at my dome
Think that chrome's gonna make you chigon
Yall got a fall you want to brawl
I'm too big you be small
When I bust take that fall
West coast rocks the most
Now I'm a toast to the ghost
Of my rival no chance for survival

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
Boy you need to get rough up
You talkin smack about the dopest
The bald headed lokest
MC know my flow be incredible
My thoughts be insane when released out the brain
I'm too sick for that ass you can't comprehend
Keep mess around and it's you that'll bend
I got a style that vary raps come scary
And when they talkin bout me what they says legendary
I'm that lonely unholy "Mom's Wicked Ol Son"
That fool that begun and won't top til I'm done
So you best get away and Deigo Night out the padre
Bring hits like Tony cause the rest of you's phony
I be doin them things the way I know
When I but a flow I'm in control
Once again that untouachable
Always approachable never rushable
Unless you want to be crushable

[Chorus]

[Knightowl (Talkin)]
It's all about that wicked W
I be that fool that'll trouble you
I'll posse your mind
Doin them gangsta rhymes
Commitin crimes of the brain
Cause I be insane
I be that thug
That'll bust a slug in your dome
Chrome spits like a snake
I hit you in the back of the head witha rake
Cause I be that untouchable
Bald headed vandal
Watch your back
When I'm on the attack
Cause I give no slack
When I bust on a track</pre>
