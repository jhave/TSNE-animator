Typed by: AZ Lyrics

My life, my life. Yeah, yo, yo

Pump this tape in the deck, place the key in ignition
We won't wait in the red light, only green's in my vision
Yeah, journey to the mind again, aboard the brain
These feathers make me levitate in waterfalls of pain
Keep your fortune and your fame, mate, I'm chillin on a tree branch
Laughin at the squares drawin perfect circles free-hand
We kill the doubt, the path, the vine is limitless
My rhyme is the reason that they can't define the pyramids
Travel at the speed of light with Ceekay Jones
with full faith of where this freeway goes
A spectrum of colors, it's like our time
has come to ride high til we fly through that rising sun

Baby, it's a new day
drivin on the through way
all I see is bright green lights
Forget what you were coming
no that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life

My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do

When I wake each day, it's like a new timeless moment
The chance to steer you dry as soon as your eyelids open
I push back the path that tipped the scales
and made it to the sea in time to catch my shipped had sailed
Played the game my way, with my mind in the zone like Michael
Recite my diary like I'm flying on a motorcycle
The easyrider on that road that stretches nations
life's speeding up and all I feel's acceleration with that wind in my face
And I got that past in my back, and I got the prize in my eyes
and I got my passion intact
So I ride through the night and dream bright into the cosmos
Now all I see is green lights at every crossroads

Baby, it's a new day, drivin on the through way
all I see is bright green lights
Forget what you were coming
no that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life

My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do

Baby, it's a new day
My life, it's my life, life, life, life
Baby, it's a new day

Baby, it's a new day, drivin on the through way
all I see is bright green lights
Forget what you were coming
no that shit ain't for me
I'ma just live my life

My life, it's my life, it's my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life, my life
I do what I want, I do what I want to do</pre>
