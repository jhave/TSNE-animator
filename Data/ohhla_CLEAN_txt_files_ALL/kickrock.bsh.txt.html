Chorus: Mickael (Baby Bash &amp; Mickael)
Can you handle my love (You better kick rocks)
I'm sick of your lies (You better kick rocks)
Sick about your issues (You better kick rocks)
You ran out of time (You better kick, rocks)
You can't handle my love (You better kick rocks)
I'm sick of your lies (You better kick rocks)
I'm so down with your issues (You better kick rocks)
You ran out of time (You better kick, rocks)

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
You think you're so damn cold, you could play me at your game
While you wasting my time, girl, you so lame
Maybe you misunderstood, that's the way it go
Sayanora, adios, we finito
New number, new phone, new contact
All your pictures, I deleted all that
New whip, new clothes, new condo
You better break white and gold, kid, pronto

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
That means bounce, dip, grab your {*shit*} and get out
Cause I ain't even tryin' to hear another word out your mouth
I'm remixin', changin' your position
And no more fightin', no fussin', no more friction
Your shopping addiction, tossed out the window
This is my house, I guess you stayin' with your kinfolk
Cause you outclassed, I need you out fast
Used to be about me, now you all about trash
Baby, please don't harass, or even tryin' to stock me
I got restraining orders, baby, come and get your copy
Your game is so sloppy, messy, girl, when you text me
I don't even read it, I delete it so sexy
Ha ha
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a {*hoe*} into a housewife
And I know it don't sound right
But you can't turn a {*hoe*} to a housewife

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Mickael (Baby Bash)
Adios (Holla at ya later)
A-a-a-a-adios (I'm a see ya when I see ya)
Ah-ah-adios (But you know I ain't {*fuckin'*} with ya)
A-a-a-a-adios (Move-move-move around with that noise)
Adios (Holla at ya later)
A-a-a-a-adios (I'm a see ya when I see ya)
Ah-ah-adios (But you know I ain't {*fuckin'*} with ya)
A-a-a-a-adios (Move-move-move around with that noise)
