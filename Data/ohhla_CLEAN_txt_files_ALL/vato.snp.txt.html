Man don't you know that I'm loco

Uh-huh, hmm... I was chillin, right around my way (way!)
21st eastside of the Beach
This motherfucker ran up on me
talkin shit with his homies like he was a straight.. G
Askin where I'm from while he runnin up 
Gangbang, my set on e'ry one of 'em (true)
Some things, sons they just won't change
Fools don't respect nuttin but the gangbang (bang!)
What's seen is what's saw, Dogg is the law
I have you niggaz runnin like a marathon
Little G's tryna creep, wanna ease with it
Talkin 'bout they gon' get my chain and they gon' leave with it (nmm hmm!)
But they don't know once they get close
it's Tic-Tac Toe, three motherfuckers laid on the floor (watch out!)
Yeah, this happened yesterday
On the West they spray - I heard the esse say, he said...

[Hook: B-Real] + (Snoop Dogg)
Vato, you won't believe what I saw
I saw these pack of guys and they act real hard (and what they do?)
They twist the fingers and said, "You know who we are"
He said, "I don't give a fuck, I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg" (uh huh!)
They keep buckin and it went too far
So Snoopy, he went straight to the trunk of his car (and what he get?)
He got his gun and they start runnin hard
He started firing and then he just charged

[Break 2X: Snoop Dogg]
(BLAOWW!) Run nigga, run nigga!
(BLAOWW!) Duck nigga, duck nigga!
(BLAOWW!) Run, motherfucker run!
(BLAOWW!) Run, motherfucker run!

[Snoop Dogg]
I didn't mean to hit what I hit
Now that's three motherfuckers dead now I ain't seen shit
But these niggaz'll scream for plea
Before a G like me, it's just a case really you could see
I crack the Mac back and pop off rollin
And smack ya neck back, ya drop off, fallin
I haven't seen my momma in a week
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me
Fuck that, I ain't give a fuck about the law
Niggaz say they wanna brawl, you would think that they were brawlers
Believing all the things that you never saw
In it y'all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a Menthol
You think you know? But this can't go
You think you'll blow? On my door? What the fuck yo!
See these niggaz proceed to speed
so fulfill the need to leave or you'll hear my enemies goin...

[Hook] + [Break]

[Snoop Dogg]
I wouldn't be the nigga that I am
if I didn't pop niggaz in their mouth God... damn!
And Snoop'll keep one foot on the streets
And leave 'em covered in sheets, run with them niggaz with the heat
You never seen a thug like dis
You never seen a dub like me
And I ain't weak for wanting peace
in fact I could be "Beast of the East" motherfucker!
I never hesitate to blaze (blaze!)
A nigga really tryna change his ways
We gotta move my team, cause my peoples                    
is screaming that we need more for fun or it's illegal    
Put the bang on the song, make it feel like a drive-by (drive-by!)
It's a shame but somebody's gotta die (die!)
They see it happens state-to-state
but when I'm mobbin L.A., all I hear the esse's say - they go...

[Hook] + [Break]

[Snoop Dogg and Pharrell]

[A girl speaking]
I'm tired of hearin all that bullshit
When you gon' play some of that good shit... damn
I mean give me some like a...</pre>
