[Intro: Cee-Lo]
Oh, ahhhh {*repeat 4X, then in background through Intro*}
Give, give, give it away now
Give, give, give it away nowwwwwwwww
Give it away nowwwwwwwww
I, I, I

[Cee-Lo]
I don't know what matters to you at this moment
But that's all that matters to me
How are you? (How are you?)
Knock on wood
Well I'm not doin so good
(I bet you pro-ba-bly couldn't tell)
(I'm not yet with it, I'm still not well)
And I don't understand how I'm so understandin
I guess that that's all I can be
How are you? (How are you?)
I think I can help
But I can't help myself
(Shouldn't I be happy? You need my help)
(I usually just talk, to myself)

[Chorus]
Oh can't you see, oh can't you see
If I help somebody, baby there's mercy for me (eeeeeeeeee)
Ahhh charity~! (And you, for you)
(One, for you, and you, and you)

[Cee-Lo]
Now all apologies baby but I'm bleedin too
Are you needin me like I'm needin you
Even my shadow leaves me all alone at night
Guess I need to start to take my own advice
(La la la la lah, la la la-lahhhh)
(La la la la lah, la la la-lahhhh)

[Chorus]
Oh can't you see, oh can't you see
Somebody's a liar who ever set free what was free (eeeeeeeeee)
Ahhh charity~!

[Interlude]
Oh, ahhhh {*repeat 4X, then in background through Interlude*}
Give, give, give it away now
Give, give, give it away nowwwwwwwww
Give it away nowwwwwwwww

[Cee-Lo]
Give it away now
Whooooo! Alright
Yeahhhhhhh
I want to be your baby
Charity!! You better give it to somebody</pre>
