[Chorus] 
We've done this so long, so long  
How come we keep doing it wrong?  
We've done this so long, so long  
How come we keep doing it wrong? 

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
It's not your first time, Lord knows it ain't mine 
And we ain't kids, we don't have to hide what we did 
It's all the more reason, we oughta be seasoned  
How can we show them the way if this is how we stay? 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
Why can't you comprehend? 
We keep going back where we've been 
It didn't work then, so why do it over again? 
Wanna make this plain, brother you must love pain 
Well I've had enough of that ride, time to step aside 

[Chorus]  

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
Folks will be watching 
Cause they don't wanna miss a thing  
Hard to keep myself from falling 
It's getting too hard to keep trying 
Under the scope, magnifying 
Under their scrutiny (scrutiny) all this mutiny (mutiny) 
About you and me, they should let us be

[Chorus]</pre>
