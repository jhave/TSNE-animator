Song:   Baby Don't Cry
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Everything has a reason
At least that's what they all say
And I've lost my count of the seasons
I don't know what's been makin' me stay

Many's the times that you've hurt me
That's just the way that you live
Many a time is forgotten
But I never said that I can forgive

[CHORUS]
So baby don't cry, cry me a river
And baby don't try to wash over me yeah
Baby don't cry my ship is now sailin'
And I've wasted all my time in your sea
And I've wasted all my time in your sea

Now that your toys have been broken
I guess you want company
There is no point in you callin'
Cuz I'm headed for my own destiny

Now everyone has a problem yeah
Lord knows you've always been mine
The nights are always the hardest
But tonight some how I know I'll be fine

[REPEAT CHORUS]</pre>
