Song:   Esau vs. Blackmel
Typed by: management@thenobodies.com

[Blackmel]
Battle me, I crush you from the start of the song
I'm ill enough to make you forget your part of the song
How many times i got to say it?  
How many times must I remind you?  
If you was deaf that's the only way someone would sign you

[Esau]
Okay Mr. Black, step up in here boy
So I can get in that ass, 
like lesbians hitting it from the back with strap-on sex toys
You're my bitch now, shut up and don't make no sound
Pretend this studio's a cypher 
and do what you usually do - just stand around

[Blackmel]
Battling Blackmel is harder than rapping to tracks with no drums
harder than playing Nintendo 64 with no thumbs
You so dumb to step to me
Me lyrically I'm scorching
You look like the result of an unfinished abortion

[Esau]
Greek style fool, I'll abuse you like a Q
I'll cane you like a Kappa, 
kid your coming off wacker than a fucking go go rapper
I need No-Doz, cause you ain't got no flows
In fact you shouldn't even rock it, like Philipinos kicking afros

[Blackmel]
You see I'm fucking up your optics
Esau I dropped your ass quicker 
than parapeligic niggas eating with chopsticks
You thought you had a victory, shit I'm about to spoil it
Yeah your album about to drop...down my motherfucking toilet

[Esau]
Okay little man, I'll give you a new emcee name it's Mini-Me
Cause lyrically you ain't half as ill as me, 
you ain't even half as tall as me
Jump up on the table and look me in the eyes
Is that your real face or a wack emcee disguise

[Blackmel]
Ah, whatever man
I'm still the livest you seen in your fucking life
The only person that'll put your shit out is your fucking wife
I'm killing it, but at the same time I'm trying to save rap
You make about as much sense as a white boy with a wave cap

[Esau]
Oh, your name is Blackmel?  That's kind of funny dun
Cause that's the only way I ever see you making any money son
Why don't you quit rapping while your ahead
I killed your rap career
but I can get you a job rapping for the Greatful Dead

[Blackmel]
Here you come fucking the beat up, verbally I tongue-kiss beats
Got me rapping over this bullshit, some low-budget Swizz beats
You dropped a single I admit a few headz were rocking it, 
only reason because you lied and said you had Tupac on it

[Esau]
I don't care if you wear 4 hearing aids and 3 pair of glasses
you can't comprehend half the things I say when I'm getting in your ass
I got a new name for you it's Blaze, 
just like the magazine you copied everyone else's style and said it your ways

[Blackmel]
Oh, you done fucked up, this microphone get put in your ass
I'm the cross between a beatdown and a foot in your ass
Them simple ass metaphors like elementary schoolwork
You old school nigga, who is your DJ, Kool Herc?

[Esau]
Now if you listening rewind your shit and play this spot again
but mute out Blackmel's part, cause he ain't said shit worth keeping
Dub it and play it for all your friends and when they get all hyped, 
tell them "That's my man Esau...and some other kid"</pre>
