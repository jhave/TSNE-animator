They see me rollin'
They hatin patrollin and tryna catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)
My music so loud I'm swangin
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)

(Try and catch me. Yea)

[Chamillionaire]
Grindin to see if they can see me lean
I'm tint, so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see these gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
And ride with a new chick, she like "Hold up"
Next to the Playstation controlla
It's a full clip and my pistolla, send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone, ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell, so I pull in ladies
Laws on patrol and you know they hate me (Know ya hate me)
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggaz tryna jack for some
But we packin somethin and what we have for um
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum, security cell
I'm grippin oak (Oak)
Music loud and I'm tippin slow (Slow)
Twins steady twistin like "Hit this dough"
D's pull up right behind and it's in re-throwed
Windows down, gotta stop pollution
City change niggaz like, "Who is that producin?"
That's the Play N Skillz when we out and cruisin
Got warrants in every city except Houston/ But I still ain't losin

They see me rollin'
They hatin patrollin and tryna catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)
My music so loud I'm swangin
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)

[Krayzie Bone]
I've been drinkin' and smokin, holy shit cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home before the po-po's scope this
Big ole Excursion just swerve'n, all up in the curb'n
A nigga be sippin on the Hennessey and the Gin again
its in again we in the wind
Don't wanna hold up while I puff on the blunt
And roll another one up, we leave it like we ain't givin a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand
40 0z. in my lap, freezin my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Comin' pretty deep me and my dogs
Yo' I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the six-five and I got heat
glock, glock shots to the block, we creep creep
Pop pop hope cops dont see me on the low key
With no regard for the law, we dodge 'em like, "Fuck 'em all"
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
wonder if you want nigga to poppin dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air
Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire (Millionaire)

They see me rollin'
They hatin patrollin and tryna catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)
My music so loud I'm swangin
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)

Now would you think it so, I tried ta let'cha go  
Turn on my blanker light, and then I swang it slow
And they upset fa sho', cause they think they know
that they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro' (No)
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep tryin (Keep tryin)
steady denyin that it's racial profilin
Houston, Texas you can check my tags (Tags)
Pull me over, try to check my slab (Slab)
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And bein the balla that I am, I talk to them givin a
damn about them not feelin my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty
Bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood (Hahaha)
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise 
Ya my number two on some old school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the laws, tell 'em "We hate you"
I could be tough to tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tippin down, I'm sittin crooked on my chrome
Bookin my phone, findin a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me
I'm bout to pull up at your home, and it's on

They see me rollin'
They hatin patrollin and tryna catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)
My music so loud I'm swangin
They hopin' that they gone catch me ridin dirty
Tryna catch me ridin dirty (*4X*)</pre>
