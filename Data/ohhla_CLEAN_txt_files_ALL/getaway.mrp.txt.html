[Police Call]
211, 211 we are looking for Master P
The suspect is armed and dangerous, repeat armed and dangerous

[Master P]
I'm gone had to lose the alarm, ducking the Dodge 
and movin the fuckers through the tracks so the beats all wrong
Now I'm movin at a fast pace
(Will the cops catch P?) huh man no way
It's time to make my move, jump in the groove
Had the cops on the drill (Yo partner watcha gonna do)
lose these fools I hear the ?? left the cops
Hella mad once say ohh shit (Which way did he go? I don't know)
I started laughin then threw my rope out the window
Zip the zone and out the back POP,POP,POP
but I ain't going out like that cause even mace wont blind me
It takes a 100 cops, an army, and dogs and they still couldn't find me
Cause I'ma brother that's raw
Jump a gate, or a fence, a bridge just to lose the law

[Chorus]
Getaway clean, they'll never find me
Getaway clean, they'll never find me

[Master P]
I can't stop cause I might get popped
Falling in the hands of some crooked ass cops
Cause if a cop thinks he's mean then ya did it
Me serving two to twenty man I ain't with it
So I keep on moving to the door groove
Shot a ghost in the back to the old school
Back for revenge like a terror somebody
drop a dime or ran, a cop said I dare ya
"stop in the name" of the law
Me stop man I'm too raw
You never find P jacking up a police car
Cause I'm a mission
If you ever get chased be the cops play close attention 
or you'll get beat, but if you wanna get away 
say Master P, a brother that's cool
Rob a bank and I play the boys in blue like fools

[Chorus]

[Master P]
Fedz has me trapped without fled
The scene some smuggling dope from Cali to New Orleans
From the West to the East coast where there were dope beats pumped
The most but I wont leave a trace
Take an old crew, my boy mixin with the dope plates
This is ready to done pack and then deliver
Out to the streets were the dope beats shiver
Now I'm getting at ya movin by the police than Bo Jackson
Then my hip hop bails
And if a cop comes closer I'll lead him to the wrong trio
Pair em like bait
It was the ? cocaine it wan't nothin but a dope tape
And two of them sirens I dont buzz
Pick a cop that bugs me amateurs

[Chorus]

[Skit]
Oh man I'm out of gas
Let me stop by this house and see if anyboody in there
(knock,knock,knock)
	"Who is it?"
"Yo baby my car is stuck can I use your phone?
Ohh baby you look good!"
	"Sure come on in make yourself at home"
"Where have you been all my life?"
	"You look like you're familiar
	 what did you say your name was?"
"I didn't!"
	"Well here's the phone, I'm gonna go freshen up
	(he's in the living room)"
"Freeze!"
	"Where you at?"

[Master P]
Im rolling 90 M-P-H
But you can't catch P not even with a blind date
??? and if it try to date me I'll be out tomorrow
Cause I'ma brother thats legit
Too smooth for the world and law can't mess
with known for pushin much though wanted by america
for rhymes and untouchable

[Chorus]</pre>
