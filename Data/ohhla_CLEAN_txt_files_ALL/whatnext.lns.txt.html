[Busta Rhymes]
And it goes like this...
Skip to my Lou (Yes!)
I got a funky hop scotch game going on (Getting strong!)
I think you better follow this and come along
Heavens to Merkatroid, we've come with another new song
(Sing-a-long!) Ha (Tic!) Tica-tica-toc
(Who's that?) Coming around the block (Leaders of the New!)
Yes, with the shit that is sure to hit the spot
Oooh hot yes, come in my Dragon's Lair, that's when I turn slayer
Uno better say you're prayer
(Open your eyes!) Rise, yes I come to (Sterilize)
Mr. Parasite, I got your big suprise
Mad effective as you vision my perspective, hot shot
Look at what you got, a super ache infected speed knot
Yo, it seems stunning every time I see the fraud coming
Hundred miles and running, time to back the tools and start gunning
Let me tell you something, you ain't saying nothing with your fussing
Now you got my cussing, bake you like a muffin full of stuffing
For the world to see ya
Leaders of the New is in the place to be for '93, G
(What's next?) We come fresh no dutty boy can test
(What's next?) You know we wicked and we full up of finesse
(What's next?) Cause when we deh a dance, we have fi impress
(what's next?) For my brother B. Boogie Brown to come down

[Charlie Brown]
Brooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooown
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
I'm the one knight supreme (Being all seeing)
Soul with the role (No I'm not European)
Operator, operator, put me on hold
Stories untold, watch the dollars unfold
Watch women approach me with the inviations
Previous engagement, speculation
I hate when my girl says "Give me some space"
On the telephone, and never to your face
I paid my dues, so lick the balls!
In the summer, in the winter, in the spring, and in the fall
I'm romping and ripping, the needle ain't skipping
Gymnasiums and stadiums the crowd be flipping
The new to the next, and of course the nextus
The greatest, the grandest, of course you expect this
In cash, boom bash, slash, grammatical
Continual residual, flow is radical
All that, and a bag of Chips Ahoy
Tell your homeboys to bring the noise
Sunrise to sunset, yes you will remember
Born on the 19th day of September
Peace to mom-du, that's C dot B dot
Not for cock block, so stop and don't jock
So take is faker snakr, phonograph no paper
Just a philly for the ride, slide, peace see you later!

    What's next? (I know you love the way it's going down!) (Repeat 4x)

[Milo]
Ex the excess, your best bet check it
(Move it along) Cause I really can't tec it
Your cement mentality will end up in casualties
I got the right one, baby, and no you can't follow me
Got pieces of a dream I need to put together
I ain't checking for nobody who's tougher than leather
Whether I'm in or out of state, it doesn't make a difference
Why the constant complaining about my real appearance?
Saying "Milo do you love me?" You're always asking
What are you looking for action or romancing?
Now who the hell you think you're gassing? (What's crazy?)
Don't treat me like a Care Bear that's always smiling
I like drinking booze and sometimes wilding
Don't act new baby (Huh!) Or haven't ya heard?
Keep 110 mph inna me Dusinburg
Keep the main on taining at an even rate
One Newport breath taker in the morning and you know I'm straight
(What's next?) Voodoo hex, 666 years of sorrow
Broken by the strength of the 7
Just do the knowledge and don't ask no questions
(I know you love the way it's going down!)
I hit up a green light crossing and I am passing
On the road to riches, 4 by 4 riding over ditches
Next with the misses, hugs and kisses, the switch you missed
Cause mental fixes, erasional addiction
So complex, flex! (Time to have sex!) Now ask yourself what's next

	You love the way it's going down! (Repeat 2x)

[Dinco D]
The sun will come out, but don't doubt the D (Tomorrow!)
Let me see Dinco you can come out and play now
If you want to, but only if you want me to
or do strange dimentions of the pensions pile
Dispensers of bad fencers sensors while
(Busting loose) tkes over your mentioning how
It came to be in '93 with what you see now
In the corners where you go sporting cones
Only a lonely homely Jones make clones
Tone dial phone girls grown close to testes
Jingling chrome press sewn Leaders aren't lefties or jet skis
Or what you call your animal when your pet pees?
(Woof!) Fucking dog, what's next, G?

   I know you love the way, I know you love the way
   I know you love the way it's going down! (What's next?)

   I know you love the way, I know you love the way
   I know you love the way it's going dooooooooooowwwwwwwn!
