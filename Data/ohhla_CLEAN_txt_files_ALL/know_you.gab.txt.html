[Intro]
Yo, yo, yo ,yo
I got it bad girl, bad girl
Yo, yo
I got it bad girl, bad girl
I got it bad girl, bad girl
I got it bad girl, bad girl

[Verse 1]
When I first met ya
I was infatuated by your stature
It's like I knew your soul before somewhere in the hereafter
Straight off the top connection conversation and some laughter
I feel I got to have ya
Though the friendship part we mastered to go and past that
Like make it a little complicated at times I stand back
And wonder if I'm missing my appointment on your M-track line
I really think it's time for you and me to pass that line
This feelings here I don't normally feel it's ill
I question if it's real I feel ya vibrations I'm losing my patience
Let's build and take it to the next, I know you're feeling it too..
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta..
*To know you*

[Chorus]
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta..
*To know you*
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta-ta-ta-ta..
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta..
*To know you*
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta-ta-ta-ta..
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta..
*To know you*
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta-ta-ta-ta..
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta..
*To know you*
Truly I wanna really deeply get ta-ta-ta-ta..

[Verse 2]
I digg ya whole style.. no other style is like yo style 
I try to word it out to you and still I stall and hold out
I like the way you work out your mind, soul and your body
I'm googly and goggly eyed when you stand before me
Many have tried and I know that few have been chosen
But when I'm with you I just get the sense that fate is closing in
I'm frozen in time, it's more than just you being a dyme
I see the other half of me when I look in your eyes, reflection
Soul connection for feeling circles, still working on myself
You too, I work with you through this cold world
There's no girl, that's making me do 
The things I gotta do to betta get ta-ta-ta
*To know you*
They say when you stop looking it unfolds in true
We come together through divine laws exposing you
To my life, in my life.. full of these shows I do
What I truly jones to do is come home to you..

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
the point of matter is I'm finding it
you're everything that I ever been looking for in a lady
Should I just ignore it? and move forward?
Set's sort to assure us a fortune and build a fortress transcending metamorphis
Take a vacation out in europe, leave the whole continent tourin
Can't get enough of what you keep givin me more
And holding it back has got me torn in half
It's time to penetrate these walls and get ta-ta-ta 
*To know you*

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I got it bad girl, bad girl
I got it bad girl, bad girl
I got it bad girl, bad girl
I got it bad girl, bad girl
Got it bad girl</pre>
