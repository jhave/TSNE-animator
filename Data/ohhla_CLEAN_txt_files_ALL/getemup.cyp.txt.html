[B-Real] 
Who wants the wrath, it must be the hood 
who's up to no good, and wishes a man would 
come up and give him a reason to blast on.. 
I wouldn't put it past him! 
He's got juice, how long will it last him? 
He's gettin back, at, all the punks that harassed him 
Ask him (HEY!) what's ya main hobby? 
He'll say there ain't, nothin like the motherfuckin robbery 
So don't crowd me, cause yo I run shit 
You know, homey that old top gun shit 
I got a slug comin straight out the barrel 
for your ass, if you wanna ask a dumb question 
Cause I'm quick on the draw, click-click, punks drop 
Now your lifes ain't worth shit! 

[Chorus: B-Real, Sen Dog (repeat 2X)] 
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up y'all, yeah 
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up (SHOOT 'EM UP!) 
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up y'all, yeah 
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up (SHOOT 'EM UP!) 

[Sen Dog] 
Sen Dog, never again will I bend 
No letters of death, no threats, will I send 
So I'm puttin an end, to all your dumb shit 
(dumb shit) dumb shit.. that, "Homes WHERE YOU FROM?" shit 
Cause I run shit, my way, all day, I don't play 
cause it won't pay 
Niggaz wanna play with the pistol, you make me get pissed though 
(YOU GET A FISTFUL!) 
Make you eat knuckles, feel your knees buckle 
Still feelin great when you're sleepin on the pavement? 
Save it! The beatdown, who gave it? 
Sen did, no one will explain it 

[Chorus] 

[B-Real] 
I've had it up to HERE, with all the bullshit 
Finger's on the trigger, and I'm about to pull it 
Gank hardrock, up the block, you know I rule it 
To the punks around the corner someone's gonna catch a bullet 
To the crew, that wants, to get with my program 
I'm out to get mine, and ain't takin shit from no man 
in the neighborhood, cause there ain't no brotherhood 
In other words, good, if you heard, that we're comin up 
We're out to make a quick buck, that's what I'm thinkin 
And I'm smokin any PUNK who even thinks of finkin 

[Chorus]
