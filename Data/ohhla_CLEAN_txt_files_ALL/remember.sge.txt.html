Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
I'm yelling, cool bro, bitch I'm a nerd
I'm yelling, cool bro, bitch I'm a nerd
I'm yelling, cool bro, bitch I'm a nerd
I'm yelling, cool bro, bitch I'm a nerd
Remember me, remember me
Fuck the cool crowd, bitch I'm a nerd
This is not a high school the cool crowd absurd

[Verse 1]
Pull up look like million bucks
I don't ride solo million trucks
Whole team flyer then million ducks
Team quack that paper a million blunts
Nowadays girls get meaner
Call her a B, she has no stinger
Remember me, Freshman you Senior
That's my [?] and my eyes are greener
Shoes a little cleaner, thought you heard
Fuck the cool crowd, bitch I'm a nerd
A nigga got money now you don't think I'm a perg
This is not high school the cool crowd absurd

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Walking around campus at break time
Niggas saying he's back like a [?] line
There was bitches there thicker than a steak fry
But I couldn't get head on FaceTime
They used to treat a nigga like a step child
I felt like that white dude on 8 Mile
If-If you said I could hit I'm footing 8 miles
I'm just keeping it G now I'm pimping throughout 8 towns
Now I know these niggas hate me
Young nigga getting fans like A/C
And girls I keep a bunch like Brady
And collect every penny like JC

[Chorus]</pre>
