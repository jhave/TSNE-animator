[Intro: Big Noyd]
You know I.. ("gotcha!")
("Bang bang") Whoooh, yeah nigga
We keepin it gangsta with you dunn
All my shorties stand up, rapper Noyd in ya area

[Verse 1: Big Noyd]
Bad boys, bad boys - what'cha gon' do?
When Big Noyd come through to eat ya food
You crazy? ("Shoot em up!")
You tryna play me, fuck is wrong with you I thought you knew I
("Shoot em up, shoot em up!") Of course you do
You know I ("bang bang")
I live this man I cock it then I ("gotcha!")
I leave you on the cement bleedin, wonder who shot ya
You boy like any killa, I rumble with any of ya
Look, see a skinny nigga - you shook 'cause my gun is bigga
And it ("bang bang") is part of the game don't let it catch ya
You riffin without a biscuit, you slippin you'll get wet up
I ("shoot em up!") put it up, sober up, I load it up
and ("shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up!")
You know I ("bang bang") that thing when I gotta wear you out
for runnin ya mouth, I cock back and empty out
No witnesses, I air it out, I ("shoot em up!")
There's nothing to it but to do it, murder music
I live it, I ain't got to run and go get it
Then make it ("bang bang")
I reach for my hip you know I ("gotcha!")
I don't play around killer, I lay you down nigga
I shoot em for rilla they find his body in the river
When I ("shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up!")

[Hook: Prodigy] [2x]
Everybody talkin like thugs, but without they thugs they nothin
They don't really want no beef, 'cause we ("shoot em up!")
And nigga you can bring them thugs, we still ("shoot em up!")

And this is how we do it man.

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Niggaz don't want it, if they want it then I'll ("gotcha!")
I talk what I live and I walk with a limp
You hear this? The .40 cal' party popper leave a mean rip
("Shoot em up!") And I don't be without the bridge
I'm a young gun bangin, chain swingin, rap singin mobb gangsta
And everybody else wanksta
We come through and bomb ya crib, niggaz be ghost
Ya mamma comin home with ya box of ashes
Nigga I pull it out, then I aim it, then I ("gotcha!")
I'm +Terror+ like the +Squad+ from the Bronx, I don't play
I ("shoot em up!") hit em in the chest or the face when I
("shoot em up!") No matter the time or the day I ("bang bang!")
With thang-thangs until they click-cling
Unlock 'em and reload 'em again
("Shoot em up!") Just to let you know it's no games
("Shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up!")

[Hook: Prodigy] [2x]
Everybody talkin like thugs, but without they thugs they're nothin
They don't really want no beef, 'cause we ("shoot em up!")
And nigga you can bring them thugs, we still ("shoot em up!")

And this is how we do it man.

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Everybody talkin it, this and that
But get, quiet as mice I make it pitch black
Put you back, it's on it life and I awaited kick back
If I don't get what's mine, the pound to kick back
You don't make it down the block, and if that
Put a hole in ya face like clips, know it's a wrap
I ("shoot em up!") pity the fool
Maddy clips into ya goons
They call me pay-per-view, I bring it to ya living room
Give it to 'em, my hammer's the slut
And it'll screw 'em, burn his ass 'til the doctors can't cure 'em
("Shoot em up!") Got you cowards kissin ya rosaries
Better get you that day, nigga fuck them bees
Ya man was smart, you better follow his fuckin lead
If you ain't know them how does it bring you up to speak
Catch his ass at the party, you know we.
("Shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up, shoot em up!")
And this is how we do.

[Hook: Prodigy] [2x]
Everybody talkin like thugs, but without they thugs they're nothin
They don't really want no beef, 'cause we ("shoot em up!")
And nigga you can bring them thugs, we still ("shoot em up!")

And this is how we do it man..</pre>
