Under The Moon

I'm still here under the moon(2x)

[Violent J]
I was just a child but you seemed like so much more
The way you would avenge me and drift across the floor
I'd see you in the hall, and you'd kiss me with a smile
I never understood it, was I even worth your while?
The others kids at school, they would hate me and they'd spit
Cuz I was just a no one, to them I wasn't shit
But you would always help me and stand there by my side
We were only seventeen, we'd be together till we died
But then it all happened on the ever dreadful day
Somebody tried to rape you and now I'll make him pay
You pointed him out to me, my thoughts began to race
I took my daddy's forty-five and shot him in the fucking face!!!
I did it all for you, and though I'm facing years
I would do the time just to equal all your tears
The last thing that you told me when I left the courtroom
Is that we'd always be together, cuz we're both under the moon

[Chorus (1x)]
I'll forever love you, even if you're doomed
We'll always be together cuz we're both under the moon

[Violent J]
I sit here in my cell and the walls are made of stone
I justified your pain, but now I sit alone
I write another letter, I write one every day
I never got a letter back, I write em anyway
I try to call collect, your number has been changed
I'm staring at the lightbulb and I start to feel the rage
You never came to visit me, I sit facing the glass
No one's on the other side, now it's in the past
My head is always spinning, I'm pounding at the wall
I feel like I'm forgotten, no sign of you at all
You're probably getting married, you're probably getting fucked
I'll break out of this cage and try to cut that motherfucker up
I curl up in the corner, my body will corrode
My teeth are turning into dust, skin is growing mold
I'm staring at the window of my eternal doom
I know that you are out there, somewhere underneath the moon

[Chorus (1x)]

[Violent J]
Many, many years, many more to go
Does she still remember? God, he only know
I know become a savage, they chain me to a wall
I still can see your body, I still can hear your call
I'm nothing but a maggot, I'm locked away and lost
The world it doesn't want me, my dignity is tossed
And to the girl for whom I feel this doom
Look here, fuck you and the moon

Hey! Fuck you and the moon(5x)

[Chorus (8x)]

I'm still here under the moon
I'm still here under the moon (still under the moon)
