[Ghostface Killah]
I think it happened on a Saturday
I heard the phone ring, ding, ding
Who this? 'Vine yo..
Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks,
It was the same who our niggas teeth up
Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago
We went this recording, now we owe
The devil slit trough, without an intro
Yo 'Vine, it can't be!
Wise guest-starring me
Can it be, we both got hit
God legendary, he and General
He survived A-dog,
Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs
He stayed in his world
And he sidely sweard
To tell the truth, that DeVon was like
"Your out of cure boo"
Wisegod Allah, warrior
XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne
Touched something for you
Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up
Becouse bitches is talking
They living, i'm twisting
You alleybag
You killed my man, you killed my man
And you sent him back
After this day, watch your hats
Slugs flying everywhere,
You could smell heaven in the air
You can never get the god, yeah
Now i'm cypher,
You've been driving off the same battery
We had, back in '91 that got you hyper
God been beautiful, god been great
God fed you, you died but we survived that day
You killed your king, Rakeem Allah
Gave him his life, he was your offspring
Camouflage dog, days was green
One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil
Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van
We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' "peace god"
As long we translate Allah's tounge, spit the language hard
Alley thoughts, identical twin
My alias gasanate, the days close,
The days close, how'd you know!

[The Dramatics]
Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone..
I know I'm gonna see, a better day
I know I think I'm crying, becouse of you
I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry
Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise!

    ***Chorus (x3)***
I wanna go outside, in the rain...
It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside, in the rain...</pre>
