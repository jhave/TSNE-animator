[Phase Fate]
Some days I look twice in the mirror
Some days its a glance
But it's so much clearer
Usually wipe the sweat off the glass
I look through infinite paths
Repeat many times over
The same thought passed sober
Now drunk crying on shoulders
Girls and boys
Lend me lobes to listen close
Like its supposed to be the focus
But really I'm just goin' through motions
Just to keep from drowning in oceans
From love potions to false notions of hope
A mixed bag of emotions and dopamine
I'm clean but my head ain't free of disease
I can't take drugs
To fight it off
Just take time and struggle to write songs
It's been so long since I righted wrongs of mine
And those voices keep findin' me
I just keep ignorin' lies and hope
The second-hand smoke doesn't cloud my vision
It may be treason, may mean prison
But there's only one ideal condition
Situation amounts to this decision

[Off Topic]
What goes on in your mind?
Who am I?
Watch clocks all the time
And wonder why I'm hypnotized
This a dedication
To my own maturation
And the one who caused the realization
Waited so long, so patient
So faceless
So what?
Long as I'm on the playlist
One time for the writers who got nothing to say
Who would die for the money
'Cause it pays for the pain
They finance a feeling and roll up the change
Shoot for the high score arcade
Would they do it if they knew that the cords were frayed
And the power would be out by the next day?
Waited so long, so patient
So nameless
So what?
So old, so ageless
So blameless for mistakes so famous
I run circles til I can't keep chasing
And collapse
Run myself over on the next lap
Making things worse, but I can't relax
Worry about, What if this? or Maybe that?
When I should focus my energy and face the facts
When I should go for broke til I brake my back
Carry a pen with me
It's like a friend to me
Writes articulate eulogies of my enemies
And passionate love letters
From a fragile part of me
And letters home to my family
I know they miss me
I miss me too
But don't cry mom, I'll be home real soon

[AGM]	I'm half crazy
		All for the love of you
		It won't be a stylish marriage
		We can't afford a carriage
		But you'll look sweet
		Upon the seat
		Of a bicycle built for two

[Off Topic]
Excuse me if I'm out of place
Woke up a year later in a new space
All seems like a dream that I had
Life passed so fast
What will I see when the dust settles?
Excuse me if I'm out of place
Woke up a year later in a new space
All seems like a dream that I had
Life passed so fast
Where will I be when the dust settles?
