I might not know what to say, rollin up in my mercury
I'm on the sea and private toys, momma taught me how to kill them boys
My homeboys name is lil troy, me my name is Carlos Coy
Roll on tweenty two inch alloys, but that'll neva be my pride and joy
My lil girl she off the hook, make my ass stop and read a book
On her stove know'n how to cook, now i know how an angel look
My beauty queen, My billy jean, some they come right in between
I dont let nobody fuck up my dreams, so i pack bubble gum machines
Everybody wanna wanna wanna be da king, bitch get off my dingaling
I'll soke yo ass in gaseline now listen to my fat girl sing
 
(Chorus)x4
 
He's all cot up

Me an my boys we sellin weed, still i gotta slang that pappy seed
Snatch yo bitch and rock a G, now bitch get yo ass of a me
Kick her out my fucken room, now they waken me up at noon
Fuck that shit i'll take my time, I aint leave till three o nine
Hold up maan now stop the lac, i think i forgot my bom bom sack
With my homeboy lonny mack, i'ma smoke till i have a uhh cardiac
Where my army at, stay on attack, one good shot and we all react
I smell a rat, so i feed the cat, me be cool oh neva that
My chedda's fat, i'll get the gat, botha my pockets hella fat
I'ma democrat, what the hell is that, take my shit betta mail it back
 
(Chorus)
 
He's all cot up
He's all cot uuuup
He's all cot up
When does the fucken first come in
He's all cot uuuup

Screwston tx were i roam, bought me home off a telephone
Took my wife on a trip to rome, bought girlfriend silicone
That vanilla bone, in the killa zone, 5 foot nine with high heellas on
I sipp batron, flip my phone, left that pearl white bitch alone
Most my friends aint around, dead, locked up, or just cant be found
I keep my lil girl safe and sound, daddy gonna buy a cinderella gown
And if that gown should disappear, heaven is real but it isnt here
You cant take no souviners, like those diamonds in your ears
Raised my daughter differently, cause the life i lived wont set me free
Write my list of enemies, and kill them hoes alphabetically
Uuhh
