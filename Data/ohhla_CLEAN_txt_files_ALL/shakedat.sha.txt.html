[Chorus - Ludacris &amp; (Shawnna)]
Maannn, these bitches is awfully nasty
And these bitches keep walking past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your bootie in the way and shake that shit!
(Now these niggaz is bout they bank)
(And these niggaz keep buying dranks)
(Lips creep from my body on your lips)
(Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit!)

[Verse 1 - Shawnna]
S-H-A to the W double N-A
Real bitch don't play
Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say
You're acting like the Dukes of the Fifth won't spray
It's okay, they gon learn
Chi's most wanted bitch wait your turn!
Sac full of yum I'm a make that burn
Y'all can't smoke none anyway
Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips
Or they really can't talk to a bitch wit wild guns
No games, hat to the side wit low frame
Now I came in this industry killin em
Now they all feeling me, sipping on Henny wit an O and a gram!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Shawnna]
C-H-I to the C-A, G-O
If you ain't been, don't go
My city's so fast, you react so slow
Your heart might stop and your blood won't flow
(That ain't right) I stomp through the hood
Wit a grand on my feet like that ain't tight
Diamonds on my neck like that ain't bright
I come through and shut down the Saturday Night!
(Hell yeah) You can kiss that and
(Feel there) bring it right back
Don't mess wit the frame if you don't know a thing
Six years in the game, I'm still here
Hold up! They mad cause the streets is sold up!
I'm back on my feet, so watch for the cops, we'll never stop
Just rep for ya block and throw it up!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Shawnna]
M-I-D to the W-E-S-T
Better yet that's me
Most of y'all chicks gotta impress me
You say you got skills, put 'em up let's see
Show and prove, I hate to really see
What y'all goin through, put on any beat
We could spit it in the street
From the West to the East, or South to the house
Just showing love, go home
The body on the flo' is so grown
What cha gon' do, when you call to ya label
And ya gotta shed a tear, cause you hear ya career's
Been post-poned, back up
Smart mouth bitches, get slapped up
Take it to the trap, get clapped up
Put it in ya brain that the female game, been wrapped up

[Chorus x2]

[Outro - Shawnna]
Shorty said, shorty said
Shorty said, shorty said
Wait a minute, hold up
Wait a minute, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, now wait a minute
Shorty said, shorty said
Shorty said, shorty said</pre>
