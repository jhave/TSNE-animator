[Black Thought]
Check me out yo, yo, check it out
Uhh, as we descend upon the city of schemes
See the image fadin into view from a black screen
A frail grandmother pack a heavy mac-teen
We fiend slash machines in the struggle and things ..
.. bloody denim scuff knuckle and things
Sucker-punchin fake rappers forcin me to take it to the extreme
Oh you real son well whattayou mean?
How you real when you hustlin dreams?
How you feel like you fuckin with me?
Now burn the 5th Militia flame-thrower
The mic soldier, takin things over
You're not sober, consider thinking things over, relax
We bout to spit it all over the track, yo

*****

Don't even listen to him, don't sweat it
