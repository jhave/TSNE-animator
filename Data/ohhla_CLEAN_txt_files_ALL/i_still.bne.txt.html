[Mariah (Krayzie) - 2X]
No matter what baby
(Don't matter)
No matter what people say
(Don't matter what they say)
I'm gonna believe we can still be together

(Mariah)
Baby, I still believe and it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
(I'm gonna believe we can still be together)
Baby I...

(Krayzie)
If you still believe (if you believe)
Then you will find everything you're searching for, maybe more

(Mariah)
But, boy you seem to be lost in uncertainty
But when you wake up
You will know you never should have let it go

(Krayzie)
Believe me, the feelin' has always been sure
I just wans't too certain that yours were legitimate
Genuine really the Real McCoy

(Mariah)
And after all this time you look into my eyes
And everything is still the same my love for you won't fade away

(Chorus)
Baby, I still believe, and it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we gonna be together
Baby I had a dream, and it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together

(Krayzie)
I'm still a believer of this
So stop just listen and look into my eyes
I want you to visualize and realize
And see that It'd never been to easy being Krayzie Bone
Temptation me blattin' with the persuasion rattlin' in my brain
Won't go insane
I figure that's why they be callin' me Krayzie cause I still maintain
But we gotta struggle through all them hard times
But I gotta tell ya peace and happiness is hard to find
Come on!
We can get together
And I won't try to make excuses and reasons
But these demons got me seein' things that's really misleadin' me
But maybe that's just my life
And maybe I'm just a thug
Cold hearted, but I can feel the love
Just keep the faith and don't brake it
Shake all them faker and haters
And ask me the " Will we make it?"
I'll say "Yeah, uh-uh"
You got to believe it
Ya got to believe it

(Chorus)
Baby, I still believe
(Don't matter, don't matter what they say)
And it's more  than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
(You, you know, you know)
Baby I had a dream, and it's more than me imagination
(Baby I believe)
Because I still believe we belong together
(I still believe)

(Mariah)
If you wanna view paradise
Think about our lovin' baby
Nothin' could be closer to it
If we don't believe, we'll lose it

(Krayzie)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
If you can still believe I can take you there
Come on and get down with the thug love that's in the air
It ain't no reason, reason to stop believin', -lievin'
Stay real and I'm a stay real right back
You know what I'm gettin' at
You the song gotta get control, and roll, roll, roll on
I still believe in keepin' it real enought to achieve it
I still  believe simply just 'cause I still believe it
I believe it

(Chorus)x2
Baby, I still believe, and it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we gonna be together
Baby I had a dream, and it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together

(Krayzie)
No matter what baby
(Don't matter what...)
No matter what people say
(Don't matter what they say...)
I'm gonna believe we can still be together
Baby I...</pre>
