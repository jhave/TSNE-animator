I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!

Ain't no limit to the shit I start
Automatic start on dat big white car
Pearl pink jar, nigga you can't rob
Fo' chains and a watch, pocket full of knots!
Spots! Imma git my stacks
This crack comin' back like dat income tax
Told ya once he told ya twice
You need mo' then a knife, you wanna rock dat ice
I'm bad, magazines up da ass
Stolen yello' cab come squeeze on ya ass
He a flash, all black mask
Rappin' ass nigga talkin' all dat jazz
Ride up on him show, him how we get down
100 rounds in this clown butt naked and he pound
Tell da truth - dat nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Chevy and I got my shit painted man

I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!

Used to be on da corna, on marijuana
Now it's marijuana - from California
Big buds, bitches with big butts
Big BMW's home of da dick sucks
My Bob Marley is bumpin' like - Bitch Whudd?
My money bumper to bumper now bitch whudd
I'm bad, I'm back! - I'm mad, I'm strapped!
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!
I don't see no nigga when I'm on da grind
All I see is ho' niggaz when I'm on da grind
.45 no nigga, know I'm holdin' mine
Imma knock his ass down if it's own his mind
Tell da truth - dat nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Benz and I got my shit painted man!

I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!

B - fo' da Bullets in niggaz who gotta die
A - fo' da Addicts and junkies who gittin' high
D - fo' da Dope distributed at da dock
Still on da block, clock no socks
B - fo' da Bass, bitch I gotta boom
A - fo' da Ass, in my hotel room
D - fo' da Dick, dick dat I slang
Since money talk, I'm addicted to my slang
B - fo' da Bang
A - fo' da K
D - Ditch da car fo' da smooth get away
I'm bad, I poke ya ass in da nose
With a cold .44, now he cold on da flo'
Layin' on his back, like he posed fo' a ho'
When ya actin' like a bitch, gotta go gotta go!
Tell da truth - dat nigga be rippin', ain't it man?
Just got a Hummer and I got my shit painted man!

I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!
I'm bad (I'm bad!), I'm back (I'm back!)
I'm mad (I'm mad!), I'm strapped (I'm strapped!)
Nigga what you want - Nigga who ya with?
Came with my doggs - Leavin' with a bitch!</pre>
