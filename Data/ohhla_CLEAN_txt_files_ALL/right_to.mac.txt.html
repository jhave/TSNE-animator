[Intro: 7th Ambassador]
Yo, yeah, yeah, yo, Maccabeez baby
Less wives, warriors get ranks

[7th Ambassador]
Born and raised in the PJs, school was on top of a grave
All of you fools ain't know how to behave
On the full moons, some started to change
From snatch the wallets to rings
Whenever spring start looking for brains
Busting up rap fools, robbing the trains
Trick swallow the flame, going insane
Wit the chrome in the hands
Before we rolled with a gang, we used to all play on the swangs
To pump high, trying to fly off the caine
But nowadays, we don't rely on them games
We occupy our slang, watching all our homies while they die in vain
My little man got robbed for his chain, it's like an everyday thang
Young G's wanna rob for they name
Now every man's broke but swear they got locked in a bank
One of them got hanged and the other one remained
It's strange when they had to come to shot they brother for change
When the fifth amendment shows us the same

[Killah Priest]
Same, we all maintain in the brain
I'm clapping my magnum, grabbing my handgun
Peace to the Panthers with sawed off pumps
This one's for the cops and the war lord Trump
Breathe easy, this goes out to the books that freed me
Up late night, doing push ups and tucks
One thousand jumping jacks and I turn on the mac
When Godlie kicked came to his brother, it made me relapse
I grab my strap, ride for the Hebrew Macks
Blackout on the president and the cop's presidents
CIA killed Malcolm X, lied on national news
Then flew out on a jet

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
Now hold up, lemme have your ear right now
We in this bitch and it's bout to go down
Love is love, and thug is thug, nigga
Get off your ass and hug that trigger, then get it

[Terra Tory]
I squeeze on em like boring the fifth, freeze on em
Can't get no colder, I already freezed on em
I back up the odds and put G's on us
Roll up the street, see the D's swarming
My cheese is enormous, swing like G. Foreman
You sleeping on me, been on it since this morning
You beefing with me like Bin Laden I'm warring
You wonder why your loved ones is mourning
The only goldmine I ever seen was a crackhouse
Slamming all over your team like Stackhouse
When ya'll hear of Terra Tory, ya'll dude gon back out
Like wide recievers, ya'll dudes gon dash out
Getting rid of ya'll, time to throw the trash out
Hell up in Brooklyn, bet I'm gon black out
Straight off the street corners, don't creep on us
We play for keeps, F' police informants
Play your position, don't cross the border
You gon fuck around, be a missing corpse in water
Kidnap and torture, smack your daughter
Don't fuck with CCF, that's the order

[Chorus]

[Timbo King]
Part of the struggle ever since I came out of the womb
My black butterfly.. {*fades out*}</pre>
