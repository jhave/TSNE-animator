Gaining Momentum
Gaining
[x10]
Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]
Start slow like our bodies won't flow
And set em up good then let go
Parton (sic) me
I'm begging your pardon
but I feel like startin something
Now that the music has got me moving
come on baby and let's get into the party b4 we get left out
A little bit of time &amp; we'll turn it out

Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]
I think that you like it this way
Can I get a no
a yes or a yay? Good cause I do refuse to ever give you something that you cannot use
Dance &amp; express yourself
mix
mingle
&amp; jump up to the Left or Right
it's goin' on tonite
I'm gaining momentum I'm getting' hype
Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]
Gaining [x10]

[Chorus:]
Don't you know we're gaining momentum We can't stop
no don't you know we're gaining momentum
we're headed to the top.
Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]
Gaining [x10]

Get in drums
cymbals,
Sounds of (shakers?)
If music was a lady I'd take her
To my place &amp; pump her up loud
And play her for the homies and
Front her to the crowd
Mary
Nary [?] Nothing ordinary
Music moves and it buries style but it still gets in them
you can't stop it cause it's gaining momentum
Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]

[Chorus]

Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]
We can't stop [x4] There it is
Now see we got the place jumping
Told ya that I felt like starting something
Pump 'em
stump 'em Make your body jump up
[?] when your life is gonna blow up moving
improving
that's what we're doing
nothing negative get in cause your mind will be ruined
Aim for the top and go straight up
and nothing will stop you when you gaining momentum
Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]

[Chorus]

Gaining Momentum There it is [x4]</pre>
