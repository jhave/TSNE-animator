[Chorus]
Who are you to question, how I live
When the whole entire world is negative
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die

[Sticky Fingaz]
From NY, Southside where guns hide
Shells fly, eyed red, I'm dumb high
Got one eye, you get wet and hung dry
Leave you tongue-tied, mothers watch their young die
Nig' you wan' die?  Fuck a car through run by
I'll be waitin at your crib for my money til the sun die
Six niggaz eat, divided off one pie
A nigga as ill as me is so hard to come by
Squeeze this rap shit til the well run dry
I never spoke to one time not even one time
Look at my brain it's every rapper combined
I'm bout to OD on some shit like Sublime

[Chorus]
Who are you to question, how I live
When the whole entire world is negative
I'm just tryna eat, tryna stay alive
Keep my hustle in the street til the day I die
I'm just another face from a movie screen
A tough little nigga from a magazine
I said you're lookin for trouble if you want his cream
Remember everything ain't what it seem
Now can you feel me?  Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?  Can you feel me motherfucker?
Can you feel me?  Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?  Then get it right motherfucker

[Sticky Fingaz]
A'yo pass that, niggaz like that get blast at
Your life flashback, you was born out the asscrack
You mad wack, walk around with that gas pack
You get laughed at and asked that where the mask at
15.3 match that, coupe hatchback
I'm a class act, got assets, where the ass at?
I do you like I did them niggaz on the last track
We like dice, if you gon' roll don't ass bet
I won't rest in peace, even in my casket
Had the '03 hum' in '02 and I crashed that
I rap slash act, seven digits I cash that
Niggaz wan' dead the beef now but it's passed that

[Chorus]</pre>
