[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Flipmode bitch! Streetsweepers bitch! Kayslay! Greg Street! Busta Rhymes!
Streets fuck with me!!! Come on!

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
See it's unaminous that I'm the catalyst analyst and strategist
On how to be the king of the city feel me
The God of the block the one that hail the throne in the hood
Must I reiterate the slot of the crown as you should
Over here in this here direction don't fight the fact it's amazin
Fuck yo' reluctance and the procrastination
That's why most of the time I look and I listen I don't let it worry me
It's undisputed you got it locked on every block currently
Call me the first or call me the last
The basic foundation of all things trust the truth is comin to pass
Call me the maker the owner creme of the lavish livin creator
Owner of flow teacher of the master spittin if you will
Go argue with your friends and the friends of them friends
See it's essential you let them know who is the most influentual
Kayslay Busta Bus drippin you every ounce of it
Bangin more powerful than the United States Councilate

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
From my mouth, to the street, I got the heat, hold the fort
Then I lock, every block, every hood, what you thought
From the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Kayslay and Greg Street a go off, a go off

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Official on the way down from the streets to the judicial system
See the nickel plated chrome Ferrari angel make them bitches whistle
The pistol that I carry is licensed
Despite I'm a felon I ingrade my initials on the handle with a hyphen
When I pop I make 'em wild like the hyphy movement
Type environment inappropriate shouldn't bring your wifey to it
King of holdin the title always growin you know it's me
You know it's 'sposed to be how it's official bitch diplomacy
You it's such shit it's so glorious
And while your caught in the matrix just call me Morpheus AKA Lord Victorious
The streets applaudin us Feds is recordin our conversation
While celebratin this new release enjoy this good occasion
My proclamation make sure your thoroughly aware
The domination that it's about to occur while your heart is racin
Streetsweepers, Flipmode bitch while we continue to shine y'all
What you forgot, thought I remind y'all

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
From my mouth, to the street, I got the heat, hold the fort
Then I lock, every block, every hood, what you thought
From the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Kayslay and Greg Street a go off, a go off
From my mouth, to the street, I got the heat, hold the fort
Then I lock, every block, every hood, what you thought
From the south, to the west, to the east, to the north
Kayslay and Greg Street a go off, a go off

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]

To the west nigga! Kayslay! Greg Street! Busta Rhymes bitch!!!
And like I said, Flipmode bitch!!! Streetsweepers bitch!!!
