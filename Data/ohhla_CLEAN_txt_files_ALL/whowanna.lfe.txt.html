[Intro: Streetlife (Size/7)]
Yeeeeeaah! Yeah
Ain't where you from (it's where you at)
You got the blunt (I got the Mac)
You got the clip (I got the gat)
You got the {*click, click*}
You got the clip (I got the gat)
I got my front (I gotcha back)
It's like.. it's like that
It's like that - Yeah..
It's like that - Yeah, yeah

[Streetlife]
Shaolin What!?! Blood, God and monster truck
Come through, splash mud on ya three-piece tux
Niggas act bulletproof like they can't get touched
Don't make me hop out the sunroof and start hittin you up
I'm outta control when the dough's low, rob and tote
Never vacated a hoe, bomb with cons and pros
I might snatch ya jewels, pawn ya gold
Call P.O. and be like - FUCK PAROLE!
Y'all have got to go and became a mould
Watch me drop and load, FIRE IN THE HOLE!
Here to change the game, started sayin names
When ya ass get shot, the cops know who the blame
You watch too much movies, wanna be all talk and Kane
2Pac, everybody wanna act the same
Feel my pain, rap niggas dyin for fame
Feel my pain, rap niggas is dyin for fame

[Chorus: Streetlife (Size/7)]
(You Wanna Rap?) Who the fuck wanna be an MC?
(Tote the Mac?) Who the fuck wanna be an MC?
(Lounge in the back?) Who the fuck wanna be an MC?
(Platinum plaques?) Who the fuck wanna be an MC?

[Streetlife]
Most of y'all rap cats is weak, talk is cheap
Check my rap sheet, concrete, strictly Street
I put in work, overtime, I build with sleek
Hail, rain, sleet, I walks the beat
Fucks, M.O. - no justice, no piece
Fuck the judge, for feedin my thugs to the beast
I know the ledge thats why I keeps one in the head
Make one false move, fill ya body with lead
I'm true to the game, stay true to my name
Off the chain? Quick to put two in ya brain
I'm from the Hill, where niggas shoot to kill
Test my skill, nigga I wish you will
Don't front for me, give niggas lumps in three
I beat you down in front ya mom, wife and seed
Call ya monks, I'm out to call ya bluff
You ain't enough, word up, you straight ass and butt
Shaolin What!?!

[Chorus: Streetlife (Size/7)]
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (You Wanna Rap?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Tote the Mac?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Lounge in the back?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Platinum plaques?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Stretch Caddilac?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Blow ya stack?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Flip ya hat?)
Who the fuck wanna be an MC? (Pimp like The Mack?)</pre>
