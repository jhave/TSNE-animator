[Big Syke]
Come take a ride with a boss playa
In "The Land Of The Loss"
Where some choose to die
And own homies double cross
It ain't no love only thugs
With attitude
Steady droppin boulders
Every day hang overs
Surrounded by soldiers
In the midst of confusion
Am I losin
It's gettin hard on my body
Addicted to the drugs I'm usin
Is it an illusion infactuation at it's peak
It fucked me up cause I thought
I saw my ghetto freak
I bust a U what can I do
But just let her know
You look like a winner
Let's have dinner tomorrow at 4
No room for no
Close the door of my L-Dog intrected
It's time to come a new in my rear view
Lookin back
Another day around the way
Where niggas stay
More chicken's then PopEye's
Get it raw and fried
Many die but you can't tell by the smell
Some time's it's like a livin hell
Come take a ride with me

[Chorus]
Would you come and creep with me
Live the lifestyles of a "G"
As we're mobbin through the streets
You can see just what we see
[2x]

[Krow]
I don't love nobody
That don't love me
As I was stoppin up at the light
In my drop top SCC
See half them niggas
Jumpin out of their shit
Comin up to jack me
The ski mask the nine mills
Everyone of them on strpaed G
I swallow my pride
As I clutch my loaded 22
Trouble on my mind
Thinkin to myself
What am I gonna do
Start blastin
Or take a chance on getting
My wig split
Or raise up out of my ride
And let these niggas have it
I thought about all the in's and outs
That I was facin
But even a G can spot a no win situation
They got me blocked in
So I ain't thinkin of hittin the gas
And I'ma dead man
If they see me reachin fast
So I slide my 22 up under my front seat
Then I raise my hands up in the air
Nice and easy
As I watched my ride rollin away
I was so furious
I swear on my life I'ma get them
Dirty mothafuckas

[Chorus]

[Knightowl]
I'm thinkin about all them fools
And all of them things they did
You know that I'm back
You better be ready to battle
And ever since you was a kid
I never had love of the fake
I think I made a mistake
The day I trusted you
Now fool you gotta get dusted
Now I'm disgusted
I thought you was my dawg
But things will changed
Now that I'm stackin chips
I be the one that gots the clips
And now I'm bringin hits
You best get out the way
Cause I'm the one that's comin through
The Knightowl be given em all those
Things that they wanna to listen to
I hope that some day
When I see that ass around the way
You fight me like a man
But I forgot you be my biggest fan
But I will not remember
All of them things
We did when we was young
Cause you's a punk
Full of that junk
So now you're in my trunk
About to get dropped off
Inside of that tank with acid
Much love to all of them fools
That bump my shit and blast it
Come creep with the baddest of them all
On this wicked ride
And let me show you how them streets be
Where I reside

[Chorus]</pre>
