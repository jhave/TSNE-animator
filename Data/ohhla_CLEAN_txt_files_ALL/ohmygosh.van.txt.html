Oh My Gosh (x6)

[Verse 1]
Hey you check it I think it's time to wreck it
So here I go again with the stuff so let's test it
Cool like the ice Vanilla here's the flava
Freezin' up the mic to hit ya with so you can savor
No slippin nor stonin gettin straight to the point
Hit the mad izm and light another joint
Tha easy like style is what I kick when
I'm kickin no trippin I'm splittin
So get a good whiff and get with the style
That I'm using no guessin
So here's a quick lesson I got my Smith &amp; Wesson
Listen up close and there will be no confusion
Now you're addicted to mentally abuse it
Word to the mutha, I'm here to tear it up
And if ya can't get with it, I don't give a
So run and tell ya crew and tell 'em ICE is near
This here is for the people the ICE is rated lethal

[Verse 2]
Here I come with the nine in my hand
It's time to wreck shop now tell me who's the man
Just like Ali I'm the thriller in Manila
Tearin stuff up like my man Godzilla
Makin the suckers drop when ya steppin
To my zone comin' straight up like my man Al Capone
You try to cross me up I'll jump you like you was a checker
And like jerry Rice I'm into breakin' all records
Rollin' with my crew firm up a blunt
My hands on the pump bust you on beachfront
In case you forgot I'm here to remind you
I'm chiller, chiller than the ice on Vanilla
Word, word to the herb as you heard
I'm hittin' 3 pointers just like Larry Bird
you can't touch this, welcome to the hit list
Try to play me out, you catch a big fist quick
Pop in ya eye, don't try to ask me why
Cause it's like that fool ya hangin' with the ICE
Cause it's cool and like I said this here's for
Tha people the ICE is rated lethal

[Verse 3]
It goes a 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4
The ICE be the leader, so open up the door
Check it out, cuz what I'm all about is gettin
Mad paid, cuz the green is real sticky
My stuff is kinda tricky, so listen up close
And when ya ask the ladies they love the ICE the most
So open up ya car and look inside here
And keep ya self in line you and please don't stare
Cuz cool is how I'm coolin and there just isn't nuttin' to it
Don't ask me no questions, cuz you already knew it
Now get with the program and listen to the style
So lend me an ear so I can get buck wild
Ya girly can't resist it so chill while I kick it
So bur a hootie mac so go ahead and twist it
My records on the table, I'm droppin' it on the needle
This here is for the people that ICE is rated lethal</pre>
