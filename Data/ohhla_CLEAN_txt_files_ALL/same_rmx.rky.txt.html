Kells Ush &amp; T you all flossing hard off in the club, we're about to triple up

[T-Pain Verse]
Hi my name is Teddy
Unfortunately you all don't know me
But I couldn't help but over hear what you all was saying about te-te
See I, I know her too
Obviously so do you
So I'm gonna get in this conversation too
Do she got a crib?
[R. Kelly]
Yep
[T-Pain]
By the waffle house
[R. Kelly]

[T-Pain]
Did she show you that thing that she be doing with her mouth?
[R. Kelly]
MAN
[T-Pain]
She know how to cock them legs back
The greatest sex in your life
[R. Kelly]
YEP
[T-Pain]
Yeah I know 'cause she's my wife
[Usher]
WAIT A MINUTE HOLD ON DOG
Nigga ain't no "hold on "back up"
You all niggas gonna make me act up
I'm out here busting my ass for her
and you all out here tearing her back up
And you just can't tell me that you didn't see that ring on her finger
I'm even tryna help her be a singer
That's why she was at that party in Atlanta,
When I told her ass not to go out to Chicago
While I'm out here doing my thing in Tallahassee
You all out here treating my wife like a straight hoe
I can't believe this Bitch
I can't believe this Shit
Everything I ever did for her I'm taking it back, I'm so through with it
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I took time out of my life to have these niggas fuck my wife and call her...

[Chorus]

[R. Kelly Verse]
Hold up [4x] Wait a minute [2x]
Just wait one got dog on minute
You can't do the remix without putting some "R'er" in it
'Cause I hit it first square business
At the Ritz in the Chi square business
It's the king of the flirt square business,
Nigga I ain't gotta lie square business
She's my shawty my tenderonni
My booty call when I'm horny
I am Bobby this is Whitney when we getting HIGH (HIGH)
Spent that money played that game

Got good brains she made it rain
She's my limp and I'm her pain
you're sure we talking about the same
She she call me big old head
And I call her bobble head
The way she wiggle it when I'm hitting it from the back up in my bed,
and the way she be screaming my name
and the way she be giving me brain, and when it's all over
She say...
Kelly you got the game
So back up T or it's gonna cause you some pain
Man I wish you would call her the same

[Chorus]

Now can I flip can I flip
You can flip it [2x]
Snap ya fingers [4x]

[R. Kelly Verse]
Yeah... yeah you all yeah... I like this
If you're in the club let me see you two stepping right now
Come on put your stunners on
Gonna two step [repeat]
I'm in the club with a drink in my hand
Stunting hard looking like about a hundred grand
Ready to spend it all
So shawty take it off
Just call the club a gym 'cause a niggas ready to ball
Think I'll buy the bar
Leave with her in my car
Hit it with my stunner on like a rock star
I know you all think I'm crazy
Kells gonna wild B-I-ITCH
This is just a freestyle
Whoah... yeah

"Snap your fingers do your step you can do it all by yo self" [2x]
