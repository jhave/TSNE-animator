Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In life, I think our aspirations should guide us
Even if there's thing we could never provide or
Be beside, Lord, just give the right to desire or admire such
The finer things you know
To dream is to live life's full potential
So whatever I'm into, I get it in too

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)
Breezin down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to Aston Martin Music Music

Let's go
You gotta turn me up if you feel this mo'fucker

Shout out Chrissy, Rozay and all that
I'm just feelin' that good today you know what I'm sayin'
D.C What's up, Maryland, PG, MoCo, VA
Lets do it

[Verse 1: Wale]
Smooth mo'fucka, let me do this mo'fucka
Riding shotgun uptown, blowin out the bubble
Tints ain't legal, I ain't ordinary people
Porn star hands, she gon' suck it like a sequel
Life without dreamin' is a life without meanin'
I'm grinding like "I gotta hope all my niggaz see it
My garments shouldn't be here, I'm somewhere near the future
As far as being hard, I feel I'm somewhere near Medusa
And everywhere I be at, no I'm at somewhere near my shoota
I swear my peoples keep a strapped like Pinky in the movies
I'm doin well, I'm just hoping I got your respect
Ironic this verse was conceived while drivin' a Lex

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)
Breezin down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)
Just me and my boss no worries at all
Listening to Aston Martin Music Music

(Back on that No Days Off)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look
Momma ain't raise a thug, Pops ain't raise a ho
I keep a level head, Gettin high layin low
Morty let me use the Maybach back in May
I told him wait, I'll have another for him 28s?
Stackin my chicken, braggin to the bitches
No crucifix chains, I'm ain't sure if I'm forgiven, Lord
I need a better way, I want that Aston
But I got fam havin' problems with they FAFSA
I'm prioritizing, a part of growing up
A lot fathers showin' off instead of showin up
A lot of niggaz love a broad till she throwin' up
9 months later, new car, can't afford a son
Talking 'bout..

[Chorus: Drake]
Would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I cant let it go
Whether that's right I will never know (ugh but here goes nothin')

Ralph

No Days Off

[Wale - Verse 3]
Ughh
Smokin' slight bud?, Coolin with my lil bruh
Ol' heads schoolin me, sayin' "Soak it up"
A lot of niggaz in my position don't know as much
A lot of women from conversation could fall in love
And that's a scary thing, I try to duck em good
Cause innocent women'll stalk you if you fuck em good
I'm sayin' that I know, revealing them most
My God come before this bread
Guess I'm different than most
See, Mel made a couple milli sellin' Jesus passion
Why these new black churches all resemble castles?
How the Church be always mad when I can't do a handout?
And why these pastor keep messin' with these boys Astons
Ralph

[Chorus - Chrisette Michelle]
We bobbin to the music this is how we do it (all night)
Breezin' down the freeway just me and my baby (in our ride)
Just me and my boss no worries at all
