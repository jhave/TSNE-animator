[Hystwise]
Hystwise you know sonnin' niggaz often
double dead one'll shove the gun into your coffin

[Clowd9yne]
Stoopin' ya' wave when I'm shockin' ya' brain
I'm over clouded elevated stay on top of the rain

[PV]
PV that one kid man I talk shit and wreck well too
So sick people saying get well soon

[Skeemo]
If it's drama I'm a let the thing pop
Skeemo sling rocks like white kids with slingshots

[R.E.U.]
R E the invincible smash chapters of past actors
So called starts please seek the principle

[Juganot]
My sanity has always been in question
I never practiced the conventional ways of expression

[SixXx]
SixXx be the man the myth answer this
Which cat can take SixXx out and his clique

[Radius]
The rap Elmer Fudd niggaz can't duck us
Nuckers Rads' one bad muh'fucker

[Kas]
I roll with sick niggaz with quick triggers my crew'll blast 'em
I done hit niggaz for six figures and you can ask 'em

[Brolik]
I'm drunk when I drive I'm high when I rhyme
I ain't with that petty shit but we could do a real crime

[Bugzy Bogart]
I been spittin' in cyphers since ya'll kids shittin' in diapers
Hittin' the snipers VI is priceless my clique's the nicest</pre>
