When I get stressed and shit
Yo I know you get stressed to
We all got stress
And all they're trying to tell you is meditation
and relaxing and all that shit
Fuck that man, that shit don't work
There's one thing that you can do
It's gonna be a peach  But you gotta listen to me

You just...
You just...
You just...
You just...

Kill Kill Kill Somebody
Kill Kill Kill Somebody
Kill Kill Kill Somebody
(Take a deep breath, grab your knife and just do it)
Kill Kill Kill Kill

Kill Kill Kill Somebody
Kill Kill Kill Somebody
Kill Kill Kill Somebody
(Just Take a deep breath, grab your knife and just do it)
Kill Kill Kill Kill

Just kill your mother, that ain't cause your woman clean
'Shut the fuck up bitch' and you stab her with a spleen
Kill your father that drunk and fucking waste a life
Wait till he's sleeping and give his fucking troath a slice
Just kill your teacher right in the fucking classroom
Drag his bloody body inside the school bathroom
Right between the classes when the halls are packed
So all the nerds who go to school that are like 'What the fuck was that?'
Kill your best friend when he's hanging at your house chilling
'Nah man that's my homey' 'Man fuck it - just kill him'
Take a sinder arc and smash it over his head
And beat his bloody open skull till you know he's fucking dead
Hide the body in the closet till it starts to stink
Chop him up with a paster and dispose him in a sink
Cause I know the way you think and it's just like you
You wanna kill everybody see I'm just like you
So in the middle of the night, sneak out your crib
Break into the neighbours and don't the wake the kids
And pour gasoline all over the house
Light a match throw that shit in and burn the whole joint down
Just kill people, old people, young people, black people white people
Don't discriminate  We're all equal
I know nobody understands you and they think you're strange
So take it from me  that's my last name

(Chorus X 2)

Go ahead and stab him, get a gun and blast him
Break a pipe and crack him, randomly attack him
Get creative with em' torture when you kill em'
Make them scream your name within in vein make him a victim
Split him wide open and take them organs and guts
Throw them at people in the street like  WHAT
Fuck  So many people to kill  So little time
Murder, kill, rape, rob, steal, commit crime
Go to school tomorrow try to top columbine
In a trench coat with an Uzi killing kids without a time
Kill the whole world till it's just you left
And stab your head with a pen till you kill your fucking self
I'm ill, I'm Q and I'm Prozac and Peckville
Take Jones wand it might as well be sugarpills
Cause it does nothing for me man I still wanna kill
I'm not gonna sop till my heart gets spilled
So what the fuck you waiting for, just go ahead and do it
Don't stop till your covered in blood and body fluids
HaHaHaHaHahahahahahahahahaha
DO IT YOU CHICKENSHIT .. Fuck

(Chorus X 2)

Kill
Yeah what the fuck your waiting for
What are you a little bitch?
Just do it
(Take a deep breeath, grab your knife and just do it)
Don't talk the shit, do the shit
Little bitch
Shit
Cause if you was shit you don't just fucking kill somebody man
He's right  Just fucking do it
(Take a deep breath, grab your knife and just do it)

(Chorus X2)</pre>
