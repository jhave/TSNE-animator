I'm trying hard to understand you
And your over-rated state of mind
Sometimes you try to move me to you
And make believe that it's all fine

And you say you love me, yes you do
But I know who I'm talking to
You left me so lonely and empty
And I don't need, your alibis
Cause I can see through all your lies
You say you love me and I'll need you
But I don't need to live my life that way
No way

Every storm deserves an ending
And a break to peaceful skies
And every night I pray for my own mending

And you say you love me yes you do
But I know who I'm talking to
You left me so lonely, empty
And I don't need, your alibis
Cause I can see through your disguise
You say you love me and I'll need you
But I don't need you in my life that way
No way

Parading around like you're a superstar
Is that who you think you are
The higher you go, yeah, the harder you fall

You say you love me, yes you do
But I know who I'm talking to
You left me so lonely and empty
And I don't need, your alibis
Cause I can see through your disguise
You say you love me and I'll need you
But I don't need you in my life that way
No way</pre>
