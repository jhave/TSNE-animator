[Tyler, the Creator]
If this was a game, I already know that I would come out winner
And I'm not braggin; I'ma be in her
but this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like Splinter
Juicy and hot, such a black bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
but I don't give a fuck and or even +List+en like +Schindler+
She's cute but her forehead's big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco
that O.J. killed the white whores with
A wealthy white girl without the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet
Leave the bitch breathless; but what the bitch don't know
is that I'm a motherfuckin sellout and a rapist

[Chorus]
Baby, you're an angel
How about we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic cause your lipstick's red, of course
I stuffed you in the trunk, drunk
cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow
and snort... blow

[Tyler, the Creator]
If this was a game
I would be considered a motherfuckin legend
And I ain't trying to gas you like Chevron
But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage
Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of "uhhhhh"
Tryin to find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck
So now it's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit
You're very attractive
and notice that my hat is always the color of cactus
And I hang with wolves, cause I'm an evil bastard
Pictures of you on my wall no glue no tape but just cum - plastered
Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch
{*snoring*} If you wanted a date, don't come
Now you gotta make it easy for you don't run
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum
And you call this shit rape, but I think that rape's fun
Wait, now it's about eight something
It's late and you stuck in my base one
Come downstairs with nothing but a shoestring
Yeah bitch, this date's done

[Chorus] - 2X

[talking over Chorus repeat]
Watch a movie
Do somethin
Ride bikes
Take a trip to the beach, you can go anywhere

[Outro]
I like my girls how I like my drugs - white
Lord; you so pretty, laying in my arms
I just got one request...
Stop breathing</pre>
