[Intro: Trife Diesel]
Holla at this nigga Starks, real fast
Try to get him on the phone
See if he gon' come out and fuck with the fellas, tonight
This nigga never answer his phone though
Answer the phone, bro, pick up

[Trife Diesel]
What up, Tone? It feel good to see your boy back home
Call up the coolest, hit the club and take shots of Patron
I'mma snatch Du and tell Wigs to holla at Vel
I tried to reach out to Bean but I think he lost his cell
You know a party ain't a party without, Bugs and Gritty
It's been a while since Staten Island crushed the city
I know you heard what 50 did to Officer Ricky
God damn, what a pity, that boy was looking silly
I'mma get dressed and kill 'em with the baby blue mink
With the matching maury's you bought me, when you was with Bink
I hit you back right after I clean my jewels in the sink
And brink the toast cuz you know I act a fool when I drink
So please answer your jack, just don't leave me hanging flat
And I forgot to tell you, son, you sound banging on them tracks
So fuck it, let's meet up at the gas station
I tried to have patience, for real, Starks, don't have me there waiting

[Ghostface Killah]
Come on, Trife, he right, it been a while since we hung out
But I ain't gonna go if ya'll niggas decide to dumb out
Remember that time when niggas had to pull the guns out?
And Big Den almost ripped this clown nigga tongue out
Even though he asked for it, that shit could of been avoided
Paparazzi was out and my name could of got exploited
Here's the deal, I'mma go ahead and finish my meal
And wait for C to call so we can talk about his appeal
Take a shower, get dressed and throw on my Gucci machs
You see Shy, tell his ass to stay out of the loosy spot
Cause it's hard on Todd G, you know how the narcs be
Oh shit, I forgot my bitch took my car keys
So check it, don't even sweat it, I'mma snatch the two seater
And leave these haters sick like they caught the flu fever

[Shawn Wigs]
Nah, Tone, I'll drive, I got the double extra Danali
Been sitting at the crib with them plates from Cali
And them two full bottles of that pure white Hennessey
Few ounces of sour, then we can blow endlessly

[Ghostface Killah]
The nights on me, don't even reach in your pocket
I put twenty straight on the number and hit the jackpot

[Shawn Wigs]
Yo, Trife, what's up with Kryme and Tommy Whispers?
Been thinking bout bringing Johnny Mack and some misfits
We ball up, hit the mall up, drink some screwface
Goons is muscle, son, the hoes with walls up

[Trife Diesel]
Yo, what up with the Lord?

[Shawn Wigs]
He gon' stop for a drink
And Vel picking up Du, son, they blowing that stink
It's a Theodore event, we gon' party all night

[Trife Diesel]
And watch Cappa show up

[Ghostface Killah]
Don't put nothing past Donnamite</pre>
