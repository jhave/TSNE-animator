Chorus:
(Natalie 
[Natalie]   I'm so bubbalicious and so delicious
            You can't resist it, now can we kick it
            Are you my friend?
[Baby Bash] Yes, I'm your friend
            You're so supernatural (Uh huh)
            When you dancin' on the pole (Uh huh)
            Baby, say, "Oh, oy
            Whoa-oy"

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash]
(Verse 1)
You keep it bubbalicious, girl, and that's what's up
You come and lend your business, girl, and that's what's up
We gon' fuck it when you shake it, girl, and that's what's up
You want it, you can take it, girl, and that's what's up
Super duper fly, baby girl, you so growed
Bringin' more flavor than some cold rocky road
I'm high as Nate Dogg on the Next Episode
Ain't no trouble when we bubble, girl, let the game flow

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 2)
Now how the hell you get a player so electrified
Is that a dance you doin' or an excersize
Baby, take me to a place where my spirit run free
Dance like we in France, mama, oooh, oui, oui
You the type of chick who love skirts and high heels
I'm the type of cat who love throwin' dollar bills
Ain't no trouble when we bubble
Fly like a breeze
You beat the Hennesey
I'm a be your lemon squeeze

Repeat Chorus

[Baby Bash]
Bubbalicious, ah yeah, so fly
Bubbalicious, ah yeah, so fly
Bubbalicious, ah yeah, so fly
Bubbalicious, ah yeah, so fly

Repeat Chorus Twice</pre>
