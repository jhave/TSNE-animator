Intro:
DJ Pooh. Zuu Tribe 97. T-Lee feels gold drastic. Yeah get the cash.

T-Lee:
Since money rules the world I'm a stay on the grind
Sky high feelin' fine in this west sunshine
I'm a rhyme all about my chips I ain't lyin'
I got my foot on the floor in the fast lane flyin'
Drape the double R L in an Accura or a M
Thoroughbreds chasin' me and they bad as hell
Mr. Lee, Zuu Tribe it ain't hard to tell
Hug the brakes get the number that's a player right there
See a chick goin' spin just like a nigga spin
Make sure you spin more so you always win
This a petty game but who's to blame for the shame
It ain't the same talkin' bout bein' they thang
I motivate graduate that's the plan for the (money)
But ain't broke, stressed and trippin' (actin' funny)
Dummy, get equipped, you're tryin' to playerhate
Stay off the next man you better go on and graduate

Hook:
When the situations dollars it's time to smash
Two thousand zero zero party's over get the cash (oooh)
When it's all said and done we get the last laugh
Fuck what you heard bad newz travels fast

T-Lee:
You got much grande beats that bang
We got saucy ass lyrics that swang
And a whole other zone 
And three of 'em straight gone
We'll fade that ass on wax or off the dome
We strive to be the tightest top notch on the scene
Be like a fiend stay down with my team
It's a pity
Huh, situation gettin' shitty
When Lee come through will Zuu Tribe take the city?
These niggas ain't Ballers these niggas ain't phillies
But these niggas don't the most these niggas kill me
You wouldn't understand this path we done chose 
Rise for much more than chips, cars coast to hoes 
Throwin' bolos at fake ass ballers with fake clothes
Lead ya to the left straight killin' your soul
Let it be told 
Everything that glitters is not gold
Got platinum recipes so our unit is sold

Hook 

"Is it the future"

Verse 3:
Stop the sleepin' game not free
You flip ? h.o.e. the 9-7 the B. is a B.
I want the millions most defiantly
So me, giving you mine is something I can't see
I guess the real team hard make ya wanna freak freak
Cause I hand with major players that got nothing but heat
Me myself I'm a hustla
Money is what I'm after
Catch me on the next page on the next chapter
Only half of these rides get my respect 
The other perpetrating' 50 need they weave check
I can't trip though cause niggas trick for these chicks
Blow up they hair buy' em thangs ain't even hip
It sound sick don't it?
You're damn right it is
Cause when you're actin' like that how you gonna handle your biz?
We want the ?  the S.C. lyrical triple
But you call Zuu Tribe the worldwide money getters
