[Mr. Cheeks]
I run with crooks that be in Donald Goines books
Thugs selling drugs up on blocks, cops and lady looks
Ain't nothing pretty in my city that's shitty
My man's was running round up on the Isle, he caught a buck fitty
To the grill, things are getting ill
At times it makes me wanna holla, when I'm down to my last dollar bill
We keepin' it real, see, that's the only way to keep it
See I'm a legal drug thug getting Legal Drug Money so peep it
Back in the days when we used to hear about the square
I heard alotta bodies used to get caught up by shotties there
And out in 40 where Ebonishah got killed
And I be like playing cuz it feel
So much envy, got to kill a man if he comes
Fear my path... shout outs to the J wrath
And the whole LB staff

[Chorus 2x: Lost Boyz]
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right
It's all right

[Freaky Tah]
It's all right, I feel light
Smoke and ball every day and night
Kill 'em with the Lost Boy crew in the park
Ass in the pool and the fools gettin sparked
I feel higher, level, nigga, they roll with the devils
Spring, I be doing my thing with my crew
This is how I do, with the Pretty Ralou
And Spigg Nice and Freak, and Mr. Cheeks
Rolling dice and ripping up concretes
I'm like coming in the winter where the sun and the shine
I'm the brightest star, niggas ask who are you
I'm Freaky Tah, that's who I am
I be bugging cuz I don't give a damn
Chilling with my niggas, I'm quick to pull triggers
And get to get biggest, copping up all the figures
Listen when I come into it, all right
I be bugging up, blowing like dynomite
Just chill and relax, don't tax
Lost Boyz in the back

[Chorus 2x]

[Big Dex]
Yo, one-two, you find a place to really run to
When it's on, so welcome into my zone
It's Dex coming into your home
And then I, blends in with tones
That makes ya knees buckle and numbs ya back bone
I'm back from the home of the nappy vagabonds
That means I just flew in from Queens
To earn my presidents by any means
Cuz my third eye and me and my society is firing me
You see beef, you can't defy the G in it's entirety
Aiyo, dred, my soul colide the dead
So earning bread, my eyes of though with red'll bop ya heads up
A urban dweller, we creepin' diggin ya cellars at night
And it's all right

[Chorus]

[Mr. Cheeks]
The microphone I split apart, I be like Moses
What you suppose, miss?
I be with the fellas puffing L every day of the wake
Me, Freaky Tah and Pretty Lou and the Spigg
Digging deep down into the grave, I dismiss
Any MC who tries to go against this
My crew is very thick I reprsent the Van Wyck
And 1-3-4 knocking at your fucking door
Close your window, I be having baggy jeans, Timberland
Boots steel toe, I be getting biz yo
Big Dex take a pull of this L
So I can go and raise some hell
From the back, I will attack
Twelve o'clock, exact, wearing black
Timberlands and a Phil jacket
I be with the niggas and we be causing racket
Can't forget Mark and the B Lover
And my nigga Melquan, the don, niggas getting on
The fame, I be with the man whos insane
Big Henny, shout out to all of my men
In the pen, even upstate
Niggas pushing weight, niggas pushing weight
And bitches... it's all right

[Chorus]

[Freaky Tah]
Think it to yourself
A tear fell from my eye
I gots to get wide
Niggas got to die, every day
Another, another, another
Niggas take cover with the new shit
That hold nine, got ta ----</pre>
