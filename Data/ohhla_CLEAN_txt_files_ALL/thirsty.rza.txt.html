[Intro: Beretta 9 (RZA)]
Drip, drip
It's hot outside man (drop, drop) One, two
I know niggas is +Thirsty+ (boodoodoodooodoodoo)
(Bobby Digital) One, two
It's hot outside (Bo-Bo-Bo-Bo)
About a motherfuckin' hundred degrees, humid
(Bo-Bobby, yeah, Digital)
And niggas is +Thirsty+ (Di-Di-Di-Digital)

[Beretta 9 (RZA)]
Ayo, this I dedicate to niggas who bust guns
All my live niggas who sold Vamps and didn't +Run+
My juveniles wild to stay out past their curfew
A build upon life and drink beers like their pops do
A subject of the streets, yo kid it's +Burning Season+
Don't expose the joint without intentional reason
Summer time (Digital), dehydrated, niggas out to quench thirst
Quench thirst, we might want to stay in home, oh fuck it
Rock the camo', I got the ammo
A long shot, look like I play for the Knicks
So call me Rambo, Beretta 9, Killarm' recon' (Digital)
Rob me, I might rob you, then it be on

[RZA]
Digital...
Radical +White Boy+ push skate board, not Mountain Dew
Old splash, d'ya see that bright yellow shirt with the Wu W?
Faced you with the flight of a butter fly wing
Fierce as the eagle, sting of the underground beatle
Might wobble or fall down inside the squabble
In summer time, cracked the ice cold bottle
Take the swallow, and give all praises due to the true
And do the Dew, just do the Dew, do the Dew...</pre>
