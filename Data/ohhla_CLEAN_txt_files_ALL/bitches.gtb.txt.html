[ VERSE 1: Willie D ]
No sooner than I walk in the club I'm gettin love from the masses
Women admirin my baldhead and glasses
They makin passes, I see they asses, I'm gettin flirty
I got that liquor in my system plus I'm wild and dirty
In my pockets is tickets for the Rockets
Million dollar nigga from the projects
I see no logic in niggas' hate when I ride past
My .45 sing lullabyes to they tired ass
See me, I be a candidate for bustin
Don't fuck around unless you ready for the repercussions
Baby blushing, she drives a Benz, but I handle em all
Sophisticated as fuck, and she ain't wearin no drawers

[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
I met the broad in the parking lot, riding a 'Stang
Pulled her way up to her parking spot, the escalade
She hesitated for a minute, then she finally stopped
When she seen a nigga hollerin at her ridin a drop
Out her car to my passenger side the bitch came
Say she in a hurry this time, but no thang
Here's the pager number, I can call at night
Rarely ever beeped a bitch, but this broad was tight
Better yet got the cellular number, she seemed changed
Diamonds 'bout the size of a dime, and these thangs
Tend to to em open, no question and one reason
That diamonds be a girl's best friends, so I treat them
Like bitches

[ VERSE 3: Tela ]
These bitches I be doin in, hoes I be screwin, and
If she talk about her friends, then I probably flew em in
What's a man troublin, like fuckin in a bubble Benz
With her hair in the wind, sittin up from the rim
Gettin ????, plenty room, it was in the month of June
I was on promotional, she was into trickin dudes
I'm no dude, or no guy, but I can fuckin get you high
I won't tell you any lie, I don't play with any mind
She know about the L-o-t and how we roll
She know about the L-o-t and say we all cold
We can keep this on the we-know, we meet back in Rio
My bitch and my ho, my half-black Philipino
You know
Come on</pre>
