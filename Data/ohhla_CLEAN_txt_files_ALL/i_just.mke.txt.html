[Verse 1]
Girl you fine, amazing body stuck on my mind
You body smoother than wine, my mission to make you mind
I can't sleep, I can't eat without you up in my world
I want you and just you fuck all them other girls
I've been patiently waiting for your man to slip up
So I can flip up to your crib and tare them hips up
Girl Pick up your phone and call Mike Jones
And I promise you good sex and late night moans
As I roam to your home the only thang on my mind
Is how I'm going to tare that ass up from behind
But untill I get there keep the pussy more wet
I brought so don perron, cristal, and moet'
And Latex for more sex, cause it's about to go down
I really love the way you scream while I'm knocking you down
Baby turn on the fire place and light up the candles
Cause Mike Jones about to give you something you can't handle
If you wanna get dicked down let me know now
Cause in that ass I get down like "James Brown"
I'm Mike Jones (Who), Mike Jones Jones
That will come when you call and fuck up yo walls
Cause I spit game good and dick down dames good
I know you heard my name in your neck of the woods
But tonight I want you to close your eyes
And picture my size inside your insides
And I hope you don't mind me dirty talking while we fucking
And  me grabbing on yo head while you down low sucking
Boo I hope you don't mind cause that's what I do
And if you bout it bout it lil momma then come on through
I want you and just you I don't need your friends
I wanna hit it from the morning till the daylight ends
Then we can hop in the shower
And let the rain hit your back while I hit it for an hour
I'm high as a tower, cause your sex great
But I had to dick you down just to set the record straight
About Mike Jones, and how my love is so strong
You ain't fucking with a minute man cause I go so long
I don't brag on my penis I let you do that
You might call me a genuis after I run through that
Yeah I just wanna love you baby...Mike Jones Jones
