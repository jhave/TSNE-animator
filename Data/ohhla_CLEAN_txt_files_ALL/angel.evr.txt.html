I'm gon' find me a woman that's real
I'm gon' find me a woman that's strong
I'm gon' find me a woman that's oh so true
I got a pedestal to put her on

I found me a girl, she's sweet as good be
And everything in her world revolved all around me
I had a chance to make her mine but I was too blind to see
And now I got to let her go and pray she comes back to me

She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend

I'm gon' find me a woman that's young
I'm gon' find me a woman that's pretty
I'm gon' find me a woman that swears I'm the one
And I'm a try not to treat her shitty

Girl I been drinkin' ever since you've been gone
And I been thinkin' maybe that I was wrong
You been holdin' out for way too long
I get this feeling you don't wanna belong

She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend

I'm gon' find me a woman that's tough
I'm gon' find me a woman that's loyal
I'm gon' find me a woman that say she got enough
And that's one I'm gonna spoilt

Well I've been waitin' such a very long time
My heart's gon' break girl if I don't make you mine
What's past is past, what's done I cannot rewind
All said and done girl, so you're one of a kind

She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend

She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend
I hater her cause I love her so I hurt her again
Don't want no other lover, won't go through it again
She's my angel, she's my lover, she's my very best friend</pre>
