(CJ Mac)
I still sell around the club, grips and bloods and hoodrats, all around me
Ain't nobody guards, but ain't nobody tryin' to clown me
Hehe, my ass motherfucker try an' test
Last six days your whole gay crew, buyin' vests and ass bets
Hit it like DeNiro and Pacino gettin' head like I'm Little Nickie
Play the "Casino", greedy bitches gettin' blown like Sharon gettin' stoned
But this ain't no fuckin' movie, ain't nobody yellin' "cut" and gettin' up
Fuck the bullshit, I pull quick and unload
Leave a nigga ass - bumpy like a toad
and stay trippin', accused of crippin'
And ain't the Nine shit that stay flyin' by in six-hundred giant shit
Ooh wee, look at me, keep it rollin' and I remember
back when my draws were stolen, but valued to keep it ballin'
Fuck you and a nigga tryin' to speak
Realsome player shit ain't too played out to get deep - motherfucker!!</pre>
