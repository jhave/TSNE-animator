[Intro]
Started
{"Zombie on the track!"}

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin here

[Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin at my momma house, we'd argue every month
Nigga I was tryin to get it on my own
Workin all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back"
Nigga I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show

[Chorus: Drake]
And we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga

[Drake]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah I doubt it nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin off without us nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house

[Chorus: Drake]
Cause we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga

[Drake]
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin
Stories stay the same, I never changed it
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin
Stories stay the same through the money and the fame

[Chorus: Drake]
Cause we started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga</pre>
