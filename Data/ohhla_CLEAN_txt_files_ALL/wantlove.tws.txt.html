DJ Victoriouz, Twista
Now, everything that I want in a woman when I be lookin at her body and her mind that's you (that's you)
Me bein able to, give you what you want or what you need when I'm becomin a love, that's true (that's true)
Please pose because when you do that, I know I could never say that the romance is through (nope)
D. Rose when I be comin, the whistles send you to a victory of an orgasm too (ha ha)
Have her with me when I kick back, when she roll one I lit that
She a cold one the way she lick that, when I hit that she hit back
AOWWW! (Uh-huh) When I give it to her how she wanna get it'll be the way to make her crazy (crazy)
And every time that she see me on the TV screen she like "There go my baby" (baby)
Cause I be fuckin her, she like the way I'm freakin her
How I'm freakin her (freakin her)
I'm the one I know she wanna be with, make the call, what time you want me to pick you up? (you up)
Tell him you got somethin to do when I hit you up - because

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[DJ Victoriouz]
Girl I know you want it, girl I know you want it
Girl I know you need it, girl I know you need it
Girl I know you want it, girl I know you want it
Girl I know you need it, girl I know you need it

[Twista]
How I'm mackin you could tell that I want yours (yours) I can see that it's obvious that you want mine (mine)
This could be reality far from folklore (yeah) when I look at your body and you be so fine
Like a coke line, the way she after me gotta be somethin else I could tell she addicted
All on me like an methamphetamines but a better fiend, she was thick as hell so we kicked it
She became a follower, but she was a swallower
Got up with her cause I wanna see when she go bottoms up, the way she turn her bottle up
Ooh you a nasty girl - and you know that I'm the same way, and you like that shit, so don't give up
Cause we gon' fight, and we gon' fuck, you ain't goin nowhere because

[Chorus]
