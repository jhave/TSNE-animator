[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, Yah

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven't slept in days, and me and my latest girl
agreed to go our separate ways, so I'm single
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out
And all those girls that played me eat your mother fucking heart out, it's Drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I'm good
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same

[Chorus: Young Jeezy (Drake)]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I'm doing my thing
I'm doing my thing
I'm doing my thing
('Cause I'm trying be unforgettable)

[Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say for life, y'all say forever
It's hard, but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's Young, baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'mma need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah I'm in my used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides are looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She saying shit in them streets, so what's the deal yo
And I've done everything in the A, but fuck Chili
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Like for y'all to meet the love of my life, her name's the Game

[Chorus: Young Jeezy (Drake)]
I'm just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I'm the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I just really hope that (you'd think of me)
I'm doing my thing
I'm doing my thing
I'm doing my thing
(cause I'm trying be unforgettable)

[Young Jeezy, talking]
Got my top dropped on this beautiful night
It's beautiful night to live my beautiful life
Pain hurts like a cut from a beautiful knife
Just know she right here on my hip, my beautiful wife
Yeah, Drizzy we got 'em lil bro,
Unforgettable, you'll never forget this, ya understand me
Timeless homie, unforgettable
