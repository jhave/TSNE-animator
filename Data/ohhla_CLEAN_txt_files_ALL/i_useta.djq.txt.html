Well 1991 I was rockin my jheri curl, just a young gun
Lookin for the bitches that have alot of fun
just dropped a hit record now i'm under the sun
Winter time night fall cold as hell
Standin outside of the Golden Tail
Hella hoes mobbin in pushin gettin through
Tiger striped cat suit lookin' at me to
I asked her whats your title and she said it was V
Vanessa you impress a nigga cant you see
What you doin' later can I kick it with you?
She said it all depends on what you wanna do
Took me me to her buddy walked in the room
Buzzin off the kamikaze that I consumed
Talk, kiss, grind tryin to get get my balls off first
She said, "Nigga, can you take my drawers off first"
I was young I admit it
She told me I was horny and wild but still let me hit it
Hot bare back until I felt that quake
She told me shoot that milk shake, shoot that milk shake
God damn I don't wanna get sprung
Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy
Ran home to tell my nigga Top
About this cock that just would'nt stop yeah
I told him she was greeneyed light skinned and fly
He said he met a bitch like that last july
A car pulled up and it was her no doubt
I told him thats who i'm talkin bout
He said thats who i'm talkin bout damn

I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
Way back in 1991
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
Way back in 1991 owwww I useta know her

Now here's the plan in the home of the one night stand
Rolled up in a stretch, pussy to catch
Plus now I'm sittin the V.I.P
And hoes wanna suck on the D-I-C
O.K. heres the play give me OJ and tanqueray
Have you had you dick today is what I'm thinkin
But I've been drinkin
I see you peepin me out
And its freakin me out
Cause she fine than a motherfucker bout 5'8
135 and I just can't wait (for what)
To hit the backside, and get the top love
Bucknaked in the hot tub
Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you)
The flyest nigga in the rap biz
And there playin my song so a nigga gotta go and uh
Put a hoe in the limo
She was askin me question after question
Until she seen my life size erection
I bent her over prepared to do my duty
And seen my nigga Quik's name on her booty

I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
we useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
Way back in 1991
I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her

(Talk box) I useta know her
We all useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
Way back in 1991 owwww I useta know her

(We're runnin out of beedees) Now who gon do the honors
I hit the liquor next to Benihana's
But on my way I met bitch as sqaure as a box
With a big ass booty and some goldie locks
And I aint gotta do much talkin' she wet
Because she seen me moving a '97 Corvette
The good thing is I never seen her around
So I took her to my spot to get down
Now AMG what you think about the bitch

[AMG]
She dance in the jet strip
Shakin the cock, 20 dollars a pop
Her nickname Babygirl, useta have a jheri curl
Now she got braids, ex-nigga paid
She useta roll a lexo now she got a pathfinder
Wear a rubber if ya get behind her
Cause my nigga told me she had the heebie geebies
Give her drank and dank she'll give a nigga freebies

I useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
we useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know her
Way back in 1991
We useta know her

We all useta know her
(Talk box) I useta know
Way back in 1991 owwww we useta know her

(Long pause)
