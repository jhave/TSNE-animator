Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Big bad Bazooka Tooth, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em..ah, fuck it, yo!

I pull the elephant tranq out of my neck
Gaffle a tank, count up the chips, wrastle the fangs off of my fist
Flood a little soldier blood over the ogre acres 
on some holiday in Cambodia with motor home appraisers 
Pagans fade into the kodochrome now, later with a lid to brow staple revist
the cobra loading zone 
Molar foaming but he hold his own wound 
cauterized by the zippo he had stole that afternoon
And my dog tags jingle by the monster island heart he built
Grew up with a jughead crown tilt and tardy slip
Be all you can be just never soothed us (Nope!)
You lost me in that part about scrubbing piss with a toothbrush
Holler scum's lullaby
Live from the ultra-fly sham city bunker where the coldest cults multiply alarmingly 
Hush little baby, timeout!
The black market mockingbirds can not sing a lick but lean to peck your eyes out 
of commission with love, out a tradition of wraiths pick on the visions that buzz
bet on the kitten's escape, solder the piston to pump out a veteran amplifier
And magnify through the same lens that set the ants on fire
Flush the moppet hootenanny
Who could fancy honor circuit when the circle's every duke is clammy?
Trooper, scoop the food in pantry
Ante up, stupid!
May delusion feed 'em foofi candy and pry the gold out of his tooth when lamping 
Pocket all you can now
Block will lead the lambs down to the cold cutlery outfit
Slaughter beef and cow tip
Pour the chief some fountain soda,
motor prone to pen the holy opus and pry this monkey off the scoliosis like:

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Bazooka Tooth, gemini, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed

[Aesop Rock]
It's like never mind the bullocks 
Like every other week these hipster tabloids jumping on and off my sex pistol's bullets
Like every other week he spins the bottle
Like every other week these fucking fanzines forget if they spit or swallow 
Too bad your inner sheep never forgets to follow, 
cause my inner greed to feed your hate for loving us is hostile 
Fortunate for me it coincides with what comes natural, 
so the mongrels that I run with turn the 'fuck you's into fast food 
Like a little freak sick of the 3 o'clock bully knuckle dust, 
nursing his last shiner, finds the shoebox in his mother's truck (Uh-oh!)
Tomorrow's extra curricular punching bag
will finger daddy's widow maker out a brown lunch bag (Bang!)
This is where the hunch back snake oil peddlers 
stuck under the burgundy sky of spaghetti westerns tend to bubble up 
Weathermen huddle up
Today, the son of one too many 'yes sir's kings his checkers, watch the double jump 
Back with a platter of hot leeches that'll drink up-every bloody drop down
to the last diseases, it's A-E-S-O-P-R-O-C-K, the peak twister 
Defender of the son of Vaughn Bode's Cheech Wizard
I used to pray the treatments got easier with my aging
like serotonin weekends was merely comedic hazing 
Wrong, but along his travels located the key to world peace: kill every motherfucker but me 
You cool with that? Cool, bang, 
You? Cool, hang
You? No? Uh..bang? Cool
Sorry, dog, rules are rules 
And too long have I followed yours
I'm trying to get them years back, and walk through every cipher with dynamite in a beer hat

Who's that walking with a hole in his head?
Bazooka Tooth Krueger, I came to break bread
What's a troop's recipe for treacherous times?
I tell 'em fast cars, danger, fire and knives, let's go
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
Fast cars, danger, fire and knives
fast cars, danger, fire and knives
I got her majesty Athena riding shotty wide-eyed</pre>
