[Kap]
Funk Flex, Big Kap
Mary J, Def Jam, let's go

1  [Mary J. Blige]
    Confrontation, confrontation
    Confrontation, confrontation
    Confrontation, confrontation
    Confrontation, confrontation

[Mary J. Blige]
Are you mad because I turned it around?
But if I stayed the same
You would still be running your mouth, oh
You never doubt the Queen of Hip-Hop soul
I never let you down cause I'm on a roll
My new cd is in your store
So pick it up and feel my soul

Repeat 1

[Mary J. Blige]
Everybody wants to know where I've been
Cause living life the way I do seems to be a sin, oh
But that stuff follows me everywhere I go
Get out of hair cause shit is out of control
Don't come too close to cause you never know
What I would do if you disrespect me

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
