Song:   Some Things You Can't Take Back
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well she was lookin' out the window
And I was starin' at the door
The dog was sleepin' on the sofa
This place has never been this quiet before
You can't pretend it never happened
You can't pretend it's still the same
You can't say you were only jokin'
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way

[Chorus]
Some things you can't take back
Though you wish you could
Some things you can't take back
Though the glass has been broke
And the milk has been spilled
And your loves on the line
Some things you can't take back

When someone says there's no tomorrow
When the writings on the wall
After all have cried and spoken
And your poor heart has taken such a fall

[Repeat Chorus]

If I could reset the clock and go back in time
I'd erase the thoughts that went through my mind
You know I never would leave
And I'd still have you with me

You can't pretend it never happened
You can't pretend it's still the same
You can't say you were only jokin'
You can't keep thinkin' things can go on this way

[Repeat Chorus]

Some things you can't take back
'Cause in the cold light of day the pieces all blew away
And now I'm livin' a lie
Some things you can't take back</pre>
