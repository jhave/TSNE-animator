Song:   Peace of Mind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ooooo oooooo
Peace of mind, Peace of mind

[Chorus]
We want peace whoa
We want a peace of mind
It's times like this I wanna leave the world behind
We want peace whoa
We want a peace of mind
I wanna take a little piece of my herb and get this whole world high

[Richter]
Some body please explain
Cause all we want is to be treated the same
Just live in peace with peace of mind
Enjoy the earth, this life and my kind (my kind)
Right now it's time to celabrate
Relax, Kick back put your feet up forget to hate

[Chorus]

[Daddy X]
Is it me or has this world gone crazy
Last chance, Last dance force maybe
Bombs are droppin body's poppin like the last days
Now I finally understand how crime pays
Its the plan that's designed through corruption
Total domination, mass destruction
Or mass distraction you do the math
When 1+1 don't equal 3 no
It's like a sickness that they don't want the cure for
Apocalyptic and only been sured for
It's like we're doomed and were headed for our last days
I wanna peace of mind, everlastin

[Chorus x2]

[D-loc]
KottonMouth Kings need to open up your mind
With the kind come and get a dose of reality
Think about the good things in life
Because negativity only brings fatality, fatalities bring broken hearts, tears, flowers, caskets people
crying, love ones dying
I see my friends going down the wrong path so I realize
Keep on striven stay true to myself and try to find my peace of mind
Thank you baby

[Chorus x2]</pre>
