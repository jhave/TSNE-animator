[Intro]
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild
Look upon his little child
Pity my simplicity
Allow me to come to thee
Lord Jesus forgive me for my sins
Make sure that you take care of my family, my mom
God bless my dad
Look over me and my niggaz, Amen

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
A$AP murder clan, ride with the mob
Twinkle in the eye cuz you ridin with a star
Rebel all black and we dyin' for the cause
Keep your hands down when you talkin' to a boss
See Lou Banga ridin' in a Porsche
Bet that nigga teeth look better than yours
All gold slugs and I don't need to floss
Young Trap Lord, might die on a cross
Gold link chain swing down to my balls
Bout to rule the world, gettin' signs from the Lord
Lord say "Ferg, damn you my boy
Wanna be on top? Nigga, it's your choice"
I don't give a fuck, I'mma ride with my niggaz
Right on the block, gettin' high with my niggaz
High to the sky, puff lye with my niggaz
Drunk drive with my niggaz, I'mma die for my niggaz, uh

[Chorus]
I'mma ride for my niggaz
Tote crime for my niggaz
Pull a 9 for my niggaz
Drunk drive with my niggaz
Get high with my niggaz, uh
Provide for my niggaz
Get high with my niggaz
Puff lye with my niggaz
To the sky with my niggaz
I'mma die for my niggaz [x2]

[Verse 2]
Get in your skin, like a dermatologist
Bunch of dirty niggaz who ain't never been to colleges
Fuck your hypothesis, I be on that rider shit
Bang him over the head, I bet that shit'll silence him
Margiela stallion, bitches be Italian
God pray for me, I know my daddy smiling and
I'm gon make you proud, save me a cloud and when
I make it to heaven you'll be by my side again
Bless all my violent friends, they don't know right
All they know struggle pain all of their life
Washing down pain with that purple and Sprite
Murder death kill nigga fuck your side
Uh, cause D Ferg got the fuckin' toast
Uh, cause A$AP fuckin' do the most
Uh, with the 9 in my 40 Belows
Ridin' to the club with a snub nose

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Our Father who art is in heaven, hallowed be thy name, A$AP
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory</pre>
