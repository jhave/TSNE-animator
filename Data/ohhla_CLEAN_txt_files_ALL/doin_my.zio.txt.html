[Zumbi, Verse 1]
Now in a world full of pain, hard strugglin' stressed
The Buddha say your soul sufferin', I'm still here blessed
Just to breath, please believe I'm way out west
Oakland to be exact, where the pimps still rest
And the mean mugs and thugs that test your chest 
It'd be so easy for me to be a pess-I-mist 
But I'm still here rhyming', still chart climbing
Addicted to the game like I'm on cane vibin'
It's really all organic, so mamma don't panic
Your son ain't a crack fiend, even though I back lean
Hard on a verse til my shit sound clean
The mega lord mix board, sword with a sheen
Unseen in the night, while you sleep without light
I slave to the beat, twist it til it feel tight
Then take it to the sound proof booth with a mic
The only thing in life that always made me feel right
 
[Hook]
Some my people got high, sold they soul for spit
Some drink water fire, work to that brink
Some make hard love til it starts to sting
I stay rymin', doin' my thing
Some shorties get smart, givin' brain to kids
Some homies get live with their one night fling
Some even go to church, prayin' on they sin
I stay rymin', doin' my thing
 
[Verse 2]
In school I did cool, always got them grades
But I acted real bad so the teachers say:
What ya gonna do boy, you gotta go get paid
Man I be rymin', doin' my thing
And when I wrote they would joke that I wouldn't be shit
Caus we was rocking high fashion, all counterfeit
Tryin' to learn a new dance step, and feel legit
Get a girl with a booty, and real big tits
We was crazy home boy, my mind was warped
By a 40oz bottle, speakin' tales Too Short
What's my taste is yours, didn't know what for
Just wanna be a rapper, wanna go on tour
Hit hoochies in a hojo, life moves slowmo
Fast forward today, on planes doin' promo
Now ya see who I am
MC to the heart, I'ma funk the jam
 
[Hook]
 
[Verse 3]
I coulda been a doctor, or psychologist 
But it wouldn't make me happy, I chose to bust
Roll with gamblers and hustlers
Cats who grind all the time, drink and cuss
But there's something beautiful, it's right beneath my touch
It's hard to understand a certain kind of rush
That I get from my lifestyle, struggling trife style
Long way to go, happily I walk a long mile
I'll... be... coming to town
God gave me many blessings, I'ma spread 'em around
When you see us in the club I'ma break shit down
And I'll be rymin', doin' my thing
It's my thing</pre>
