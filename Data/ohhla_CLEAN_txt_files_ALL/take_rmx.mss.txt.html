[Intro: Missy &amp; Tweet]
Oooooooooooh, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Missy (Tweet)]
You're so incredible
Ever since the day we became, we became.. so personal
Everyday that I spend with you it gets.. unforgettable
Anything that I did with you, I don't.. regret at all
(I love everything about you, yeah)

[Chorus: Missy (Tweet)]
Take away, your gold and platinum chains
(Your love for me is platinum, baby)
Cause I'm gon' love, love you anyway
(Oh, love you... anyaway)
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
(It's not your dough, cuz I)
Cause if you go broke, I gotta make it last

[Missy &amp; Tweet]
Goin' nowhere, nowhere, nowhere..

[Verse 2: Ginuwine]
Let's make, it national
I want the whole world to know
I'm with you, and I'm.. in love
Ain't no girl in this world
can fill your shoes, none not at all
The things you do for me is so.. unbelievable
And you can take away all the platinum chains

[Chorus: Missy (Ginuwine)]
Take away, your gold and platinum chains
Cause I'm gon love, love you anyway
(I'ma love you anyway, yes I am)
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
(I'm only in it for the love of you)
Cause if you go broke I gotta make it last
(I gotta make it last baby)

[Bridge: Missy &amp; Ginuwine (Tweet)]
I just wanna be the perfect match (I just...)
You don't even have to ask.. (You don't... have to ask)
I just wanna be the perfect match (I just...)
We become so attached.. (We become... sooooooooooooooooo)
I just wanna be the perfect match
You don't even have to ask.. (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I just wanna be the perfect match
We become so attached..
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeahhhhhhhhhh)

[computer voice]
Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me..
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime
Now can you hold me, now can you feel me
Now can you get near me..
For once in your lifetime, for once in your lifetime

[Chorus: Missy]
Take away, your gold and platinum chains
Cause I'm gon' love, love you anyway
I'm not in it for, for the love of cash
Cause if you go broke, I gotta make it last</pre>
