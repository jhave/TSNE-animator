[Verse 1]
I walk down these city streets
Just a lonely man inspired
Hoping God will send me water down
To quench this burning fire
How I feel for the mountain
A monastery man
Things will stay the same so I'll remain
And show just who I am
Seeing things around me
Bonnie and Clyde
Graffiti with no message
Doctors, medicines, or pride
But it doesn't really matter
They're blowin' in the wind
On the cover of a magazine

[Hook: 2X]
Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling

[Verse 2]
I try to wash my dirty hands
But they won't come off the water
Hopin' truth will make me clean and then
Redeem my sons and daughters
Though they're not yet on the very highway
Pass along below
That's why I left my memories far behind the lazy road
Seems so simple
Future's the past
The present all the things we holdin' on to make them last
But it doesn't really maeeaahhh (matter)
Blow eeeahh (blowin in the wind)
Couuhaaahhh (with they're head high)

[Hook: 2X]
Hallelujah
Babylon is falling
Babylon is falling

[Musical Interlude]

Ahhhhh..

[4X]
Hallelujah</pre>
