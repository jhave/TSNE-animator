[Intro]
Yeah! Ow! Turn me up some more Just
turn me, turn the music up some more
Gillahouse! We 'gon get it in nigga

[Verse One]
Yo! Crack the Remy Martin, for niggas pumpin weed by the mini market
Bring it when you see me park it
I think Big like Diddy office
I fuck a hoe with a baseball cap on like Mr. Marcus
Yeah! My Family Feud like Richard Dawson
The survey said I'm hidin right in your apartment
It's Brick City, right beside New York
Yeah the streets is watchin even mimes wanna talk
I run up on the DJ, smack 'em on camera
Makin sure I get my wax on like Daniel son
Feel my Genuine Draft not Miller
I could walk up in the church and start a mosh pit up
Yeah! I Bring The Pain, eleventh member of the Wu-Tang
My flow tigerstyle crane
I'm back nigga, ridin that gravy train
The rap criminal my Artifacts hard to Tame
Bitch wanna complain, no use to barkin
'Cause we can go neck for neck like Pam and Martin
Get smoked like a carton, of Newport's nigga
On my New Jersey shit, and New York nigga
Yeah!!!

[Interlude]
Gillahouse! Gillahouse in the motherfuckin buildin y'all
Been a long time since east coast had this motherfuckin reign!!!
Gillahouse!!! Gi-Gi-Gi-Gi-Gi-Gi-Gi-Gillahouse!!

[Verse Two]
Yo! Yo! Check the nigga flow
I knock out the Mike like Buster Douglas bitch leave a nigga broke
And Jigga know when I clutch the pen
It's fuck them hens I put them paragraphs in a bigger foe
Fuck tryin to take a pack of protein
'Cause when I brawl I'm a stay strapped like Bokeem
Blow smoke rings in the meetin
If I ain't gettin half of what I sell you ain't eatin neither
A leader won't take no shorts I know better
It's D-O-C M-P-V for Vendetta
I'm always on point never skip or slip
My bitch stay tryin to kill me like Mrs. Smith  
If I carry two cannons, no time to kill out
I bust out the side of my jeans like Bruce Banner
My dogs do it on camera, and to them
I'm big brother almighty like Gamma Phi Gamma
I roll like a rider should
And when the chick blow Doc she be famous like Monica
Hardcore in the blood get the best in line
Put the iron to your watch 'cause I'm pressed for time
NIGGA!!!
