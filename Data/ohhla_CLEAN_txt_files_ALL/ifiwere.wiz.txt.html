Song:   If I Were a Lame
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I were a lame
Only just for a week
I'd look myself in the mirror
And shoot the first thing I seen
No honestly I'd try to find someone else
And I'd make it seem like it's his fault
That I'm broke and can't get on
And he's doin shit I can't do for myself

[Chorus]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate anotha man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
When I'm smilin while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

If I were a lame
I'd talk shit to the hoes
Like you shouldn't fuck with that nigga
He ain't rich
I heard he really broke
I would get on a song
And talk as bad as I can
Bout how I wish I'd catch him slippin'
How his mixtapes don't be shit
And how I'm gone end his career
But I'm his numbah one fan

[Chorus]
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate anotha man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
When I'm smilin while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame

It's killin me how niggas act anytime I come around
No matter how much I do for myself
They wanna bring me down
But I juss gotta do me at the end of the day

Cause I'm not a lame
So I can't understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
No it ain't my fault
My shit flies off the shelf
So stop tryna be somebody
And worry about juss bein yourself
If you could juss be yourself
And don't be a lame
(Lame ass negro)
No don't be a lame
(Lame ass negro) </pre>
