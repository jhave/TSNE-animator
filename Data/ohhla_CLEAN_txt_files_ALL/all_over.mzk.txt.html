Yeah... I've never seen nothing like this before in my life..
I mean... A nigga selling out over a hoe..
But you know... your hoe could be the next hoe..
With my hoe..

Once upon a time, you know I had a mack daddy
Just me and him in the eight-trey Caddy
The hookers would stare and the niggaz would grin
Just let the wheels spin, let the wheels spin
You know we had to get the proper roll on
But pop went the tire, and we had to get the stroll on
Came up on some wenches that I knew
From when back when, in 1982
They tried to push up on my honey
All smiling in his face, but that shit wasn't funny
They thought they would try to take my man, unh
Shake my man, uh-huh break my man
Yeah, break like a brick but I'd rather be broke
They flaunt their figure in front of my nigga
And they play me for a joke
Nope, 'cause this time it's not happening
I'll snatch them bamboos off and start scrapping
See, I don't start trouble
But I gots to bust the bubble of a bitch
Who want to play me like a two-dollar trick
Rip the shit up, grab his keys and cut
Get stepped to by a bitch with a chip on her shoulder
But I told her, that I would have to scold her
And I would have to fold her
Like a love letter from the second grade
Look over at my nigga and he's grinning
Confused in my head and my mind is spinning, but it's..

[Chorus]
All over a ho
Because stupid niggaz are always on the go
I remain ???? ???? ???? ????
But I'd rather stack dollars, let my mind feel free
'Cause too many niggaz, too many niggaz
Wanna keep a bitch down, unh, oh wait a minute
Too many niggaz, too many niggaz
Wanna keep a bitch down, a-hold up, a-hold up

So now you see me coming back, watch me flaunt the fly shit
I gotta get it straight when the shit gets scandalous
'Cause I don't run around town fuckin' around, second-guessing
But something inside told me to trust my bitch's intuition
Now should I listen (?), shh, quiet step
Don't want nobody knowing where I stepped
Saying to myself "How the fuck can I deal with him?"
I'll the bitch named Sally that I scrapped with, then I'll squash it
And give her a G to see what the bitch can find out for me
"So you want a little action?" (Sally: "Well, alright...")
'Cause I'll be damned if I get played like LaToya Jackson
And if I'm played, I take it like a woman:
Imma kick to the curb and hit 'em shorter than Gary Coleman
So the bitch was down for the shit
'Cause bitches can set up a nigga faster than a Mafia hit clique
Or should I get him smoked... nope
Here's what happened to the nigga that played me close:
Told the ho to meet him at the Let'Em
And make sure, Sally, that you fuck him and fuck him
Here's a mini-microphone to put in your purse
And I'm sure that your stank ass don't have to rehearse
It's like sure enough, my nigga rolled up G
It was dark as a motherfucker, but I could still see
So she finished the job without lagging
Got the nigga on tape like Jimmy Swaggart
And it's... (just as we had planned)

[Chorus]

Now I really know that nigga's promises ain't true
'Cause he said many times "I'd die without you..."
Unh, I shoulda seen through ya
I guess the only thing you was good for was the punani-eater
Now I bet you've got more water upstairs
Than you've got sugar on the candy cane
You think you're going out to fuck another bitch
Come home, and fuck me?  Boy, you must be insane
Well, the next day the nigga came over
He pulled up in one of our rides, a Range Rover
He walked in the house thinking everything is right
I said to the nigga "Have fun last night?"
He said "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wh-wh-what do you mean?"
I said "Go take a shower, 'cause your dick ain't clean
Or was Sally less filling?  Or did she taste great?
You can't say shit, I got it all on tape
Yeah motherfucker, here's your last kiss
'Cause I ain't putting up with that bullshit"

[Chorus]

Too many niggaz, too many niggaz wanna keep a bitch down, but not me
too many niggaz wanna keep a bitch down, so I gotta clown</pre>
