(*H.A.W.K. talking*)
Big balling Texas, you are now about to witness
The sounds, of the Fat Rat with the Cheese
Lil' O, Screwed Up Click

[Hook]
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I rock them jewels
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too

[Lil' O]
Ay yo, I just came to party
And I don't really wanna, kill nobody
Pulled out the thang, lick shots from the forty
And have your mama talking bout, Lordy Lordy
But boys, like to jump into some gangsta games
And never learn, till a playa shank they frame
All you hear is broads is yelling, then I smash and bang
When I pick up the pool stick, and spank his brain
I'm a gangsta gangsta, a hustler hustler
The Braeswood block boy, ain't no busta
And if he don't shoot you, then he bound to cut you
If he chunk up the West, then his boys gon rush up
So the best thing to do, daddy leave it alone
When I'm leaving my home, I'm always leaving with chrome
What makes you think you won't, catch three in your dome
And I ain't even tripping dog, you seen the wrong

[Hook]
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I rock them jewels
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too
Don't plex, cause I got the tool
(man you talking to me), yeah I'm talking to you
Well see you hating on a playa, cause I fucked your boo
But if it's fuck me nigga, then it's fuck you too

[Lil' O]
Hey don't plex, dog it ain't even worth it
I'll have you in a coffin, looking picture perfect
Chest look a mess, body blue like smurfy
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Nigga what you smoking, what you drinking
You gon run up on who, nigga what you thinking
Hey look me in my eyes, nigga I'm not blinking
These Southside playas, will leave you stinking
But look here daddy, I don't want no trouble
Cause if it go down playa, guns gon rumble
And boys gon drop like fumbles, so if you see
A sucka fall to his knees, man that cat ain't stumble
So what you need to do, is just stay in your place
Before I grab the Cristal bottle, Cris in your face
Have your mouthpiece missing a space, for talking out
The side of your neck, that hating gon get you erased

[Hook]

[Lil' O]
Hey don't plex, lil daddy what's the deal
What's all the plex for, relax and chill
Stop acting like a broad, you need mass and gill
This is Big Balling Texas, start acting trill
We don't fight over hoes, we don't do it like that
This the best way for you, to catch two in your back
Don't be mad when you see me, come through in a Lac
Cause if I'm sitting on 4's, I got two of my gats
And you one of them cats, that's making me feel uncomfortable
Don't make me snatch your life, right from under you
Cause if you hear (*gun shot*), that ain't thunder fool
It's too late, now you six feet under dude
My cars wonderful, my jewelry's shitty
And I ride on chrome, when I cruise the city
And that's where you be a fool, to get me
Cause I got something sitting on my lap, that'll chew your kidney

[Hook]

(*H.A.W.K. talking*)
You see, pretty much what my dog trying to say is
If you out here fighting over these females, you plexing
If you mad at a playa, cause he out here getting his cash, you plexing
And we don't do it like that down here, in these H-Town streets
This is Big H.A.W.K., S.U.C. five star general
Putting it down with my dog Lil' O, letting y'all know how it go
Cause real recognize real, you feel me</pre>
