Uhh, ahh, uhh
{*heavy breathing*}
Uhh, ahh, uhh, yeah
{*heavy breathing*}

[Chorus]
Cuz if you ain't ready (ready)
You better, get ready (get ready)
Cuz if you ain't ready (ready)
You better, get ready (get ready)
Cuz if you ain't ready (ready)
You better...

[M1]
Uhh...
Wake up - time to move
Put on ya shirt, put on ya shoes
Go all out, ain't nuttin to lose
Pick all the chains, break the rules
Let's ride soldier, build ya skills
Tell me how we gon' get free for real
No game, this war we got to win
Get in where ya fit in, come on then, nigga

[Stic.]
Learned a lot, seen a lot, grew a lot, cut my locks
Strong as ever, new and improved
In my heart I know we can't lose
But we got to hustle, ride the wind
Dead'll struggle, Dead'll win
Knew the strategy, know the enemy
Focus energy, one community
North, east, west, south
With or without the gold in ya mouth
We bout to roll out like gangsta white wall
For the love of the people, we fight for the cause
Now walk wit us, lace yo' chucks
Lemme see them black fists, raise 'em up (c'mon)
Get ready cuz Bush tryna push,
these anti-terrorist laws that's meant for us

[Chorus]

[Tahir]
Ay, this for the strugglers, nine-to-fivers
All the hustlers, call the grinders
On a mission, every person
Organizin, puttin work in
Get ya paper, it's on and poppin
Time to ride out for somethin proper
Drop them coppers, we don't need 'em
Trained to beat 'em, bang for freedom

[??]
City blocks, country roads
Every ghetto, get ready to roll
Keep on livin, keep on learnin
Till we free it's self-determined
Tell ya folk, holla dawg
So we can get this power dawg
Stick together, sew ya up
RBG throw it up!

[??]
Been here, still here, in here, this real here
No fear, we ain't scared
Better beware, we pre-prepared
Comin with the same team this year
Stic. here, Ta-hir
Fist in the air, this our year
Holla if ya heard me!

[Chorus 2]
Nigga this that RBG's
We keep it off the heez'
Still hollarin "Let's Get Free"
Buck wit me, who ready?
Nigga this that RBG's
We keep it off the heez'
Still hollarin "Let's Get Free"
Buck wit me, who ready? c'mon c'mon!

[Chorus]

*beat falls out and returns*
