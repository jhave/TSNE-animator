Fuck you
This is for them hoes that hate
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
This is for them snakes that smile in your face
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
Go head tell em why you mad
Cause you broke and you sad
And ain't no body tryna fuck you
So I just wanna say.... F-U-C-K you

Does my sexiness offend you
You hoes ain't friends but they try to pretend to
Snakes in the grass tryna strike against you
Tell em why you mad cuz Im fly like jet blue
They even try to go thru what i been thru
But they need to catch up cuz they in my rearview
I kick a bitch ass in my Jimmy Choo shoe
But you ain't even worth sweatin out my hairdo
I tell em screw you bitch go to hell
You sayin my name tryna get your shit to sell
And even tho your girl been away got low like Chappell
I'm back in the club got everybody yellin

Fuck you
This is for them hoes that hate
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
This is for them snakes that smile in your face
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
Go head tell em why you mad
Cause you broke and you sad
And ain't no body tryna fuck you
So I just wanna say.... F-U-C-K you

Go head tell em why you mad
What you spend on your rent I spend on my Louis Bag
Im high class shoppin on Fifth Ave
You keep the tag in your clothes so you can take it back
Mad cuz you're broke and you're lookin for a fix
What you want my autograph and you wanna take a pic
Tell em why you mad cuz you lookin real pissed
Jealousy is a diesease and you lookin real sick
Need to see a Doc Your girl on top
Lotta bitches want my spot but I got it on lock
Headed to the bank Imma get it non stop
When they play it in the spot let everybody holla

Fuck you
This is for them hoes that hate
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
This is for them snakes that smile in your face
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
Go head tell em why you mad
Cause you broke and you sad
And ain't no body tryna fuck you
So I just wanna say.... F-U-C-K you

Kim real Im just sayin what I feel
You hoe's faker then a three dolla bill
Now the Queens back you already know the deal
Only time you gettin burn is when you on the tredmill
Ewwww it's like they always on they period
Tell em why you mad go on tell how you furious
You chicks crack me up don't nobody take ya serious
I laughed at em like Eddie Murphy Delirious
Listen here don't hate me hate the person in the mirror
So please keep that fake ass shit from over here
And everybody put your middle fingers in the air
And we gon tell them haters

Fuck you
This is for them hoes that hate
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
This is for them snakes that smile in your face
Pardon my french but I just wanna say
Fuck you
Go head tell em why you mad
Cause you broke and you sad
And ain't no body tryna fuck you
So I just wanna say.... F-U-C-K you

FUCK YOU!</pre>
