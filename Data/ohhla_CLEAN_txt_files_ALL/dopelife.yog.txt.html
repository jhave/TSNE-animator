[VERSE 2]
Big motor, big rims, loud pipes
(Yup)
Lil' nigga, fresh to death, big ice

It's a drought so I whip it, I ain't sellin' regular
(For Real..)
Cause I can take a quarter thing
Whip it right
Get a extra half a quarter
And drop the price
That's that dope boy shit if you ain't never heard
How to get a half a chicken off of every bird
Nigga that's my word
(Nigga That's My Word)

Go tell on your people
(What?!)
Nigga you's a bitch

But I was in the North, straight up sellin' dope up out it
(Yup)

(Yea)
My plug on the way and imma be gone

[CHORUS 3 (OUTRO)]

Bitch told, me, alright
All she listens to is Yo Gotti and Gangsta Grillz
She said that's all the dope boys rock to
She asked me if I could introduce her to Yo Gotti
And could she get Gangsta Grillz
(HaHaHa)
I said which one you wanna do first
We can make that happen</pre>
