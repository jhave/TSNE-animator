 [Aaliyah]
What would you do to get to me
What would you say to have your way
Would you give up or try again
If I hesitate to let you in
Now would you be yourself or play a role
Tell all the boys I keep your love
If I say no would you turn away
Or play me off or would you stay, ohh, oh

 [Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed, first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cos if at first you don't succeed, first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again

 [Aaliyah]
I'm into you you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not till I see what this could be
Could be eternity or just a week, oh
Ay, yo our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now but will it change
This ain't a yes this ain't a no
Just do your thing we'll see how we go, ohh, oh

 [Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed (yeah)
Dust yourself off and try again (again)
You can dust it off and try again, try again (yeah)
Cos if at first you don't succeed (ooh)
You can dust it off and try again (try again)
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (yeah)

 [Aaliyah]
Said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date
What about the next date
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be buggin on the first date
What about the next date
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

 [Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cos if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

 [Sin]
If I burn anything I'm burnin the track
The remix and y'all gon' be spinnin it back
Like one two, me and Tim spittin it up
Like twist ? Philly livin it up
Crash the bar in the Jaguar
With no crash a one-ninety flash car
Livin the life so I spit on the dice

 [Sebastian]
Like send us a bash and ain't treatin em right
Like keep a stash that's the number one law
And here's the coach back I wanna be up in your bra
Gave your friends competence sprayin the John Paul
Hennesseys and when I leave I don't go to the mall
I take you to a place with fur coats and stores
Put your hands in some gloves, put that Christian Dior
With the snow caps, Gucci frames, push back
In the Cadillac, black that, now watch your back

 [Aaliyah]
Ohh, yeah, yeah
Baby, hey, yeah
Again, again
Ohh

 [Aaliyah]
And if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
Dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cos if at first you don't succeed (first you don't succeed)
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (again, again)

 [Timbaland]
It's been a long time
We shouldn't a left you, left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step, step to, step to, fricky fricky

 [Timbaland]
It's been a long time
We shouldn't a left you, left you
Without a dope beat to step to
Step to, step to, step to, step, step to, step to, fricky fricky</pre>
