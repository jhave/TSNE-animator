No, no, no, no, no
We ain't said no names, y'all
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start namin' names?
We ain't said no names

[Krayzie]
I can remember back in the day
if you bit another nigga
you was considered a biter
Non-originality, simply disrespectin' a true rider
Nigga, I'm fired up
Nigga, keep on bitin' the Bone
and your jaw'll get wired up
Keep on lovin' my song
but my nigga, you ain't Bone
Can you understand what's wrong?
Better get on
Sayin' you been flowin' since back in the day
Some of you was
Well okay, but whatever it was you were stressin'
It wasn't effecting nobody like this way
Hit me, so niggas can miss me with they drama
Tell them all like Willie-D told niggas
"Bitch, play with your mama. 'Cause I'm not your toy."
So nigga don't test me, cause Krayzie ain't no sample
But really, could you handle
Big old slugs from these here magnum?
Ever since we came with Thuggish Ruggish Bone
Niggas been comin' up out the woods singin'
We stole they flow and song
If that's the case then why when we kick
Wicked shit, muthafuckas all like it?
And then why when you come tryin' to kick my shit
I can tell you strugglin' tryin'?
And back in the day how many niggas
Was really claimin' to be thugs?
Niggas was gangstas
So what the fuck done changed 'em? Huh?
What really be fuckin' my head up
Is when one nigga do somethin', come up
Make a Little bit of money, somebody all on your nuts
I'm keepin' it real, and bitch
If you Feel I'm talkin' bout you
Then it must be the guilt
I think we should give them the murder treatment
Yeah, that should learn 'em, baby

[Krayzie]
Oh, oh, we gonna kill them with the big shotgun
Yeah, fuck y'all niggas who's talkin', nigga
Niggas talkin' shit over here, nigga
Fuck y'all niggas wantin' to do it

Aw shit, these niggas done started over here
They talkin' shit, say we ain't rappin' (What?)
Niggas has got the nerve, and look who platinum
Niggas been runnin' off at the mouth
Before they think and look at the reality
I'm a speak on it, so bitch, be mad at me
Now first of all, y'all can't even talk
Y'all need to go get your speech right
And then while you at it
You need quit samplin' that bullshit
And get your beats tight
Let's meet up at midnight in the alley
Where nobody knowin' what's happenin'
What's happenin?
You wanna pull out some guns or do some rappin'?
A nigga don't want no problems
But then if he wants to cause it - a nine millimeter
Dawed-off, a .380, TEC-9, comin' out my closet
Probably only have to pull a muthafuckin' twenty-two
Probably just say "Boo!"
And watch you niggas scuffle, scatter everywhere
Them niggas up outta there
That studio shit been known
To give niggas like you wig-splits
I hear you talkin', woofin' nigga
But I really can't feel shit
Now face it, nigga, rap just ain't the same
Especially since my Mo Thug family encountered the game
The fame is pain, for this I'll pay the price
And niggas tryin' to take my life
Always feelin' violent vibes
Just because I'm shinin' now
In the hood, it was sarcastic shit like
"You paid now, been awhile since you came around."
So you tellin' me that I ain't down?
But first of all, when I was broke as fuck
You niggas did not give a fuck
Now all of the sudden
Ya lovin' me when we drunk, playa hata
We know who you are, can find out where you live
Better protect your kids
Fuck it, let's blow up his crib
10-o'clock news: "Nobody lived."

[Tombstone]
You better roll
Cause we give no love where we got to buck
Break you off somethin' proper with hate
I 'll break you off somethin' proper with love
It's all how you take it
We been never takin' no strippin'
For the body dippin'
Grips in the wasteland all from mad-testin'
Even though they know about death - a cold place to rest in

[Cat Cody]
We know just who you are
And exactly why you came
Now wouldn't it be real fucked up
If we start naming names?
We ain't said no names</pre>
