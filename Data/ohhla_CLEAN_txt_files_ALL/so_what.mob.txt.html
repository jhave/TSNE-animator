[Jazze Pha]
Ladies and GENTLEMEN!
Jazze Pha, Field Mob, Ciara, Superstar DJ's 
Here we go

[Chorus - Ciara]
They say - "He do a little this, he do a little that 
He always in trouble," and I heard
"He's nuttin but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks 
He's always in the club," and they say
"He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips 
He's sellin them drugs," and I heard
"He's been locked up, find somebody else 
He ain't nuttin' but a thug"
So whaaaaaaaaat, so whaaaaaat 
So whaaaaaat, so whaaaaat

[Smoke]
And they say - I'm a slut, I'm a ho, I'm a freak
I got a different girl everyday of the week
You too smart you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm THIS, they say that I'm THAT
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact!
But you don't be hearin it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin, and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin pla-ces
with you by my side in my Mercedes

[Chorus]

[Shawn Jay]
Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, life of a legend
Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, that don't mean nuthin
Her like missin is a type of affection you get 
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Yield to the blindness, apply your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin for real
I'm a positive talkin negative pimp
They hate to see you doin better than them, so!

[Chorus]

(Ladies and Gentlemen, Ciara)

[Ciara]
Some people don't like, it
'Cause you hang out in the street
But you my boy-friend
You've always been here for me
This love is serious
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for ya
and I don't care what they say
Some people don't like, it
'Cause you hang out in the street
But you my boy-friend
You've always been here for me
I love the thug in ya
No matter what people think
I'm gon' be here for ya
and I don't care what they say
