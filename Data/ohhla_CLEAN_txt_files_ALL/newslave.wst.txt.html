[Kanye West]
My momma was raised in the era when
clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin clothes, you woulda thought I help 
but they wasn't satisfied Unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga rac'sm
That's that "Don't touch anything in the sto'"
And it's rich nigga rac'sm
That's that, "Come in, please buy mo'
 What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
 ALL you blacks want ALL the same thang!"
Used to only be "NIGGAS!", now err'body playin
Spendin err'thing on Alexander Wang
New slaves...

You see it's leaders, and it's followers
But I rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders, and it's followers
But I rather be a dick than a swallower

I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeves
I know if we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you AND yo' corporation, y'all niggaz cain't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm goin Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggaz pussy ain't me
Y'all throwin contracts at me, you know that niggaz cain't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys, fuck your "ces't la vie"
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggaz cain't fuck with me
Y'all niggaz cain't fuck with 'YE!! Y'all niggaz cain't fuck with 'YE!
I'll move my family out the country so you cain't see where I stay 
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash they recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit, like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA, teamed up with the CCA
They try and lock niggaz up, they try and make new state
See that's that privately-owned prisons, get yo' piece today
They prob'ly all in the Hamptons, braggin 'bout they made
Fuck you AND yo' Hampton house, I'll fuck yo' Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse, and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?

{Autotuned}
I won't end this time, not this time again, so long 
So long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dying and, I CAIN'T lose, I CAIN'T lose
No I cain't lose you, I cain't leave it to yoooooooooou
'Tll it gets too high, gets too high again

[Frank Ocean] 
Too high again, too high
Oooooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-ooooh
WOOOOOOOOOOO-ooh...
Oooh-ooh-ahh-ha-ha-haaaaa..
Ah-haaaa-haaaaa-ha-hhaaa
Ha-haaaaa-aaaah, ha-haaaaaa
Haaaaaaa-AHHH-ahhh...
Mmm... AHHHH-ahh...
