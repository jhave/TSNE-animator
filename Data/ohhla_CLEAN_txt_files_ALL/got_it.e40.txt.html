[E-40]
You know they say they got it
But I got it man, hey, hey!
Uhh, hey, hey!

Independent scrill, mansion on top of the hill ("Got it!")
24 inch wheels, luxury automobiles ("Got it!")
Solid and polished, respect and recognition ("Got it!")
Thumpers all over the house all in the kitchen ("Got it!")
Getback skills, my nigga I'm a gritter ("Got it!")
Turn a scottish nickel to five or six figures ("Got it!")
Style, finesse and swagger - scavenger ("Got it!")
Connections, plugs, killers, manpower ("Got it!")
The gift of gab, the sales pitch of a real estate broker ("Got it!")
Cutlass Oldsmobile, 442 motor ("Got it!")
Mannish with it, I carry it like a boss
Knock that ass down, stand over you when I let off
Never out of touch, I'm always in the loop ("Got it!")
Side hustles, under the table loot ("Got it!")
Mailbox money, my nigga I'm the nigga ("Got it!")
Fixture, I got my own liquor ("Got it!")
Watches and rings, donkey ropes and bracelets ("Got it!")
I'm havin my change, paper, big faces ("Got it!")
Wisdom, neighborhood block experience ("Got it!")
I got game from dopefiends and pimps ("Got it!")
Loved ones that'll mash yo' head in ("Got it!")
Factors, that'll call shots from the ten ("Got it!")
Bitches, batches, broads ("Got it!")
They love this fatass Sick Wid It hog ("Got it!")
Benedict Arnolds, Judases and traitors ("Got it!")
Willy FooFoos, riffraffs and haters ("Got it!")
Mannish with it, I carry it like a boss
Knock that ass down, stand over you when I let off
The latest slang, the lingo and all the slick talk ("Got it!")
The sickest flows, the illest style, unorthodox ("Got it!")
The rapper your favorite rapper duplicate and mock ("Got it!")
The most recognizable voice in all of hip-hop ("Got it!")
Platinum and gold records all in the hallway ("Got it!")
Trophies, certified, by the RIAA ("Got it!")
Street credibility, history and longevity ("Got it!")
Father and son chemistry, me and Droop-E ("Got it!")
House to house, soil to soil, worldwide ("Got it!")
The whole family on my momma and my daddy's side ("Got it!")
The gift of spit, the gift to twist a pot ("Got it!")
If I ever had to go back to grit and cookin rock ("Got it!")
Baking soda, kilo grams of candycane ("Got it!")
'Cross the street, broken down Mustang ("Got it!")
Mannish with it, I carry it like a boss
Knock that ass down, stand over you when I let off
