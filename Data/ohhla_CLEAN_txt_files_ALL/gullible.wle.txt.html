[Wale]
Would you believe that?
If you read that? Ohh
TV killed the radio
TV killed the radio, haha
Let's get it...

What if they told you this music was bogus?
The government run it, they controllin' the culture
Would you believe that? Hah
If you read that? Haha, yeah
What if they told you the iPhone was tapped?
They see all of your browsin' and know you via your apps
And Twitter and Instagram is really like middle men
And internet soldiers, everybody was carryin' Macs
What if they said Obama wasn't a red?
He actually got a good ass tan 
and the swag to appear black, haha
Would you believe that? Niggas impeach that, look
How bout they tell you you dyin' if you ain't votin'?
So now your go put one and reline on that emotion 
and believe that, haha
You know you do with your weak ass, hah, hah
What if they make a list? Tellin' you what is dope
Tellin' you what's hip but never let they mother jump
Part in the flow with consistence control they many souls
Althought it's niggas, it's loaded by television shows
Opinions show but most to us they null and void
A little gossip make little people feel more important
Some don't believe somehow they need it for the allure
A lot of bull is a pot of gold to the gullible

[Chorus: Cee-Lo Green] + {Wale}
I turn down the radio just to turn the TV on.. (on.. on..)
I live my whole life in stereo, always singing my old song.. (song.. song..)
As it flooooows, intooooo, my veins {wake up, wake up wake up}
As it flooooows, intooooo, my veins {wake up, wake up wake up}

[Wale]
TV killed the radio
TV killed the radio
TV killed the radio
And then the internet slit the television throat
And the world star model fell up out the orbit
And for that broad, a rapper now is behind his mortgage
And other rappers would visit shawty, shawty keep goin'
And everybody be laughin' at him, he doesn't know it
Cause he believed her
Thought he couldn't be G'd by such a sweet girl
News flash, news flash, it's a cruel world
No one is too thorough to lose it all to a girl, uh
What if they told you your chick was a groupie
You know, like a ho, the type that be choosing
You gon' play it like nah homie, soon as the car pull up
Tell her you'll holler at her, say get in and goin' lose it
Uh, TV killed the radio
Uh, TV killed the radio
TV killed the-
And then the internet slit the television throat
When I moved forward I gave birth to several episodes
Our generation is cursed, we got too many clones
We just believe they gon' repeat what we just told
And all that bullets a pot of gold to the gullible
Ralph!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Wale]
Stockley, juice things up a little bit
Turn me up some more, baby; I'm rockin' now
I'd like to thank all the beautiful people that came out here tonight
Miss Reese, I see you in the back baby, oh yeah
You hear that? Uh, hear the Dap Kings in the back?
Young Dallas.. hah, I feel good right now
I just want something bout people but I appreciate
Hard to believe it... YOU DONE~!!! {*beats fades away*}

[Skit]
"Yaknowhatimsayin'? I ain't the third lil pig but I can show front you some bricks
Ya know what? Nigga, why do you think they call me Lil Coke James?
Niggas now and days wanna go to the NBA, nigga this is my gift
Niggas shootin' on my block all day everyday, I'm already NBA 
Got fiends jumpin' from the free throw line, like Michael Jordan
And why you think I got all of these J's on my feet? Niggas I got whips!
Niggas I got more whips than my slave great great great great great great great great grandfather
That's because I'm on the block 24/7, 365, rain sleet hail or snow"</pre>
