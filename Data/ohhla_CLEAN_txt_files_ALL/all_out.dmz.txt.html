[Chorus]
Fat stacks, thick thigh chicks is what we hold out
Ridin clean, puffin on green is what we know 'bout
Trials and tribulations of life, is what we flow about
Young God, go hard, and I'm goin all out

[Alex Dimez]
I'm always down for a collision cause I'm tossin like dumpling
A brother like me stays four-five dumping
Smugglin jacks across enemy lines
Niggaz love to hate, and still get bigged up all the time
I'm Alex Dimez, a young God but popular for my grime
Get to know me through rhyme when I'm massagin your mind
Watch you get hypnotized by each one of my lines
Like when the shotgun pellets all be touchin your spine
Everything that you touchin is mine so hands off
Before I gotta prove to the world that your man soft
Bitch niggaz runnin they mouth and that's all
Most don't know the true meaning of what's raw
Keep bumpin your gums, I'm crackin your jaw
Better yet I'm dumpin the four and breakin the law
See the God on his grind on the streets and in malls
Put my hand in every pot big and small, I'm 'posed to do this
Shorty spit ruthless, recognize who the truth is...
... big and small, I'm 'posed to do this
Shorty spit ruthless, recognize who the truth is

[Chorus]

[Alex Dimez]
Back to the rules I originally came with
And still makin moves with, just entertainment
Grooves in the sidewalk, Henny in my veins
Love's in my heart, I got weed in my brain
Right from the start kid I always stay the same
Niggaz won't stay the same, I beg to differ
Comin from luxurious livin, beams with red slippers
Evenings with the fam, toastin over dinner
Ever since the day I was born, I signed up
Niggaz wanna get to the top? Well line up
Brothers wanna get in the game and pay nothin
Some get a chance while others stay frontin
While you were tryin to hit homeruns I stayed buntin
And now I rise to the top like cake in an oven
Shit's startin to hurt, now you feelin somethin
Me goin all out, ain't stoppin for nothin
It ain't my fault that you got hate in yo' blood
Keep it up 'til I come through and put eight in yo' mug
Like I said - it ain't my fault that you got hate in yo' blood
Keep it up 'til I come through and put eight in yo' mug like

[Chorus]</pre>
