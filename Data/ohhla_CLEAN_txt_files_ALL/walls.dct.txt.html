Man against man just ain't the plan
It's time for god's people to take a stand
I mean brother to brother, black to white
Stand up to the problem and begin to fight
Not against each other, you're wastin' time
Yo, I'm referring to a battle of minds
Not through debate or writin' on the walls
This kinda action is delayin' the cause
An eye for an eye, fight fire with fire
It's our turn to take it one step higher
Gotta live by example, show brotherly love
We're together on earth, we'll be together above
So we're

[Chorus]
Tearin' down the walls
Of segregation
Unity abroad
New revelation
Tearin' down the walls
Of segregation
Unity abroad
In every nation

To label churches by color ain't nothin' but wrong
We're in the same crew, we're singin' one song
If you're in god's army, that makes you my kin
Yo, our common bond is the father of men
Of all attributes that we should possess
Love is in the word ahead of all the rest
No negotiation to love a certain nation
All means all, with no discrimination
Boy, we can set a precedence the world can cop
Yo, fellow believer, now's the time to stop
Racism within our lines
Today is the time for this love to shine
So we're

[Chorus]

(vamp)

Judge a man by his heart, not color of skin
God views a man from what's held within
And, you're called one of his, so you gotta know
To be christ-like is the way that you go
And my brothers and sisters in one accord
Yo, we're the sheep, and the shepherd's the lord
So whether black sheep, white sheep, or even swirl
God watches over all the sheep of the world
So tell me whassup when ya know the command
The word's bold, "love your fellow man!"
And treat him like you would treat yourself
Pull brotherly love off ya dusty shelf

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
