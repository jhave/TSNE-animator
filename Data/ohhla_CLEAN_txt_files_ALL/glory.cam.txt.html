I'm here now!
Ha! Ha!
I'm here now!
They should have never let me in the muthafuckin game b!
They done fucked up lettin me in Un
They done did it to themselves man!

Eh yo, you see him
Cam in the BM 
Wit the Koreans
To G 'em
Wit land in Korea
Take the leer jet flight
When?
Thursday night 
Overseas
Y'all fuck up it's worth your life
Huh, you niggaz heard me right
Uggh, for that persian white
I go to church of christ
Search a life
First to cut a nigga for his merchandise
My niggaz ball for weight
Sprinkle ten grams of coke on their corn flakes
To make em frosted flakes
Oh, these jewels on my neck
You'll say the Lord I'm saved
My shit cost some cake
You think you can afford a date
But yo your men should know
That my crew, we intend to blow
Treat you cats like Martin Lawrence
And motherfuckin end your show
When I say no
What don't you understand the N or O
Like that nigga Jigga said
Yo, you either friend or foe
So respect my wish 
I'm a perfectionist
And wit the gun
Is the only time a nigga plays catch or kiss
Check the list, how many necks I twist
Who expected this, Exodus
Blow over night, or even sex a bitch
But she catch feelings everytime I hit her off
On my dick so bad I need Cochran to get her off
Ask my nigga Digga
Or my other nigga Mr. Ross
The point we get across
To make it that you get across
And cats like you, get mad and wanna holler rape
But you live in the burbs'
Your business is on the holidays

Chorus
[Noreaga]
Now where my up north niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my down south niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my east side niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my west side niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my Harlem World niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my Iraq niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my N.O.R niggas at
Wha What!
Now where my Cam'ron niggas at
Wha What!

[Cam'ron]
Eh, yo I just wanna walk wit ya'll
I don't wanna rhyme
I just need to talk wit ya'll
How ya'll feel about me
Yo, I think I'm pretty hot
Cause when I rhyme
Niggas grab they dick and diddy bop
Then pull they skully down
And put their ice grill on 
Like they don't trust a nigga
And walk around the club
Like they bout to crush a nigga
I get a nigga mad enough to when he snuff a nigga
No need to boast 
Yo, I fuck around and bust a nigga
You got to love a nigga 
The way I rhyme what
Cause out west they fuckin throwin gang signs up
Wildin all out and not carin where they wind up
Next day same ice grill along the lineup
Ya'll niggas' time up
No mean to trouble you
I'll snatch your kids quicker than B.C.W
What you mad about?  I see a lot of tightened jaws
I got a lot of hoes, but I'm really, really liking yours
Not to nag her, wonder if I can bag her
It ain't if I can have her, it's HOW I'm gonna have her
I'm a lay her like a quarterback
On her back
On the mat
Found out that you wanna act
We ran through her
You want her back?
Come on wit that
You kiss a hoe
But when the bitch leaves
You fuck around and miss the hoe
Oh, I'm the type to kiss the hoe and diss the hoe
Choke and threaten to kill her, like her last name's Carlissimo
Listen yo, trick the hoe and get her dough
That was Pryor like Richard yo
See I done been around the world
See I met Puff and I know Mason
But still the best nation
Nigga is donation
So let me hold somethin
Yo, you can't change my livin
This robbery's a holiday
Call it Thanksforgivin'
Cause you a turkey
Talkin bout you sell weight
Nigga you had soul mates, I had cell mates
But now I've been in the same three hummers
For the same three summers
And my dice game loves me
and stays on the same three numbers
