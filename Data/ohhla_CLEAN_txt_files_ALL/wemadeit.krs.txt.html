Whoo (hahah), WE MADE IT! (We in here)
We made it, uh
WE HERE! WE HERE, WE RIGHT ON TOP!
RIGHT ON TOP! Yeah!

[Chorus: Slug]
Not about what life gonna hand you
Stepped up, got ready and ran through
Made it this far, won't act brand new
Way I feel, there's nothing I can't do

[KRS-One]
Congratulations you made it, you made it
That's right, you self-created
Out of millions of sperm cells, you made it
You fertilized the egg man, you made it
You made it first, then you made it through childbirth
Then you made it home where you opened your eye first
You made it, people happy that you made it
They elated, you newly created, you made it
First day of school, you made it
First grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, you made it
Into your teenage years man, you made it
Your dreams, plans, life goals, you made it
Wrote it down then you stated, I'm self-created
All the right choices, you made it
The money in your pocket, you made it
You never waited, never hesitated
Your magical life, you would never trade it
for nothing, man you made it
You highly favored, and flavored
Man you made it ("I made it")

[Chorus: Slug] + (Female)
Not about what life gonna hand you
Stepped up, got ready and ran through
Made it this far, won't act brand new
Way I feel, there's nothing I can't do
(Not about what life gonna hand you
 Stepped up, got ready and ran through
 Made it this far, won't act brand new
 Way I feel, there's nothing I can't do)

[Slug]
I made it, and didn't even know that I made it
I was placed in a cycle of stress and self-hatred
Self-medicated as a self-preservation
Stayed sedated to kill the pain and frustration
It's all related and these ain't complaints
I'm just tryna take the blame for the time that I wasted
Chasing after temporary validation
Had to stretch my reach, I could barely break the chain's grip
Freedom broke it, now the shoes fit
Keep my focus on my people and my music
Speak fluent, live and breathe through it
and leave the foolishness for these too-cool-for-school kids
Some don't want to see the truth to it
So used to losing that we afraid of the movement
It's all right, let the pride get boosted
Even if you make it just to prove that you could do it

[Chorus]

[Buckshot]
I work so hard to do it, Pop said "Do it!"
Don't worry, people will rock to it
So I do it for the ones who could not do it
If it's done right, I did it, I run right through it
I do it for the ones who might do it
Later, or latter, it don't matter do it?
I did it once and I'll do it again
I got stuck on the way it got done when it was done with a pen
I do it for them, I do it to win
I get it done like a cooked cornish hen, I could go on again, so do it
And I'll prove water is fluid
When you step up, the rock is not a bluff, do it
Huh, it don't matter if your mind's influenced
I think not, cause I do it and y'all dying to do it
So, if you do it, do it slow, only do it if you know
what you're doing, if you don't, don't abuse it yo
How many emcees do it? Too much to count
But I do it for the bounce, move it
And I'll show you what to move with
If you ever question the it that I do get, now you do it!

[Chorus]
