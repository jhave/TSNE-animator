But wait a minute let me check my list
And make sure yo named ain't missed
Never mind the ice on my wrist

Smokin on that fire hay, takin the back streets where I stay
 
(Heavy D)
And you gon do it this way
Cause you gon feel it my way
(Baby check me out now)
I dont know what you see in me
Maybe it's my jewelery
Don't know bout where you from
But where im from we get it done


(Chorus 3.5x)
You know my role don't slow
You know my doe flow so
Sit back and po moe slow
While you out on the flo 
I'm feelin you fo sho 
Don't wanna go solo
No need to talk no mo 
Baby come on lets go</pre>
