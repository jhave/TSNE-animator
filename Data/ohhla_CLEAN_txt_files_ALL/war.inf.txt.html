"Gun shots"

[Ty Knitty]
Uh uh uh it's war son for real

" Machine gun shots"

[Godfather]
War (repeating)

If its war it's on
24 slash 7 war war 
We want more
As time goes by 
It's either do or die 
Be the look in my eyes
Dunn i'm glad to be alive
Mobb loaded in rap
Only the strong survive living in fact
Niggas best fall back (fall back)
We click like clocks when they tick
24 slash 7 war
Stomp off a predators
Quick to set it off
Which you know this Infamous
Blow this spot control this spot
You feeling it, squeezing the glock

[Ty Knitty]
Some say we the drunkest and stay bent
24 7 it's on arrogant milltant
Thugs drugs and guns, 8 bars a peice
Hav lacing the beat
Blow trees till the morning
All i see is ice grills on mugs
Handshakes and hugs
96 buildings of villains
It's a maze through these buildings
The steps we walk
Qb slang we talk
Dont piss me off

[Gambino]
Ayo i feel this shit wit thug heart
We takin ya heart
It'll be the shit i kick that'll tear ya apart
Fear no man my plan is to get on top
Cop a drop straight cash off the lot we got
Murda one rap music abusing ya thoughts
Hold the heat in the street fuck peace abort
We keep it gangsta with A.K's and hand grenades 
Runing through ya block sprayin' for days crime pays 

[Hook] [Godfather]   repeat x2
If it's war it's on
24 slash 7 war
Who would you be if you didn't have to set it off
Squeeze yours Infamous on top better rep yours
Fuck around and test yours
First be the best off

[Godfather]
If it's war nigga abort
Combat sport
Survive by all means use whatever was taught
Living the code of the streets
Gun shots pop some nights i can't sleep
Gotta make ends meet
Second time felony a jake got beef
I'm wanted by the states 52 at least
We a - mericas most the toast stay close
Better watch ya approach
My niggas is going for broke

[Gambino]
If it's war say no more nigga handle ya biz
Protect ya moms wife and kids the way i live
A lot of foul shit flash through my brain i did
How i used to rob shit wit my identical twin
As the world spin a hundred bark bent off gin
Loose rocks for ten, been locked in pens
For life ima war till my motherfucking end
Gambino, lighting you up wit mack 10's

[Ty Knitty]
Ayo all we need is the Linden if it's war 
We want more we here to settle the score
Say no more ammo galore (Ya heard!)
We catch you on tour
Who would you be if you didn't have to set it off
Squeeze yours infamous on top better rep yours
My niggas buck for a cause and shit on the law
If it's war it's on, ayo my word is my bond
If you done heard then you gone
Hit your bird and your mom

[Hook] [Godfather]  repeat x2
If it's war it's on
24 slash 7 war
Who would you be if you didn't have to set it off
Squeeze yours Infamous on top better rep yours
Fuck around and test yours
First be the best off</pre>
