[Chorus]
Nobody loves me
Sometimes the world can seem so cold
Looking through the windows of my soul
I see the truth and now I know (I know, I know, I know)
Y'all gotta love me
When the weight of the world was on my shoulders
You were there
When it got heavy, I held it
You were there
The ones that stood by me like soldiers
You were there

I know you love me

[Verse One]
But I'm still waiting for the Lord to come hug me
Send a sign or somethin'
Is it all for nothin'
The talent and Passion of mine
I'm sick of sufferin'
I know your plans is greater than mine
So I'm asking
Why do you want me dead or alive
And how could you let the people see me through the enemy's eyes
Like, jealousy, envy, Feds wanna convict Gotti
I'm thinking probably we was gettin' too much money
Too many niggaz in whips sittin' on 20's
Too much connections to the streets, Y'all niggaz doin' somethin'
And after overall assumptions, so it's all or nothin'
Ain't nothin' stopping the second coming, except the coffin
I may be incased, but even from there I still touch 'em
Niggaz ain't promised tomorrow, that's why we still hustle
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, say my a prayer, I swear

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
But what's love, when your friends become enemies
Your nightmares are no longer your worst dreams
And as bad as everything seems
Keep hustling
We gon' get it by any means
How unfortunate, January the sixth
Federal officers, raided our offices
Making it hard for us to eat, and breathe, and live
And they swear they got niggaz that's informin' them
They've been handin' down indictments for about a year
And they send nobody to jail yet, we still in the clear
And the Bible that said, "Thou shall not fear no man, but God"
Whoever said that, ain't never faced the law
And why all these Feds probin' going on
I'm fighting niggaz, swingin' back against the wall
That's for my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
How could you hate me, why would the Lord forsake me
Put the weight of the world on my shoulders
I thinkin' I could brush it off and nobody notice
Keep raisin' my kids: Britney, Jeffry, and Jordan
Keep coppin' new whips: Bentleys, Benzes, and Porshes
My niggaz, and my fans is the only thing of importance
It's crazy how the world turns
Sometimes, you gotta light up and let it burn
Sweep up your ashes, put 'em up in a urn
On a mantle from memories
I hear you callin' me, Lord knows you love me
The Passion of Rule is so real, just lend me your ear
You'll feel what I feel, you'll tear when I tear
The vision's real clear, just look in my eyes
I believe in putting my life in the hands of God
For all my niggaz that can't be here
For every tear, send me a prayer, I swear

[Chorus]
