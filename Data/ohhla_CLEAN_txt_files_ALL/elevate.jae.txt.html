Song:   Elevate Your Mind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby

[Verse 1]
Live with no regrets
Die for my respect
'Cause I don't wanna live
If the world don't have it for me
So called friends jealous
Hated by all me ex's
But I don't give a fuck
Long as my daughter happy for me
See everyday's a celebration
So we spend and ball
Then we get lifted like old people when they fall
And dear wack rappers we never listen to y'all
If we was deaf with a choice
We still wouldn't listen to y'all
She love the breeze from my balcony
Different type of work just flew her in from Calgary
You probably in her direct messages nigga
Thirsty times thirty your desperate nigga
I just tell her

[Chorus]
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby

[Verse 2]
Too outspoken
You might say I'm nad
But hear to speak my mind baby
You never say I'm nad
I run the streets old Bojack gray and black
Niggas can't touch me like it's techno bo special flow
Kill a hater on Valentine's no X and O
Work all day and cook hot shit
Like I live in Mexico
And fuck wifi, I get high as hell
Hood nigga got your favorite divas eating taco bell
Ride shotgun, these niggas mad I'm a winner
And they not one
But I remember nights where it was no pretty hoes
Just me and ex videos
No really though...
So for a nigga please

[Chorus: x2]
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby
Elevate your mind
Elevate your mind now baby</pre>
