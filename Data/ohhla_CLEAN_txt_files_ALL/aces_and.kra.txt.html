Walked up in the bar and sat down on the stool
And got the low down from the guy with the jewel
He was playin pool and he thought he was good
Cause he bet me five dimes, he could sink em with his foot
He grabbed a stick, tried to kick it with his heel
Did a sick back flip and ended up full kneel
He didn't squeal, but it looked like it hurt
And it did cause he took me for my cash and my shirt
I got worked, but what's worse than that
Just as he was leaving he tipped his hat
Then he laughed and said, I'm sorry bout your luck
When he walked out the door he got hit by a truck

Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's

How bout the guy, used to hang in the clubs
Getting all the numbers and getting all the love
He didn't wear gloves, he was too hard core
May he rest in peace, we don't see him anymore
Lots of stories and old cliches
Small town girl tryin to make her way
She moved to the city, all she wanted was a job
Now she's underneath the desk tryin to move to the top
It won't stop cause the circle won't let it
Be careful what you wish for, you might get it
You know the cat got macked by the bees
He was messin with the honey and the mouse and the cheese

Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's

You could beat the system, you could beat your girl
But who ya gonna beat come the end of the world
Imagine everything you ever worked for, strived for
Suddenly becomin everything your gonna die for
Now what'd ya live for
Nothing anymore right
How could you live your whole life uptight
See everything you did and everything you seen
Rolled around in the mud, but you couldn't come clean
And that makes you dirty, now how does that feel
Living life like an open cut that won't heal
Sore at the world and you don't know why
You bounced like a ball and that's how you'll die

Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's

Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
That's a dead man's hand
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's
Ace's and eight's</pre>
