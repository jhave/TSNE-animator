[Louis Logic]
Whatcha think cause ya neck and ya wrist go bling
That ya shit don't stink? Faggot asses doin' the Sisqo thing in a thong
Y'all ain't never had a inkling of thinkin' of bringin' it on
Take my advice shorty
Before I make your life story the same shit R&amp;B bitches sing in a song
Cause when I ring the alarm the hooligans wanna fight for me
And bring the things that'll make a calm night stormy
Quite sorry if y'all didn't understand it
I'm at once demanded and underhanded
So when ya stash goes missin' from ya man's crib,
You'll be scratchin' your lid sayin', "I betcha someone planned it"
Learn ya lesson
Don't take one for granted, whose confirmed profession is words as weapons
Observe discretion and freshman escape with they life
Use your street smarts, otherwise we takin' ya mics

[Hook] 2x
You need street smarts for retards
Cause y'all ain't thugs y'all sweethearts
So ya better not come around these parts
Ya hear three barks and then see dark

[Louis Logic]
It's best to know the ledge
Court jesters please observe, and heed the word of older heads
Before your life's scroll is read on the day of ya judgement
Pussy rappers cry when taken away from their husbands
Y'all sissies but ya have to try to feign a grown man's appetite
I wait for no man that's the life
When ya take what ya need before givin' ya up to speed
I'm like Nissan, but more driven
when it comes to sendin' sleepy rappers to the mortician
I'm like Kevorkian, ya all fit in
Cause my schedule is open ended like ya whore's kitten
Clitoris drippin' after two or more listens
I'm the porn magician,
Every deflowered chick's source of friction
forced to fit in till the drawers are splittin
I'm the Puerto Bliccan, spittin' with the street smarts retards
Good riddance to the niggas on the R&amp;B charts

[Hook] 2x
You need street smarts for retards
Cause y'all ain't thugs y'all sweethearts
So ya better not come around these parts
Ya hear three barks and then see dark

[Louis Logic]
Even hardened criminals know the average Joe's miserable woe
Though they both live by different codes
Niggas don't know how I developed such a difficult flow isn't it so
cause y'all wouldn't believe what I done did for the dough
I've walked the earth in the places where the niggas won't go
workin' for racists, surrounded by the turbulent faces
And in search of oasis I found rap records
earnin' the papers by whippin' halfsteppers
Don't get your GAP sweater tied in a bunch
or think you're bad cause you're buyin' your lunch
By supplyin' the chunks for some guy on the junk
You need to try survivin' for once with a 9 to 5 for a month

[Hook] 2x
You need street smarts for retards (you need street smarts for retards)
Cause y'all ain't thugs y'all sweethearts (street smarts for retards)
So ya better not come around these parts (you need street smarts for retards)
Ya hear three barks and then see dark (street smarts for retards)

What do ya do when ya catch ya best friend and ya chick in the sack
And you need a way for gettin' em back?
You need to get street smarts for retards (I'm tellin' ya Duke)
You better get street smarts for retards (You better go tell ya whole crew)

Your out on the street corner sellin' drugs and such,
but enjoy the taste of your own bud too much
You need street smarts for retards (I'm tellin' ya Duke)
You better get street smarts for retards (You better run and tell ya whole crew)

You wanna face the kingpin and ya at the dude's house
But ya brought a rusty boxcutter to a shootout
You need street smarts for retards (I'm tellin' ya Duke)
You better get street smarts for retards (Run and go tell ya whole crew)

Y'all pussaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy's... shut the fuck up!</pre>
