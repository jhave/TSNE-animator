[Intro: not sung by BOA]
God's gon' set this world on fire
God's gonna set this world on fire one of these days Hallelujah
God's gonna set this world on fiiiire
Gonna set this world on fire one of these days

[Opening - sung]
And there's no earthly way to know it
Which direction we are going
There's no knowing where we're growing
Or which way the wind is flowing

[Chorus - sung]
Is it raining, is it snowing, is a hurricane a-blowing
There's no knowing where we're going, it's a hurricane..
Is it raining, is it snowing, is a hurricane a-blowing
There's no knowing where we're going, it's a hurricane..

[Verse One - sung]
Not a speck of light is showing
So the dangerous keep growing
All the flames of hell are blowing
Is the grisly reaper mowing

[Chorus]

[Verse Two - sung]
Yes the danger must be growing
Cause the hookers they keep on hoeing
And they're certainly not showing
Any sign that they are slowing

[Chorus]

[instrumental and ad libs to end]

"For those listeners who didn't feel that
 we just had another one baby, it just rolled through."</pre>
