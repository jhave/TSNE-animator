[Ludacris talking]
Yeah, they never seen that shit comin'
Greg Street and Ludacris, Georgia to Texas
All over y'all ass
Dirty South nigga, check it

[Ludacris]
Now I'm an honest ho and all my hoes is honest
Luda make you brace yourself like orthodontist
I'm hooked on chronic and Smirnoff twist
But know ass in spandex is a turn-off bitch
It's not right like chapped lips if you givin' some mouth
Niggas want me on a song so I give em' the South
Thirty a verse, cars just for sixteen bars
And that's before I did this, so it probably went up
Eighty thousand dollar bonds, I ain't givin' a fuck
Cause that's change in my pocket, 45 I cock it
Click before I spit then it's time to scram
Bought a Cutlass on dubs, colored candy yams
And that's bowling ball paint so I roll the lane
Keep a poker face bitch and I fold the game
On a come up, get done up and it's time to creep
Freestyle motherfucker, nightmare on Greg Street</pre>
