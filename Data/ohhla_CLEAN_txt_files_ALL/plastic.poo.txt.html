[Intro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah! Rapper! Joe Scudda! Chaundon! Yo! Uh! Uh!

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, I flow liquid, Poobie been gifted
Wrote it in my manual watch how I shift it
No breaks, two takes at the max
Heavy on facts got me cruisin at a slow speed
Haters watch from afar and catch nose bleeds
Or do some Big Syke shit like have your car keys
A bad seed tryin to do good
Niggas can't cause they too hood, I'm too nice!
I'm steady rollin like two dice
You now starrin at a fresh slice, for my old man
Rapper tryin to touch old grams
Put a couple on the stand keep my people out of prison
They praise me faithfully no religion
I thank God everyday what's He's givin
I'm livin, no glamourous life
Ain't nobody sayin, "Yeah Rapper, you do that light!"
I do this right! You lookin at the sun
Or you lookin at the one and the rest is flash lights
Somebody tell these pussy niggas good night
I'm like a pair of stretch jeans homey - extra tight!
Get it right or get it right where you stand
I say I'm on the mission my nigga I'm not playin!
Shoutout to Ronnie J what's up

[Chorus: in tune to J Dilla's "Love Movin'"]
We keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups
I keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups
Real ghet-to with the plastic cups
We keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups
R.I.P. Dilla Dog nigga that's wassup!

[Verse 2: Joe Scudda]
(J-O) Aiyyo, dirty crib, dirty car, dirty clothes
Got bent, spent nights with dirty hoes
Smoke weed, eat food off a dirty dish
My P.O. said, "Joe, you got dirty piss"
I'm nervous, a hundred and twenty hours of service
for the community, yo where's the immunity?
But it beats jail time, I can't do cell time
My man passed his test, how I failed mine?
Good ass lawyers and the money to pay it
Fuck a bitch-ass court-appointed, the state coulda say it
He ain't pick up the phone, even left me a loan
Fuck I need you for?! I can do bad on my own
Got me pickin up trash, my whole summer is gone
Seventeen years old, man I
shoulda been home
Instead of out doin dumb shit, I wanna do fun shit
Go to house parties with the cats that I run with
Get drunk, smoke weed, party and pass out
Sleep in late instead of takin the trash out
Workin for free, I need to work with a fee
This community service shit just ain't workin for me

[Chorus: in tune to J Dilla's "Love Movin'"]
Uh, I keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups
We keep it ghet-to with the plastic cups
Real ghet-to with the plastic cups
R.I.P. Richard Pryor nigaa that's wassup!

[Verse 3: Chaundon]
Uh - Bronx Bumbleton, Carolina Hurricane
Word is he's the next shit, yeah I heard the same
{?} the beat, certifiedthe murder game
Most wanted MC, niggas know the name
Ghetto celeb, the broad on my arm
Bottle of Dom, light the block up then I'm gone
Chaundon! - The muh'fuckin voice of the street
J Dilla still wit us, ressurected through beats
Poster boy the success, the face of B-X
Soul of New York, won't expect anything less
Still walk wit a Diddy Bop, through any city block
Flash a smile to a pretty young thing that make her kitty hot
Pardon me y'all, I'm blessed with the charm
Surrounded by chicks as if I'm on the Birdu farm
I get it on! Make no mistake, there's only one
Chaundon, Boogie Down's in the house and I'm DONE!!
