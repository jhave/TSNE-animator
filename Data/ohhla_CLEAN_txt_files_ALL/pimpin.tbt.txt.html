[Man]	Pimpin is a alive, these niggas just jive

[Baby]
I don't ride white walls its vogues I'm mashing
But I'm +Hood Rich+ nigga tell ya bitch to ask me
Swang yo' ??? in that brand new Caddy
Seville four door slammed back lil' daddy
Throwing bricks in the cut like a nigga give a fuck
I spunt what you niggas spunt when I was coming up
Its the bling bling king worth mils with nuts
Scored that brand new Benz loud pipes 'em up
Got that Avalanche truck alligator in the trunk
Got the snake in the floor of a Bentley HEADS UP
Them white folks coming lil' dady HOLD UP
Shift it up the block for a nigga can pop
I'm a born hustler but a pimp pimp player
2-G and 2 its Big Tymer year
Doing donuts in the drop top with Cartiers
And I ain't met no nigga with more cars than this player

[Fresh]
You don't wanna get it on
You'll get shitted on or spitted on
Reptile boots and suits thats fitted on
Got the bar up in the car with the dranks so I can sit it on
Peanut butter and wood, its still understood
That Im'a P-I-M-P
The M to the A, double N-I-E
Now put yo' feet up on that mank
Take a pull of the stank
And we can do it how it should be done
I treat a bitch like a hoe, a hoe like a slut
A slut like a nut cuz I really don't give a fuck
Now with a dick up in yo' throat can you still sing a note?
Well if you can say I'm the man with the superfly trim
Woah move away young dude you're ruining my mood
Straight mackin to the stackin money bitches and food
Caddilac Buritz big booties and tits
Got twenty bad bitches with the matching outfits

[Fresh]
I was the man in kindergarden and a pimp in first
A mack in second grade by third it was worse
A made man in the fourth a don in the fifth
Had the teacher sellin ass when I touched the sixth
Seven eight and nine whatever they had was mine
From tenth to twelfth bling bling ya blind
Now I'm the money foldin phone holdin
two way checkin home wreckin
rent collectin weenie weckin, big pimpin
Love a lotta women, walk with a limp an'
(Talking)
I'll have the snow crabs a bottle of uh um cristal
Some fettacinni and some um let me see what else
Oh and some shrimp

[Baby]
I'm a bird on crew in that Lexus coupe
I left the roof at home let the rain come thru
Don't cry now ma you know how it go
But since ya hair got wet lets smoke some 'dro
Get it right ma and put that Fresh mink on
Them CMC boots with the platinum thongs
I wear enough ice to sit on the throne
And if a nigga come close Im'a go back home
