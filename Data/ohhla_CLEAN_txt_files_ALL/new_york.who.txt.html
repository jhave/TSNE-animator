Yeah, get it right niggas, we live and die this shit

All I got is my niggas, my family dunn
All I live for is them, I die too dunn
For my doggies my loyalty is crazy
My heart'll turn cold, cause they would do the same for me
All I know is this Mobb shit
Me and my comrades runnin' through the states sound bombing
Every ghetto, every hood, every project, every slum
What what, any two, any one
You don't like me, step up front or hold your tongue
Cause I don't play those games I'll burn ya
Your wife wanna stare nigga, so we fucked her
She love it when I spit on her, when I fuck her
Ain't not'in sweet, ain't no'tin change wit' P
Except now I got more places to lay my hat
I break my back for my clique
Go 'head and try that shit
You'll be a hurt nigga the day you try that shit
