Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Big wheels on my Phantom, got it sittin' crooked
3 birds for a show, nigga gon' book it
I'm LeBron James, you a fuckin' rookie
You probably want a ticket I'mma go and book it
Book it, book it
Book it, book it
I'mma go and book it
Big dollars in my pocket, got me sittin' crooked

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
100 racks in my pocket, I can't even walk
50 hitters with me nigga, I set it off
Poppin' bottles, blowing money, I'm just having fun
Me and my niggas fresh to death, upper echelon
I got buckles on my shoes and they gold bitch
Open my doors in reverse, this that Rolls bitch
CMG Bentley coupe, that's a cold kit
See the bird, double R, that's some cold shit
All I rock is white, them on my old shit
All my niggas solid, all my hoes thick
DJ drop that Gotti, this that dope boy shit
Smelling like a bag, I'm looking like a brick

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
They say I signed to Tip, I say when I do that
Me and Tip, we're conversating bout where them choppas at (bang bang)
I be where them goonies and them robbers at (I am)
So when you see that Phantom dog don't follow that
Ridin' in a rental, gettin' that pack off
Fish scale yay I call it bath salts
Trap doing good, I can't complain
It's been a damn good month, I moved like 20 things
Then went and bought that new Jeep, that SRT
Yo ho suck dick on sight, ASAP
Just got a yellow AP and that bitch nasty
When I popped out my second week I coulda bought a Aston

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]</pre>
