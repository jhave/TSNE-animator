[Verse 1]
I'm stackin, rappin but if I just so happened
was it I probably would be posted up thuggin, sellin crack or somethin
I had to leave it alone cause the rats are something
Look like my return won't be long
The streets keep asking for me
Young savage on the mound game ova now
I'm in Houston and A Town wheres the motherfuckin crown
I don't have no fuckin friends
I'm solo now
Put my trust and my mack 10 bitch don't let me down
Coloaborate
Just fuck wit them that's makin me sick
Spoil bitches don't want share
So I'm taking this shit
I'm a 110 street cat and had my back against the hope
No money, no love, just tears, weed, blood, and hoes
I'm like slim these niggaz don't feel my pain
A ninty-nine problems and but a bitch ain't one
Ghetto stories, gangsta musik, thank big labels ain't come
Shitd we just trying see which one

BITCH!!

[Chorus]
I'm so retarded
And I'm gon all hard and
My game mutheafuckin bitch brains up
And I just getting started
They hate to see a nigga ballin
They rather see a nigga coughin
But rap money, street money I'm gon see money
Bitch nigga regardless

[Verse 2]
If the shit ain't funny den I can't grin
And if it don't make money it don't make sense
And If you really ain't bout nothing
You better zip your lips
cause around here stuntin nigga emp yo clip
man My grand so ridickuless You can call me the clips
and I slap all my bitches you can call me a pimp
I'm like the hood candy lady
I got them chips
I got hoes wit J.Lo faces and Beyonce hips
2 home boys doin 7 can't wait till the touch
So many people up in heaven dat I miss so much
vest up up wit my chest and stomach not becuz I'm scared
But no they coming I hope they don't shoot for my head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
18 riding lacks nigga
How you hate dat?
Do it big bad bitch give me dat shake back nigga
Yall ain't got do shit
Just leave it to me Push record for yo boy and lay back and kick up yo beat
turn up the beat
A pen paper give me one sheet put a barcode on it
Distribute this heat
I got the biggest fuckin bug buzzin in this streets
I know you heard a young savage Trill E-N-T
But you forgot bout me
Thought I was gone where I'm gone go
I run this mother fucker
I'm the spice in the gumbo
I'm bout my fuckin paper man dats all I fuckin want more
You gone gets wats mine
Oh no, you a dumb hoe
Still good, still can get you rite on the down low
It never snow in Baton Rouge
I'm the nigga wit the snow
2 let y'all niggaz do y'all thang so I hope y'all been gettin it
Wat up playa
I'm the new mayor of the city nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
