Soarin': is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga wit a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of the sudden they fixed they faces
Cause of who I know and trail of places, that I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
Cause I'm risking my soul attack
Now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb: it don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you're goin' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can't rule out these claps for gun
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
So maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Been pimpin you can think about marriage
Until then get it then
Find yourself and let's begin
I'mma tell you how in a minute
I'mma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zone and see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'mma zone out till I lose feeling
Remember, I'mma be gone way past November
Even stay up there, up there 
Floatin floatin' hopin' I could find peace somewhere

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
In my, mind sounds like oooooooh
When I'm, gone it feels like ooooooh
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I forget about it all

Ballin': is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Comma's on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland city we ride around
Greetin' my niggas wit dap and pounds
So if I fall I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while 
I keep myself so lifted 
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless see without my flight
Man, everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am fadin' man
Doin' other shit if everywhere you go niggas ain't just standin' round hatin'
So, my advice is when the lights start flashin' 
I'll be zonin' all alone 
And then the place where my mind is goin' 
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress tryin' to ask me for one dance
He think he slick, but my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin' copin' floatin' I will find peace somewhere

[Chorus: KiD CuDi] (Repeat 2x)
In my, mind sounds like oooooooh
When I'm, gone it feels like oooooooh
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I zone, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright
I forget about it all</pre>
