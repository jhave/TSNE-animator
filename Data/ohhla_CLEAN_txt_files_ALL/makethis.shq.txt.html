(Bring it, bring it, uh come on)

(Shaquille O' Neal)
Aiyyo baby clear the way for Shaq
Another hit when you thought I wasn't comin back
I heard you askin all your girls aiyyo where he at?
Well here I am doin damage on another track
Do you really wanna rumble with the big dog?
T.W.IsM. fam, Peter Gunz, Shaq, Ken Dawg  
Getting money droppin hits stoppin all y'all
Boy y'all tryin come let me warn y'all
Stall y'all I'ma make it if I'm hot or not 
It is the money, ask yourself cause I got a lot 
Not bein funny talkin sh.. but I pop a lot  
And back it up and catch a breeze in the six-drop
And if it's sunny then I get deep in the kick drum 
You think I'm wack baby girl come and get some 
And see yourself when Shaq get these hits from 
Same source that your man wouldn't bit from 
Oh get ready baby

(Chorus w/ variations)
(Public Announcement)
Get ready tonight
We gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
It's on baby girl I hope you can remember

(Peter Gunz)
Aiyyo I used to push the a..
Now I push the six with the bows in the back 
Funny how the honeys come and pose when I'm at 
In the Bronx and the shows where I'm at
You can ask the hoes in my flat
Shaq made a path I came through walkin 
Now I'm pushin and got the whole cold stalkin
Feelin me knowin that I'm winning in the beginning   
You thought it was a phase till I heard a brother read
Peter Gunz un fellow chapter uno bruise like Bruno 
Slam like sumo who know money you know 
I bring the funk like under arm and see me on 
That's why they get me on delivery my ?denemerey?  
So configurey chips and the gzank
Is just how a..
I've got plans for mine 
I wanna know when I go that my family got the dough 
When I. 
Get ready baby  

(Chorus w/ variations)
(Public Announcement)
Get ready tonight
We gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
It's on baby girl I hope you can remember

(Shaquille O' Neal)
I'm a pro on the court on the microphone 
Going platinum if I buy a million of my own 
It gas there's recruits on same song 
Why your man play off I'ma play on
Word is born pro Dawg is the Hit-man  
Big dirt's hittin fools like quick sand 
On a mission clear the path like Christian
Apply pressure to the Christian 
Who the man Peter Gunz is you wit these 
For all these undercover haters tryin to get these 
Forget that cause baby mamma wanna hit these 
And bring me drama while these cowards tryin to stick these
So nick these I'ma shine like the Sun do   
As you know I'm made of steel so I'm gun-proof
There ain't a member of your crew I can't run through 
Won't you page me later then I'll call you
Uh wanna play baby 

(Chorus w/ variations)
(Public Announcement)
Get ready tonight
We gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
It's on baby girl I hope you can remember

(Outro)
(Public Announcement)
Get ready, ready, ready, ready, ready 
Ooh yeah you don't have to worry
You don't have to worry don't you say one thing baby
