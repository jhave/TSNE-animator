Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And we are
The krush groovin, the body-movin
The record makin and the record breakin
And it goes a little something like this

Uh, oh, frickity, uh, oh

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Oh, I see, come on
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Ohho

I got my boots polished up and my overalls pressed
He is back, it was over y'all guessed
I heard ya new stuff and I hope it's y'all's best
Cos this that ? that's disposin' y'all's mess
See I live with Ricky Wade and I'm still with Timmy Mosley
Hit every town, every suein' city knows me
Oops, I admit, every suein' city chose me
Why are you yappin, I sent you to get the groceries
Hot shot, hype down, money's in my sight now
Really think that you can keep from me but it like how
Bubba's out of sight, wow, yeah I'm really psyched out
Plus we got them kids in the yard and they like (OW)
I was playin' in, Bubba's gonna strike now
Been milkin' music, we just had to find the right cow
Still I'm in the field, ain't no tellin' what I might plow
Fly always from the early bird to nights

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Oh, I see, I said
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah, oh
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
No they might

I popped up with Archie to let ya know I'm ready
Put some hickeys on the Betty and some mickeys on the chevy
Just hit me when you're ready, oh and send a deposit
A title, a bobbin, I'm stumble in and rob ya
? walk the walk, too much for you to knock it
That I'm a been done, ain't no words to drop it
Said it first quarter to double up the profit
Timmy call to play now huddle up I got it
I assure y'all I'm no average, okey-dokey backward savage
Don't subscribe to that old add, and this country boy is no ?
That's just a sample of flows I can handle
And no I ain't content with that gold on the mantle
If hip-hop's dead then I rose from the shambles
As him to which y'all can't hold a candle

I said a lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Oh, I see, I said
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Ohho

Oh, I see, they don't really do a forty quite like me
Yeah I know you miss me, just a innocent wing see
Cos the belly sexy, and I keep it greedy
That's why every girl I meet seems to need me
And I try to help 'em, call 'em Bubba easy
Got a mean slur being chunky but to please me
But not enough to part me from my cheesy
But I love the hold 'em two big bouldem
Balls on her chest, cock nine hit em low dem
Betty shoulda told 'em, Bubba K is holdin'
Down this fort with a army of Trojans
I was soft spoken, mamma raised me humble
But gotta be a crocodile if I'm a raid the jungle
Back in the mud thirty days in the puddle
Sucker speak up, I can't translate ya muffle

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Oh, I see
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Ohho

A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, ah yeah
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Oh, I see
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear, oh
Get some money from Ugly, buy a keg of beer, oh
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would disappear
Ohho

Go boy, ahahahaha, hehe, ha hehehe
Goin' around I told ya once before, ah yeah
Hey, frickity, he-he-he-he, I told ya once before, ah yeah
He-he-he'll be-be-be comin' round the mountain
He'll be comin' round the mountain when he comes
He-he-he ain't goin' nowhere
Gotta-gotta-gotta make that competition
2000, 2000 and eternity, Timmy, Bubba, we out</pre>
