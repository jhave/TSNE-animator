[DF Dub]
Oh yea
I'll tell ya a story
About a country girl
Oh yea

[Verse 1]
She was a country girl from Cleveland, Texas
In a big city and she liked my necklace (Bling Bling)
So we started talking, while we took a ride
In thee big pick-up truck and my hat was to the side (Oh yea)
She was a country girl, from the class of '96 ('96)
A big booty with some big ole country (damn)
A country name with some country attitude
Say yes Mam, but at times she's kinda rude
A daddy's girl, so I had to watch my ass
Sixteen, Mr. Hill would whoop my ass
He can't kick it, I'm a city kid
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did (we did)
Oh yea

[Chorus:]
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
[4x]

[Verse 2]
She liked country living and acoustic guitars
And Kenny Chesney in country bars
And Cadillacs and I couldn't relate
I'm just a concrete kid on a country date
And her dad hated me, I knew it
Didn't like my tattoos, pierced ears and black music
We still chill cow tipping and tripping
With that brushed papa shirt lift back cuz she was tipping (Oh yea)
She was a country girl home cookin' and grubbin' (Hmm)
Ain't used to my style big limos and clubbin' (We be clubbin')
A city kid and I'm doing my thang
I like an ole country girl and this is how I sang
Yee-hoo, What, What

[Chorus:]
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
[4x]

Oh yea

[Verse 3]
A country girl cut off jeans and lollipops
Tequila shots, tube tops and liquor stops
A country girl with them country ways
Livin' big city nights but them country days (Ugh)
A country girl don't understand thuggin' (What)
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin'
A country girl pigtails and care free
No direct dish, just Channel 3 (Oh, wait a minute)

This the only channel you have?
What?
Oh yea!

[Chorus:]
I fell in love with a country girl
A city kid in a different world
[4x]

Oh yea
