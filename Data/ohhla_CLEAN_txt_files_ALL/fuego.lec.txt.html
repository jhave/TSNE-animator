[Lecrae]
I'm all in preach Jesus til I'm short winded
Come gossip pouring up living water and lyrics
This ain't rap this bartending
And I'm back in the back snap back to the back
With a pack full of cats that'll strap with the fact
Christ when he ask to revive in the tracks
Turn they're life into maps with the gospel we pack
Look I'm of one life but for Him I spend every cent though
I know this life it comes with pain
But it's through our pain we win though
Could be made like Him so treat these streets like flint bro
Cause our God can spark up the dark
In the hearts of the hardest departed let's go

Treat every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire

Never been here before left foot tell the right foot to go
See the whole world coming through the door
Footloose don't nobody care no more
Come on go hard til the end don't quit it
Sky to close now go'n head get it
World's the same it's all a game
Look at a stranger go'n change a thang
Get up the sky go'n burn tonight
Ye know ya'll going to learn tonight
Feed the hungry and touch the sick
We go'n help the homeless and love the kids
We go'n move to a place where it's hard to live
And folks die young and they learn to kill
Light the sky up change your bio
Live for something more than things you buy up
Serve and save learn and change
Trust in the king who can turn this thang
Yeah they ain't every seen a shine like this
Look up they never see the sky like this
I'm on and this little light I got
Imma let it shine til the day I drop
Heart quit pumping only way I stop
Til then I'm a light post on your block

Treat every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire

See I don't want no regrets no turning back Imma go and impress
Even if I lead the whole world in press
That ain't going to put my soul to rest
Keep the name keep the fame world to cold so I keep the flame
Ever seen a child ain't eat for days
Promise you ain't ever go'n leave the same
Hands and feet cause these the meek
The world is a mess go'n sweep the streets
Cure for cancer cure for AIDs
Make a brother wanna stay on tour for days
When I get home and things are wrong
There's two shot dead right around my zone
Ya I pray but faith is dead if I don't get up and go work my legs
Torches high light the sky 116 no shame tonight
Ya they ain't ever seen a shine like this
Look up ain't ever see the sky like this
I'm on and this little light I got
Imma let it shine til the day I drop
Heart quit pumping only way I stop
Til then I'm a light post on your block

Treat every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last time you get no other chances
Get your torches high let's set ablaze the sky
Passion's a fire bright and we'll be burning forever

Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire
Set the world on fire let's set the world on fire</pre>
