[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
Fresh pack of bogamills (Yes sir!) 
Empty bottle ass taker, empty bottles of Nuvo
Only one problem is

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh! Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
Ok we left the club around three, headed back to that room
Yeah it's time for that dome 'cause we checkin out 'round noon
She said damn N.O.R.E. so cold keep it up always no doze
Look at that ass shorty all swole, we can just go! go! go! go!
How 'bout some backshots? Do it missionary
Whip out my laptop, pulled out my dictionary
Hmmm! And I got head right off the whip
This she came up out my lips, I'm like bitch what part is this?!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Verse Two: Ja Rule]
Yeah! I got a bitch that like to get fucked up want it like to get a little roughed up
And that's cool 'cause a nigga gotta customer, stickin my dick in her mouth and her chokin up
Not for nothin but you really hurtin both of us, 'cause I hate to see a woman cry when they givin mine
Never mind never mind games any given time
You can come over bend over let me bust it open 
Closet freaks just came out Frank Ocean, I said I like to do it in slow motion
She said she slippery when wet caution, awesome
Never met a mouth that I didn't fuck often 
Never met a bitch that ain't like her +Kisses Down Low+ K. Rowland
Are you rollin? Well them kisses pausin

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] (Birdman)
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?! (Yeah!)
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?! (Rich Gang baby girl!)
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head (Fly nigga shit!)

[Verse Three: Birdman]
Versace on the spread count a hundred in different ways
Fuck me in different days I fuck her in different ways
Shoulder to partly, fendi and head play
Pull up in hard tops, cuff 'em and get paid
(RICH GANG!!!) Crusin in my maybach
Pull up to the front do', thrity on that top flo'
(RICH GANG!!!) Two on this persian rug
Gave me brains and she blessed me on love

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Bridge: N.O.R.E.]
I-I had to tell I had to tell I had to tell her man!
I said baby girl, mamita senorita!
We could've did what we did when we, we're supposed to do
But after you did what you did, ewwwwwwwwwww!!!!!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah! She tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
BITCH! You must have bumped yo' shit when you fell out my bed</pre>
