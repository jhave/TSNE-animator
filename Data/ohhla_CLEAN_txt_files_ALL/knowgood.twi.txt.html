Bump this shit, bump this shit, tell me what you know good
Bump this shit, bump this shit
Two years ago a friend of mine
Named Jamie Madrox write these rhymes
And when I wrote them rhymes this is what I said
Die motherfucker die we rock the dead
I spit blood cause I love that shit
Quick to just straight up cum on your bitch
Don't mean mug or expect to die
Now put your motherfuckin' bag of weed in the sky

I put my pen to the paper like they're in love
Perform anywhere and nowhere for a pound of bud
I just like the feelin' of a microphone in my hand
I'm on a mission to turn two dollars to two hundred grand
We been rhymin' like some poets since we was young
Didn't make a lot of money just rapped for fun
Now we got a little somethin' but it's not enough
And we ain't stoppin' baby we just started warmin' up

You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Whoever spat on my shit can watch your whole world wing it
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good
You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Everybody's hypnotised as if they in a trance
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good

Some people call me monster but my name is Jamie
The misunderstood with many personalities
I roll with Monoxide and he's my bro
Ran through many bitches but we don't love them ho's
But they don't want us, they want what's in our hands
Small venue, big dicks bout to leave 'em brash
Put twelve stitches in that ass like Kobe
And when I'm done that freaky bitch is gonna blow me

M-O-N-O-X and a I-D-E
Only call me Paulie if you're down with me
Never for the money always for the family
The family's the fire that burns inside of me
I'm a Juggalo, wicked shit is my fame
Keep it underground so I can let the blood rain
If you got a choice between an axe or a blade
Better grab the axe and put that knife away

You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Whoever spat on my shit can watch your whole world wing it
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good
You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Everybody's hypnotised as if they in a trance
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good

I got a little older so I dropped a child
Still smokin' weed like it's goin' outta style
Skinny like a bean with the meat of a flea
Still all these bitches wanna sleep with me
T-W-I-Z-T-I-D
On the east side is where you'll find me
Need a little money so I pull a robbery
If I'm runnin' from the cops my homies'll hide me

Now that we back in the game people shakin' like a leaf
Still holdin' it down with three fingers for the east
Peace to the people that pride with us
And if you ain't down with us prepare to bust
Before we bust on you and your whole crew
In my b-boy stance what the fuck you gon' do
You ain't fly like an insect, you're a cockroach
And we're comin' with enough shit to drown both coasts

You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Whoever spat on my shit can watch your whole world wing it
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good
You don't wanna see me and my b-boy stance
Everybody's hypnotised as if they in a trance
I make 'em say ho, I make 'em say ho
I make 'em say hold up, tell me what you know good

Bite it, b-boy stance
Bite it, b-boy stance
Bite it, tell me what you know good</pre>
