Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus]
Never heard it like - quite like this before
Never heard it like - quite like this before

[Chris Lowe]
Now first off the bat, nah y'all who dat?
Think about where you first heard the skull snap
First of all, y'all don't know me
I'm on the cover of the XXL between Steel and Jarobi
"The Greatest Day in Hip-Hop History" is to be marked
Mad contacts just got sparked
F'real, that's why I'm here
Sleeping Bag wasn't cursin me, this my 10th anniversary
I trooped it back from the day in Connecticut
Y'all live, real niggaz lick shots, peace to Shaolin
Let's get it rugged like rough rugs and stuff
And break shit down like construction trucks
Word up to M.O., to the ten year demo
I made him come clean, one mean lean machine
I tell you like this, if y'all prefer
You gon' hear this funk shit 'til your vision a-blur

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chris Lowe]
Y'all millionaires pay attention, player hatin and dissin
Sharp minds'll find this the shit y'all missin
See I'm all about the skin I'm in, back to black
Let's begin again, my complexion like cinnamon
Best believe somethin up my sleeve
With no competition, just can not achieve
A sexy sucker, but the mind is sane
Havin nothin to lose but my goal's to gain
That's plain to see, that's on the strength of Mic G
Yes lord I hold it down real tightly
I take it to the top one time for all y'all
The ladies and the gentlemen, hustlin and pedalin
Whoever you are, I know your type by far
Have some respect and keep that act up to par
The rules of my game for your protection (protection)
To keep you movin in the right direction

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chris Lowe]
The ball in your court, Chris Lowe shoot the shot
Some brothers, might like it, some brothers, might not
Do it different?  Not at all, the funk don't fall boy
You nuts, niggaz got classic cuts
Check the script, as I flip, it ain't nuttin
I hear presto rappers, instant, pushin for buttons
But this here original, from analog to the digital
It's clear to see that mean it's rippable
to death, the last funk nigga left
I needed a record, to save my last breath
Push it up, cause you might not ever hear me again
I'm Chris Lowe, see y'all in another ten

[Chorus] - to fade
