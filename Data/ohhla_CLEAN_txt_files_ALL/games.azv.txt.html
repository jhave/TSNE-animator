[AZ]
Of course it's me, AZ
The most hated, most underrated
But it is, what it is

[Verse 1]
Go the years studded frames on my facial
(?) tint, you can sense I'm bi-racial
Benevolence of a pimp and I'm grateful
Heaven sent, I was meant for a late view
Lived the life, unknown the most
Never boast, got that grown approach
I get it in, professor with the dividends
Doe or Die, succesor of my sibblings
You know it
From petty crimes to a street poet
It's all the grind, steady mind, taught to keep forward
The game's crucial, no gangs I remain neutral
It's more fruitful, trueful I'm living beauful (beautiful)
What the Lupe do, love it or leave it
Minor beef to above it to breathe it
Inclining cease, fuck how others perceive it
I'm doing me, hip-hop since Spoonie Gee in ziplocks
So I ask why y'all fooling with me

[Chorus]
I work hard (you know you know you know you know you know you know)
To get the things I have
I work hard
To get the things I have
And I wanna know why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play on me)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play, yeah)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me

[Verse 2]
Imagine this: no money, just arrogance and hungry
Can see a sex freak, fly mystique and spunky
Comfy amongst the streets why y'all creeps is lunchmeat
Frauds, like emotional broads, it's only monthly
Grungy, violence is the only respect
The stress numb me
Death is the last thing left
So get from me if your math ain't matching your words
I know the half so when I laugh I'm just relaxing my nerves
Love furs, diamonds is a mans best friends
His and hers is all captured on the camera lens
I'm what it was, for the buzz and the torch was lit
Never a dud, you all bug, get off my dick
Y'all need hugs, I'm just trying to mind my own
Little patron, few shines, all kind of colognes
Monotone, it's assertiveness that come when you grown
I sense nervouseness, y'all know I'm in that murderous zone
But still courties, shake hands and kiss the kids
Make plans with the Ms. take trips to live
Why bid when the smart got a lot of advantage
It's a art, so know that y'all involved with a mammoth
Single handed, never taken nothing for granted
Never fronting, my face ain't never touching the canvas
Understand this

[Chorus]
I work hard (you know you know you know you know you know you know)
To get the things I have
I work hard
To get the things I have
And I wanna know why you wanna play on me
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play on me)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play, alright)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play, baby)
Why you wanna, playa hate AZ (Why you wanna play on me)
Why you wanna, playa hate on me (Why you wanna play)
Why you wanna, playa hate AZ

Why you wanna, playa hate on me</pre>
