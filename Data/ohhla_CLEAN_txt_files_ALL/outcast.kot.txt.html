Go
Kottonmouth Kings 2004
We got this punk hip-hop shit on lock

[Chorus]
We are the outcasts
Running renegades
Modern day anti-hero's
Making room for better days
Punkers and rebels
Wild in the streets
Fighting for our freedom
We got our own beliefs
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast, outcast
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast!!!!

(Motherfuckers....bitch)

[DADDY X]
Stoners Reeking Havoc we run this shit
Anarchistic punk rock clique

[RICHTER]
Mashin' the fuck out
Rippin' the town up
Runnin' amuck
Getting kicked out of strip clubs
Fools ?? friends limo bus
Ounce of crypt buds
You can't fuck with us

[LOC]
D-Loc, you can label me an outcast
Runnin' through you city like a motherfuckin' house rat
I stay punk rock on some D.G.A.F. shit
Don't Give A Fuck type hype beotch

[RICHTER]
Got it tatted on my arm, my boys 1st time blastin'
Think I'm a freak, look at you when I'm laughin'
You work at 99%, nuff said
I'm livin in the one with the Krown on my head

[LOC]
Kottonmouth's smoked out
All Krown down
Born in OC, representing P-Town
With the real type beats that vibrate your speaks
Hip-hop punk rock we just don't stop

Go
This is Rip-Hop
Punk Rock Hip Hop
Ain't no-one else hit this shit, what?

[Chorus]
We are the outcast's
Running renegades
Modern day anti-hero's
Making room for better days
Punkers and rebels
Wild in the streets
Fighting for our freedom
We got our own beliefs
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast, outcast
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast!!!!

[LOC]
Now we some modern day rebels getting' wild in the streets
Don't disrespect us. Love us don't hate us
Label me an outcast
Go on

Now we some modern day rebels gettin' wild in the streets
If you disrespect you can test my reach
I'll box you eye
In the flick of a wrist
Pull enough weight to crack the concrete

[RICHTER]
We got dogs in every state, county, city and we building
Throw something at me and your catching a filling
We an underground ?? creppin' deep beneath
Spredin like disease from the west to the east

[ALL Chant]
Call us the outcasts say what you gonna say
'Cuz we are the outcasts of this society
So call us the outcasts we wear the name with pride
'Cuz we are the outcasts of Suburban Noize Tribe

[DADDY X]
Come original or don't come at all

[LOC]
You radio song suck's
Fuck um
Bitch. Go

[Chorus]
We are the outcast's
Running renegades
Modern day anti-hero's
Making room for better days
Punkers and rebels
Wild in the streets
Fighting for our freedom
We got our own beliefs
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast, outcast
O-U-T-C-A-S-T outcast, outcast
Now we got u watchin' us we're outcast!!!!
