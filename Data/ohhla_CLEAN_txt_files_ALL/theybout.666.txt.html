[Hook: Juicy "J" - repeat 2X]
Yo mami an yo pops man they 'bout to find yo body
The snitcher and the cops man they 'bout to find yo body
The ambulance and morgue man they 'bout to find yo body
Laid out on the floor man they 'bout to find yo body 

[Crunchy Black]
One, two, here I come foo
Three, four, kickin' in the door
Five, six, rob a nigga quick
Seven, eight, get away str aight

[Lord Infamous] 
Throughts cut guns shot, wounds broke bones
Plagues diseases warclones and ozones
Playa depleting, go a heating, west nile 
Everynight on the news under the murder trails

[Juicy J]
He grew up as a rowdy motha fucka, he didn't give a shit
Give my black ski mask and gun and a do' to kick 
Down watchin' frown put the tone underneath your chin 
You know Project Pat is there your nigga down to make some fizz

[DJ Paul]
From the uterus to the funerals
I'ma keep my crown
Bitch I ain't from England
But my money still come in pounds
Lost a couple of members for the better
Still we hold it down, meet up on the
Bees on the ground from a .40 round put 'em down
