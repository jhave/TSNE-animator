[DJ Tech]
Warning, Warning (echoes)
The sounds your about to hear (echoes)
Can be devastating to your ears (echoes)

[Black Spooks]
Aiiyo Tech, bring that beat in (echoes)

[Ahmed]  *Chorus*
When it comes time to bust, who do you trust
W us ??,  and it's a must that you wake up, wake up
When it comes time to bust, who do you trust
W us ??, so just wake up, wake up

[Black Spooks]
The impractical Pterodactyl, human cold tablet capsule
For less than a capful of Advil
I'll snatch you right off It's axel leave you baffled
As you sit on gravel, then drag you through the whole English Channel
And effuse your flannel till your skeletal structure dismantle
With a Roman candle I start to revolution, unravel a king technique
Inadequate Sway to the left when I speak
What I secrete excrete your mental capital lasso your head and drag you
To the black tabernacle in kryptonite shackles
The wingered cannibal, two legged jackal, the killer mammal
Im every animal, pick what you think you can handle
Meet your girl I hump two times like a camel
Leave her smoking like ignited tobacco sprinkled with Tabasco
Flammable ??? , birde is irrational, hurling cantaloupes at your folks
In the name of Black Spooks mishandle those savage magrrical tracks
With no fragile flow, techtical spasm flow, enable to fathom flow
Put down the mic, im what your wanna grapple fo'

[Sly Boogie]
Im Sly Boogie the promiscuous, polygamist, ridiculous
When I deliver this gift like Nicolas
Come and get with this and when I break you off a chip of this
It I'll be like cocchie with syphilis on the clitoris
Inconspicuous when I sylphis this explicit wickedness
Come sip a swig of this liquid I spitted riverless
I'm phina split some lips and rip some ligaments
And get the pistol grip and dip and hit a lick, with exquisiteness
Ghetto fabulous with extravagance with a batch of cannabis
I be passing like nasty flatulence
Like savages causing havoc amongst the planets inhabitance
It's on and crackling, you can add it up on your abacus
It's tragic damage like traffic accidents
And I got these hoes waiting by the phone like job applicants
I'm phina crack a fifth with a half a splif
With Sway &amp; Tech I'm phina stack my chips and live immaculate

[Planet Asia]
Everytime I draw down, I lay the law down, same as before
Flow hydro, God forbid they ever take away The Wake Up Show
Worldwide broadcasting, straight out smashing
On the watered down version of the hip hop masses
Exclusive, on the 1 &amp; 2's nuthin but vinal, live &amp; direct
Sway &amp; Tech, DJ Revolution
Turn your system up; now let the system bump till it's over
At this point of time, there's not another radio station that's colder
My procedures round cats get call seizure
Clownin cats like Karmaleader, just controllin my breathin
I'm known as Planet As, reppin the Val, one of the best
I'll make you spit all your writtens until it's time for you to freestyle
Back to back battle raps, where cats gain respect back
I wreck raps, 24 bars of 'Celebrity Death Match'
Soon as my ??? played, enters your body off the page
Paranoia is usually the sign of the first age
??????????????? you's a first grader
I willies like Smith and pull chicks like Jada
In ya city with the natives, worldwide universal
Over millions tune, carillon multi-cultural civilians
Your now in tune to another dose of raw dogg blares
bangin out from coast to coast
Cali Agent number two, y'all maestros to crew
I strangle MC's until they face turn black and blue
The crackable, turn on the radio,
For most of the times I'm at The Wake Up Show, getting my spit on
Snatchin up your limelight, airwave invadin
Broadcastin, from The Wake Up Show it's Planet Asia

Chorus 2x (Ahmed)

[Ahmed]
Ahmed's countin
And when I get to ten, then im phina win
But, first work the body then two to the chin
that's what I do wit a pen (one)
I picked up after the phone rung um
He said "Its Tech I gotta track for you to wreck Ahmed
You betta come and run
And hurry to the spot
Cause I need you to heat it up and serve 'em till its hot
And the fans will say I cheated
Rushed to get my rap completed and got there about 3
Rumor has it that im tight as Ali
Press on if you don't believe it then you guessed wrong
Know why rappers don't wanna let me bless on...
They joints, I'll kill any track I guest on
Before the wake up, was rippin mics until they break up
Chewin up opponents, and spit em out and tell em "Shape Up!"
Straight on my way up, even when ???  come back
And Rev 'ill forget how to cut up before Ahmed come wack
You wanted 5, 6, 7 when the fake rhymes spin
Avenue is prime time like 8,9,10


[Ras Kass]
It's the golden child of the west, don't know how to act though
Kicked off the 'Up In Smoke' Tour for scrappin wit staff?  ?
As an embryo on the Wake Up Show
Handed rappers they ass on a silver platter
Illagrate matter and data
Vindictive, we do selectively cruel
The type of person to go to your album release party
grab the mic and boo you (boooo!)
Like who you? Forget who's who
Make a rapper durag do not want to
Nephew just a hollow man with the 'Sixth Sense'
Walkin around not even knownin that he don't exist
The cordial bi-linguistic, this twist be the hardest act to follow
To not even spit, I un-swallow
Golden State Warrior, Ras, X, Saafir, Gladiator's appear
Y'all queers with career's like Brittany Spears, so
(Singing)"Oops you did it again, you give oral sex to various men"
Where Barbie at I cant be humpin on Ken (uuuhhhh)
You lose playa, steady takin a loss
I'm off the meat rack like well done with 8 1 sauce
When the period is dotted, its all  ?? Technologics
Every word is part livin cell, part robotic
Be in the Matrix with jungle fever bangin Lara Croft from Tomb Raider
Download my program and  ??

[Crooked I]
Crooked I's a cannibal, a mechanical animal
That'll dismantle your mandible with a manual
on how to make raps flammable
The King so hand him a crown
I'll push you off a buildin
and write a whole song before you land on the ground
By the time your bodies flatter
Your lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney
pancreas, rectum and your urinary bladder splatter
I'm outta ya reach, hologram unseen on the streets
The Hollowman of Eastside Long Beach
Was made to smash and bang
You know what happen to the last rapper
we captured that was after cash and fame
Tech electrocuted half his brain, drove his ass insane
While Sway choked him out with his own platinum chain
Revolution hit him with turntables and cracked his frame
Karmaleader laughed as he grabbed his ass in pain
See, nuthin about these hoggs is cute
We got more stripes than Darrel McDaniel's joggin suits
Stompin like got rock steel toes
Keep glocks with shots that dive at you
At top speed like jocks tryin to block field goals
Take the speech from a lyricist
And throw his voice in the other room like a Ventriloquist, Listen to this
When I'm checkin my intellect and baffle Alex Trabek
And I can answer the Million Dollar Question in less than a second
I step in with weapons
That's destined to spit lead thru ya flesh then exit intestines
Me def just from flexin
Wait a second, who do you love?
Man this shows so raw, the MCC is keeping the studio bugged
Just in case I say (Backwards) Shit, Hoe, Bitch, Fuck (Backwards)
Aint a freestyle flow, I love the Wake Up Show!
