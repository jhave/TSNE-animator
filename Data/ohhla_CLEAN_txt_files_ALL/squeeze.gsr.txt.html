- Aiiyo son, it seems like, everyday
  more and more people begin to get more foul
  Uhn, now dig..
Association breed assimilation
Let me tell you what happened
I'm driving the other night, these two faggots pull me over
Talkin bout I got a broken taillight
They got a broken headlight
They shake me down, they tellin me
that they gon' come and see me tomorrow and have somethin for them
- Word, so what up?
So now I got somethin for them

[Verse One]
Who's the real criminals, take a look behind the scenes
Corruption and greed is commonplace routine
Guess it pays in many ways to have a few schemes
Shit, I know model citizens that ain't squeaky clean
You got dirty politicians, dirty judges and dirty cops
Everyone's on the take, the hood's filled with dirty blocks
How we gonna save the community, they worse than us
It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust
Think about it, that RICO shits no fuckin joke
For them the evidence'll vanish in a puff of smoke
I been observant, I'll never be subservient
I guess you get what you deserve in this
From project hallways to courthouse hallways
Some prevail, most see jail, this happens always
Speed on, before you get peed on
All I need is more power, then I'ma put the squeeze on

[Hook]
I want more power, I'm gainin more troops
I'm gaining more respect 'cause I want more juice
The most influential men, got influential friends
And I'ma put the squeeze on all of 'em

I watched y'all get fat, now I want my share
What you ain't got it all? Then I want what's there
The most influential men, got influential friends
And I'ma put the squeeze on all of 'em

[Primo scratches]
"They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a Set Up" -&gt; Guru
"It's a Daily Operation" -&gt; Guru
"You know me son, show respect" -&gt; Steele
"They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a Set Up" -&gt; Guru

The squeeze..

[Verse Two]
Believe me son, I'ma put the squeeze on 'em
Croocked cats, that confiscate the gats they keepin 'em
Hustler's Convention every night at D&amp;D
Had chicks on the strip with Trace in eighty-three
It's nothin, that why I know I'm on top
And I'ma stay here 'till I'm paid and owe nothin
They gon' take they cut, so why shouldn't I
Eliminate the middlemen, who thought they could die
Go overseas, make G's and bring it back to the streets
A never-ending saga when I rap to these beats
As the minutes go by, you 'bout to get it, know why?
I'm already in too deep, so forget it, don't try
Cause all you gonna find is sufferin and pain
I had enough of you man, I'm 'bout to fuck up your plan
So speed on, before you get peed on
All I need is more power, then I'ma put the squeeze on

[Hook]
