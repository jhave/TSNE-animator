(Intro: Silkk + Master P)
Yeah
You ain't gotta go to no car lot
Come and shop at the garage
Nephew [That-That-That-That]
I need to borrow a couple million from you [That-That ain't nothing]
You know how we do it

(Chorus: Master P)
That's how he doin' it
That's how she doin' it
That ain't nothing whodi I see how yall doin' it
That's how he doin' it
That's how she doin' it
Whodi that ain't nothing I see how yall doin' it
That's how he doin' it
That's how she doin' it
Whodi that ain't nothing I see how yall doin' it

(Verse 1: Silkk + Master P)
Clap your hands doors come up [that ain't nothing]
Clap twice the motor start up [that ain't nothing]
Guys givin' a concert when they run up [that ain't nothing]
You see it when the car and the truck's done up [that ain't nothing]
No Limit man we run the south [that ain't nothing]
Got my own clothes coming out [that ain't nothing]
Fly to France look just for lunch [that ain't nothing]
Condor if I say more than a month [that ain't nothing]
All my rides they be chromed up [that ain't nothing]
TVs yep phoned up [that ain't nothing]
Out the country when I wanna chill [that ain't nothing]
Ninety-six inches on the wheels [that-that-that-that ain't nothing]

(Chorus)

(Verse 2: Master P]
I got a house with some marble floors [that ain't nothing]
And my ceiling it be solid gold [that ain't nothing]
On my bed I got mink sheets [that ain't nothing]
And my mom live 'cross the street [that ain't nothing]
Ghetto kids call me Santa Claus [that ain't nothing]
Cuz every Christmas I break 'em off [that ain't nothing]
I got the new rims that keep spinnin' [that ain't nothing]
On the truck the Benz and the Bentley [that ain't nothing]
I got a Goochey helicopter [that ain't nothing]
And if I get sick I got a private doctor [that ain't nothing]
See me on Forbes I own the tank [that ain't nothing]
Came on out of money I own the bank [that ain't nothing]
I even ball in the NBA [that ain't nothing]
And might buy the (team's next mate?) [that ain't nothing]
P Miller on my shirt and pants [that ain't nothing]
And my speakers say the same thing [that ain't nothing]

(Chorus)

(Verse 3: Romeo + Master P)
Richie Rich be my nickname [that ain't nothing]
Ice cubes on my wristband [that ain't nothing]
Hit the mall the girls scream and holler [that ain't nothing]
Got a white dog named Dollar [that ain't nothing]
Platnium car with my name on it [that ain't nothing]
Got a car the paint change on it [that ain't nothing]
Got a butler got my own waiter [that ain't nothing]
Thirteen and got my own label [that ain't nothing]
Got a 2005 Lexus [that ain't nothing]
Even got my own house in Texas [that ain't nothing]

(Chorus)

(Verse 4: Curren$y + Master P)
Hospital just dropped a hundred on a Benz [that ain't nothing]
Then I bought four for my friends [that ain't nothing]
Hit the club on twenty inches [that ain't nothing]
I'm about to pay everybody admission [that-that-that-that ain't nothing]
Cops took my lil' partna to jail [that ain't nothing]
Hit him with a million dollar bail [that ain't nothing]
I'ma have him home in a day [that ain't nothing]
My money longer than the interstate [that ain't nothing]
I'm on stage got 'em goin' wild [that ain't nothing]
Throw a hundred Gs in the crowd [that ain't nothing]
I wrecked my Jag last Friday [that ain't nothing]
Got another one in my driveway [that ain't nothing]

(Chorus)

That-thu-thu-that-thu-thu-that-thu-thu-that-that ain't nothing
That ain't-that ain't nothing
