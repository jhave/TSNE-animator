{*entire song rapped over Micheal Jackson's "Billie Jean" beat*}

Yeah, Scram Jones
You know how we do, 2G remix
Check this jack son, got it from a Jackson
Check this jack son, got it from a Jackson
Check this jack son, got it from a Jackson
got it from a Jackson, got it from a Jackson

Yo, yo
Aiyyo I spit like a rifle, spray like Lysol on a classic
Recycle Micheal, cuz we should all recycle "Plastic" (that's fucked up)
I got it mastered, do what I gotta do
Like crackheads tellin the pipes "I Wanna Rock With You"
My people stay cockin tools, rip up the club
Hittin shorties, throw my dick in the glitter glove
Stick the glock and let the haze light
Its like the blaze is my life, the only lady in my life
Mary Jane in the pipe, naw we crack Phil's
Show our ass when we moonwalk - crack kills
We pack skills, you a spare tire
Ain't commercial, but my hot rhyme will set your hair on fire (AHHH!)
You starin at mine cause we hot like boiled eggs
And we'll get you wide open, like LaToya's legs
Your bubble gum raps gonna get chewed up
Cause mama-say mama-sah, mama you suck
Mama-say mama-sah, mama you suck (you suck)
Mama-say mama-sah, mama you suck (you suck!)
Mama-say mama-sah, mama you suck (YOU FUCKIN SUCK!)
Mama-say mama-sah.. uhh
Aiyyo I blaze the mic, take a strike
Spray it tight, take a hike
I got you other MC's workin workin day and night
So take a light and make my day
But after I spray it right you'll have nothing to "Say Say Say"
We major, you A-A-A in softball
And like a stolen paintin, my flows "Off the Wall"
We smoke like a Pall Mall, so play the field
Cause I hate y'all for real - its just "The Way You Make Me Feel"
It's another part of me so pardon me for rappin bitter
But the only person who could spar with me's the man in the mirror
The cat's iller - always gets me stuck
He'll get up in your ear and he won't stop until you get enough
We'll make you step it up when I smash the mic
I don't give a damn if you "Black or White"
Its just beats like this drive me bananas
Billie Jean's too clean, I'm hittin Dirty Diana
"P.Y.T." girl is mine, quick to lace her
Pissin on your rhyme is just my "Human Nature"
So leave me alone and just "Beat It"
The smooth criminal's too lyrical you get defeated

And if you wanna be startin somethin
You got to stop all the bluffin
If you wanna be startin sometin
You got to stop comin with nothin
I get high far from sober (yea yea) keep smokin that thunder (yea yea)
When my lightning takes over (yea yea) you're bound to go under..

Aiyyo it's "Thriller", fangs poppin out my mouth
Locked in your house, you front so much that you gotta slouch
You bout to bounce (why?) cause yo we play for keeps
"I can rap better than you." Yeah?  And I made this beat (yeah right)
I spray the heat, call me a microphone assassin
Put your money by your mouth, I'll battle you for 5 Jacksons
Raise you a Janet, plus a extra Tito
You rollin ABC 123 up at cee-lo
Your bank is gone, word I'm gettin mine
I should really cop a watch to "Remember the Time"
Maybe buy a tag from a guy on the ave.
Or pull the five-finger discount, you know "I'm Bad"
{*imitating MJ*} "You know I'm bad, I'm bad" Yo chill dog
You do that shit again, there's gonna be some "Blood on the Dancefloor"
Scram Quincy Jones the Jackson beat vandal
I spit harder than it is to clear this freakin sample</pre>
