Song:   Good Morning
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Good morning, welcome to the thing called light
Good morning, don't you let it pass you by
We laugh, we cry and then we dry our eyes
We fall, we rise, ready for another try

When life gets tough, remember we were never born to die
When times get tough remember we were born to be alive

Good morning, wake up and live the life
And don't forget to dream the dreams, the dreams
And don't forget to live the dreams and dream
And don't forget to dream the wonderful things</pre>
