Could've been a princess, crown out of thorns
Pretty little summer dress, fabric is torn
You got my interest and when I see you
I wanna free you, bring you
Out of everything, trouble in your life
But it's your kingdom and I'm just another knight

She fell asleep in the passenger seat
So we turned up the music hit the automatic unlock
Tapped the gas took the corner too fast
Put her ass out and left her on that black top
You know that dream you have when you're falling
But you always wake up before you hit the ground
Well it was like that, except her body went smack
Took a minute to figure out what just went down
So she stood up, she brushed herself off
She hurt, but nothing felt broke
She gave a little laugh because gods a comedian
Always surrounded her with all these jokes
She looked around, she knew where she was
Walked a few blocks and hopped on a bus
Went back to that street that nicknamed hell
To go manifest a couple more stories to tell
And I still can't figure out why she ain't figured out
A better way for her to use that cute little mouth
Between the Johns and the Jakes
How long will it take her to clean her front lawn of these snakes?
Anyone of us could've loved her
Anyone of us could've been her father or her older brother
Hold her, until she discovers the light
Besides the one at the end of the tunnel, another knight

Her name was Idola, she worked ?
Small little town below the border called Novala
She spoke little English but overall the music
Just a simple sins became hard to distinguish
So we got a private room where our conversation gloom
Beyond pillow talk, told me I'm the one you rode
And that soon would get to talking, of course me too
Was gonna be bilingual but growin up there
He didn't stand a single chance to advance
So she hoped to meet a gringo
That would be down to marry her
He didn't have to care for her
Could do anything but beat her
And she keep the house clean
And make sure he had comida
All he had to do was make believers of La Migra
Then she filed for divorce and set off on the course
Then he could step back into the joy of being single
I chose to interrupt, cleared my throat spoke up
I wish I could help you but you see I'm not a gringo
She laughed, I know you're not white
But you might know somebody
So she gave a website www.latinhotties.com
She said I'm number 37, I could make it happen quick
I already have a reverend that's prepared today
Then the tears came, wiped her eyes apologized
And said it wasn't pain
There wasn't much time before her kid was old enough to understand
Then she ?
