[Paris]
Hail to the man with the righteous groove
So sick that it makes you move
Closer to the speaker, never weaker
Lines on time and I rhyme Malika
Lot of knowledge on the microphone when I speak
Rabbit MC's I love to eat
Shockin with the rhyme, gettin sicker with time
I'm comin way too real and I'm blowin your mind
I'm tearin shit up, I won't let up, you need to get up
And out and on the floor, cause I'm fed up
With rhymes and words that's weak that's wack, absurd
Pollutin the airwaves, too often heard
I come through with the rhymes, so true blue with the rhymes
I eat you with the rhymes, and on and on and in time I'm
movin with the smooth the groove that some consider dangerous
And you're playin this, I ain't new to this

{*scratching*}

[Paris]
Yeah... it's a Scarface Groove

Paris is the name and I'm here to get sick
I mean I'm stronger than a tiger and I'm down with the click
While makin sure my song is deffer with an 808 kick
And now you know it, I'm a poet, and I'm harder than a brick
I makin over 3 G's a day, and you say
That Mad's cuttin like a blade over sucker DJ
Start shinin all the time that I'ma standin on stage
It's a Scarface mob and we're sicker than AIDS
What I wrote, is no joke, there's no hope
It's too dope, you're gettin broke by a cutthroat
While bein killed is the price you're billed
There's no time to rhyme and no time to build
Steadily the melody plays, and steadily bass
is in the place, is in your face, with grace
Sensation and finishin the suckers with my sentencin
You get excited as the rhyme begins, you're goin

{*scratching*}

[Paris]
Smooth... with the Scarface Groove
This the Scarface Groove
Yeah, it's the Scarface Groove, y'all

Startin to sweat, I know it's hard to breathe
Rhymes are on time so you better believe
The style, sick of the style, cause the style is wild
I couldn't never be mild, and now I'll begin
to advance in a b-boy stance
The underground sound makes you clap your hands
It's the B-A-Y, do or die
Born to freestyle, born to rise
And now I'll keep on rockin the beat on
No one comin up short capiche on the mic
You're scared, runnin from the man you fear
P-Dog is sick boy, you better beware
The man X-Rated, rated X the man
is comin through with the jams that keep you clappin your hands
While I'm movin nonstop and the party is smooth
One hundred below ice cold, it's a Scarface Groove

Yeah, it's a Scarface Groove
It's a Scarface Groove, y'all
Y'knahmsayin?  It's a Scarface Groove

{*scratched: "I'll play the 9 and you play the target"*}

[Paris]
Debutin I'll do it for sure by comin through
and never stoppin hip-hop, I just drop, MC's are ruined
Now I'm teachin when I'm talkin so that you'll get taught
Makin sense so intense is the record you bought
I'm stronger, strokin 'em longer
Stickin them, dope MC's go under
Keepin 'em down with the Scarface sound
Swimmin 9 millimeter laps, MC'sll drown
Keep talkin that bullshit, you might get housed
Smacked in your mouth, P's turnin it out
Money stackin and mackin is what I'm talkin about
I'm never playin, or bulllllshittin
The rhyme'll go colder than ice, but get hotter than coals
Big soul on a roll and only 20 years old
Keep it goin non-stop and the party is sore
And I'm movin, smooth again, Scarface is on

Yeah, Scarface is on
Scarface is on
Yeah, Scarface is on</pre>
