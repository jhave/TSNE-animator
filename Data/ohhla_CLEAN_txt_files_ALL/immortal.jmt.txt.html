[Sample]
"Explorers... In the further regions of experience...
 Demons to some... angels to others... Now you must come with us..."

[Ikon]
Enter the dragon
With 3 immortal Surgeons
Ark of the covenant and the Holiest excursions
The search for the knowledge and the wisdom of the sands
The Hologram sends you to the abode of the damned
Immortal like vampires;
Setting fires in the caverns of the unholy
Oh, the ancients all hope of Abraham
Send you to the sacred land
To change form, the daunting rituals that leave you scorned
Crown of thorns adorns the unborn in which you spawned
There is no shelter from the storm of Babylon's lost children
I lead millions to the promised land;
The holy lamb
The planetary Hologram
Blowing your Shakra's to oblivion
Digital Man, Biblical man like Syrian
Vanishing Breed, the Holy Throne
Presidents of United States are now Clones
The Zones of the Virus!
The eye of Cyrus!
The last waltz of the tyrants-
The harvesting begins now!
Infinite information Like Wu Chi Tao
But How-
Would you in stand the power of the helix
The crucifixion of the phoenix
The Black thesis, will burn you
Give to you the darkest of afflictions
Mortal Mc's face the verbal crucifixion

"I am in fact lacking confusion as to what's real, and what's illusion"
"I am in fact lacking confusion as to what's real, and what's illusion"

[Breath of Judah)
The infinite, grand planet
Ish ka Kha Shalamha, Most High
Called Ali Aba, astronomer
Roam the universe like Rha me-yun lef
Indigenous with consciousness of Sirius
I am a 7 density light being
Transmanifest personally
In divine nation Atlantis rising
3 dimension radiation is extremely
for difficulty to cope with the body
Externally, in the centre of the galaxy, Alchemy
Spirits soul my commitment
So that's efficient, receive nine dimensions
Of cosmic expansion exquisitely
Philadelphian church chosen settee
Add instance to vortex's
Pleiadian Sequence Equinox's
At the zero point. Dialoguing
Keeping time flying
Sitting on Khompeten , Meditating
3 Immortals... Through portals!

"I am in fact lacking confusing as to what's real and what's illusion"
"I am in fact lacking confusing as to what's real and what's illusion"

[Apathy]
The plot thickens;
Through psychological crucifixions
I mar emcee's and travel lands guiding Christians
My writtens escape the earth in certain crisis
I Create raps for Christ and 12 righteous tribes
Educate with positive vibes
Devastate your dimension and nobody survives
Out of smoke we rise
Illuminating eyes and wise
Teaching Lost fools that Yeshua never dies
I cry, try to cut off my air supply
I'm a transport to space, let the mother ship fly
Annuni, seven signs
Let the Dolphin be the Baptist
With self contained underwater breathing apparatus
In Atlantis Digital image screen enhances
Photographs of alien ships upon ya planets
Emerge from Volcanoes, Dreadlocks and Halo's
Presto- changeo, I Morph to tornadoes
And tear up ya major metropolis
You fish tank guppies couldn't fuck with the octopus!</pre>
