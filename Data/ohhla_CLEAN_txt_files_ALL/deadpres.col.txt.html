Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Give me my money, man, why else would a nigga be grinding?
I'm for them diamonds, dog, how else could a nigga be shining?
I'm glowing, knowing that the flow intact
Get this record deal, I swear to God, my first mil I'm blowing that
Now, like fuck it I know I'll grow it back, shit, it's nothing
Funny how blacks spend their money on mad shit for stuntin
But shit, that's all we know man, thats how a niggaz raised
You learn bout two things: getting pussy, getting paid
And you should be gettin laid by the time you in ninth grade
So niggaz lying on they dick and hoes giving nice brain, yea
In class dreamin bout having these nice things
And then you look around and wonder why you strugglin
But them whites ain't
I brush it off like, "fuck it, it's motivation"
Some niggaz gotta walk through life, some niggaz roller skating
Some niggaz bypassing steps, some niggaz chose to take 'em
And for that fortune, man, some niggaz sold their soul to Satan
But fuck it man, I ain't hatin, I gotta go for mines
My little God-sister pregnant now, I put in overtime
On my grind, yea, just like the nigga making Fortunes
I'm focused, on my bite, like a cobra, I'm tryna get my Oprah on
These hoes is crying cuz I won't pay 'em attention
Time is money, bitch, and a nigga payin tuition
Real niggaz hustle by using their intuition
While these fake niggaz ain't into doing, they into wishin

Til I'm rich, ain't no reason to settle nigga
It's greed that make a nigga wink at the devil to get that cheese
You niggaz couldn't think at my level, even with trees
You couldn't get this deep with a shovel, now nigga, please
I'm chasing G's tryna throw some diamonds on them freeze
Sick shit, sneeze on some thousand-dollar sleeves
Ease to the top and I'm not finna leave til I'm hot
But my watch gotta breeze, a south nigga
Boy, I'm shining without the diamonds in my mouth
Out grindin while you reclining on your couch
I'm climbing, you haters blinded by the doubt
My niggaz riding is devout, so talking violence out yo mouth
And you gonna find what I'm about, nigga
Far from a slouch, nigga, I ain't gonna parlé with y'all
I'll probably hit ya, my hand game like Bobby Fisher
but check, them checks is all a nigga thinking
For them Presidents, I'll treat a nigga like Lincoln
