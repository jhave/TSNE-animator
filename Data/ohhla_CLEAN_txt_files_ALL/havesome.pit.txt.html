Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All I wanna do is have some fun. I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home. I gotta feeling this party has just begun. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that you're gonna give me some. It's all I want
Baby. It's all I want

You know the type of women that I like, the ones that understand my life, the ones that understand wrong is right
So let's do something wrong tonight. You name it, I'll do it. Always the fluid, in Spanish I'm fluent
That means my tongue is bilingual, ready to play with that spot where you tingle
Gotta bingo, she's a star, ringo. Her and two friends? Hmm, I like that lingo
She asked if I'm single, I said "of course not" and she loved it
Next thing you know we're both having fun in public! Dale!

All I wanna do is have some fun. I gotta a feeling that I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is take you home. I gotta feeling this party has just begun. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that you're gonna give me some. It's all I want
Baby, it's all I want

You know I love an open mind. So I can see what you're thinking
That way I can give you exactly what you want, matter of fact, what you drinking?
Some call it pimpin, I call it leverage
I call it slips, they call it marriage. She got me up like the Eiffel Tower no Paris
Mami, you can fuck like a rabbit but no diamonds, no carats
She asked if I'm single, I said "of course not" and she loved it
Next thing you know we were both having fun in public

All I wanna do is have some fun. I gotta a feeling that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home. I gotta feeling this party has just begun. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that you're gonna give me some

All I wanna do is have some fun. I gotta a feeling that I'm not the only one
All I gotta do is take you home. I gotta feeling this party has just begun. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that I'm not the only one. It's all I want
I gotta feeling that you're gonna give me some. It's all I want
Baby, it's all I want
Baby, it's all I want
Baby, it's all I want
Baby, it's all I want</pre>
