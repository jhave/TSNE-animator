Uh, bounce, uh, bounce, bounce

[Smilez]
Hey yo, pigeons, chickens, birds, poodles (uh huh)
They understand me like I'm "Dr. Dolittle" (uh huh)
Except for those dogs that like to talk doo doo (um)
You know what I do to dogs like you? Stage you (ow)
I ain't new to this, 'cept for that gray 6
Pull that out, and get all ya'll believin'
Shit keep ridiculous (uh), shit keep playin' it (ah)
Callin' me Ron Isley your "Contagious" (haha)
What you talkin' for, huh? What you takin' dog?
Your whips sittin' on a statutory rape charge
What that mean, your rims under 18
Mine LNE AARP
Get your Milli Vanilli flow away from me (get outta here)
K-Mart rap you need to bring it back, *scratch* bring it back (uh)
My or my jack, like that nigga, Smilez is where it's at

Cause I jumps out the whips (uh)
Belly full of Cris (yeah)
With dimes on my hips
Now tell me, what you call this?

[Chorus]
Ridiculous, ridiculous, 35 girls on the floor, just shakin' it
Can't hold yours? Yo we takin' it
Chumps in the corner, steady hatin' 'is

Ridiculous, ridiculous, better watch out, we conspicuous (uh oh)
Got in on lock? Yo we takin' it (come on)
We livin' this, ridiculous (let's go)

[Southstar]
First MTV to BET, radio to TV, video to CD
We be, the cats settin' them trends, makin' them ends
Stay with them ticks that get rated as ten
We steppin' on them, slide over give me some room
This a best of 7 series? Then give me a broom
I got girls all over, wantin' me as they groom
When all the cats that try South, layin' under a tomb
You think I'm gonna lose (haha), you must not seen the news
Have your whole family, start singin' the blues
Want to be like us, but you can't fit in our shoes
Just light up a match, I dare ya'll to spark up a fuse
We about to explode, me and Smilez travel the globe
This ain't a game, us and ya'll, we not the same
We the lions in a cage, that can't be tamed
So the only think to do, is keep payin' your dues

ATL (drop bows), St. Lou (fo' sho'), New York (light po), O-town (we so, we so)

[Chorus]

[Smilez]
Uh, uh, yo I'm glad they thinkin', comin' with a drink and
To the club, don't he note, just our season
That her, not the one who two face kid
At 11, quick to heaven, but snuff your face in

[Southstar]
How can you say, in the winter, we don't make it feel like its May
We ain't the best you heard of in your day?
Stop lyin' to yourself
Yeah I'm cocky, arrogant, sound conceited, but look I got you callin' for help

[Smilez]
Man its so hard to choose coochie, gold or platinum
Shit when it comes to that, I try stack paper (I chose)
Lawsuit it up
Bented cap tilted forward
In LA, I drop my whip a little lower

[Southstar]
A '96 Max, headin' in the dog kennel
Get your hairline pushed back if you want play around the world
A full court press, ya'll cats couldn't handle
Once we come out, blow you out like a candle (woo)

[Dakari]
Girls show love (uh), when we show up (uh)
Dakari on this track, nothin' else to say but

[Chorus] - 2X

[Talking behind chorus, and after - w/ variations]
Uh huh, c'mon, uh, that's right, ya'll know, Southstar, uh, Smilez, Dakari!
Got your niggas trust me, sucka, yeah, talk to 'em, ha
It's over ya'll, right here, Dakari
Ya'll ain't ready, start prayin' niggas, we not playin' niggas
Trust me</pre>
