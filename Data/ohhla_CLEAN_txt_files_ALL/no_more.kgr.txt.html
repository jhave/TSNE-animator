(Ah yeah)
(Y'all Hip-Hop hoes)
(Check this out)

(Bitch)

Yeah bitch
No more Mister Nice Guy
Y'all bitches check this shit out right here now
Word up, baby
No more Mister Nice Guy
Fuck all the bullshit
Fuck all that nice shit
No more Mister Nice Guy

(You are not the sensitive man you used to be)

I used to be romantic and considerate
But now I hit the skins, I jump right in, and then get rid of it
Cause I remember when you used to treat me like a stepson
You hung around for fun but yo, I wasn't gettin wet none
Treated you like you was a star big as Madonna
I took you out on dates to go eat steaks at Benny Harner's
I called you on the telephone to see what you was doin
Took a trip to the zoo and bulls were steady tryina do it 
??? but I didn't get my rocks off 
Talkin bout knockin boots, I didn't even get your socks off
Tryin everything inside the book to get you naked
I guess the candlelight dinners and Spinners records didn't make it
But yo, I'm still ringin your bell holdin roses
We might as well been Eskimos in clothes rubbin noses
I woulda gave you stars from out the sky
But soon as I got the pie
Poof - no more Mister Nice Guy

(You bitch)
Bitch you're actin real funny with your pussy
Yeah bitch
No more Mister Nice Guy
Bitch I been waitin for like a fuckin month and a half
Word up baby
No more Mister Nice Guy
What the fuck is the problem?
What's the problem?
Fuck that shit
No more Mister Nice Guy
Fuck you and your pussy
(Bitch)
(Ah yeah)
(What's the matter, you're burning?)

Thinkin bout the times I opened doors and pulled your chair out
But now I got you stressed, lookin a mess pullin your hair out
I used to come and shower you with mad flowers and candies
But all that shit stopped when I got into the panties
Now you're steady beggin me to bang her
I come to bust a nut off of a blow job or fuck you with my finger
Before I got the cunt I was your little rubber-duckie
But now you see me three times a month if you're lucky
I used to buy you clothes as we doze in a pocanose
Now you're gettin called all kinda hoes and a broken nose
Took you out for movies and dinner 
Now I pack a snack and rent a blockbuster tape and run up in ya
Before I woulda done anything to see you nude
Now you ??? hump or gotta nease noff like Ebeneezer Scrooge
It ain't no more pickin you up dressed out in a suit and tie
Bitch, no more Mister Nice Guy

Bitch, I'm tellin you right now
It wasn't all that
Aw fuck you
I don't want it no more
Suck my dick
Fuck your pussy
This stinks

When we first went to bed I used to leave your head spinnin
But now I hit quick and give a speed stick while in it
Yeah, I used flip you like Jack the Ripper the stripper
Now I'm ready to date when I get lipstick on my zipper
Just give me a cut, and all of a sudden
I'm steady (nuttin) (nuttin) right on your shirt buttons
So get a grip as my tip starts to sprinkle
It drips from your lip to your hip to your ankle
And that's for all the times you used to try to play me, baby
My name ain't Miss Daisy, but thanks for the ride, lady
Because you rode me like a hoe inside a rodeo
And now the nitwit is moby dick-whipped like Toby-o
I wish you would light a cigarette that I chain smoke
The only coat i be puttin on is my raincoat
I used to treat the hookers flier than sky high
But now I'm a wise guy, no more Mister Nice Guy

(You bitch)
Now I hope you bitches understand
I tried to tell you bitches
Suck my dick
Suck my dick
Fuck all you bitches 
Fuck y'all
No more Mister Nice Guy
Suck my dick and suck my nipple
Suck all our dicks bitch 
Fuck you

No more Mister Nice Guy
I don't give a fuck no more bitch, now I'm maaaad
No more Mister Nice Guy
Come on, you bitches

Fuck that bitch
I'm really mad now
I'm telling you 
You really got me pissed off
I can't have the pussy no more?
Fuck that bitch
Even if I have to take it
Don't make me take it 
I'm tellin you
(Take that, muthafucka)</pre>
