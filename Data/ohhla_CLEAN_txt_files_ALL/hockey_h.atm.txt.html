You can't imagine how much fun we're having

[Slug]
Stop it there without a care to what you've got to fear
Keep it all betwen your beer and your hockey hair
A lot of weird people traits and ticks
From the strangers to these dangerous faces you kiss
You know this town aint cool as it used to be
When the lion, tigers and bears'd stare at your jewelry
Thruthfully I'm content with how the day moves
Stepped up the game, oops, still rock the same shoes
And one-time with them flashin things, they still
There to turn the drama into action scenes
I'm renting me a vehicle to roll me to the finish line
Follow if you wanna, we'll return around dinner time
Back hurts a little bit more with every cigarette
MY mack learned to never ignore the petty gibberish
I walk the clay cocky like MR. Know-It-Also
Patiently waiting to pop, shake up the soda bottle
Horizontal like a mail-order male whore that came forth
Just to show you his pale horse
Of course the ones that love him hate him most
Heard broken aint nothin man, she look like she ate a ghost
Make a toast to the butterknife, fuck it right
Wonder when my butterfly is gonna kep her flutter tight
I get way lonely when I'm on the j-o-b
And every pretty face actin like they know me
Same story, take photos and blow me
Like suckin on my pony is some type of a fuckin trophy
Don't know what to say homie, I understand under
the notion that mine is at home under another man
Don't even give it two minutes of business
Rotate the shoulderblades and keep them chipless
Built a prison out of conjugal visits
Now I rock a fake grimace on my face to catch the kisses
A bag of pot luck, a pint of gut rot
emcee's is mockduck tofu tough-talk
What the blood clot, jumpshot, fadeaway
Watch these kids eat it up like it was mayonaisse
Then he's on to the next city followin the destiny
Fell asleep droolin on your left titty
Indeed I play my part and call it high art
Keepin my eye on a piece of that pie chart
Smarter than solutions to the rubix cube
Took it apart and then pulled out a tube of superglue
Electric boogaloo, instead of tryin to look at you
I should stay in my house, sit on the couch and read a book or two
Maybe then this space alien can uncover ways to coexist
With other homosapiens
Until that time comes people know my bum steelo
Incognito with mosquitos and dung beetles
It's like that, take your head out of the vaginal crack
Like what the fuck did you expect
