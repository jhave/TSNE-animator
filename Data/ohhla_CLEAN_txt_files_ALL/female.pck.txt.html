[LootPack]
Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good
Hook me up one time and make it feel real good

If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice
Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice

That's right
Yeah you got it good baby

We can hook up anywhere anytime or day
Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say
We treat women with respect like a real lady

[Wildchild]
Now when I lounge around the way I be like asking all of my crew
Is sort of like playin basketball

Hey man do you
crush the jim hat on before I slam dunk to get humped
Best chill before that girl gets spunked

The say you got wild style while giving that girl erection
Wildchild's up in your face always promoting protection

I got this relation wit this girl in my section
Word is bond
Yeah she's my way out so I seek no infection

[Madlib]
Gold digger higgers playing like miss déjà vu
Running round talking bout you use to stay by who

Causing problems but my problem solver is more like a revolver
Lyrically lounge mode
Is like chillin wit my boo

I'm blew wit two hits
Then pass and stay true

Rolling out wit my crew
Back stabbing benefits never hit my way cause I always parlay

Tell the brothers to bust protection in any selection

[Loot Pack]
Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good
Hook me up one time and make it feel real good

If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice
Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice

That's right
Yeah you got it good baby

We can hook up anywhere anytime or day
Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say
We treat women with respect like a real lady

[Madlib]
When Madlib
The bad kid

Only had one selection
Plant my seed and live life with out trife and deceptions

Living out the Cali wild brothers running mad game
Some people flock cause they are all on that fame

But I don't pay it no mind
Get in that gossip

You want to floss it
Head trips is gonna process hectic

Female brains sustain like hexes
Genetics who said it cause I'm like in it to win it

[Wildchild]
We keep it real while brothers try to interpertate lyrical skills
Ninety six get use to a condiment that miracle pill

Those that are not one hundred percent effective my main objective
Is to push forth knowledge in the youth so they stay mad protected

Don't prove me wrong

Unprotection is really not good for your health
The reason you get caught
what you do is cause you carry yourself

Quite unwisely not thinking about your outcome
Loot Pack not teachin but reaching out like Malcolm

[Loot Pack]
Since you got it like that baby doll I got it good
Hook me up one time and make it feel real good

If you make me feel nice not once maybe twice
Dim the lights one time breakout the Alize on ice

That's right
Yeah you got it good baby

We can hook up anywhere anytime or day
Most brotha's try to think of dope lines to say
We treat women with respect like a real lady

got it good baby
