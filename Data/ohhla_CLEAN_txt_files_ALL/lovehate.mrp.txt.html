[Intro]
Only thing I could tell y'all, it ain't like what you think
I'll never speak on my people

[Chorus 4X: Master P]
Same thing make you laugh'll make you cry
They claim that they love you then they hate you at the same time

[Master P]
It's a shame mayne, I can't change mayne
They'd rather see me on the block catch two to the brain mayne
I'm tryin to be here for my son to get bigger
And you ain't real 'less you got a gun and droppin a nigga mayne
I try to change my life, I try to do right
But I feel like a felon on my third strike
Cops pull me over, try to harass me
I seen the R. Kelly tape but these young girls nasty mayne
And the ghetto is infected with AIDS
I've done seen so many young black males on the pave'
Died with they eyes open, leave momma's heart broken
Got that dope in the hood, niggaz still smokin
No education mayne, just inflation mayne
A bunch of ghetto people out here tryin to make it mayne
Niggaz'll test you when they know you a killer
My people livin for the lottery man scratch 'em and peel 'em
Damn

[Chorus]

[Halleluyah]
I pour out liquor for my niggaz who done fell victim
Whether they behind the trigger or the shell hit 'em, listen
I guzzle beers for my brothers that's missin
Whether they in a box or they locked in state prison nigga
Tattooed tears, to represent the day
Of the ones that caught that hot slug to the head mayne
This for my niggaz on the block misled
Who think they gotta hold glocks or cock rocks to cop bread mayne
Listen instead, I think I got a better plan
To bring you a brighter day, make you a better man
Switch the hustle, try to get your mind on
gettin legit in the world, nigga get your grind on
Paper come in other ways, even though crime pays
Put down your 9 my nigga, use your mind today
And you'll see, your paper start to multiply
The same thing that make you laugh, man'll make you cry

[Chorus] </pre>
