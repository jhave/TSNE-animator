Speed of life,fast,it's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass
It's like,jumpin' rope on a razor blade
All lightning quick decisions are made
Lifestyle plush,females rush
This high profile personality,who earns his pay illegally
Professional liar,schoolboys admire
Young girls desire,very few live to retire
Cash flow extreme,dress code supreme,vocabulary obscene
Definition-street player,you know what I mean
  
The high rollers (x2)
  
People of the city,stop foolin' yourself
Crime rules the streets,who the hell else
All the police have gone out to play
Because for enough cold cash they'll look the other way
Just look at the cars as they go by
Benz,Ferraris,trucks up high
Beepers connecting players to big-time deals
With all of this technology who needs to steal
Just live a life of leisure every night and day
And you're livin' proof that crime does pay
Your life is dangerous and reckless
You eat fly guys and girls for breakfast
You're a titan of the nuclear age
Your muscles flex with a Uzi or 12 gauge
And you love the game,that's why you boast
Because you're high priced,high speed.high post
  
You're a high roller
  
High rollers
  
When I say high rollers,I mean the best
Forget the half-steppers,eject the rest
Because these high ranked officials of our city streets
Make millions all triggered by electric beeps
They dress in diamonds and rope chains
They got the blood of SCARFACE runnin' through their veins
Silk shirts,leather suits,hair always fresh
Eelskin boots,large hearts,though their sizes vary
Bankrolls that take 2 pockets to carry
Cruisin' in their 500 Benz Sedan
With their systems peaked out rockin' PUSHER MAM
Yes,their fashion's high and hard to beat
They buy their GUCCI from GUCCI'S not the swapmeet
Eat very weel,much clientele
And whatever you need,they probably sell
  
The high rollers (x2)
  
Oh yes,I'm here to tell you females also roll
Drive the same cars,somethimes wear more gold
Cold as an igloo,or hot as a flame
They'll shake  ya,break ya and you won't know their name
Gangsters to the max,all marks will be taxed
These girls drive FERRARIS not CADILLACS
Respect is demanded,most men don't understand it
Till they peep the huge bank that these girls have landed
They're junkies for fun,love life on the run
And if things get hot,they will pull a gun
Prey on the lame,no shame to the game
And they all seek POWER,fuck the fame
  
The high rollers (x2)
  
Now radio stations probably won't play
This record because of the things I say
They'll say I'm glamorizing the hustlin' hood
And a record like this can do no good
But I'm not here to tell ya right or wrong
I don't know which side of the law you belong
  
Yes,the game has flash,but sometimes hurts
Behind any mistake,hard times lurks
And jail's not your only problem,though it may seem
You just may die by a barrage from an M-16
But to each his own,choose the mobile phone
The tailored suit,the luxury home
You'll never get caught,'cause you got nerves of ice
And you're much smarter than those crooks on Miami Vice
Right
You wanta be a high roller
