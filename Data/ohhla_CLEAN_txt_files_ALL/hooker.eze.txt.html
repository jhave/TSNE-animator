[Eazy-E]
Big titie shitty bang bang sittin' on a dick
tryin' to play a pimp by the fifteen clicks
hoes play with me weekly 
so I'm down wit hoe play with my pee pee
Eazy muthaphukkin' access
saggy baggy ass pants for a happy ass bitch
ho ho ho to the ho and the cloe
ski to the E or a piss in the snow
I take a hoe from the show to the mo' to the flow
to the inches where mo' now the hoe is gotta go
pussy just as hairy as a panda, pink and peppy panther
panty expander, tricks lick long while I lap long hard and fast
while I'm dippin' hunnies ass, throwin' harder with Barbara
seein' sexy with Betsy, gettin' ready for Betty,
I hit the hooker heavy

[Chorus]
I hit the hooker heavy
Ready to.... (x4)

[Eazy-E]
Use a finger to when them real niggas comes to spread'em 
hittin' other peoples bitches so I'm comin' to ya weddin'
head and the bill in the dark I begin with my dick
so you can say I have a head start
comin' from the south of the border, cause I'm shorter
than ya thought I was wife, whore, daughter in the order
fuck all that one man one bitch shit
one condom, one dick, switch
to another after gun with a rubber
you can lick me like a lover wipe your mouth on the cover
I never dilly dally pimpin' Susan and Sally
now you can find the couchie from Miami to Cali
throwin' harder with Barbara
seein' sexy with Betsy, gettin' ready for Betty,
I hit the hooker heavy

[Chorus]
I hit the hooker heavy
Ready to.... (x4)

[Eazy-E]
Bitches comin' with it for doublemint
lookin' for ya homies 
cause the hoes know me like they owe me
I got a strip I hit when I'm lonely
hit a bitch wit a whip and she run like Toby
so never count on me fool when in the true skool
wit truce sluts lookin' for a crew screw
I flip and I flow when they go kinda low
hoe better have my dough so suck silly 
hookers could stay or ya don't touch nuts
really hook a good day
adios disapear like a smoke your rejected 
by a dick thats erect bitch
sometimes I think I'm losin' it a lunatic
with a lot of automatic shit with clips
it ain't no thang to me it's the same ole slang
to me I roll with a long size gang with me
throwin' harder with Barbara
seein' sexy with Betsy, gettin' ready for Betty,
I hit the hooker heavy

[Chorus]
I hit the hooker heavy
Ready to.... (x8)
