[Chorus: Fundisha - repeat 4X]
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Lil' Bow Wow]
Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

[Chorus]

[Lil' Bow Wow]
I got the rock in my hands
Aint no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

[Fabolous]
Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go glass too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They dont know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders wanna sing

[Chorus]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored 63 points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
Didnt give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

[Chorus] - repeat until fade</pre>
