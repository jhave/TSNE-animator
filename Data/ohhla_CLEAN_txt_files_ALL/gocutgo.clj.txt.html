1, 2, 3 'o' clock 4 'o' clock ROCK
5, 6, 7 'o' clock 8 'o' clock ROCK
9, 10, 11 'o' clock 12 'o' clock ROCK
Gonna ROCK (What?) ROCK, ROCK around the clock
Three years ago in St. Albans, Queens 
I was rockin at a park called one eighteen
Little kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot 
Didn't know that years later I'll be standin on top 
Live in Farmers Boulevard I was born in Bayshore
Stopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor  
And this is a story about a brother I know
Cut Creator on the fader no watch him go

[Chorus]
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

[LL Cool J]
When back in the days before I clocked some dough
I used to go to the show and sit in the front row
Hopin and prayin one day I'll get on the road
So I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned
Not fearin a thought, got stung like a horse 
Don't make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss
When his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate
One time for your mind
Check out the guitar break 

[Chorus]
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

[LL Cool J]
This just wasn't hard enough for Jimo Hendrix to sing
He could do lessons of mixin take you under his wing
Straight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for
Ain't no thoughts in the room ain't breakin no roles
And in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big strivin plan 
Just my posse learn the vocals what little they had
It's all about us three: Eve, Phil &amp; Jay
He heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play

[Chorus]
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

[LL Cool J]
Rock, rock y'all check out the funky cut
It's like travellin through time to the straight cats strut 
Cuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife
We'll be do doin the doo for the rest of the lines 
Wanna piece of the action, it's time to party, get up
Not a subway bummy singer puttin change in a cup 
Wanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin up and down
Bitin your livin hold your breath until we come to your town
L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S
Cut Creator cut the record for me 

(Chorus with LL in the background sayin Cut it)
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go

L-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S

(Cut it in background)
Go, go, go, go, ahh, go

(Chorus with LL in the background sayin Cut it)
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go, go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
Go Cut Creator Go
