Verse 1:
Cow will burn ya, I'm taken MC's straight under
And you can't see like Stevie Wonder (ha)
Then the black bull blown like style on the microphone
Throwin' your chromosomes like a cyclone
And commerical raps get the gun claps
A wack on the ground of the head with my ill skill raps
I'm a kill me a crazy motherfucker tonight
Step out the light nocturnal to the night (word 'em up)
Your sight will put you in fright (word) and none of you wanna fight
Cause my game is mad tight aiight
Yo E this might be my last album son (hell no)
Cause niggas trying to play us like crumbs nobodys 
I'm a fuck around and murder everybody
And get crazy buckwild with the shottie
You couldn't see me if you weighed 500 million karrots
Cause I'm sychosymatic

Hook:
Ooh I might lose my lose (x4)

Verse 2:
I'm from the dirtiest stinkiest part of Long Island 
But in every corner of the world my style be wilding
And I'm dead serious even though I may be smiling
I'm conshadier antagonizing character in back of the hoodie
Coming to get you for your goodies
So if your 2-2-4-5 technozzels think y'all can creep
But Keith Murray ain't losing no sleep
I'll man handle and dismantle your mandel down to your thorax
On wax with a bloody axe
But on the real for the real the real I build on Capital Hill
And ill cause of skill
Breakin' shit up with degrees like a Count Crackula 
In fact the factor is compound fractures (uh)
For every action there's a reaction (yeah) 

Hook (x4)

Verse 3:
We are the world! I'm shakin' and bakin' and takin' 
Niggas down to swirls and twirls
I'm runnin' them off the ball like Earl and Pearl (uh)
This is a basic general classic situation
Can't nobody see me in God's creation
I steps it up from inspiring expectation with funk illustrations
You can thunk justifications 
Perhaps you would like me to make the biscuit callap (pow!)
And make your lungs collapse
You represent he represent I represent
The sick bizarre twist is that I torment in my performance (uh)
Kickin' brain twitchin' (yeah) 
My yobic topics, niggas be like "Stop it, you got the illiotics!" (yeah
