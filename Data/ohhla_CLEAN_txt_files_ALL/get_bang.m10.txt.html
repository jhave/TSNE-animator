	 Stay strapped with a sack while niggas watch my back
	 Well nigga get yo bang on

Verse 1: Mack I hear some niggas gotta problem wit the 'Wood (Wassup?)
	 I see the homiez got they straps &amp; they ready in the hood
	 So I'm loadin' up my weapon steppin'
	 callin' up the crew cause ass-whippins we ain't accepting.
	 And I ain't lettin' shit go
	 Niggas got to back up bowdown or get wet up with ammo (blaow)
	 Muthafuckers got to pay
	 run up on 'em like a thief in the night cause I don't play

Mack10:  At night I can't sleep I'm tossin &amp; turnin'
	 So I stray from the yak &amp; smoke sherman
	 Gotta hobble to my leg &amp; the hood's gettin bigger
	 I'm paranoid sleepin with my finger on the trigga
	 and now my bitches stressin that I'm livin wrong
	 Cause I'm fresh out the pen &amp; gettin my serve on (gunshots)
	 It's all about murda when me &amp; Sweepthru roll
	 So fuck da enemies &amp; we dumpin when we see some SO

Chorus   I don't know about you but all I wanna do is get my bang on
	 Stay strapped with a sack while niggas watch my back
	(What you want?) Just wanna get my bang on
	 I don't know about you but all I wanna do is get my bang on
	 Stay strapped with a sack while niggas watch my back
	 It's the life of a G I got to live

Verse 2: Them rocks movin slow on the block
	 Nigga one time hot &amp; we just lost a dope spot(damn)
	 Got me curb servin under pressure
	 I'm so paranoid at night I keep my glock on the dresser
Mack10:  This 187 got my mind under stress
	 cause even clamin' Dub S (W/S) you need a bulletproof vest
	 You know the game nigga when ya Doggin' &amp; Loccin'
	 Kill the 1st thing moving and catch the 1st thing smokin
	 All I wanna hear is buckshots &amp; guts out
	 Niggas gaspin for they breath 
	 that's the type o' shit I'm talkin about(fo sho)
AFT!:	 You niggas cruisin for a bruisin'
	 Hey Mack get ya ammo cock the tool that ya usin'
Mack10:  Til they gone to the back dog
	 Cause when they come thru the 'Wood they betta know how to act dog
	 Connect gang punk, yell a hood out &amp;(WESTSIDE) bust
	 &amp; nigga fuck every click that ain't down with us(fuck em)
	 Fuck em &amp; feed em fish niggas get dismissed
	 Connect Gang bang at the top of the list
