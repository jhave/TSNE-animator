[Intro]
Baby baby I miss you
I need you here with me
My life is incomplete
how I love to see your face
I miss your pretty smile
without you theres no me

Tell me how can I move on show me how to carry on
when you're no longer there
And tell how can I be strong when my happiness is gone
If you're no longer there

(Verse 1)
I close my eyes and let the rain fall from the sky
And wish that I had never ever made you cry
Regardless of what surcumstances be
you kept your word and your promise to always honor me
So what I got's to do to make this up to you
How can I make you feel the love that I still have for you
Did I loose your trust
Did I loose my mind
Did I loose the gift the angel sent me from the sky
I guess that you can say that I kind of went to far
played my selfish little games and only broke your heart
Into a - million pieces when you laid there and cried
And all that I can do is say I'm sorry I lied
Remember when I told you that the day that I die
I want you to be the only one right there by my side
You have been my happiness my best friend my everything
And even though my words mean nothing I love you till the end

(Chorus)

So tell me how can I move on
Show me how to carry on
When you're no longer there
And tell me how can I be strong
When my happiness is gone
If you're no longer there

(Verse 2)
How can I be strong knowing now that your gone
I remenise on the day you used to hold me in your arms
Shed tears every night something I've never done before
The life of a player wasn't worth loosing my girl
Your my world and I need you i'll do anything to see your
Face over again I lost more than just a friend
Till the end I will love you
you will never be replaced
The emptiness inside me living this unhappiness
Tell me how can I move on it's like I'm living a sad song
Just to hear you breathe or the sound of your voice
You were the light in my life I was afraid to let you go
The days go by don't want to live no more
If I could touch you one last time show me a sign I'll be there
I'll hold my head down cause you're no longer there
But I know your in the heavens looking down at me
how could the sweetest girl in the world be taken from me

(Chorus)
So baby baby I miss you
I need you here with me
My life is incomplete
how I love to see your face
I miss your pretty smile
without you theres no me

Tell me how can I move on show me how to carry on
when you're no longer there
And tell how can I be strong
when my happiness is gone
If you're no longer there</pre>
