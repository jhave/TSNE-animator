We'll like to welcome y'all back to the club
I'm your host this evening, Mr. Tadah!
Ya dig, club Toe Jam, is once again off the hook
For ladies night, ya dig, everynight
Right now, we would like to bring something very special for you
Check it out

[Nate Dogg]
Oooooooooooooooh
I like them girls with the tight black skin, dark and fine
Thats the kind of girl I wanna play with tonight
I wanna do some nasty thangs, wanna make her scream my name
I like the girls that don't say, "what?," know that she fine
Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime
Put her on platinum chains, got her own cash and things
I like them girls, their sassy ways, sassy ways
Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

[Snoop Dogg]
Why you so cute, why you so big
Why you bullshitin', come and deal with a pimp
Put your bags in the trunk, holla at your boy
You can spend the night, we at the Elroy
Doing things that we shouldn't, couldn't
Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, whats goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

[Warren G]
See I rock baby, nonstop baby
Warren G baby, shake that thang lady
I see you picky lady, you be tweaking lady
Pulling that '38 snub out your stock end baby
You put the G in the dub, we hot fuckin' in the tub
I ain't trippin' off baby, so why you trippin' off cuz
I'm trying to get my money right
So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right
What the fuck is up, you messing with a G
Warren to the L to the B and the C
Regulate get cocked and be original
The game don't wait for female individuals

So what you saying, you trippin' off my homeboy
We ride like that, you know what I'm sayin'
Hey baby, just take the grabic

[Nate Dogg]
