Cuz I need a man
S'alright, yeah, oh

Deidra "Spinderella" Roper:

Hold up, wait, let me get this straight
You want your cake and eat it
Brother, you can beat it, uh
Unless you're willing to drown me in passion
Romance the cat, better make it last (Forever)
Ain't lookin' for no quickies
Brothers be like Tricky
Tryin' to get me, hit me, and run, but me I'm picky
I like it sentimental
Stimulate the mentals, I
I like a gentle man, with a gentle hand
I want the baby carriage
And the marriage and the whole thing
Diamond ring, treat you like a king
I'll be your queen bee
Better keep it real with me
Or the be the ex-man, I'm with the next man

Chorus:

If you're lookin' for do you right
Hold me tight lover
I'll do anything you want me to do
I need you to do me right
Hold me tight, brother
Baby, all I've got is all for you

Sandra "Pepa" Denton:

You call yourself the best
When you put hickeys on my chest
Nevertheless, I'm not impressed, I want the rest
I'm talkin' 'bout the quan baby, the vagabond
I got it goin' on, that's right, that's how I see it
So what you got the cheese
Brother, I'm not pleased
Want the striptease (Take it to another level, uh)
You'll be a homely lover, friend, sexy pushin' my Benz
Dividends stacked, you got it
By the way, don't bother me
Unless you are attracted to the God in me
Pardon me to talk to, borish
Shit is tired, and you'll be fired
If you can't have one, can't have none son

Chorus

Call on me (Call on me)
When you need me (When you need me)
I need a man (I'll be your man)
That can please me (Oh yeah)
In the middle of the night (In the middle of the night)
Hold me tight (Hold you tight)
I'll do it right, if ya, bring me right

Cheryl "Salt" James:

You put me onto the next level
Fool don't be trippin'
Your whip-appeal hit me in my heart, skippin'
Your ways got me singing your praise with the next phase
I count the days, you're so amazin', I'm cravin' your skills
My temperature's blazin', show me how it feels, uh-huh
I'm savin', my secret sauce for the course (That's right)
You gotta hit me off with that God kinda love
That work it out through the hard times kinda love
You know how I broke it
In the Lexus, the Benz coupe
Yesterday, I should never leave you or deceive you
Uh-huh, I wanna please you
