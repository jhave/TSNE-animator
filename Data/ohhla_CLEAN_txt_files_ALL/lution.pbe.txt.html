Hear the beat go
It's a bird, a plane, and the sound remains the same

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap (Revolverlution)
Brothas gotta rap (Hear the beat go, revolverlution)

Here I am, Superman again
Cause you know damn well I'll never be the man again
Here I go, on upload, stand up and watch the game unfold
3 minutes to download
Revolverlution, make your brains explode
When understanding, knowledge, wisdom
Love, elevation and and activism
Let's call it raptivism
Since a lot of MCs be stuck on isms
As in sexism, self hate racism
Why many cats end up stuck in prison
Youth slavery is what you see and
Is what you be mentality
Beyond reality a fantasy
But that fantasy is kilin me
I don't give a damn if you bounce to this
I don't give a damn if you shake to this
But I give a damn that you overstand
Revolverlution, the Rap Superman

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap

Revolverlution, The final frontier
And I'm outta here
Have no fear some of these rhymes wear a cape
But the record don't fit on a stack of Bushshit
Sick and tired of bein sick and tired
If what you want is what you need
If you can see yourself beyond the weed
Pappa bringin on a new breed of MCs
You know what? Wooo wheee!
Face it, tell me why ex-fans be hatin
The present state of the hip hop nation
Maybe it's your president of the corporation
Is why we in this situation
Some is dumb, double up the drums
Hear the beat go..
Watch em all come
Damn! Revolverlution
You know who? The Rap Superman

Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Brothas gotta rap
Hear the beat go!
Let the brothas rap!
Let the brothas rap!
Let the brothas rap!

Double up the drums

The Rap Superman, cut off the program
Raised the whole fam
Now that sounds hot, I stopped the robots
Children of the gone who the grown forgot
Lost and then found ex lovers of hip hop
Who watched another artform gone to rot
Beyond the bushes I save a lot
Under the underground sound of hip hop
And even if this joint gets hot
You'll still never ever know what I got
Revolverlution all up in this spot
Now the rubber hits the road
Broke the motherload
Download! And hear the beat go...

Hear the beat go!
Hear the beat go!</pre>
