[Intro] [Phonte talking]
And small children will gather round and tell stories to their parents.
About tales of the great Phontigalonius, Sean Boogalonius and Joseph
Wellington Scudowski over tracks applied by Khrisies. We'll make it hot.
We'll make it hot. We'll make it roaring hot!

[Verse One] [Phonte]
Ain't a motherfucker out there say I ain't spittin'
Say me and my whole team in NC ain't livin'
Say we ain't drivin'
So don't push me dawg, your style is pussy dawg
Believe me, I ain't kiddin'/kitten
Hip hop's most elusive figure
Phonte's the one 
That'll shoot the trigger and have your troops delivered
In body bags
Cause your rhymes loosin' nigga
You couldn't make the crowd just to a conclusion nigga
So what's your fascination?
I'd break it down but I don't have the patience
You have to face it
Your raps lack imagination
You need to make life a part of your skills
Or else you'll be a martyr for real
And make publishin' a part of your deal
Cause lightening won't strike the same place twice
But God damn poverty will
And you can rhyme like Nas or rhyme like Pras
Won't matter cause it still won't knock like ours

[Chorus]
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We don't stop for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
Take it to the top for 'em

[Verse Two] [Sean Boog]
I'm a Gillette Razor, live close to the edge
Mind's up in cloud nine, spit over your head
Bought a pillow case once for sleepin' on the industry
Told the judge I was just goin' to bed
I'll toast you for bread, flows buttery smooth
Wanna be's come at me like stuttering fools
Other words absurd, push my buttons and nerves
Hungry man, understand, a glutton with words
Sick of payin' dues, this rhyme is gonna aim at you (BOW!)
Take your rings, double burger and your pager too
O-Dog, you think I'm playin' with you?
I'm just a Menace II rhyme, doin' what I came to do
A no brainer, a simple tad really
Cause most of these rap cats just act silly
The game's ours
And I promise you this
Cause ain't a team alive that make it hotter than this

[Chorus]
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We don't stop for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
We make it hot for 'em
"Make it hot"
Joe Scudda on the mic, let's rock for 'em

[Verse Three] [Joe Scudda]
Rappers is a dime a dozen
See me shinin' cousin
Rhymes hot like I carry lines in ovens
Baking at 350 and always had beef on my plate
Ask yourself if you really want beef with me
So
Bring your fam and your fellow crews
Fuckin' with me, you're gettin' more than your elbow bruised
Thinkin' more like I.C.U.
Cause that tough guy image you portray is something I see through
Straight to the Bitch In Yoo
And I ain't talkin' bout Common or Cube
Cause there ain't no common in dude
If I feel I got drama with you
You gonna need more patchin' up then your baby momma can do
I'm more bang for your buck buddy
Bet your bottom dollar
It's the kid from the bottom holla
We got 'em
Tell me do you follow?
And if not, I guarantee I split your head like an alvacada
What?

[Chorus] [Joe Scudda]
"Make it hot"
From college kids to thugs
We make it hot for 'em
For cats that do drugs
We make it hot for 'em
For chicks that love Joe
We make it hot for 'em
Shakin' they ass for doe
We make it hot for 'em
For cats with no heat
We make it hot for 'em
For those that sleepin the street
We make it hot for 'em
Even for the cats on the block
We make it hot for 'em
A middle finger for the cops
We make it hot for 'em</pre>
