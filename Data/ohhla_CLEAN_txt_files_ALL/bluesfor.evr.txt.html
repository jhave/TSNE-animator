Blues for Christmas
Baby I ain't got a dime
Blues for Christmas
Baby I ain't got a friggin' dime
I'm just ain't and they're wasted
I hang my head down baby, I'm cryin'
Baby I'm cryin'

Santa Claus
Bring my baby back on home
See I ain't got a lot of money
But my baby, she's rich enough for us both

Blues for Christmas
I'm as blue as I can be
Blues for Christmas
Baby I'm as blue as I can be

I'm just sittin' here drinkin'
Trying to drink my baby back to me
Trying to drink my baby back

Santa Claus
Bring my baby back on home
Blues for Christmas
Ain't no time to be home all alone
I can't lose these Christmas blues
Baby I just can't seem to shake 'em
Held so many arms
All I seem to do is break 'em
Yeah, break 'em
I said I break 'em baby</pre>
