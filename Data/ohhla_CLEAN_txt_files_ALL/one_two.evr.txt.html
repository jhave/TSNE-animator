[Everlast]
Yeah, yeah, two-thousand, zero, zero
The party just started, ha-ha, ha-ha
Everlast, Kurupt, Fredwreck, Kurupt
goes somethin' like this

(Chorus)
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do

[Everlast]
Sticker man tryin' to feed his baby
Drug dealer tryin' to raise his son
Every pimp gotta dress his lady
Come on now you ain't the only one

(Chorus)
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do

[Kurupt]
Now this is the combination of intervention
That just might open up a new dimension
I can tell, the well, just might run dry
Loss some tension of thoughts, modify and simplify

(Chorus)
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do

[Kurupt]
I said life, blast, present to the past
Hard rapper the war path
War path Kurupt young Gotti
Incredibly clever, mack auther with Everlast it's true
Do what you wanna do, one, two

[Everlast]
Mary Jane wanna run smoke reefer
Little Ricky's out sniffin' rock
Cynthia, she's at the disco coked out
Doesn't matter what drugs you on

(Chorus)
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
It go one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do

[Kurupt]
Game, growth, life by oath
The gifted, different toast
Talent, the mellowdramatic
violent life in silence but this here's mine
Crystal clear ???

(Chorus)
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
The good Lord knows just what you've been through
I say one, two, one-two-one-two
Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do</pre>
