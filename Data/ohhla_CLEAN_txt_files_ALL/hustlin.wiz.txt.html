Typed by: AZ Lyrics

If I said it I meant it nigga...

We all in

Hahaha everything's taylord

And fuck it we ain't got to go to the store no more
Got my own papers baby girl, feelin get my own weed too
Get you a pound let you roll that shit

Uh, I'm rollin up the windows while I'm smokin weed
Drivin through my town like I don't know the speed
Countin so much paper I can't fold it up
Bad bitch, she suck me while I'm rollin up
Ya bitch, you probably see me everywhere
Money long now my house got tv's everywhere
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat screen
New bitch, look nothing like my last fling
Ridin in the maserati nigga no shirt
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it wont work
Camo shorts on like a general
Mind on a mill, blowin on medicinal

I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnnnnn, yeahhh
Hustlinnnnn, yeahhhhhhh
[repeat 2x]

Been through every nigga town never had a problem
Young millionaire, never had a job though
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground
As long as your money up she said its goin down
Brought her home girl, said that she don't do friends
Kick the bitch out and make her find new friends
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims
745 for a new benz
I take everyday and live like its the weekend
Doin it all if you ain't ballin take a seat then
If I said it I meant, throw a stack at that bitch ass
Let her pay her rent with it

I'm just a young nigga hustlinnnn, yeahhhh
Hustlinnn, yeahhhh
