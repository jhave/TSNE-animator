[Intro: Makeba Mooncycle]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Makeba Mooncycle]
I'm just a queen, living in this valley of kings
I bust shots at fiends, and live by any means
Bling bling, I step on hoes with open toes
When I move through the flow, you should move to the dough
You a snitch of the sort, wanted like an outlaw
Just view my lyrics, watch this Earth go round
No one infiltrates, I hold my kingdom down
Catch me at the rooftop, busting shots in the sky
On the brink of greatness, I'm ready to fly
You know, freedom or death, you know, justice no peace
We just, deal with mad shit and watch problems increase
Maintaining through it all, the rise and the fall
The make-ups, the break-ups, the crashes and shake-ups
The goings and comings, I rule through the end
Everyone has enemies, I have very few friends
It's the, strength in my brain, I try to refrain
Tell the truth, in all matters, my rhymes remain phatter
You're a mistake and a foul, like if my barn in my vowel
Stroll with my miles, see the strength in my prowl
You know the Moon rises, when the sun needs to rest
Always out for power, even in a crest
You got X like the Files, awaiting new trials
Tribulations, sensations, I rise up for nations
Queen of the world, the oyster's pearl
You know Ms. Mooncycle's not an ordinary girl...
You know, you know, you know, you gotta... "oooh"
I make competition... "get away" </pre>
