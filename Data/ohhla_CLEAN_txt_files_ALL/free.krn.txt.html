[Intro]
Uuuuuuuh man time to wake up, man I feel good today
today is gonna be a good day
man what everybody standin' around me for, what y'all standin' around me for?
sup y'all can't hear me or somthin, y'all ignorin' me?
what up I'm feelin' like I'm floatin' or somethin', man what's the deal?
E He He....
I know it ain't what I think it is.... O - Ou

[Verse 1]
My soul's released, now I'm floatin' above my body lookin down
Watchin' tears droppin on me as my family stands around
My bedside, feelin' pain but I'm not sufferin in the least
Wishin' somehow I could let them know that finally I'm at peace
My momma's cryin, hate to see that, cuz she wishin God would've chose her
I never called like I was supposed to, man I wish we could've been closer
But it's too late, I'm about to see if there's a life after
Cuz the last page just ended in my books final chapter
But I'm free and I ain't feelin no more stress 'n' tension
Wishin for a time extension, but it's calm in this dimension
In the world I felt confusion, drama, heartache, and depression
Contradiction, pain, affliction, attitude, hate, and aggression
But I sold my stock on all that when I took my last breath
Ain't it strange how the value of life is taught the best by death
And I was finished, envision K-Rino's apparition, arisen
My spirit did its time, now it's lifted from lifes' prison
Now I'm Free

[Chorus]
Free like the wind
Free to fly like a bird till I'm born once again
I'm free
Like the sun, like the rain
From this world, from my foes, no more tears, no more pain

[Verse 2]
I travel out the hospital room back into my old hood
Not even mad at the ones that hated me, glad to see that the livin good
I see these young boys and young girls fried out and drank sippin
And I'm trippin, cuz I ain't even tried to warn 'em when I was livin
I had knowledge of self, I knew better, ("WHAT WAS YOUR EXCUSE?")
I remember wantin to teach 'em all, then thinkin what's the use
They'll never listen, they hard headed, walkin around in a trance
Had a chance to make a difference, but now they blood is on my hands
When I was on the planet I took people and life for granted
Life is prescious, time is short, I had to die to understand it
Now I'm ready to try and help, but when I speak now they ignore me
And I'm sufferin the same fate that many others suffered before me
I'm supposed to be relaxed, but man the guilt is still lurking
I try to zoom back in my body and make it move but it ain't workin
I seen my lil partner get blasted, never thought that it could be
Wish somehow I could have saved him, now he gone just like me
But we Free

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now I've been traveling for hours and I ain't seen no white light
And I ain't lookin for one either, I'm just floatin through the night
My girlfriend, I watch her break down as I hover above her
Eventhough I barely told her, I'm hopin she knowin that I loved her
Did her wrong a million times, now I'm wishin that I can kiss ya
And tell you all the things I never said when I was witcha
Now picture the whole scene change and I'm consumed
By two dark spirits walkin me into a pitch black room
They show me the future and how things can change in an instance
And I'm sad to see no traces of my existence in the distance
True enough my family love me, still got picture up at home
But time heals, the pain is gone, and everybody done moved on
Even my gal found somebody else, she done made it through the worst step
My homeboys think about me, but it ain't like when I first left
That's when I realized what life's about through all the suffering
I was there to leave a mark, ("WHAT DID YOU LEAVE K-RINO?") Nothing!
I'm Free

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
