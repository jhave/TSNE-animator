(*talking*)
Much more important, than the pain we suffer
Is our response to the pain, I'ma let y'all hear
Both sides of the story, who's side are you on

[Yung Ro]
Say where I'm from the days are cold, nights are colder
The streets on fire, keep me talking to the two sitting on my shoulder
(before you leave grab them gats), so I turned back
And seconds before I hit 360, (son you don't wanna do that)
But the last voice spoke calm, so I here I stand gat in my palm
But the other began to speak louder, (what are you waiting for come on)
And to be honest I chose the aggressive voice, it was easy
Followed any road he choose no matter the risk, wherever he lead me
(they want you dead), so I was paranoid so scared to go to sleep
(you see I'm watching you), riding through the city mad at the world invented my creep
Seen a familiar face at the club one night, just trying to have a drink
Then he bumped me and a voice yelled (shoot), before I could even think
And then I fell to the floor, shot in the chest
Together we layed on the floor, felt funny when our eyes connect
I saw the pain in his eyes, so I searched for that other voice fast
Embarrassed to ask for mercy or help, and heard the other voice laugh

(*talking in background*)
How do I ease the pain, when I know the devil coming back
You know, they say war's inevitable, which is why it is essential
That we study it, and equip thy selves with the right tools to fight
So grant me the serenity, to accept the names I cannot change
Courage to change the thangs that I can, the wisdom to know the difference

[Hook - 2x]
How can I, ease the pain
When I know you coming after me
How can I, ease the pain oooh

[Yung Ro]
Dear Father, I'm having problems controlling myself
Rather talk to you nobody understands, so I roll by myself
On this road by myself, but never neglecting those two footprints
Cause when I was lost and fell behind, look where Jesus went
Right in the front and I love him for that, and not to mention
We been chopping some game up, he helping me trying to get it back
You know love that is, cause I admit I'm running low
Trying to ease this pain on my own way, ha that I know
Foolish of me right, (no son you're human and humans make mistakes)
But ain't I responsible for my actions, and which road I take
(you're being too hard on yourself son, remember you were born in sin)
I know but I'm ashamed for being weak, and letting the devil always win
(he only wins when you give up), man I ain't gave up
Got a few scars and suffered some pain, but ay I'm a soldier I play it tough
(well raise up) man I'm up, (son be proud of who you are)
What about my depression and in securities, (they're not the truth by far)
And I believe that and I need that in my life, just like that Juve song
But I weave back cause they feed that negativity, yeah they do me wrong
(son you know the weight of this road), yeah you right let me stop complaining
(you have my mercy if you need it), man Lord it get hard but I'm just saying
I'm a man (but a child of mine), so I praise you
And try my best to make you proud, what I owe you is more than I gave you
But I'm trying to get paid too, in this crooked bidness that's full of snakes
Don't know what the future hold so lately your boy, ain't been feeling great
Now what can I do to stop this pain, I took a look at the sky
Asked for forgiveness and felt the ease, just as soon as I apologized

[Hook - 2x]

Pain, suffering ha, or is it just discipline from God
Many try to find out the difference, who is the author of suffering</pre>
