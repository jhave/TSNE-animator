[Drake]
I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin the consequence
Drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin in and out of consciousness
And they sayin I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
Nooo, don't do it, please don't do it
Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just somethin they know

[Chorus: Drake]
They know, they know, they know {*3X*}
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now that's somethin they know
They know, they know, they know

[Drake]
Yeah, I be yellin out money over everything, money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it they'll be ooooover you
That new shit that you got is ooooover-due
You better do what you suppooooosed to do
I'm like "Why it gotta be all that?" But still I can't deny the fact
that it's, true, listen to you expressin all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggaz sound like +All My Children+
And that's who you thinkin is 'bout to come and make a killin
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it; I ain't even gotta say it
They know

[Chorus]

[Outro: Drake]
I be yellin out money over everything, money on my mind
Mind, mind mind
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time
Time, time time
They know...

They know, they know, they know {*3X*}
Yeah... {*echoes*}</pre>
