[Verse One] [Eligh]
To the end of the road and back
Me and my friend came in
Shit get's odd when you livin' in sin
Knockin' at the back door and not gettin' in
I'm a ragin' buffalo black
Whirlwind rider, leather saddle, ready for battlin' any instinct
Brought myself to an infant 
So I can leave that proper imprint 
Imprint is so fly 
So different and so shy
Everybody gifted but so dry
I'm tryin' to bring that rain to roll
That thought to get you by
We high off life in the best way
Transitioning over the airwaves, right in front of your eyes
We best play over two fifteens or essays
Grow within you things that press play
My dunes been cocooned and now breath throughout my resume
Reservoir dog barkin' in the back lot
Tryin' to get unchained and hop the fence
Like that chain of command to get to that higher plain of consciousness
Consequence of stagnation
Sittin', rot in damnation
What is a man without some change
Bummin' the street with himself to blame
Empty pockets, empty brain
I'm sick with God my Midi mane
Forever eyes so simple plain

[Chorus] [x2]
A simple plan for life is change
Find yourself the nicest frame
Strange
Then you see the light, man
Then you find the right, lane
On a bright, day

[Verse Two] [The Grouch]
And as I write to this tune
My babies five months growin' in the womb
There's a population boom goin' on
There's a planetary shift you can hear it in this song
They try to heal it then cut it
Heal it then cut it
Heal it then cut it
Don't cut it again
If you feel it then love it
If you feel it then love it
If you feel it, love it my friend
It's right in front of us
Each and every one of us
Freedom or death, yes the two are antonymous
Symphonic just hearin' good news
I keep my ears open and stare to the moon
I know there's more than hope when I put out the feelers
We all want the same things, when we're bein' our realest
Collective consciousness, let's form a village
Then spread good feelings till there ain't no more killers
And I apologize if I didn't always rise
To occasion
Had to come of age and apply
My knowledge to my personal experiences
If I didn't I could have died in all seriousness
We've come far y'all
As a person as a people as a world
It's time to raise the bar
It's not hard just remember who you are
It's not just remember, remember

[Chorus] [x2]
A simple plan for life is change
Find yourself the nicest frame
Strange
Then you see the light, man
Then you find the right, lane
On a bright, day

[Chorus] [x2]
A simple plan for life is change
Find yourself the nicest frame
Strange
Then you see the light, man
Then you find the right, lane
On a bright, day</pre>
