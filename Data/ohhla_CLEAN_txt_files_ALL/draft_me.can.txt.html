*female newsreporter talking*

"Also the, hearing from the defense department that they launched
 some fifty Tomahawk cruise missiles
 Not only from ahh US ships but also from British
 submarines in the area"

[Chorus: 2x]
Draft me! I wanna fight for my country
Jump in a humvee and murder those monkeys!
Draft me! I'm too dedicated to fail
Justice must prevail (Justice must prevail!)

[Canibus]
Yo, I wanna get drafted, I wanna see somebody get they ass kicked
with standard military tactics
Fuck brass knuckles, I'll punch you with brass fists
Totally flowin with my emotions in my moment of madness
I'll wake up the whole barracks, murder you on your matress
And look at you like, "What's the matter?"
You better go back to your bed, before I have to act up
You might be the next one to get ripped you jacker!
You better not tell the captain
I might accidentally shoot you with the mack 10 at target practice
Runnin through the obstacle course, up and across
Over the logs, five more, damn soldier you strong
Come on, I wanna be agile and docile
Break ya legs like popsicle sticks, put you in a hospital
Stand over top of you, put a pillow over your nostrils
and just feel so sorrowful
It doesn't make me feel powerful, it's just a parable
It's just a rhyme really none of this is tangible
So don't ask me about it, I won't get angry at you
And before I get angry, I just won't answer you
You better go get in shape or lift some weights nigga
Cuz next time I see you I'ma be a ape nigga
Lemme find out you still callin out my name
I'll crash into your tourbus with a plane nigga

[Chorus: 2x]

[??]
Fuckin with my freedom, leave a muh'fucker bleedin
Leave 'em in pain like a infant when he teethin
It's huntin season, and ya loved ones grievin
Cuz I never back up (no sir) I never back down
Ask Brown (Ha!) From the bell to the last round
Face down, dick in the dirt, hit 'em where it hurt
Make the enemy my lil' bitch in a skirt
Cuz when it rained it poured, this ain't a game it's war
One goal, one aim son, same as yours
Alotta pain to endure, terrain to explore
And I'ma hold my weapon right cuz I was trained in the Corp
You don't want no trouble, whole city reduced to rubble
And we gon' make it happen, quick, fast, and on the double
Draft me!

[??]
So y'all best go get y'all shuffles!
(Draft me) The situation's gettin ugly
So who better butt me, and put to sleep the enemy
Draft me, pass me, the M-16
Give me a buzz cut, ask me if I give a fuck
I'm comin out blastin, military four-fashion
Twelve close castin, for weapons of mass-distraction
Outlastin, all the privates in my company
Fightin for my family, and the cats that grew up with me
My Band of Brothers, rarely just smother the enemy
Razor blades cut ya face and leave a scar so you remember me
Lurkin, to leave y'all with bloody red turbans
Screamin "Jihad!" while y'all pray to a false god
We ready for, all out war, it's time to settle the score
Grab a .44 and dump into nigga's door
Draft me, you ain't even gotta ask me, I'm ready
With the Rambo machete, using tactics that's deadly
Draft me, I swear to God, we ready for the Taliban
Drop the bomb, and huddle with some nuclear laws, come on!

[Chorus: 2x]

[Canibus (as Stan)]
Truthfully, I wouldn't wanna go to war if they asked me
I'd rather puff hashies and talk about headies and Lassie
I was just sayin to Canibus last week
I heard a record called Channel 0 that was mad deep
When I'm overseas I can't eat, the food is nasty
Bis has a seafood fancy, I'm allergic to crabby
G'head draft me, your all in my new family
I'll have a good time wavin gats at the ???
If I get hit, one of the team'll carry me
So g'head draft me, g'head draft me

[Chorus: 2x]
