[Scarface]
I'm just another ghetto boy
Single parent upbringing, mama's pride and joy
Dad died 'fore I got a chance to meet that dude
So I was raised in the hood, in the streets I grew
Seen it all, it ain't too much I ain't done yet
Let my nuts hang, nigga I ain't scared of shit
Seen death in my eyes, musta not have been time
Cause I'm the last of this motherfuckin breed of mine
Yeah and can't nobody tell you no different
The nerve of this motherfucker sayin I'm tripping
The nerve of you motherfuckers questionin this
When I'm as real as a realass nigga can get
And I was raised with that g-code imbedded in my blood
And I would rather die than tell on a nigga from my hood
Or tell it on a motherfucker period
I take the code to the game that serious
The streets got rules, it's certain shit you don't do like
Sayin it was me when you knowin that it was you
It's not defamation if what I'm sayin is true
Picked a fight, got beat, now this pussy is tryin to sue
Bitch, you knowin what the outcome was
Fuck with one fuck with all, we were bound by blood
Not the blood of the gang but the blood of James
It's out of love for this nigga we pump slugs in frames
That's the type of dude you're listenin to
Soft to you for a minute then I'm trippin with you
And since you want it with me I'll position them goons
They carry out the order to this mission and boom
Ya out, now what was all this chit-chat about?
A word from the wise, keep my dick out ya mouth
Apparently I been too lenient on dudes
Cause you niggas done forgot who the streets belong to
I'm the motherfuckin king, I'm the motherfuckin mayor
I'm the president, the don, the boss of all players
Remember me, the one you got your idea from?
Well I'm still here, planted on this block I slung
So fresh and so clean, complicated rhyme schemes
You niggas is monotone, ain't no fuckin with heat
I'm a motherfuckin g and if I'm lyin then poof
May the Lord strike me dead in this motherfuckin booth
I'm the truth, emeritus, the F-A-C
The M to the O to the motherfuckin B
OG, to the critics analyzing my shit
Thinkin so-and-so is better, you can suck my dick
Cause it's been 20 years and counting and I still ain't bouncing
Fuck the club I'm a true thug, the realest nigga out here
Yeah I listen to them bullshit caps
Or how they so-called shine but that bullshit's wack
Steady on my grind and when I pull this strap
I'ma show you what I mean by "These fools just rap"
Cause I'm just as greedy as the next man is
I see em sellin and then I'ma feed my kids
And it is what it is, you can take it how you want it
Motherfuck who I offend they can meet me on the corner
It don't matter who you is or where you come from punk
When you see me that's the motherfuckin bell, bitch, jump
Cause I'm tired of you niggas disrespecting the great
I am legend, it ain't nobody fuckin with Face
My catalog's timeless
I could go on for days and days
Let me count the ways I got paid
It's over when I leave this stage
I'ma turn the page, say goodbye to Face
