G'eah mayn, this one here
For you niggaz, always in a nigga shit mayn
Always trying to peep, what a nigga got
Me myself, I'm a man of few words
I don't say, too much shit
So that's why, I got that self explanatory shit
That shit that's just g'eah, speak for itself

[Yung Ro]
Ay when I spit they like g'eah mayn, that nigga yeah mayn
He real he just spitting that whoa, I'm like g'eah mayn
Now look at here mayn, I really don't care mayn
Maybe cause down here mayn, we trill and let our g'eah hang
You can feel the blanks, if you peeping field of blanks
But if you ain't real you can't, you a shotgun but filled with blanks
You too eager son, ay take it easy son
Watch how I bring the bread home, get full just leave me one
Cause that's all I need, ay I'm a hustler poppy
Two steps ahead of you, I'll thank you plus your muscles sloppy
Maybe that's why Ro so cocky, life is a hustle copy
Don't believe set a trend, watch how you hustlers copy
That's why I hustle properly, grind hard and clutch it softly
Cause you never know it could g'eah, now did you busters copy
Hold up shh hush he's cocky, I mean Chamillionaire
I'm in my Nobody attire, he in Chamillion-wear
That's du-rags Air Forces, white T's Dickies
Ay let's wipe these rookies down, g'eah freeze pussies
I sell you game sell you dope, off of services
I sell a bitch a dream, and have her offering services
Ahh fa sho it is, going down daddy's sure
Locked your girl like daddy's yours, how crunk with a fatty girl
She be getting mad at your boy, and I be like damn it girl
Confusion can't stand it girl, catch this back handers yeah
Don't let me lose you man, the mission's not to lose you man
Add flame with my movements man, body language move the hands
Look I got more expenses, grinding can't ignore the tension
Inside on life not 3D, more like a four dimension
Wait I got more just listen, it's nothing to score with bitches
Let em get comfortable, you'll see their whore intentions
Throwback jersey no, that's a gimmick I'm authentic
Hat tilted back tilted, like g'eah g'eah g'eah
Rap switching style switch em, style switching so rap getting
Very interesting, competitive look I'll get ya
I'll hit ya like halls hit ya, praise you down crawl with ya
Then you know what's coming next, g'eah I'm like aww did ya
Hurt yourself, trying to run with them big ones
Cause we got them big guns, g'eah who wanna get some
I got a lot to give, a couple shots to give
Blocka-blocka g'eah, get off me got a lot to live
Thoed, ay Ro yo flows
G'eah I'm like g'eah, motherfucker I know

[Hook - 2x]
My style is like g'eah, my clothes are like g'eah
My do' is like g'eah, I'm the realest in here
Show it off like g'eah, play with em like g'eah
It's easy it's lightweight, holla back daddy g'eah

[Yung Ro]
Say daddy get your stunting up, you tripping with that cheap shit
Too many rappers wearing grills anyway, you can keep it
Peep this I'm hot, you can see it in clear view
Pain the movie starring Yung Ro, in a theater near you
Ay plus I fuck hoes, they say I'm some'ing like a hero
I be stroking they be moaning, it do some'ing to my ego g'eah
I'm the man son, shorty like man son
I play her like basketball, crossover fade and one
You will never peep me man, orthodox structured well
I'll leave you like what the hell, then I'm in the wind like fuck you g'eah
Fuck the jail fuck the laws, fuck your bullshit indictment
No warrants give me my license, snatch it like g'eah nigga
We on Homes Road, racing bikes I'm daring niggaz
Popping wheelies in the air nigga, stunting like g'eah nigga
Source Awards, they voting who tight us
We go to the mic trophy, Koopa holding it like g'eah nigga
After party mami dancing, I'm like you go girl
She trying to make it stand up, my hands up like g'eah nigga
Life is good, this is balling at it's finest moment
Nobody piece with the diamonds on it, flashing like g'eah nigga

[Hook - 2x]
