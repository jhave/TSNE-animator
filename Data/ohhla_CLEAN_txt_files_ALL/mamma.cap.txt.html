"What ya said to me.. about me"
"What ya said to me.. said to me.. said so much you just.."

[Cappadonna]
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you For helping me write this dart
And if it wasn't for you ma' would've never had a start
You taught how to read
Taught me how to take my time and never speed
Taught me how to hold my neck back when my nose bleed
I love you Mamma, espescially for the fact
that you ain't have to take my shit
While I was in the streets, whylin' out, jugglin' bricks
Hustlin', sellin' crack, catchin' 'em vicks
I love you Mamma, cuz in the Bricks
that's just how it gets

[Hook: Cappadonna]
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you for helping me write my dart
I really miss you and I just wanted you to know that
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you for helping me write my dart
I really miss you and I just wanted you to know that

[Cappadonna]
Mamma what you said to me, yeah, that's what's up
You taught me how to keep shit real and when my gun bust
Keep it low, keep on the go
Just incase keep peepin' the Po
Mamma loco, yeah kid yeah that's my true nigga
I beat ya ass for actin' up know what to do nigga
My moms and your moms might've went to school nigga
When Pops left Moms was the disciplinary
She taught me how to love them women and pop they cherry
Take money, cut time and stab Jerry
Plus I remember what you said to me
Mamma and I don't have to worry
Dear Mamma, after work meet me at the Ferry

[Hook: Cappadonna]
Dear Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart
I wanna thank you for helping me write my dart
I really miss you And I just wanted you to know that
Mamma what you said to me it really touched my heart

[Cappadonna]
You know I love you Mamma jJust because you my true team
You rose me as a real King somethin' for the Queen
That's why I always stay focused, keep my nose clean
Watch over my family, whoever intervene
Fuck all y'all niggaz, tryin' to stop my dream
Block my cream, Mamma I'll pop my steam
Just how you taught me, Mamma bail me out
Jakes still caught me, Thank you Mamma, I'll make a lil' coffee
The things that you said to me, it hit my mind softly
You a strong woman, and Mamma won't abort me
We used to live in Brooklyn, but you SI New York'ed me

[Hook: Cappadonna *Cappadonna ad-libs too*]

I really miss you and I just wanted you to know that
Mamma I'm really missing you, I really miss you</pre>
