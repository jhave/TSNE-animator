Cause..
We are, so extreme (so extreme)
So advanced (so advanced)
Sho is clean (sho is clean)
Sex, mony and drugs we know these things

Bitches fallin' in love, we show them things
Cause..

[Verse 1: King Jacob]
And that's that
Yeah I'ma call just as long as that ass fat
Take her out wit the money I got from Azcap
Just investin' in my future but she'll pay it back
Just a lil' restatution from bein wit a mack
Just a lil' contribution for knowin' she a fact
Without a doubt, you know we goin' outta town
She bringin' it back for daddy she goin' on her rounds
Wouldn't it be kinda funny to see it goin' down?
That's why we brag and boast, shit we showin' out
That's why we ask ya'll hoes what we know about
The King named Jacob, you sleepin' please wake up
I'm the type of nigga that know them hoes
Show them hoes, mold them hoes
Told them hoes, so long ago
That the game was sweet now they wanna know

[Verse 2: The Professor]
The center of demention
Hit blunts and now I'm limpin'
So..(High), Up in the..(Sky)
It aint no comin' down or mention
And keep it pimpin', how? fire dro up in the kitchen
By mornin', all ya fruit juice and crackles will be missin'
We an trippin, we act like fiends in a way
But not..quite we height and be extreme for the day
Extrememly clean, but known to get my hands dirty
But they aint worthy rather put my hands on summin derrty
I'm in a hurry, my click be keepin it extremely late
As for the party, we are the party whether extremely great
Look at the shape, apple bottom, demisive waist
This niggaz all up in they face, so quick to draw the cape
But me?...I'm a playa, I don't step on no toes
Chickens can't get the time of day, and you respectin' these hoes?
Shame on you, ay aint that kinda lame on you?
Busta, I grab a strap and make it rain on you

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Murphy Lee the booty critic, I'm like a baby when you sit it
I damn sure didn't get it show this girl how you just did it
(Whaa?)...Ya summin' special wit ya back side
Put ya booty into rehab (Why?) cuz ya back high
I back by 2 women drinkin' some Ackrite
She rolled up and gave me the sack, tie a back tie
That guy, that's hot from mornin' to bedtime
Groupies backstage end up in the headlines
And I talkin' bout news, Young Dude name em after shoes
The ones actin' brand new.
Now let me see ya shake ya tailfeather
Put it high in the sky so I could tell weather
Tell whether you could take it or not, shake it or not
Tell whether you gon get buck-ed naked tonight
I'm the same bro that made ya knees touch ya elbows
So gon' hed and treat me like a toilet bowl.
