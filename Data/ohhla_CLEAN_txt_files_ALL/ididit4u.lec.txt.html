[Lecrae]
I did it for you {*3X*}
That's why I did it y'all
For all the listeners
Whoever be hearing this
That's why I do what I do
I did it for you

Single mother low income riding the bus
Big momma making a fuss saying in God she trusts
My uncles 20, I'm 10 taking gulps of gin
He don't realize that we all are engulfed in sin
Gang bangers on the corner got me wanna be down
Take a bullet for some city on government ground
By 25 everybody locked or died
To busy playing around never looking ahead
Every funeral, cats get upset and cry
Turn their heads towards the sky trying to ask God why
But they never looked up till then
Every other day they concerned with the world and consumed in sin
Not Christ just heaven they want
They think clean means not trying to sling things out of their trunk
Nobody ever to them heaven was spotless and we all dirty
That's why we need a Holy God to wash us

[Chorus]
I did it for you - I opened up my life and shared my life
So that you can see we all need Christ
I did it for you - if you can understand my pain
Maybe you can see we all need change
I did it for you - can view my life my pain my hurt
Man I hope this work
I did it for you - since Christ died for sin
I'll never be the same again (I did it for you)

[Lecrae]
Young dude, I remember coming home after school
Changing channels from videos back to cartoons
Up late talking on the phone under my bed
So momma couldn't hear some of the things I said
And it wasn't all bad but it wasn't all good
Even though momma was doing the best she could
I was a latchkey home alone for hours
Entertaining my sin And my soul devour
Pick up by the cops at the age of 12
And not because my momma didn't raise me well
I was a drug baby big momma dragged me to church
Hated ever minute of it but she prayed it would work
I an't never met my daddy so I feel all empty
Like why he never call or why don't he come get me
And momma under legalistic teachings and lies
So she beat me and she tell me it was to keep me alive
a typical youth I mean A typical youth 16 agnostic and looking for truth
I lived for myself, No one ever told me the plan
God had to bring redemption to a fallible man
Good news really wasn't good news to me
Cause I never new the condemnation due to me
And I wish somebody would of told me then
What it meant to know Christ and to be born again

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
They say Mac got saved and X is a Christian
Well I don't really know them but I pray they both listen
It's hard trying to grow up in a sinful land
And you don't have an example of a Godly man
Well hold on; just keep your eyes on Christ
When we enter in the world, man our lives alright
They say heaven has a ghetto but that an't true
And if God has a standard then that an't you and that an't me
That's what I learned late one night when a man named James White changed my life
He told me that Christ paid the price for sin
Every lie I ever told Christ died for them
See, I never knew I offended God I just knew I really wasn't trying to live for God
And my sins all cost me, Yeah pretty costly
I couldn't blame the hood for the death sin bought me
All that I could do was blame myself and realize there was no way I could change myself
So I trusted Christ with my lustful life
And he saved me that's why I am trying to touch the mic
Yeah so if you ask who I am spitting this to, that's right yea'll I did it for you
And if you ask who I have written this to, that's right I did it for you

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I did it for you, I did it for you
So I could show you that his grace is right here for you
I did it for you, I did it for you
So I could show you that his grace is right here for you
I did it for you</pre>
