[Isaiah Rashad]
My dick I know it's, yeah, it's unfamiliar... yeah

Baby, can you sucky on my dick? I know it's big enough
Ride with a nigga from the South, I know you feel the rush
Fuckin' with a nigga, bitches rarely ever get the touch
Better feel privileged, catch another, you can hit the dust
I done grown up for my child sake, Black and Mild face
Look up loud place, never crowd place
Never skirt chase, maybe first grade, never last place
Never had brakes, pop a transmission, always had faith
Always had trace, always had James in that duplex
Hit a suplex, fuck a crew neck
$pottie solo up in that recess, never regress
Georgia peaches, grab her cheek ass
Such a slutbag, baby nut rag, never cuff that
Love a hoodrat where there's puss at
Barely have me goin' on that Sosa, I never go back
I never hit it raw again, fucking with the law again
Picking up trash on highways, never my way
Blasé blasé, sneakin' shotty, fuck a Friday
I'm with Robert, chuggin' Bombay, fuck your turn up
Fuck your turn out, we gon burn up
Fuck your mosh pit, I'm on my shit, on that Tribe shit
Got that Phife Dawg; I might bite, bitch, I'm on tablet
Scribble down, I'm rapping like Kool
Inspire all my local jokers who be quittin' that school
They be hating that job, I was hating that too
I was flipping your burger high as a bitch, but I'm cool
I think I'm blessed now, I only stress about the stress now 
Since I'm fresh now, I pull that motherfuckin' dress down (dress down, dress down)

[Chorus: Isaiah Rashad - singing]
... And I'm gon' testify girl
... And I'm gonna touch your thighs
... I'm gon' spend the night, girl
... You like... {*7X w/ echoes*}

[Outro]
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, what's it going for?" {*3X*}
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, all that pussy, all that-"
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, what's it going for?" {*3X*}
"I heard that you was servin' all that pussy, all that pussy..."</pre>
