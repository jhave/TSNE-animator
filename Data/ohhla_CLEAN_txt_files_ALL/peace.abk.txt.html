Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I rebuke you in the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost.

What up fam? I'm here on a more personal level. I say we take this peace pipe, fire up the end and let's roll out.

Elevate your soul with a piece of the earth.
Get rid of all the stress inside before you get someone hurt.
Take a hit of the weed, if you think that you can. Now hold it in homie, hold it, hold it... Damn. I love the sound of virgin lungs right before they bust. So if you want to come and smoke, peace pipe with. Let me take you to a level where you ain't been yet. Come and step in to circle and let's all get wrecked.

Until we meet again, I'll guess see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. My journey ain't over yet ya'll someone in this bitch about to get me High.

One time open your mind body and soul and let yourself be possessed by the indo smoke. Write down your problems, roll them up and let's burn them away. Ain't no reason to be chillin' all sad and gray. Acting like a lost pup, teary eyed and stuff. Look every time I pass the blunt you fucked the rotation up. Let's keep it floating playa' smoke smoke gimmeh my dope. I'll see you in my next journey when I re-up bro.

Until we meet again, I'll guess see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. I don't know what strand this is but this shit has got my ass Stoned.

Until we meet again, I guess I'll see you. Take it easy. So long homie. Nice smokin' with you... keep it peaceful. Keep it peaceful.

You know I met alot of cool ass people livin' life this way. Laid back, while getting stoned every damn day. Understand in one another while we sparking this bowl. Conversating through whole night, let the time just... go</pre>
