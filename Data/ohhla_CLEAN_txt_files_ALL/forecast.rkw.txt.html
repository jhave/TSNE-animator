Turn me up (feel me like) let me get a feeling of who love me
And who I love (that's what it's all about though)
You understand?  
First you got to know how to move (the forecast calls for...)
Then you got to know how to make moves (straight up) 
All y'all 
It's eternal (what?)
(We getting on the ninety five?) Yea I like that word
(Yo) we bringing it from here (don't drive too close to the ?heava? nigga)
Understand? (Come on) let's go let's go let's go 
Yea that's right (right) 
What up? So what is it called? (you know what its called kid)
Yo (how much I, how much I implement my thoughts to you?)

Yo, hey yo shout out New York 
Philadelphia my sword talk
Praises due 
The block favors you
New Jers with the guerillas with the most sexiest birds
Vehicles and shit shout out your word
Fox premier 
My niggas in Connecticut yea
Upstate, Albany got love here
Rochester all the way down to stretcher
You large Long Island niggas definitely paint a picture
Chicago peace

Yep I know it's ill 'cause police tried to kill me
And oh let's politic and make dido
D.C. I hope y'all feel me when I ble-do
Atl., Tennessee ring bells
Out in Ohio bumping twenty inch wheels
Yea San Franciso, Vegas, Illinois, Dallas

Bitches on the air

Stay Brolic in the Giants like the Denver Broncos 
Yo South Carolina bring the drama

Batting a white man
