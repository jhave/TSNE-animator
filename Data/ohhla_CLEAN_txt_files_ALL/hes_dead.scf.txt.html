Old McDonald had a farm
Ee-eye-ee-eye - my dick

(Is he dead?)

[ VERSE 1 ]
You can run but you can't hide, I find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standin right behind ya
You crossed the wrong muthafucka, now you paranoid
Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slackin up, I shoulda killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We coulda talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this muthafucka to try to punk me?
What possessed this muthafucka to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fuckin with me, I ain't no muthafuckin punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, cause I'ma slit your Kool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a muthafucka jokin, mayn
They wanna test a muthafucka's boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
Cause when you're fuckin with me, I'ma tear this muthafucka up
You're fuckin with a dread
You're takin 2 to your head, I'm comin fed
(Is he dead?) Yeah, he dead

"It had to be a murder"
"Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature"
"It had to be a murder"
"I looked him in the eye -
Then I shot him in his face"

[ VERSE 2 ]
See, niggas make mistakes, black
They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so muthafuckas stray back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dyin, muthafucka, so I go for blood
And let em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake muthafuckas on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turnin the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be runnin from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin for the head
Just makin sure you're dead

"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"You're dyin, hoe, and can't nothin save ya"

[ VERSE 3 ]
It's over, I'm smokin on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wantin some action, so I'm rollin through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fuckin this bitch and puttin her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin up
She's tellin homie she don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a muthafucka, 'specially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, du
So I cut the shit quick
And said, "Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ???? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her"
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talkin shit and wantin to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
( *shot*) And left the muthafucka stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin job
So off with your head, bitch
Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm makin sure I get you good
And if you twitchin like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin pistol and continue squeezin
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feelin this
But niggas ain't real with this
Cause niggaroes ain't killin shit
But yo, I guess it's dead
And I be givin you 2 to your muthafuckin head
Makin sure you're dead

"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature"

This is goin out to
All those fake muthafuckas
I ain't gonna say no names

"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"It had to be a murder"
"Always look a man in the eye before you kill him"
"You're dyin, hoe, and can't nothin save ya"</pre>
