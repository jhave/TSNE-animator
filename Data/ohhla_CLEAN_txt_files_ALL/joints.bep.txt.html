Yeah...a chick-a-doom, chick-a-doom chick-a-doom 

CHORUS  That's the joint, that's the jam
		    Turn that shit up, play it again  (3x)

[Will I Am]
I like the way the rhythm makes me jump and move
It gots the feelin' that makes me wanna do my do
Got me feelin' joy, turn my grey sky blue
And when you hear a cut baby doll I know you
Will feel it huh? Get up on the floor start movin' some
Body parts that got brothers actin' dumb
And they be actin' dumb from the cut that playin'
People break they neck from this demonstration
We about mass appeal, no segregation 
Got Black to Asian and Caucasian sayin'...

CHORUS (2x)

[Apldap]
Let your body collide to the rhythm provided 
By the mind state affairs classified and make your
Heat up and flare I swear 
A serenade, a soul and so beware
And what's happenin' here, seek one to help you
Feelin' a piece of mind, let your spine unwind
Maybe in time you can stop this crime
But until then, yo I'm-a rock a rhyme sayin'...

CHORUS (2x)

BRIDGE  It's the jam, it's the jam, it's the jam, it's the jam
It's got groove it's got feelin'
(a chick-a-doom, a chick-a-doom chick-a-doom doom)
It's the jam, it's the jam, it's the jam, it's the jam
It's got groove it's got meanin'	
(a chick-a-doom, a chick-a-doom chick-a-doom doom)

[Taboo]
Got the state's appeal with the joint's that real
I don't need no steel to make my point
Get down and dirty cuz that's my joint
Ha! We preferably make all points
Through a nation we build off the musical field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel
Any time or place, on stage in ya face
Over tea in Earth and outer space

[Will I Am]
Because we rock that *shit*, we flip that *shit*
Some east coast west coast cosmic *shit*
Some north bound *shit*, some some south bound *shit*
Some overseas London out of town *shit*
Rockin' the joint, rockin' the jams
Turn that shit up, play it again cuz...

CHORUS (3x)

BRIDGE (1x) to fade out</pre>
