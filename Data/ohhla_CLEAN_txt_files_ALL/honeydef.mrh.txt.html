MC:    If Jermaine likes it
Brat:    He do
JD:      Yo, uh, uh
           You know what? Y'all ain't ready for this
           Still scrambling from the damage of the last remix
Brat:    Most of your stories bore me, I love to lie
           To my royalties be the glory
           Mariah, my honey, be fly
JD:      Ah, me and B-R-B-R
           Usually seen in hot spots jumpin' outta two seaters
Brat:    We got money to make
           And many records to break
JD:      We not (sometimes) to any so make no mistake
           Listen

Mariah:
Oh, honey (So So Def)
You can have me, when you want me
You simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one, who makes me come running
Cause what you got, is far beyond compare, ooh

And it's just (just)
Like (like)
Honey (honey)
When your love (uh huh) comes over me 
Oh baby I've got a dependency, always strung out
For another taste of your honey (yeah, yeah)
It's like when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you
I adore you, one hit your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling don't you see
Every night and day, I can hardly wait
For another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe, how good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe, how good it feels inside

MC c'mon
Yeah, ooh
Oh, I can't be elusive with you honey
Cause it's blatant that I'm feeling you (say what)
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cuss you're the only thing I wanna do

JD:
Y'all be saying this and that
But y'all don't wanna see this new phenomenon
This Don Chi Chi
It's somethin' nasty
Word to B.I.G.
I'm in it for life
Dead president for life
And by the minute I get more nice
I'm the J-E-R 
The M-A-I
N don't forget the E
And she go by the unforgettable name 
Of the B 
To the R
To the A
To the T

Da Brat:
I like colloso size pieces of rocks
And getting pushed in the Bentley drop top
Undefeated indefinitely
And don't stop
We rock in all kinds of spots
Calling all the shots
And y'all knows how we get down
My beliefs is being dolla bill seeker
And a Benjamin keeper
Don't mind popping if y'all
Or slow wind with some clown with
Seven digit accounts

JD 2x:
They say 'Hey, JD won't you play that song?
Keep 'em dancing (dancing) all night long' (all night long)
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
Keep 'em dancing (dancing) all night long' (all night long)

Chorus to end (variations):</pre>
