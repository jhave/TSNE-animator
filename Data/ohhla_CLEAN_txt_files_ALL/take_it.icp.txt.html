If it was up to me I would never dare you
If it was up to me I would rather spare you
If it was up to me I would try to sway you

Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to
If it was up to me you wouldn't have to fear him
If it was up to me I wouldn't let you near him
If it was up to me it doesn't really matter
Inside out, it's only
It's all out, they gotta take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to

Ok, come on
You don't wanna see what goes on over here
You don't even wanna get near
If I was you I'd turn around and back home now
Before your ass gets stuffed little buster
Tryin to mean mug with that lip flappin
What you thought was gonna happen?
Turn around bitch boy and break off fast
Before you get that foot in your ass Mother fucker!

Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
It's all out, you have to take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Take it (Do it)
Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
Everything is up to him
It's all out, you have to</pre>
