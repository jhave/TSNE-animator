makeba
yo how you doin' baby it's been a long time
haven't seen you in a couple of years and the last i heard you lost your mind
well how you been who you been with how's it been goin'
still into hip hop are you still flowin'
oh yeah that's cool
we should kick back maybe have a session
i remember you tellin' me you had to get away couldn't stay another day
in the life of L.A. in the city
that's peace
yo where you been China Africa Greece
least you coulda dropped me a letter or a phone call
let me know you was all right
your friends and your family and they kept tellin' me
makeba disappeared in the night
now i know that you had big dreams makeba
but i had big dreams too
and all this time you were searchin' makeba
did any your dreams come true
i remember i used to be down for you and you was down for me
i had your back and you had my back makeba
i wanted you to be my g

makeba
yo you know i got another girl after that right
she kinda looked like you too a little bit
sweet makeba
yo why don't you just come to the crib you know
we could listen to some music talk about things

ooh i see you're not a young girl anymore and you're all grown up
and you been around the world
wanna see what life's gonna offer you it's your young world and it's all for
you
you probably got a man in every country that wants you
like i wanted you but you didn't want that
remember how we used to make love makeba
'member how you loved it when i hit it from the back

makeba 
i had love for you
i had wanted you
i had needed you

i remember comin' to your house seven in the morning
ready for school but we didn't even go
it was right back to my house where we kissed liked kids
and we jumped in the bed and you know
i loved makin' love to my makeba
she was like my queen of Sheba
i remember how we used to smoke chiba
oh you don't smoke no more well that's cool
well everybody gotta stop sometime
i remember one time when you hid my stash and saved my ass from the one time
i remember some fools tried to jump me and you jumped up before anybody did
we used to say if and when we get married we'll have kid after kid after kid
after kid
after kid after kid after kid after kid after kid
damn that's a lot of kids 

makeba
sweet makeba
i had love for you
i had wanted you
i had needed you
how i loved makin' love to my makeba

well remember how the whole crew used to hang tough
well everybody's doin' they thang and stuff
and everybody's still actin' like they know
and a few more people ain't w/us no mo'
oh me i'm just chillin' 
makin' my music livin' and buildin' 
tryin' to make a million out this little ol' dime and this nickel
and lickin' lickle shots for the prophets we forgot
but other than that i'm glad you back on deck
i expect to see you in the near future
if you wanna just sit and chat talk about the good old days
good old times what was in style what's goin' on now
cause it has been a while
makeba
honey girlfriend 
left in a whirlwind put a brother in a tailspin
just twirlin'
had a few laughs and kicks
but me and my clique don't be trippin' no tricks
i still got a piece of me to give you
you still got a piece of you to give me
you listenin' but you don't hear me
we can pick up right where we left at but
i gotta be me and you gotta accept that
i just wanna be homies
cause i ain't got love like Monie
cause soon as you got close you got ghost
and you tried to leave Acey 'lone-y
so hook up w/me if you can cool
but you know i know what you get loose to
and if you play your cards right get your shit tight
then we might be down like we used to
makeba
