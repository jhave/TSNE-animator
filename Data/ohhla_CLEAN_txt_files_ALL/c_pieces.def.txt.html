[Defari]
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many... THERE'S SO MANY
So many cold pieces in L.A
1, 2, 3 -

Women with ass, who do I rush?
Who do I ask, who can I trust?
Who has class, where can I bust?
Can it last past 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Chicks with hips, sexy ass lips
Lickin' they lips, lickin' my drick
Ass is so thick, wiggle that shit
Bounce it real quick, picture that shit
Damn there go 7, 8, 9
Women so fine, finer than dimes
Finer than the coldest in the golden of olden times
Finer than fine in L.A., happens all the time
Matter of fact there go 10, 11, 12
Twelve of the most top-shelf bad bitches on earth, who else?
You gotta pop a collar, the super scholar
All proper holler, know that -

[Chorus]
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many bad women
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many bad women
(ALL TOP-NOTCH)

[Defari]
Come to L.A. and compete
The baddest women in the world feel like lunch meat
Compared to our everyday girl with pretty feet, soft skin, pretty eyes
(THERE'S SO MANY) - tanned with ass and titties
Legs so fine, face so pretty
Hair like "uh-huh", walk like "what?"
She keep passin' me by - never
(I STEP UP) and tell her that "I like your jeans"
Turn around girl, let me see what's happening
You so pretty, smile like a diamond gleam
You so pretty, I gotta tell you (WHAT'S UP WITH US)
But once again, who can I trust?
When can I bust?, there's some things we gotta discuss
She brought a friend, damn her friend's finer than her
Miraculous, Los Angeles

[Chorus]
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many bad women
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many fine women
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many fine women
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many bad women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many fine women
(THERE'S SO MANY)
So many fine women in L.A
So many cold pieces in L.A
So many fine women
(THERE'S SO MANY)</pre>
