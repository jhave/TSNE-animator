[Jadakiss] + (Styles P)
Uh-huh, yup, AH-HAH!
Cyphers in front of the Apollo as a shorty
(Now I got a clip full of hollows in the .40)
Louis (Gucci's) every now and then (Maurice)
I take too long to come back (send for me)
Know how to work it (big things poppin)
On the underground circuit (maintain) 'til it surfaced
The nerve of these peasants (treat a rap budget)
I'm like a bird how I stretch it (think they get the message)
Waters (dutchies) lot of herb (in the session)
So-called tough guys (herbs with aggression)
Put your thoughts all over the curb (with the Wesson)
What used to be superb (now is depression)
Negative energy  generated from the snakes
(and the centipedes, you will) remember me
I just get the storm started
(Cold-blooded) warm-hearted
(Either way) you on target
(Move to the side) like a lane merge
(The gun's like fried rice) Who want they brain stirred?
(Enter the limelight) lemon drop-top (off a crime life)
Always see the crew in the hindsight
(Yeah, American sedan) Shooters got Berettas in they hands
(This is mafia) The veterans are planned
(Word to the tape on the brick)
This is raw (we in the four-by-four) 8 plus 8 in the clip
(Hustlin Harry Potter) shakin the brick
(Ice in the bracelet) give the matrix a glitch
(And my car's like a spaceship)
Got gold in my Nike checks (Jordans got ice in the laces)
(Pants got a gun where the waist is) It's basic
(Shirts smell like earth smoke, chirp) Yo
(Chirp back) let me know (who gettin murked though)
Yeah we gettin money nigga (who gettin work though?)
And I got the kush nigga (I got the purple)
(Move squares) cause we gotta hold down the circle
(Kill you) or hurt you (whatever's a virtue)
Beat you like your parents when you breakin your curfew

[Chorus: Jadakiss] + (Styles P)
Yeah, homie live life to the death
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
Vicious money, it don't matter if it's cash or a check
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
Big houses, cars, and jewels that's wet
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
'Til the family, friends, whole life is set
(We gon' make it to the top) Just one more step
One more step

[Jadakiss] + (Styles P)
Yo, livin my life (what's left of it)
Don't try to go to jail but if you do (make the best of it)
If you crash into a bullet (then it ain't no estimate)
It's a money-back guarantee my nigga (death's a definite)
This is audio crack (guess who's chef'in it?)
Jadakiss and S.P. (do this effortless)
Gunplay make you do whatever (son say)
If the Lord send you a flight (the ticket is one-way)
Put that work in when you young, you get (power)
Money don't match the runnin and get (sour)
Still (rep the hood to the death)
A promise is only good if it's kept (niggaz'd kill you for less)
(Silence is golden) Go 'head, keep dozin
The window of opportunity (keeps closin)
We gon' see if you really a clutch baller
A cell is small (but a casket is much smaller)
(Burn out 30 a session) 60 a ki' shit
(That street shit) Jada and P shit
(Lambo's, hoopties) Shooters and groupies
(Monte Claire) D square (Emilio Poochie)
Long trips (short trips) makin me nauseous
(Courtship) Gave them jewels money for Porsches
(Made a couple mil') but it's small shit
(We rap and keep raw) so we on some street law (court shit)
(Walls still spin) Upgraded the floor flip
(Ain't touch it) ain't see it (ain't hear about it)
If it's money gone (believe we gon' care about it)
Send some niggaz to your crib (take the air up out it)
(Leave some blood up in it)
Listen fam, the Lamb's the color of toast (seats like butter in it)
No hammers in the club (box cutter in it)
Long money and big checks
(Get popped in the chest, face) wig, neck (trey-pound) sick tec
(Play the game) Get a plane if you shipwrecked
(Learns from the best) if you ain't learn shit yet
(Yeah!) Motherfucker
