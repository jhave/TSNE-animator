[Saukrates]
It's time for the remix.... remix

[Moka Only]
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and cynics, your time is up
Just admit it, everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shit

[Saukrates]
This is hot shit, better go and get yours
Ha, we burning at shows
This is hot shit, better go and get yours
Ha, better go and get yours

[Prevail]
Voiceless, world remix
Kings and queens on the deck, dancing hip to wrist
You know what, whats up, it's like we just woke up
After two years of recording, y'all I'm hungry as fuck
I'll eat tapedecks, CD's, mini discs
Turntables, speakers and the board for the mix
Nothing left, how could you bump the rest
You need to jump out the smoke to where the air is fresh

[Mad Child]
Don't even think about it, don't trip, rip robotic
Alot of quadrophonic, you can't stop this product
I'm a mytholical psychotic, you do not got it
Murderous plot, hot shit, you can spot it
From a mile away, hot where we come from
Some come, Mad Child's a stun gun dumb dumb
Violent phantom, shine like Green Lantern
Ill temper tantrum on national anthem

[Saukrates]
This is hot shit, better go, get yours
Ha, we burning at shows
The top shit, professionals get those
Bred scrilla, an essence of gorilla b
Cause it's hot shit, better go and get chose
We burning at shows
It's hot shit, better go and get yours
Ha, better go and get yours
Filling the bowl with hot shit style
I pop more than N*Sync got enough dynamite
To bust a whole Brinks box
To stuff in this levable sling shot
It's big socks, you stopping to think, not
This remix is iller than three sixes
Tatooed on the back of three chicks
I ain't rocking the boat, I'm giving chickens sea sickness
Witness to the okie, rock from coast to coast
My curves are more swollen than most can boast
Yo, you folks telling this, I'm like V-twelve
Supposed to be the hot dose to vote the against those opposing me
But...

[Moka Only]
Y'all ain't got it so don't even think about it
Cause I'm down if you know the top
Swollen Members, Moka Only gonna take the shot
If you think, you bet you know me, better press rewind
You can pump it in your Sony, repossess your mind
If you fronting, you can blow me, you can testify
Someone else who's about what it takes to climb
Whenever Battle Axe Warriors come out to play
You can bet we gonna do it in a thousand ways
And we're sweating off what we do to resusitate
Members only rock, so mother fuck debate
It's hot shit

[Prevail]
Prevail, Mad Child, Saukrates
Who would've thought all these ones would add up to three
More horsepower, hardcore with gun powder
Blow the show into a black hole in a dark world
Of spotlights and spot dates, top rate
Hearts break, like a Beamer in a car chase
I can see them when they star gaze to phase
Their eyes are brighter than the screens in an arcade

[Mad Child]
Ride this, Mad Child's double kick rocks
I'm pulling out the big guns with big socks
Toxic driven things, deep fangs in venom
And I'm a send them the same hot that t dot got in them
Pretend I'm a minimum wage earner, plus a fast learner
No diploma, selling something on the corner
More than one in the twenty-first day, when's your birthday
Get it when you want it but I want it in the first way

[Saukrates]
This is hot shit, better go, get yours
Ha, we burning at shows
The top shit, professionals get those
Bred scrilla, an essence of gorilla b
Cause it's hot shit, better go and get chose
We burning at shows
It's hot shit, better go and get yours
Ha, better go and get yours

[Moka Only]
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and cynics, your time is up
Just admit it, everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shit
Swollen Members gonna make y'all stop
Take a minute and remember who takes the top
To the critics and cynics, your time is up
Just admit it, everybody knows this rhyme is up
It's hot shit</pre>
