[Intro: Killah Priest]
Oh, no, hahaha... yeah
It's Priest back at ya.
The Genesis... genesis
My Genesis, uh, uh, genesis
Here it go baby... genesis..

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
Back in the days, it was much like this
Inspirations make me wanna reminisce
It's my genesis, it's the life, it's the love
It's my genesis, hook this mic to a plug

[Killah Priest]
Afros to box braids, locks and waves
Fades, to flat tops, it came, the boxing game
The bus stop, the pop locks and spades
Knuckles, doin' the hustle, I chuckle
That's me the young dude, playin' kung fu
Run to the store to get more junk food
Hero and a small Sundew, hard headed
That's why I flunked school, back in the days
When the Bishops and the Lords used to rumble
That's a Brooklyn thing, the hoodlum reign
Shots go off at block parties
Muslims and God Bodies and big posses
Different crews from different schools, it was school
Grandma watchin' the news, I'm dodgin' principals
Graffiti writers, guess who's on Riker's
Guess who's pregnant? Guess who's the lifer
To Laudi prom, robbin' the ciphers
Don't mess with Sun God, he's a fighter
It was, '80's, Michael Jackson and leather jackets
Bicycle fashion, my last words of a king when he's rapping
Swing flurries like a champ when he scrapping
Grew up fad, notepad, that's all I had
It's the only thing that bring me back to past

[Chorus 2X]

[Killah Priest]
It's the Priest, bless like sheeps in white sheets
Clothes fit me like robes, right to the T
Pearls huggin', back up, me and wifey
It's so elegant, my words add flesh to skeletons
Once it's heard, it covers the flesh from element
It's the medicine, take it for the soul
It's better than gold, Proverbs, makes your pops burst
Starbust, above God's Earth
And the moonlight, I move like a Greek move degrees at night
I write movies that masterpiece, the cornerstones my poem
I lay bricks like a mason, my words can move a nation
Throw pens out the page, the same way you pull a pen out a grenade
And watch it explode, yo, my mind explode, divine and glow
Back to the days, where the rhymes was made

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Killah Priest]
*singing along to the beat*
Yo, come on, let me hear ya'll sing it, it go
*singing along to the beat*
Heat it up, uh, Black August, take control, understand
Words of the Proverbs, heard... yeah.. uh.
Priesthood, where you at, boy? Yeah..
