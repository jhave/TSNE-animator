[chorus] 
Bran! Duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh
For when you're stuck! 
Bran! Duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh 
Diarrhea!!  

C'mon have another one, then another one, eat all of 'em 
Choose one from the supermarket, there's a whole wall of 'em 
Cereals with bran and fiber in 'em make you crap a lot 
It makes your butt feel all slimy 
I'm-a show you how, c'mon all together now 
Yeah, that's how it's gotta be 
Cereals with bran and a lot of fiber in it 
In your mouth out your rear, in a span of three minutes 
Prune juice, wash it down, clean you out fast 
Pant's droppin', the floppin' and ploppin' splashin' your ass 
Once it gets started, it just won't quit 
And then ulllgghhh, to big to fit 
98% of constipated people couldn't give a shit 
Little bit problem isn't it what's fixin' it 
I got a plan, I'm the man sittin' on the can 
All because I eat a lot of bran 

[chorus]  

I'm-a sit here sittin' on the shitter in pain, oh 
The only thing that cleans you out better is Drano 
But you can't beat bran for it's raz-a-ma-taz 
Makes you "ullgh-raptha-thbbb" like my main man Taz 
If one bowl doesn't work have one more 
And you won't be constipated any more 
Bloated, loaded, you better be prepared 
If not it'll feel like your lungs have imploded 
The smell it makes me high, I desecrate the air 
Be there for a week and never come up for air 
My crew, yup, my fans, yup, we all got plans 
To be sittin' on the john with the tidy bowl man 
The smell, the sound, it gets all around you.
We got enough toilet paper? I'm goin' for Round 2 
Fill it to the brim, I lost ten pounds 
You run for your life before the smell tracks you down 

[chorus]  

I'm the new king, sittin' on the porcelain throne 
Hurry up and give me the damn plunger before this thing overflows 
Tons of it in the potty, my body created 
Give some to the White House, they're all constipated 
Stuff comes out my ass like it was Niagara Falls 
So much of it falls that it splashes my balls 
And I, let it go so I [fart] um excuse me 
I started this nasty caper to create a toxic vapor 
For that I give praise to the maker 
'Cause cereals now come with a free roll of toilet paper 
But but but wait I see stars 
I'm so full of gas I could drive to Mars 
When I'm not on the can, I'm shoppin with my man 
Buyin' some cereals with fiber and, and

[chorus]
