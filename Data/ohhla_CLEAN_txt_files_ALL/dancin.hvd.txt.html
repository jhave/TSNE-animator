Song:   Dancin' in the Night
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Do you ever feel like, gettin high?
Do you ever feel like, leavin this world?
Uhh - do you ever feel like, you ball by yourself?
Do you ever feel unnecessary?  Uh-huh

[Heavy D - singing]
Don't call me crazy but sometimes I feel like gettin up
and dancin in the middle of the night
I need a way to release myself
from all the pain and the pressures in life (one time)
Considered drinkin, but then I started thinkin
I'd probably drown away my life
Gotta do somethin, too many people frontin
You see I need a way to get by

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
That's why I get hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
from dancin in the middle of the night
Dancin in the moonlight

[Heavy D - singing]
Last night I'm cruisin the Meadows, better known as the ghetto
Seen a shorty named Black
At 13 he's deep in the drug scene
And there probably ain't no turnin back
He said dat, momma was smokin, he tired of bein broke and
poppa locked up and ain't comin back
I almost cried when he looked in my eyes
and he said he didn't care if he died

[Chorus]

[Heavy D - singing]
I've been dreamin for years, cried a river of tears
I can't take it no more
I seen the bible dying
And I don't wanan cry no more (just ain't right)
Too many people pushin too many people
Hate is just a sequel, cause still nobody's equal
And I find myself lying
Cause I don't wanna cry no more

[Chorus]

[Heavy D - singing]
Dancin in the moonlight
Said dancin in the moonlight {*repeat 7X*}

[Chorus]

[Heavy D - singing]
Dancin in the moonlight
Said dancin in the moonlight {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
