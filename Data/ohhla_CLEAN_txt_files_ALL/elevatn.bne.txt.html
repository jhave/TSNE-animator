(Intro)
Yeah, one time for they mind baby
Keep the wicked numbers away haters
I know y'all want some, but'chu can't get none

(Hook x2)
And what I'ma do is just keep them away without worryin about a thang
And you know my name
I'm not takin the blame, not playin a game
Evolution of elevation is way bigger than your big bank
Explain to me breath
Explain to me breasts, explain to me death maaayn

(Verse 1)
Heaven is high
How you doin it as I'm walkin by
I've been in a flurry of war, and enemies ain't talkin right
I don't have the time, ain't expectin no love up in here
Allah I pray you forgive me for closin my eyes and ears
Nobody want to tell the truth [shh] nobody is real
Everybody tryina cover up what's already revealed
Why am I tortured just for tellin the way it really is?
No questions asked, I'ma pass, I don't want none of that ass
I don't need, lead, that a fig
I can walk around here naked
No I'm not Mr. Shakur, I'm so secure in the matrix
I'm bakin up in this blanket, your fire is childs play
Chucky, I'll stomp you to pieces, and take him out my way
We prayin like everyday, see you at the +Crossroads+
I'm gonna miss everybody, cryin for the lost souls
Crosses, fire, and crossbows
The righteous that lost those
My titans and corn-rows, igniting and turn slow

(Hook x2)
And what I'ma do is just keep them away without worryin about a thang
And you know my name
I'm not takin the blame, not playin a game
Evolution of elevation is way bigger than your big bank
Explain to me breath
Explain to me breasts, explain to me death maaayn

And what I'ma do is just keep them away without worryin about a thang
And you know my name
I'm not takin the blame, not playin your game
Evolution of elevation is way bigger than your big bank
Explain to me breath
Explain to be breasts, explain to be death maaaayyyyn

(Interlude)
Now what I want you to do right here man-
Is I want you to flip it like you used to flip it way way back in the day (Maaaaaayyyyyn)
You know, you gotta get back to that man (Maaaaaayyyyyn)
You know what I'm sayin?
Right before you had cut your hair, man
I want you to flip it on 'em, baby (Maaaaaayyyyyn)
Holla, cool

(Verse 2)
Generals sit at the desk
Then we take a test, we sellin ourselves in unison
And if woman'll miss us
The moment of you and then everything that he was doin then
See Heaven is high, now get with the real
We studying Islam, people
We walkin alone, without any help, and duckin like every evil
Is there anything that you want me to tell you?
Are you learning anything new on this internet?
But now you got something that you can come listen to
Give 'em the real on these politics
It's more and more obvious
Never oblivious to any negative thinking
Cause we are the warriors, slaves of Allah
Without any negative drinking
You know what I mean
No need to go further and further, the burner is serious
We keep to ourselves, with nobody else around to make us delirious
If I can't be as sloppy, just pop me
We drippin, we movin like militant soldiers
No what will you feel when all the ascensions are going around your shoulders?
Rocks are bigger than boulders
Whether it's Colorado or if it's California
The haters are demons, just lookin for war
Now watch when they runnin up on us
It's only they jealousy, they'll never win
They'll only be mad cause we back y'all
And it ain't a need for me to worry, Allahu Akbar</pre>
