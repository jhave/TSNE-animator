[Ice Cube]
Ha ha, that's my shit
Turn it up {*echoes*}
Uhh, yeah

I hear a beat like this, and think about growin up
House parties, with gangbangers showin up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say Cube get on the mic, nigga blow it up
I used to lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's{?}
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo niggaz we should flip it like this
Cause them _Boyz N the Hood_ like the gangsta shit
I put the pen to the pad, young nigga was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real

[Chorus 2X: samples] + (Cube)
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

[Ice Cube]
Oh shit, it's N.W.A.!
Them niggaz on tour and they comin our way
Lil' Eminem is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other niggaz got raped
Same niggaz turned around and said fuck me
No FUCK YOU cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, nigga it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang
I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
From _Boyz N the Hood_, to _XXX 2_
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say "We love you Cube!"
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some fuckin play toy
A lot of niggaz say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody fuck wit'chu
Cause you talk a lot of shit about the red, black &amp; blue
And how they treat a nigga called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them fuckin misdemeanor
While black people dyin in that God damn arena
Just because I'm actin nigga never stop rappin
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin
Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket
Who you think you fuckin wit? Here's another classic

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
I'm Ruthless, I'm Ruthless..
Street Knowledge..
Lench Mob..
Westside..
Uhh..

[Chorus] - 1/2</pre>
