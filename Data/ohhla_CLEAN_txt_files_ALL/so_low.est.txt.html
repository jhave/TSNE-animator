[Lil' Mo (Kokane)]
Roll with me
Come smoke with me (Smoke with me)
Come close to me
So low (Come flow with me)
Dance with me
Take a chance with me (This is your chance)
Take a dip with me
Don't go

[Snoop Dogg]
Oh no, I have a party to attend
With some civilized people, and some more of my friends
I wish I could stick around
But I gotta take a trip back uptown, now
Layin wit'chu, stayin wit'chu
Playin wit'chu, is somethin I ain't gone do
Now look here boo, there's so many freaks up in here
And I done already been there, so I don't really care
Now you can take that, take that
Bitch, I know you hate that, hate that
You can't do nothin about it
You know damn well what I got back at the house
And I refuse to loose, trade in my shoes
Gimme the blues, hand my the booze
Strap on the fools, overabuse or misuse it
So I'm skatin steady, datin on the move to groove
I ain't got nothin to prove infact, I got too much to lose
Girl, you got a nigga way ? and way too cool
But I ain't leavin here wit'chu, for real

[Goldie Loc]
Yo, this the single house
We gone disconnect the TV, leave the stereo and move the couch
Everybody get they groove on
I'm sweatin like a rainy day, but I get my groove on
Dip baby dip, fall back a little bit while I hold the hips
Pass me the drink, while you hit this G-13
Pocket holler one time, fashion statement clean
Stacy Adams supe it up, baby girl boot it up
Almost dropped my glass when she lift that damn booty up
Dog walk to the cat walk
I'm ridin that ass like Tony Hawk
There's somethin about the way you blow my mind
Got me wanna boogie all the time
Baby this is what I'm lovin
Forget the last dance just to end up huggin, let's dance

[Tray Deee]
Lil' momma got a gang of ass
Plus that mini-skirt make me think she fast
Passed by and asked if she'd like to dance
Spark a conversation to ignite the flash
Bling bling all gleam, and I'm clean to whip
Saw the proper full crew I'm leavin with
You can act like the mack don't effect your type
Cuz you know a nigga tryin to have sex tonight
Ain't no secret, come freak with the real McCoy
Skip the guilt trip baby and just feel the joy
Make it rugged like you love it, never soft and sweet
Throw ya legs in the air and just start to beat
You can leave your thong on like it's all discrete
But it'll slide to the side when you fall asleep
Is you sho' that you can roll, dip, and smoke with me
Girl cuz I'ma give it to ya like it's 'sposed to be

[Kokane]
Come fuck with me
Drink with me
Smoke with me
Yeah, yeah
Loc with me
Drink some Hennesey
Goldie Loc, and Tray Deee
Yeah, yeah

[Snoop talking (Lil' Mo singing in background)]
Yeah you tryin to fuck with a nigga huh
I can't even trip though
It might seem like, some shit like, two-two
Beep-beep, haha, two-two
Beep-beep, two-two [Repeat until fade]</pre>
