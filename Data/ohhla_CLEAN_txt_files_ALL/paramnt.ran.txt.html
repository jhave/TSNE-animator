[Random]
I done seen it all, best times, worst times, either or
Bein poor wasn't new but always seemed to see you more
I do not play - I USED to 'til them shots
sprayed around way I've been jammin like Andre
3 stacks, keep the feedback, I don't need that
Far from perfect, but it's hardly worth it
So I drop sermons like a Sunday service
Felt the draft from the bullets, sorta like Pervis
Ellis and, jettison, right to the front
Used to, do what I could now I, do what I want
Big Ran, never been the bro in the front so
Play me like a chump if you want, see me in a couple of months
I never had much, so that ain't new
Livin a lie that ain't true, it ain't you (nah)
But I don't hate you, it wouldn't make sense to
I just gotta know (what) who convinced you
and turned your back and now everybody's against you?
Tires warm but yet I'm gon' continue
Insert coin and join the game
Fought through the maze and all of the joy and the pain
But I ain't done yet (uh-uh) got a lot more
achievements to unlock 'fore ridin in the sunset
Said I ain't done yet (done yet) I got a lot more
achievements to unlock before I ride into the sunset
Yeah

[Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah
One two, one two
...
Dumb high always put me in reflective state
"The Gods Must Be Crazy" man they stay tryin to test my fate
I'm at a crossroads, the fork is sharp in it
Even though it won't work, I put my heart in it
Look close you can see all the scars in it
Look in the sky, it's hard to see the stars in it
Behind the fog they sit, hear the drums and how hard they hit
Remind me of life and how hard it is
Nobody want to hear a grown man speak of ugly
So yo I {*fuck* *censored*} and I get money
Pop bubbly, maybe some Goose but
In this economy you gotta find a new lunch
One with less food son, left me starvin again
Blowin smoke like, how we spark in the wind
And we starvin to win, and losin is not makin it
This song was written before a hajj, made it</pre>
