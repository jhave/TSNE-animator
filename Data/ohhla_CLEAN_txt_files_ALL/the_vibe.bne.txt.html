You crept and you came and shit changed

Nigga what you sayin you came and you went

Fin to get that gangster getting a demon you can conjure up and see
If we get angels pinnin my ankles bloody murder fuck wit Jesus
He done creeping deep puttin those to sleep till I raise up on my enemies
Let's get pumped for the peeps in Egypt and 400 years of oppression
Spread the message I ain't finished diminished you so called critics
And fuck them billboard and the billboard status me kick it
You fucked up for a while for the day that I was in trial
Man and I don't know how style through with them crowds and now
I got to kick it get on the ground wantin my people to gather around
Remember the sound of the rounds came from my town 
I know you bitch would bite that we can't allow
And they won't claim my style ready to beat you down 
Hittin them tombstones (sellin volumes) getting them costumes bow now
I'm rolling with Makaveli pinnin my pistol steady ready
Buck them flames aim for the pressure point

[Krayzie]
I beg your pardon my nigga but how do you know me

Put him in the river now nigga who wild wild 
What incredible style that's what you was thinkin 
when you tried to get it down
We see that you fuck with a daily crowd so nigga just turn your ass out
Whenever you ready to rumble my nigga just meet us outside of the club
Ready to slang slugs nigga done got to drunk and forgot that we claim thug
Nigga this shit is ridiculous

Buck you to hell it was nigga you down with us  
Nigga you scared when a St. Clair nigga bust 
Aw Fuck left his guts in my trunk nigga tried a 211 fucked around got 187
