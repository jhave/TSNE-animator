Verse 1: Peter Gunz

It took a long time sittin in your one and only
niggas said they comin in a month or so 
but they run though, 
how they really want it, want all the rain and thunder shit
niggaz talkin this hocus pocus, focus
on the lyrical, lyrical content
from the Bronx to Compton, say enormous
hit the CD stay sober, listen tell we smoke a blunt
listen get sound, give it to you, give it to you
dont be alarmed, sound affects normal
and I'm a MD not a MC, 
step a head said of that shit in your walk in
you singin I give you somethin to bounce to and think about
that the same crew, with the same lou
on the same rhyme, step on education at the same time
play mine, it'll bite you like a K-9, obey mine 
like Sprite nigga, get it right nigga, with the right nigga
tight for the calm shit, it be bomb shit,
every day, all day, his way, ya'll way
see you in the hallway, the floor way, 4-4 way
did you call before me, now give me

verse 2: Lord Tariq

Yo L-o-r-d you gunz done block scared me
