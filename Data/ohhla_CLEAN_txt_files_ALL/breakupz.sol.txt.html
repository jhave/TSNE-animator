[Intro: Ghostface Killah] + (Solomon Childs)
DJ in the biz, DJ and the beats (Ashanti, Theodore, Solomon Childs)
Radio shining (what's poppin') This is Uncle Ghost right here
My nephew named me that, youknowhatimsayin'
Baby, yo, show my little nephew some love, youknowhatimsayin'

[Solomon Childs]
I miss you being a part of my world
Admit, we used to have so much fun, didn't we girl?
Like ice cream strawberries, from Ben &amp; Jerry's
Had you blowin' nothin' but blueberries
Sleepin' in nothing, but Burberry
Lady Datus, tans on the sand in Barbaros
Lips look sweeter than Kool-Aid
Before I let the track fade
For your love, I'll travel millions of miles
To see your kinky eyes, and sweet smile

[Ashanti]
Saw you again for the first time, been a long time
It brought up all these feelings, that I never knew, I had inside
Seeing you with another girl, it didn't sit with me too well
And I'm mad at myself cuz I love you, and without you I'm going through hell

[Chorus 2X: Ashanti]
I didn't think that I could shake us
But baby, can we make up
I know that this is kinda crazy
But baby, I wanna make up

[Ashanti]
I never knew, what could love you, how I love you
I thought that I was through with you so glad I could be single
Now I'm caught thinking bout the past, and wish that we could just go back
And I'm mad at myself, cuz I love you and I really want you, to come home baby

[Chorus 2X]

[Ashanti]
I don't know if I'm crazy
But all the pain and the heartache you gave me
That only made me, wanna get back with you
Held your hand, the way you held mind
You felt it, the way you felt mine
And all that fighting that we went through
See I was already used to it

[Solomon Childs]
All I ask is for you, is to give you Big Poppa, 'one more chance'
To prove you wrong, look in my eyes while I'm singin' this song
Tickle all your places, that you thought would never make you laugh
And on the little man, baby, we can go half
And anything in my power, don't be shy, baby you can just ask
And I admit, I took advantage of your love
I apoligize, love, should of never took advantage, damn

[Chorus to fade w/ Ghostface Killah ad-libs]</pre>
