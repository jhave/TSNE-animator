[Rick Ross]
Time is money (mula) Mind is funny (yes)
Trust me she lying if she denying she love me
Make up ya mind you been on and off (Ross)
Platinum petron come take shots with a boss

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
If you came to get the party started girl just say lalalalalaaa
I want to put my hands all over your body girl come this way Nananananaaa
What you gon' do oo-oo, if I touch you if I put my lips on you oo-oo
If we took you back to the crib just me and you oo-oo
All night I want to play just say lalalalalaaa
Just take off your clothes and just lay back
All you gotta do is just lay back
Would you do this for me baby Just lay back, lay back (Boss) lalalalalaaa

[Rick Ross]
Girl I'm bright as a bezel, and you sexy as ever
Shorty what's on your brain, cause whatever is clever
Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar
This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather
run a few errands (Ross), summers in Paris
never shopping in clearance, don't make me embarrased
She never a bird, but baby my parrot
Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots
My house is her home, I made her a palette
Maybe being too modest, my shit more like a palace
Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter
Shawty brace yourself, it's only getting better

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]

[Rick Ross]
See shawty laid back, so we laid up
When I fade to black, we always made up
This shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of
Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors
Have 700s, first one to get it
My car's a virgin, first one to hit it
Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood
Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feeling good
Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip
I'ma hit the club, I'ma buy the VIP
We spending money, I'm talking slick
I hope she ride me, I'm talking stick

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]

[Rick Ross]
I'm too tipsy to drive, she so sexy tonight
Man ain't treating you right his bank account can't be in sight
Shawty you need a plus, you need a rush
No need to lie, baby you need to fuck

[Robin Thicke]
Came to get it started girl
Put my hands all over you girl
I touch you put my lips on you girl
Na na na na naaa</pre>
