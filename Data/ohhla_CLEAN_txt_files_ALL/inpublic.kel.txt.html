[Kelis (Nas)]

You see, it's this thing (Kelis)
I like being single (ha ha)
Outside....in my mind (Get +Tasty+)
I liked the way we were (Cookies - +Tasty+)
(+Tasty+, yeah, let's go)

[verse 1 - Kelis]

He was next to me (come closer)
Our flight was s'posed to leave around 2:53
All I wanted to see
Is what would he do if I dropped down to my knees
I wanna play a game
If someone come in, it don't matter, just the same (I like it)
Try something fun with me
Let's take our clothes off all over the balcony

[Chorus - Kelis (Nas)]

Let's get it on In Public
Just let it go, I promise that you'll love it
Oh Daddy, don't you wanna be my soldier? (yeah)
Ooo-oooh, let's get it on In Public, oooh

[Verse 2 - Kelis]

Don't try to run from me
I'll make your toes curl up and make your body scream
Come take a walk with me
We can do it over there by all the trees
Drive this car real fast
I'll lay my head and I'll make your body blast
Oww!

[Chorus]

[Kelis] (Nas)

Let's make a movie baby (Sit over there)
Can we get away with it? (Open your legs)
I'll be an animal (yeah)
All lights on (I wanna see you)
I like it when we do it to this song (You like that)

Let's make a movie baby
Can we get away with it? (I'll be directing, heh)
So nasty
All lights on (I like to see)
I like it when we do it to this song (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Yeah? Talk to me

[Verse 3 - Nas (Kelis)]

The pussy or the mouth? That is the question (Okay) like Shakespeare
but my erection is the case here (yeah)
I ain't got time to drive you all the way home
But instead I can slide you to a club bathroom (Okay)
or a restaurant's men's room
Then I can zoom in your womb
We both get what we want (Okay), then we can assume
to doing what we was, smokin' that bud and chillin'
But first I got it up, before anything, you willing?
To win it, it's animal behaviour
La chic, la freak-out, with a sexy beast ma (yeah?), who slays ya
This is for the mature who love the natural love-
-making outdoors on the hood of your car (Ohh, yeah)
Nas is good at it all when it comes to givin' it ?war?
Do I have to convince you now?
We don't need hotel keys
We jump in the trunk and stain everything upside ya G-string

[Chorus] *with Nas ad-libs*
repeat 2x

[Nas (Kelis)]

*Kelis moans*
So nasty, girl
If they gon' see us, cool, they gon' see us (haha)
I think they seen us, hahahaha
Kelis, sexy beast (yeah)
Yeah, Nasty Nas (that's my boy)
Yeah, uh, outside, in my ride, ha
Let's ride, ma
Yeah, let's go</pre>
