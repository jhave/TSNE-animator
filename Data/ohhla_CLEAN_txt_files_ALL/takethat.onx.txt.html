[Sticky Fingaz]
Seem like the only thoughts would be negative
But shit, I'd never give, I need a sedative
I'mma forever live, the one and only, murderer
Defeat, I never heard of that
Push ya head, throw the back, gettin that, word to gat
The most coatable, a number two of niggas when there's a show to do
You know the true Official Nast niggas, I blow a hole in you
I'm sellin tracks not cracks, you buyin or what?
Cuz I be in your crib right now, tyin you up
Corams jack ya house, put the gat to your spouse mouth
And clean the place, kill the kids, do they see my face?
It's the cream I taste, he thinkin my way, be the race
We the mischief who raise the most hell
Onyx in the Bible, Genesis 2, verse 12
And that's the life, that I lead
Niggas walk around town like they can't bleed
So take that, where your heart is at
So take that, yeah, what
Take that and that and that and that and that</pre>
