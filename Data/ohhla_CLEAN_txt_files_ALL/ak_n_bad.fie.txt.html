[Fiend/Skull Duggery]
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, yes I am, yes I am
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad

[Skull Duggery]
Like the bitch I appear dead in your shit
Make you run from the thoughts nigga, that'll conflict
I maintain in murder hood shit (murder hood shit)
Cause I'm a Third Ward Stunter, uptown roamer, 
from Second and Clara nigga
I get ya, I wet ya, I told ya
Niggas still can get hit and run from that shit
Trying to get to a save havan where he can die at, where he can cry at
Where that lance fill the soul, he cold
As I make it round the block (round the block), 
squeezing hard (squeezing hard)
Forty five nigga, in my right palm (in my right palm)
As I get to your spot, nigga you cold (you cold)
So I left three shots off in you low (every shot in you low)
Cause I told you I'm from the Crescent (Crescent) 
where you testin (testin)
Big easy nigga, get dirty down and greasy nigga
Nigga, feed my mind with the evil thoughts, 
I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
Cause I told ya nigga, I'm ak'n bad (I'm ak'n bad)

[Fiend/Skull Duggery]
We ak'n bad, ak'n bad, yes I am, yes I am
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad

[Fiend]
Bring it where the dirt lies cause I was seeking it to destroy
Under twenty five and I caused a killer to die and I'm unemployed
I takes no joy up in another mans pain
But in my mind somehow I hate to find the word called strain
Obtain machan' before you place me in the game
I'm a survivor, watch they holler when I let loose this thang
And I'm swamp and gumbo living
So if yall niggas coming with 'em, 'fore I rid 'em
Yall better talk some senses in 'em
Cause New Orleans niggas don't yap where I'm from
Bust backs with a gun, up in the club, get to clapping and swung
And my bullets don't hum, they burn
And it ain't no aftermath if you catch a nigga ak'n bad
I make this loud shit sound good, knock on wood
Who am I, little nigga up to no good, out the hood
Watch me show you what I could, I got with a spatch' and a half
Look at my lyrical habit for cabbage, bitch you see me ak'n bad

[Fiend/Skull Duggery]
We ak'n bad, ak'n bad, yes I am, yes I am
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad

[Mystikal]
How many niggas yall know will come in this bitch
Take out an album and drum on the track
How many niggas yall know even gonna try to come close
To doin what I done on the track
I'm the one on the track, smoking like I'm blowing a blunt on the track
I'm out in front of the track, bustin like a forty five gun on the track
Yall know what I know yall better step aside and let the best come in
And yall niggas that talkin that shit yall really better catch some wind
You fuckin with Fiend, you fuckin with Skull, you fuckin with me
I'll fuck you up the same time I fuck up the beat
You can't stop ak'n bad, ak'n bad
I gets way up in your ass, in your ass
I gets paid a lotta cash, lotta cash
Oh ah ah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Bitch I'm hard and I will roll, I'm still cold
Twenty eight years old (got plenty more) got plenty more
Bitch I'm the man, cars hanging out the garage, 
lights on top of flashing pads
Like my little brother Reece I'll take a licking and keep on

[Fiend/Skull Duggery]
We ak'n bad, ak'n bad, yes I am, yes I am
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad
I'm ak'n bad, ak'n bad, we ak'n bad</pre>
