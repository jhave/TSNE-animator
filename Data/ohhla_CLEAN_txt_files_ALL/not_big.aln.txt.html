Now listen I think you and me have come to the end of our time
What do you want, some kind of reaction?
Well OK, that's fine
Alright, how would it make you feel if I said you never made me cum?
In the year and a half that we spent together
Yeah I never really had much fun

All those times that I said I was sober
Well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you and you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite
I could see it in your face as you break it to me gently
You really must think you're great
Let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks
When I work my way through your mates

I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game

So you thought this was gonna be easy
Well, you're out of luck
Yeah, let's rewind, let's turn back time to when you couldn't get it up
You know what, it should've ended there
That's when I should've shown you the door
As if that weren't enough to deal with
You became premature

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state.
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me
Gonna reciprocate.

I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game

You're not big, you're not clever
No, you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever
You're not big, you're not clever
No, you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm being kinda mental
But you left me in such a state
But now I'm gonna do what you did to me
I'm gonna reciprocate

I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you're rubbish in bed now
And that you're small in the game

You're not big, you're not clever
No, you ain't a big brother
Not big what so ever

You're not big, you're not clever
Not big what so ever
No, you ain't a big brother Oh

You're not big, you're not clever
Not big what so ever....
