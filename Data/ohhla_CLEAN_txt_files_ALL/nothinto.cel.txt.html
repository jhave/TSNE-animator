[Scratch Chorus]
"If you're ready for this say you're ready for this" - Schooly D 'Peace To The Nation'

[Intro] [Celph talking]
Yeah, uh, Celph motherfuckin'. Get it right
My man Rise. What up boy? It's that classic Demigodz shit
Oh yeah. It's that classic Buckwild shit
Oh yeah. And it's a No Sleep movement. Takin' over
So if it ain't about that...(I don't even know)
I guess we ain't got nothin' to say man. Let's go

[Verse One] [Celph Titled]
Celph Titled's not your ordinary street rhymer
I'm like Evil Dee and Mr. Walt, I beat miners (Beatminerz)
And even old timer's get a broken nose
cause I murder rappers with words I wrote down on Posted Notes
We order straps and magazines from the back of magazines
Here's an under statement (What?)
I'm an average MC
Take it how you want it (oh)
I got a target with your face on it
Shoot it up till there ain't no face on it
For a fact, fact four, matter, matter of fact
Put your format on disc and press 'Format'
There's no doormat at
The laboratory I create raps in
You need a special card just to get your ass in
So here, read my brochure 
It guarantees you ain't havin' no career and no tour
(For sure)
I'm here to bring rap trouble
never rocked a four finger ring just some brass knuckles

[Chorus]
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"I don't care what you say" - Queen Latifah
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"That's right"
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?

[Verse Two] [Rise]
Now people recognize the name and say that, "Rise is nice"
Before they didn't recognize they called me "Rahs" or "Rice"
I hold it down
Even if I don't make it stores soon rappin'
Pullin' things outta nowhere like cartoons
I gotta, follow my mind and my own advice
So I can drop overnight like the price of flights
Or not, horrible struggles, stories work so well
Losin' weight, broke, punchin' extra holes in your belt
Look, I don't know what happened
Your pulse just fell
Cause I'm the know it all, do nothing, stuck on his self
The helps in helps and stops when the help ain't felt
And that's a problem right?
Like when I drink by myself
I think by myself and people tend to stay when I play
I work hard without a job, what day is today?
Relate if you play what I play or would have did this your way
The stock in me Rise, I'm good, I don't care what I say

[Chorus]
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"I don't care what you say" - Queen Latifah
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"That's right"
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?

[Verse Three] [Celph Titled]
Hey hey
And I'ma shout at ya
Fuck with your safety like Hulk Hogan's son's passengers
I give mouth's fractures
Now the cops is out after a wild south rapper wildin' out at a
Country club with a bat clobbering golf carts
While you servin' burgers at the McDonalds in Wal-Mart
Ten G's to ball park (Whoa)
Figure that I get for one show
Ten minutes and then dip
I magnificent, like the Biz Markie
My Cadillac, push button start, I don't need car keys
You will bleed, these are sharks teeth
Make a mark deep, in your arteries (pardon me)
Kill you with harsh speech
Piss on a slut, so rude, make my cock leak
So she be havin' pee (Hav &amp; P) like those two dudes from Mobb Deep
+Scenerio+ with Dinco D that's my ring tone beep
My chrome heat with free space like a Bingo sheet

[Chorus]
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"I don't care what you say" - Queen Latifah
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?
"You know what?" - Queen Latifah
Hey, hey
"You know what?"
Hey, hey
"That's right"
You see we don't got nothin' to say so we gon'
So we gon' make a damn song about nothin' okay?</pre>
