[Intro]
Yo what's up, this Daz Dillinger
Givin' shouts out to all my homeboys and homegirls out there
Yeah, keep it gangsta'd up
If it wasn't for y'all, we wouldn't be who we are today
(Dogg Pound!)..

[Daz Dillinger]
Fresh on the scene, Diggity Daz keep green
Havin' money and dope, with a gang of doe
Eastside is the spot where I hustle for pennies and dimes
If you didn't know, this Dogg Pound for life
I peel out and skate, I feel the breeze with the top down
Glidin' and flossin' through the town, gold D's, low pro's
Hundred spokes lookin' clean to a T with a triple beam
I got a take for all these suckas, I don't sweat no other
Hit the switch, peel out, burn rubber on you sick motherfuckers
I make 'em bounce... everybody, they love to bounce
Get some drink, that's what I'm talkin' about (Dat Nigga Daz!)
Pop the trunk and let the bass thump
Turn it up as loud as it can, bump the land
Every project, neighborhood, spot, and block -
Turn up the beat, so I bail out the spot
Good for 66 for hundred, and a half is 250, and an ounce is 500
Which one is the bombest?
All my homies that slang chronic on the block
We some fools niggaz, fuck the cops
All my niggaz yellin' -
Every-where we go, they want to see how
We just keep it so D-P-G
All my homies yellin' -

[Chorus]
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
Cause you a gangsta, gangsta
You know I love them gangstas, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Everybody's yellin' - )
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
I love them gangsta, gangstas
Just keep it gangsta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All my West Coast niggaz - keep it gangsta'd up
Gangsta'd up, gangsta'd up
All my East Coast niggaz - keep it gangsta'd up
Gangsta'd up, gangsta'd up
All my Midwest niggaz - keep it gangsta'd up
Gangsta'd up, gangsta'd up
All my Dirty South niggaz - keep it gangsta'd up
Gangsta'd up, gangsta'd up

[Daz Dillinger]
Ridin', fuck the law
Swervin' with my homegirls, yeah you know what you saw
Swervin' with my hydraulics, homie I can't call it
I grip the heat for these suckas that I meet in the street (booa-boo ya)
Cause I'm stackin' my paper, I'm 'bout my business
Never fallin' in these hoodrat bitches, they keep callin'
When I stalk that's when I master the art
Drinkin' satin in the park after eight when it's dark
I smoke - blunt after blunt, smoke joint after joint
Eleven to seven to prove my point (suckas)
I'm on the grind when I shine and it just won't stop
Hot soundin', flag security and fuck the cops
Another zone to the head
Roll it up, fire it up, light it up, it's just us
Gat tucked under the seat, these days I play for keeps
If you're cold homeboy you catch heat
All my homies yellin' -
Every-where we go, they want to see how
We just keep it so D-P-G
All my homies yellin' -

[Chorus]
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
Cause you a gangsta, gangsta
You know I love them gangstas, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All my homies yellin' - )
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
I love them gangsta, gangstas
Just keep it gangsta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
Cause you a gangsta, gangsta
You know I love them gangstas, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just keep it gangsta, gangsta
I love them gangsta, gangstas
Just keep it gangsta, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Daz Dillinger]
What do you consider fun? (gangsta ball, gangsta ball)
All day, night, and all day long (gangsta ball, gangsta ball)
When you wake up in the morning and you start to yawn (gangsta ball, gangsta ball)
All day, night, and all day long (gangsta ball, gangsta ball)

[Outro]
Yeah! I wanna give it up to all them DPG fans out there
Keep hittin' me up, dpgrecordz.com
I wanna give it up to all the people up in Canada, Japan, Australia, Holand
All the people in the States, y'all know what time it is
All them ghetto hoods out there, y'all just keep it gangsta
Keep your head up, fuck all that bullshit that you go through everyday
Cause tomorrow might be a brighter day
Everyday, all day, keep doin' what you're doin', don't stop
Always remember the dream will always be fulfilled if you're the one to fulfill it
