[Intro: sample]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out, for you

[Eminem]
I'm just so fuckin depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need somethin to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or, why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow, but I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

[Chorus: Eminem]
In my shoes, just to see, what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh-ohh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so-ohh-oh!
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautifulllll, oh-ohh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to youuuuuu, so-ohh-oh!

[Eminem]
Yeah
I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
I walk in it's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation, like I want that
I'm not lookin for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin man-servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "HA!
Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own!
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of bein that cool kid, even if it meant actin stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, "Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

[Chorus]

[sample] + (Eminem)
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own (oh-ohh)
Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone (so-ohh-oh!)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (oh-ohh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out, for you (so-ohh-oh!)

[Outro: Eminem - echoing]
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
So-ohh-oh!</pre>
