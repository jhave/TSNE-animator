[Baby D]
My nigga what you know about the ATL-A-N-T-A, GA my nigga we swervin

Who that be me B-A-B-Y D from da B-I-G double O-M-P
I said it before but I'm goin to say it again
My nigga we too D double E-P
I represent the dirty dirty south
Down here lil buddy we don't play no games
I represent the A-T-L 
Eastside shawty and the Westside niggas on da thang throw your hood up
Make your shoulder jump 
If ya hatin on the "A" then lock'em in the trunk
Ya don't know who you fuckin with 
But I'll bet we'll bounce on your motherfuckin ass like it ain't shit
ATL Hoe throwin up them "A's" 
Gangsta walk on the motherfuckin stage
Nigga watch me bounce on these sucka ass punks
Then fuck around and got the "A" town started
Don't make me say "Ain't told you so"
Throwin bows to the nose sayin "Yeah Hoe!"
Pastor Troy, Archie, and Big Oomp click
Add it up young nigga that Gangsta shit!

(Chorus)

[Archie]
Yeah, yeah 
Nigga it's Archie
The phatest skinny nigga you will ever know
Try'in to stop my cheddar flow holla at my beretta blow
Atcha dome and atcha chest
Wear your chrome and wear your vest
Had your home a bloody mess 
Faked thugs get bless with a slug to the chest
Arch to the "I" to the "E"
Passin Baby D beside me
Eastside Boyz is right behind me
"A" town bitch nigga you try'in to find me
Simpson Road down to Godbe 
These are the places that I be
These are the faces that I see
I die for the city don't play by me

You can try me if you wanna Archie be brin'in drama
Pistol carriers bury ya make you say "We The Bomb Ya!"
Death before dishonor put that on my mama
The phat boy representer 'till I'm a goner
Yeah! Nigga!

(Chorus)

[Pastor Troy]
Pistol pistol my pistol banana fanna Atlanta
Bombin on the bitch the young the filthy rich
The six I use to drive was live but under rated
I cut off the top and had the V12 gold plated
But some niggas hated they do not hated in public
Them pussy ass niggas gon make me jump to my bucket
The brown one with the three rims 
I whoop up on your block nigga your chance slim 
Do you remember Tim they call him "Poor Timmy"
I fuck his pussy over his hammy with a fifty rimmy
Think you are nigga friendly cause I'm the Pastor
Bitch I ain't Creflow this ATL Hoe

(Chorus)

We rrrreeeeeeeeeaaaaaaddddddyyyyyy</pre>
