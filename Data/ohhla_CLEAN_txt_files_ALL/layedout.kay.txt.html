[Verse One: Bun B]
II Trill gladiator Rap-A-Lot soldier
Fingers up, haters down, niggas should have told ya
Lookin down on this team you must be on meth (Meth)
We nothin but them riders and we ridin to the death (Death)
Ya better make a left 'fore it won't be alright (Right)
Cause when niggas get the ridin bitch we ridin all night (Night)
And you'll be amazed (Mazed) When we get to disrespectin 
Niggas like we Kanye, at the VMA's,  hold up!
 
[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out, some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out

[Verse Two: Twista]
Let 'em know it's all good even though they know that Twis' misunderstood
Say slick, talk shit, I wish (I Wish) You Would (You Would)
I ride (I ride) Stay strapped (Stay strapped) I box (I box) I roll (I roll)
And if we get into then I won't hit ya with the knuckles
I'm a hit ya with the black fo' fo'
So cold, If I see ya in the club and the bitch started
the knockout I let ya know you better holla mayday
I'm a call lord then I'm folks that wanna get you stuck
then I'm a hop and call Kay Slay
Stop a motherfucker I say really, then and furthermore
I roll up and stuff him like a Philly
Pop a motherfucker like a pill or wheelie
If the Twista wanna drop a motherfucker get the milli

[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out 
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid

[Verse Three: Papoose]
Somebody gon' get laid out, pull the gauge out, blow his brains out 
He tough, let it hang out, pus, let it drain out
Pull the shank out, cut his vein out
Nigga came out with his chain out and his shades out
And his braids out, said he hates East and he hates South
Talkin with a hate mouth, I'll smack the taste out
Now he stashed in a bodybag with his head out
Shotty blast, everybody dash when I bang out
I give orders like take-out
He ain't wanna play the house, but he's aced out
Whatchu fist fightin for? Whacha face 'bout?
I put the +Flava to Ya Ear+ when the +Mack+ blow the +Craig+ out
Make 'em hit the ground like the {?} threw his leg out
Scream at the crowd, where they ball we ain't came out
And show him with the Auto like T-Pain mouth
Pa-POOSE, Pa-POOSE, I'ma show 'em what my name 'bout!
 
[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out 
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid
some-some-some-somebody
 
[Verse Four: Dorrough]
Say, somebody hit 'em (hit 'em!)
That shit talkin gon' get 'em stomped up
Yea - better hope the shoe don't fit 'em
If it do (whaaaaa??), you through
Fuck you and yo' crew
I don't move, the goons shootin out the blue (Br-r-r-RAT!!)
Turn this bitch into a hoe into a serenade, getcha whole body sprayed
47 AK, now ya ass +Kay Slayed+ UP!!
Boy, you got me fucked up
Keep bumpin ya gums, getcha mouth tied up
(Bitch!)
 
[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out 
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid
some-some-some-somebody
 
[Verse Five: Young Chris]
Bodybags Balboa bitch I got a "ay" for your Rocky ass
Leavin holes all up in yo' face, like a hockey mask
Want drama let it be, put 'em under Pleasure P
Put 'em to the test and see, bet you niggas rest in P-E-A-C-E, too raw for TV
Meet your maker +Final Destination+ hater 3D
I murder production y'all boys can't see me
Got a better chance beatin a murder with a P.D.
 
[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out 
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid
some-some-some-somebody
 
[Verse Six: Jay Rock]
Who followed me home?! Drop it like Angola stones
Poppin my disc is like poppin ya dome
with the K/Kay, +Slay+ rappers in the circumference of the own home
It's my world, see my face in the ozone? (Whoo!)
Before I was on the cover of magazines
I was loadin up, duckin for cover with magazines
Clips like a hairdresser, getcha doobie clean
Welcome to Hell mister, I own niggas and cheese
 
[Chorus: 50 Cent Sample]
Somebody 'gon get layed the fuck out
some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid the fuck out 
Some-some-some-somebody 'gon get laid
some-some-some-somebody
