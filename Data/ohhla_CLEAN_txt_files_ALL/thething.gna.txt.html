Verse One: Raekwon the Chef

Yo... Son, yo check it
Stay ladylike, get yours, fly perm, silk drawers
Les Paulie, ice your finger like Rollie
Collect em, weapon, plus we side-bettin, never wettin
Me and you, glowin like flourescent
Now, Asiatic, laces burned with a rabbit
Stab it, maintain mine, she gotta have it
Knowin you catchin me in lies
Snatchin me out of fives boo, yo you the shake, I'm the fries
Chill, daughter, you're Navy Seal real recorder
Peace, Law and Order, God-body hit it underwater
Relax, HBO yo, color Kangol
You're sweet mango, no champagne tango
Keep my Sky Pager blazin, so amazin
Rubbin my waves and your rock is the size of a raisin
Gettin it, youse a Queen Sarafina, Gina
Hittin it, doin ninety witcha man's Nina

Chorus: Gina Thompson

The things you do (every lit-tle thing)
Makes me keep running to you (ohwwhhhhhh)

Makes me keep running to you (ahhhowwwowhhh)

Verse Two: Mr. Mike Nitty

Baby doll, you got the world goin out of control

Got these other wannabe divas, very mad at this
D-O-D hold the fort down (yeah yeah kid)
Mr. Mike Nitty lace it up somethin proper
Smoked out in the back of a chopper, the chief rocker
Shorty slim with the big brim and Miss Thai Stick

Verse Three: Craig Mack

Yo check it

So as my style climbs you sink to the bottom
I'm a rugged, mad murderahh
Undiscovered, rockin rhymes to your dearly beloved
Your girl love it, rap style never second
King MC, and baddest man on this record
So check it, I flip my words dope just for Gina
Felony on the microphone when youse a misdemeanor (hahhh)
Origi-nal, non stop rockin you
Dig into my dresser, MC's it's stuff for sockin you
Up and down like a Wall Street stock'll do
I shake the planet boy you only shake a block or two
Ahmmm-gain, as my feet steady
Creep into a haunted house and lounge where the bed be
Ultra like Ced Gee, member my nigga

Hahhhhhhhh-haaa!

Baby, it's the things you do
Baby baby, it's the things you so
