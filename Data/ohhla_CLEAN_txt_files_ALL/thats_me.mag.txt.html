Magic talking:

I'm that motherfucking nigga everyone asking about.
Yall know who the fuck this is.
That nigga nigga Mr. Magic. (huh)
That nigga nigga Mr. Magic.

Chorus x2

That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with P?)
That's me motherfucker that's me (Who that is be with C?)
That's me motherfucker that's me 
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking Magic

Verse 1: 

I treat the mic like a blunt so watch Mr. Magic get high
spitting lyrical fire 'til they day i die
Yall remember me as that shadow that jumped out of the midst
making hit after hit and got the whole rap game pissed
Got 'em wondering where I came from
straight from hell the first nigga to make Lucifer run
You underestimate my consistency
Look like you waiting a weak verse nigga you might as well get rid of me
Mad cause you can't trigger me
Which angle is I come from, mad cause you can't catch me son
I already won and believe the best is yet to come
I'll be flippin MC's until the day that I'm deceased
and got every record label waiting on my contract to be released
I mean all in the pentenaries, niggas is probably mentioning me
Give or take a couple of years, I'll be the man eventually
You can't stop what supposed to be
I'm the one, I'm the chosen man, That's ME

Chorus x2

Verse 2: 

I'm the whisper you can hear in every project hall
the conversation you can hear through every crack in the wall
the funny noises you can hear in your house when it's dark
the biggest upset in years cause im at the top of the charts
got niggas wondering why the fuck they struggling
I guess that's a fucked position that Magic put you in
But it's my turn so give me some breathing room
you aint on a nigga's ass killer but that's cool
It's all to be expected shit you let me know I'm competion 
but there's alot more to me that you niggas couldn't even vision
give you a run for your money and bitch I'll take your shit
I'll run your pussy ass home like a bitch
See aint no studio up in me, better not offend me
I'll rape Barney and kill Officer Friendly
shoot at the sheriff and the motherfucking deputy
See I'm the one you looking for motherfucker that's ME

Chorus x2 

Verse 3: 

Just name a designated time and a designated place
point them niggas out and  I promise they be erased
Ain't a fake bone in my body, If I did I'd take it out
In front of the whole world so nobody would have doubt
that nobody could take me out, I'm just in a half-clout
Forgive me if I'm wrong but my money is what I'm bout
My dope is high coat, smoking po-po till I die
trying to make a couple mill 'fore the age of 25
I spin and been like a motherfucking tornado
cut your from nose to navel, now that shit gonna potato
It's kinda hard to believe that a nigga like me from the C-T-C
Went from serving fiends to posing in magazines
Nigga we hustled on the same corner
the only difference is my hustle was a little stronger
I say you should go and fear, you got the right worry
cause I was created to make end careers early, ya heard me?
That's me motherfucker that's me (huh)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
That's me motherfucker that's me (nigga nigga what)
I'm the one they call Mr. fucking huh what

Chorus x2

Magic talking: 

And if you dont know now you motherfucking know</pre>
