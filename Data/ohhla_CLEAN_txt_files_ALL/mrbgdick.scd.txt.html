All right Mr. Big Dick

Schoolly, I got to tell you, you get the best ass I ever done seen
you got it to a total science

Yeah man, we here tonight, we gonna talk about something
get straight to the point, some of us were talkin about it
straight to the tip

1-2-3 ...
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are

Hey Schoolly, tell me about your dick, talk about your dick
come on tell me about it. I want to hear about your dick

Um, lookin at my dick it's about that long
For me to really answer it I'ma need another song

Say some brothers who don't realize
That Mr. Big Dick is always on the rise
To look at mine you need four eyes
Why? Because of the size
Me and Mr. Big Dick go everywhere together
In the cold the hot any weather
On the ave I always will hold it
When it get big sometimes I will fold it
All you girls with the big booties
It is my duty to fuck you cutie
Don't be shy and don't be slick
Cos that's the big question

Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are

I was sittin in my Lincoln thinkin and stinkin
See a young lady and my eyes start blinkin
I say hey lady, you need a ride
Before I finish, she jumped inside
Lights in and I bust a nut
As I look at them thighs and the big fat butt
I looked a little closer and checked out her face
I said damn Schoolly man what a disgrace
I got this fat bitch in my ride
I see my old money and I wanted to hide
He laughed so hard he wanted to die
I said you suckin dick, she jumped inside
Took the girl for a ride out in the park
Way way way way back in the dark
I said now listen baby, act real flirty
Get in the back and get your knees dirty
Don't act shy and act real slick
Cos that's the big question 

Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are

People say I'm vulgar they just don't get it 
They'd rather have me stand on stage then try to rig it
I'd rather meet a honey, pull out all my money
Get back and say something funny
Like don't act shy, don't act slick
Cos that's the big question

Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
Mr. Big Dick ... who do you think you are
