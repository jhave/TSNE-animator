Eh-body always wanna know what know what the G
In Kool G Rap stand for, Giancana nigga, gangsta
Quick to gank ya ass with the Gaincana gash gash
You heard

[Kool G Rap]
Yo here come the one who's know to keep it thoro,
Queens the borough (straight up)
Is live nigga rep that (no doubt)
Cock the techs back and move on a weak clique (move on 'em)
We deep bitch
And none of my Gorillas is scared to leak shit
All y'all niggas wanna speak slick -what you say- (what)
It couldn't be thick and quick to flied'em dicks 
As soon as the heat spit 
Stitch your fucking feet to a brick
Enjoy then bait 
Heats to chicks we creep when we flip gyms
Cana baby thug for life are love is life
Guns, hoes, drugs and iceaight 
How your heart pump kool-aid when is brood and mice
How you trying to fight slugs with knives (don't do that) bitch nigga
Liquor (don't do that) plenty gun talk front for New York 
And went to draw a stick figure (ha, ha)
Bounty your head for 'bout six figures, cook a bitch liver 
End of the wall who lift the fifth quicker nigga (you know me)
My whole approach sicker 
So all you rappers with names hot as flames
I'll be there when the shit flicker (get'em)
This ones about war gunslinger (get'em)
And brick flipper big dick don G rap nigga piss rivers

[Chorus]
Drama, is the life I live
Bossing, is the things I did
Problems, is the things I finish 
I been known from hood to hood to handle business 
Money, is them things I take 
Ladies, come on and bounce with me 
G Rap, I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you' bout your cake

[Kool G Rap]
Ayo my whole life is under non-fiction 
Drama friction 
Beef blood in the street bullets with bombs ticking 
Just to become a don from sinning 
Horrible living G Cana the street boss peoples loss
Left a dog reap in the cost 
Had to go deep in the forest 
To hold police frost peeping the floss 
Conduct family biz have my own Sammidy Sam kids
And pump fizz were you live (oow)
Run up in a house and put a hand on a wiz
Give me fifty grand to live (Bitch)
G Rap Americas Most see the name embedded in toast
I'm here to all y'all niggas perish and quote 
We lost money but cherish the dope
Meat cleavers sever your throat 
The smoke, for the big bread and the a boat 
So all you guys with gimmicks (die, die, die) 
Skies the limit better believe it
That I'm gonna ride every minute
And this games about posh and spinach 
And the lifer this shit get the love for menace 
Never violate the lines of scrimmage 
G Rap Giancana kid I'm vow to keep it life to the
finish (uh-hu) yeah

[Chorus]
Drama, is the life I live
Bossing, is the things I did 
Problems, is the things I finish 
I been known from hood to hood to handle business 
Money, is them things I take 
Ladies, come on and bounce with me 
G Rap, I damn from far from fake
Throw your steel in the air if you' bout your cake

If you 'bout your cake 
If you 'bout your cake

All about that cake

Yeah, Giancana, mob boss nigga, what uh</pre>
