Alright it's getting really close to the election day
I'm voting please don't cut off my section eight
As soon as pastor pass the collection plate
I'm like shit I'm trying to stack for a escalade
But pay your ties times money
I divise wise cunning little plans
To withstand when cats drive by funny
Like I ain't got what he got I don't play that
Nigga we fade cats that don't fuck with j-cats
You're trying to act like a boss save it patna
The first and fifteenth you be be hittin up yo baby mama
And you know that money for the baby
No he ain't right at the stop light looking at me crazy
Seems like your get up and go done got up and left
You're trying to throw with dononan yo you gotta be def
'Cause I can flow like donovaon bro sound supersonic
Pouring gin and tonic with some chronic to blow

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
On the microphone
Here we go

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go

He mad cause I gave the dick to his favorite chick
You know the flavor patna tried to savor quick but
That behavior really just made her sick hah

If not then don't say shit to me
Shit this independent dope we splurgin and
Boy I'm going to stay in the cut like sea urchins
Hah poetical progresive poppin it proper
Ask them cats I made a mess of rockin it

Still got connects on them A1 ostriches
Not the type that will spoil my women
I just take'm to the crib so they can soil my linen

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go

Been 'bout ten long years still come flawless
The lawless warrior William Wallace
Rappin' 'till I get a million dollars
Like home girl strippin still in college
Trying to get paper'd up
Please huh believe I help her breathe like vapo-rub
Rock the mic in your favorite club
Rock flavors like haters might step on the the gators right? shit...
From the bay to decatur the mic motivator hold a mic like yoda hold a saber
You know the flavor watch your behaviors
Cool I'm off to Handsome Boy Modelling School
And best believe I got a locker full of Vodka and Backwoods
I can play the doctor and start writing prescription
If you fighting addictions I'm right in the distance
My music enlightens who listens check it out

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go

It's like that and-a you know
This is all original and that's how it goes
It's like that and-a you know
Here we go</pre>
