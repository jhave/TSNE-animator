(Hook)
This is a day in the life
See I make big money, and I fuck niggas wives
And I only skate twenty-fo's
Young pimpin still slammin them Chevrolet doors
This is a day in the life
See I make big money, and I fuck niggas wives
And I only skate twenty-fo's
Young pimpin still slammin them Cadillac doors

(Verse 1)
Got my old school Chevelle, and it's ruby and brown
And the car make that "vroom-vroom, schrrrr" sound
When I pass by ya place, they say "turn down the bass"
But I keep on turnin it up
I know ya don't like me, talkin about'cha wan' fight me
Jump brave dame, show me whats up
Movin on to some other thangs, I just want some chicken wangs
With a lil' barbecue sauce
Say my money young honey, what the fuck, is you a dummy?
Shit, actin like yo ass is the boss
That sign say McDonalds, not Mac'Kims
Actin like you're shy, with them dirty ass Tim's
Move over, Range Rover
I'm comin in this bitch much colder
In a chromed-out, shagged-down Escalade
Bass turned up, sittin peanut-butter suede

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
I'm thirty-five years old, and I'm filthy rich
And by the way dude, I been fuckin ya bitch
And I got her buck-naked, ridin up in the Vette
And every time she see me, young pussy get wet
You might love your baby-momma, but I like her a lot
For real though dude, you ain't got what I got
And that lil' girl buddy, she look like Wayne
Maybe you should think about changin a name
I got another story, let me tell ya how it go
'Bout a football nigga, that was fuckin my ho
He was hangin with the tramp, like day and night
But what dude don't know, is that I'm fuckin his wife
And by the way mistaaaa, I even fucked ya sistaaaa
I got'cha momma fucked up, payin all of my bills
And your grandmother bought me some spinnin wheels

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
I stay sharp from my head, to my belt, to my toes
Call me "Rubber-Band Man" cause I keep bank rolls (Damn)
These rookie view, but don't attempt this at home
Unless ya paint super-wet, and ya rims fully grown
A lot of y'all niggas say I shine to much
Weeelll, kiss my ass, y'all can suck my fuckin nuts
Got lil' chrome jets, with livin room sets
And every time I pass, your baby-momma turn her neck
When I come through, bitches go "ohhhhhh"
Niggas go "whooo you", nigga I'ma show you
I'm sharpest that'cha ever seen, pimpin stay super-clean
Shoes to the pants, to the shirt do me on the scene
Five-million dead white boys in the bank
And the check that the Williams brothers gave me is blank
Got five-million nigga, put away for the fam'
And five-million comin, nigga shit got-damn!
