Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
She went to Victoria's secret
Then she went to Frederick's
She plan on getting naked
And let you disrespect her
You can turn the lights off
'Cause her shits electric
She climb on top arching her back
With a sickest methods
Have you stuttering like
A sk-sk-sk-sk-skiping record
That's how I got a stripper pregnant
But that's a different segment
She sending naked phone pics
And ask you, did you check it
Your skin smells like bubble yo

[Verse]
Baby girl is candy, sweet as chocolate omlettes
And she the shit she should own Stock Insurement
I'm about to go and see what we have in common
Tall dark and charming, brightning on the armin
Fresh like a B-boy, dress like a D-boy
I should be next to your flesh like a keloid
Thug sex I'm the best I will destroy
Your cookies while you mess with them decoy
Everybody on my team looking for some action
Ballin' so hard baby ass will feel taxin' it
And we only ride on the strip when it's action pass
Slave master that's how them whips are
Back to back walk' in the club
And they ask how many bottles you need
We on the building like a nigga on the property
Dj turn the music up and lights down
All you bad chicks on the floor right now

[Chorus]
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance

[Verse]
The bad bitch is playin' the corner dawg
So we like to block 'em off at the corner wall
It's COB and we was born to ball
I'm playin' with bills with more juice than Orenthal
Bottles in the club now they asking if I'm hood rich
My answer wearing a shoe if my foot fits
You can see the Louie logo in my foot prints
Spend so many dollars they don't make good sense
That's why they love me
From Dina, to Tina to Trina, Corina
Sabrina, Katrina, to Gina I seen 'em
Dancing on the floor, the way she move her body
Know she work it in the bed, bet she perfect with some head
I love the ganzu, be fly every time
Even the car head shorter than mine
But still fine though
That's the kind I'm tryin' to find yo
Private dancer I just need a sight show

[Chorus]
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance

[Verse]
She stand still but her booty shake
Yeah
She stand still but her booty shake
Lil Momma introduce me to your sushi plate
We should go on an X rated movie date
She threw her hands in the air
Then she turned to the side
And her body started moving like a slinky, yeah
I want her wrapped around my pinky
And I swear to God her body's yelling freak me
She stand still while her booty shake
Yeah
She stand still but her booty shake
I love it when she swing her hips
Put her fingertips in between her lips
I want her between them, fill in the blanks
I will stop this on right now
'Til vanilla, caramel and dark brown
I wanna see you break it down
I wanna see you break it down
It's the pretty round brown
Driving me, you wow

[Chorus]
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance
Let the beat control your body
When you dance

[Outro]
Slit slit COB
Your beat is turning me on
Oh you got me going
Come give it to me to me
To me
Come on
Uhu do me real good
Hit it like a real nigga should
Uh come on and give it to me</pre>
