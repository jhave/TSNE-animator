[Intro]
Eh, yo, yo yo
This is Ying Yang Twins with a ghetto public service announcment (uh oh)
Red light (ohh), red light (ohh, ohh)
Stay by yourself, (ohh) by yourself (ohh)...

[Chorus] - 2X
Smoke by myself
Drink by myself
Poke these hoes by my goddamn self, for rrreal (By my goddamn self)
For rrreal (By my goddamn self)

[Verse 1]
Nigga dwell on it, can't he
So tell on me, got my bitch all at the crib
Try to smell on a nigga, wanna stay around him
But when I'm sitting on the couch
She keep me saying "ouch", cuz she grabbin on my crouch
And I already know, thinking to myself
What the fuck, somebody told
Had to have been one little nigga that I showed
Some shit that they never should have seen, anyhow
All hell nigguh...hatin' on me now, smokin' on my weed
Steady drinkin' on my beer, hell naw niggah
Get the fuck up out of here, can't hold one
So you can't hold your tongue, nigga lips smackin
Like she chew bubble gum, tell her where I been
What I did, who I'm with
Said see me with two bitches, thats when I said it
I gotta stay the fuck away from head, I'ma

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fuss with nobody else
Now red light, child started a fight
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovas
Shorty, did I stutter? Go get another rubba
Child is shaking like blubba, child that want me to cut her
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out!
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work
I'm hitting the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky
Haven't seen what I've been, I'm drinking all alone
On the phone with my b...l, u, n, t 'course every day
I white out, acamo, philly, or marsailles
Give a fuck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' cuz I...

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3]
Smoke by myself, drink byself
Poke by myself, cause I was born by my God damn self
Fuck, run and train, that shit lame
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high
I don't give a fuck, if ya got fire
Every now and then you chip, and you wanna get Henn
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin, don't roll trees
Hey man, shit, take it from me
You better off to get drunk on a Pepsi
Up, thats a beep, might be a freak (Hey lemme roll with your phone?)
I ain't taking nobody with me, I'ma ride by myself
Get high by myself, get drunk by myself
Fuck this ho by my goddamn self (myself)
Don't nobody hold your own, like your own
Thats why we on our own...

[Chorus] - 3X

[Outro]
See now when you do what you do, how you do what you do
When you do what you do, nobody can tell on you
If you all by yourself, ah ah ah, say it
I don't need no friends, I don't need no foes
I'ma drink my Henn, and choke all out the door
Now everybody said goodbye, get your hand that burns
It's just good to see ya ride, reverse, reverse
Biieetch, reverse, reverse, biieetch
To wonder all this time, what happened this time? (Hoooo!)
Everybody tries ta, everybody chill...we just playin'
Everybody but me, Ying Yang Twins out for the 2001
(Eh, we'd like to thank y'all)
Went down to the jukebox...</pre>
