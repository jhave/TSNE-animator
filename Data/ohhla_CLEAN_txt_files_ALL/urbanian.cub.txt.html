[Intro]
Google me bitch
I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch
Ha ha, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, yeah
I told her, won'tcha Google me bitch
Try to Google me bitch, listen

[Chorus 1]
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Fuck with the kid, and I'll turn, into Damian
Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is
Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous

[Ice Cube]
(Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way
of tellin y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day
Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway
Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over 35
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby

[Chorus 2]
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know, what my name is
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian
Google me bitch, wanna know, if I'm famous
Google me bitch, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, ah won'tcha
Ah won'tcha Google me bitch, I told her
Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this

[Ice Cube]
I'm urban, and ordained
Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter
I'm hard liquor
Cirrohsis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin, I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?

[Chorus 2]</pre>
