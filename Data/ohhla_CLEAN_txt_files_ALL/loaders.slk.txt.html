Chorus: Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes
And these hoes won't ride wit me... 
But these hoes can't ride fo free {2x}

[Silkk]
Well check this out, I slips on in
I dips on in, she be thinkin ride home
I be like holiday inn, because y'all can't ride for free

It just ain't gone be that easy
Now you think you can ride free?
I pay fo the gas you don't give up the ass
nigga please, cause I be a hustla
Must I spell em all in abc's
Or do you get the picture don't make me hit cha
But I don't hits to run, I hits fo fun
Smash it like Daz,and they gets the guns
Cause I ain't no joke
They can ride fo' free I can't drive fo' free, please!

Chorus:

Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes
And these hoes won't ride wit me...
But these hoes can't ride fo free
These hoes want daiquris, but daiquris aint free
These hoes won't smoke my weed, but weed don't come fo free....

[Girl]  How about some cavaci on the rocks 

[Silkk]
Nah, some gin and rum.

And that's how it's gon' continue to be...
Haaaaaa... none of you girls can ride fo free
Rides wit me no that's a damn shame...
That's how it is a damn shame, dollar up on my damn fame

Chorus:

Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes
And these hoes won't ride wit me...
But these hoes can't ride fo' free
They wanna go out and eat, but these hoes get Mickey D's
These hoes they wanna be seen, but they can't be seen with me

[Silkk]
You hoes better wake up and smell the coffee
You must have took a wrong turn because you lost me
And nuthin come fo free...
I'm a rider so between them thighs it be me
You gots to watch how who you take home
That's nice she look like Halle Berry
and today she look like Grace Jones
The first I didn't wanna...
on they plate but after that they want like lobster and steak
Now the club be the best place, they work be the worst place
Nine times outta ten I never been past the first date
Yeah see it's like this I'm mackin bad
If you wanna get taxi hoes, call up a cab

[Master P]
Yeah Bitch, jump in a muthfuckin bucket
Cause you'll never ride in Benz
But I ain't mad at you
You know what I'm sayin cause you got a nigga gettin your hair done
gettin yo nails done
But me and my little brother Silkk
We gon' reverse the game on you bitches
You know what I'm sayin bitch
You can take me to the barber shop
you can put some muthafuckin gold around my fingers
You can put some muthafuckin gold around my neck

Chorus:

Niggaz just don't know, that I'm taxin all these hoes
And these hoes won't ride wit me... 
But these hoes can't ride fo' free
They wanna have sex with me
But girl my dick ain't free
And if you want this meat, it's goin fo' forty G's

Never let a bitch get in the way of you and your money
But pussy... I can get pussy anytime, believe that</pre>
