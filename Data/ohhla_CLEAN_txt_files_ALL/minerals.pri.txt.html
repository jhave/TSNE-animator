It's hard to make God
It's hard official
That somehow forgot about how to be (original)
Suburban cats perpin' like they hard and (criminal)

Your hand skills (minimal)
I walk into cipher's with the (starter's pistol)

One verse will leave your whole notepad in (critical)
Runnin' like a track star, hopin' I'll (miss you)

Then and only then will I stop smackin' crews
Thought they was runnin' shit but only in the bathroom</pre>
