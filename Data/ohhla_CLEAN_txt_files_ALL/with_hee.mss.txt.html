Uhh Missy, yeah B.I.G.
Ha ha, yeah, I like that

[Lil' Kim]
Uhh, it's the Q to the B to the double E, spittin' lovely
And it don't stop, rocks shine through my tank top
Where your bank stop, I deposit all the one drops (ha)
Think not, excuse me but uh I like to flow
Cause this joint knocks harder then Indicot and
I be off the wall like the Lox, nightbox filled with Benjamins
Me and my girl Misty gettin' pissy up in Bennigans
Makin' all of you rappers begin again, like Fennigan
Christians repent then sin again, girls wanna be my friend again
Lay up in my crib up wit', get up in my linens and
While Misdemenor hit notes like Sarafinna, I subpeona you
To my funk grooves see, I hit you wit' the huhhh!
She wit' ya with the heeeee!

[Missy]
It wasn't your car that had me all in love with you (you)
Cause I've got my own ride and a trunk full of tunes (tunes)
I drive through your hood
And I hit 'em with

chorus

I hit 'em with the hee

I stop 'em with the haaa (I stop 'em with the haaa)
Let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar, heee haaa heee haaa

[Missy]
It wasn't your money that had me all sprung out (sprung out! sprung out sprung out)
Cause I got my own account and my bills in large amount
Aye hey hey
I drive through your hood

chorus

I hit 'em with the hee
I hit 'em with the
I stop 'em with the haaa (I hit 'em wit' the hee, I hit 'em wit' the ha)
Let's drink to you and me, let's drink to you and me
Meet me at the bar (you can meet me at the bar)

[Missy]

Shit, no shit I thought you hadn't noticed
The way I roll this Dutch, the way I roll this Dutch
