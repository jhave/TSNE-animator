The internet can't deal with a nigga like me
Cus I keep it so hood, yeah I keep it so Street

Turn your tvs on bet all u see is me
Nah I ain't playing why you trying to blame me
Might as well hate the world instead of hating on me

Youngens they charge feeding heat with the teeth of the lautter
Ace stopping I'm Steady Moppin
Leave you at Side of the Coffin
Bitch I am Ace that's the Ace of the Double O D
And When you Mention Greatness Bitch you better me mentioning me
And when you say The best you definitely mentioning we
They said I couldn't do it
Proove it I'm Ludacris Nigga
So doubted the music They influenced and movin through me
I'm Times 3
Hit a fiend and it's deeper than me
Call me Young HOV they way I change and I bank on the beat
My Album coming tell em pussies they stayin asleep

My replication of this creature I mention it's me
My Album Droppin see this dead will be living through me
That means greatness is bigger than Pac deceased</pre>
