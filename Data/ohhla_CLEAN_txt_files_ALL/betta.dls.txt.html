[Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is]
[Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]
[Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry no no more]
[Listen all you fellas, you betta listen] [you betta listen]
[Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is]
[Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]
[Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry no no more]
[Listen all you fellas, you betta listen] [you betta listen]

Mummy I saw one day
She was on some fume vapors
Givin' me lip so I continued with the caper
Cat litter had me sniffin
Since outside the palace
Eyes sicker than aids
Game harder than a callous
Tried to enter in her shit
She had locks on the session
Tellin me how her last man
Taught her ass a lesson damn
Well, i'm not the mayor
I take care of my dimes
But I excluded I had nickels
Addin' up to her kind
Short stacks with a wristful of jewels

Sayin she didn't need a man
To make her out for a fool
Dig it, miss, my love is credited in cupid account
And if you need that extra help
Gigglin, figurin' I had jokes for her humor
Then she broke out with the words
About knowin all the rumors
"See, all you niggas rappin be like pedigree dogs
Thinkin you can have me leashed
Around your microphone cords"
Somethin 'bout her lit me up like july
And with them onions in the pants
I couldn't help but cry
Seemed lost in the essence
But i had to find my way to take
Action for the digits just to set up a date
Thought my shinin was on
I had the skirts in the bag
Until i took a bit of time
To peep the price on the tag
She said "I'm that salt and pepa
Who like pushin it to sisters
You need to get to walkin with it mister,
I think you betta listen"

[Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is]
[Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]
[Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry no no more]
[Listen all you fellas, you betta listen] [you betta listen]

We was at some outside jam one saturday night
When this pretty ass girl got locked in my sight
She was a ghetto philosopher
Yeah you know the type
Thinkin' Mary J. and sade understood her strife
Caught me lookin', "Yo what's cookin?"
"Nothin' from around here
So don't approach or hope
To be the man of the year"
I said listen deer or rabbit or whatever the hell you be
I'm not the one to embarrass
But the one to emcee
I traveled the world q uarters on my relationships
Used and abused by hoes
So my royalty stubs
But above all
I brought my daughter into this earth
So I understand the need
Of women feeling of worth
She glanced deep in my eyes
And said "oh shit, you're ill
I like the way your mind
Moves around at will
Still, let me apologize for soundin so sassy
But you niggas act as if my ass
Has a sign that says harass me"
Her name was gail from the union of dale
I made her remove the shades
So her eyes could tell me the plan
Yo where's your man?
"Oh that nigga's past tense,
Painted bruises on my face
Haven't seen him ever since"
Gave a pinch to my bottom
And started rubbing my back
She said "i bet your ass is darker
Than a mobb deep track"
Only one way to know it,
And i was down to show it
So we jetted back to my crib to set it
She made it known
"I've owned thoughts of you
Since that song 'meeny-meeny'
Can't believe you're about
To be all up in between me"
Man, the flag was lowered
So my wood was raised
Followed a shielding of my building
To protect me from the blaze
This granted access to
Southern parts of her borders
Did you have her comin'?
Like the new world order
I caught her with the right combination
A good combination
Keepin' it in her hard, man
You betta listen

[Listen all you fellas, here's what good love is]
[Listen all you fellas, the kind she understands]
[Listen all you fellas, then you won't have to worry no no more]
[Listen all you fellas, you betta listen] [you betta listen]
