...Rubber they better name it Hercules motherfucker

[Violent J]
No luck, got stuck
The're comin' to repo my truck
Big bills, shit kills
No pills and I'm outta refills
She dissed, I missed
I'm havin' problems dodgin' these fists
They chasing me, They wanna lock me up
I'm surrounded by thugs about to sock me up
I can't stand it, I'm stranded
I can't find a home on this planet
I fucked it up, I can't get up
My old lady's tearin' my shit up
I miswrote her, turned shoulders
They all lockin' me out, it's gettin' colder
But I'm okay, I just move on
I can whether any storm, I know in the long run

[Hook]
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Mad pills, drink spills
Black out at night my hands kill
Wake naked, can't take it
Po' wrapped me up in that blanket
No mail, I failed
I'm on the right track derailed
How stale, I'm in the county orange
And my kids life been torn
Welfare, no health care
Every motherfucker out for they self here
Weird thoughts, life's tough
But I'm a hustler and know how to bluff
No cash, no pass
I got dog bounty huntin' my ass
But it's okay, I just move on
I can whether any storm, cause in the long run

[Hook]
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang

(Wrong turn, got burned)
(And a motherfucker still ain't learned)
{Denied, no reply}
{But I've been known to retry}
(They hate me, I'm scary)
(They waitin' at the cemetary)
{Grim reaper creepin' on me hound doggin'}
{I got a chemical splash in my noggin'}
(I get lonesome, and them bones come)
(I got warrents on the fact that I'm on some)
{I ain't healthy, can't help me}
{I ain't wealthy look what they dealt me}
(Straight straggler, brown bagger)
(Juggalo, gang bang K tagger)
{And it's okay, I just move on}
(I survive it all) {Cause I know in the long run}

[Hook] - x2
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
It ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
Shit ain't no thang
