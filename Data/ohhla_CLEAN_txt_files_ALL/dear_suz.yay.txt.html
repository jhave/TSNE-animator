[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Aiyyo Fif' (yeah)
Yo Fif', I got this letter from this girl (word?)
Finna write her back man
I'ma tell you what I told her though (what you said?)
Listen..

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
Dear Suzie, dear Suzie - I appreciate the fan mail
Dear Suzie, dear Suzie - I read your letters locked up in my cell
Dear Suzie, dear Suzie - I see you know I'm a star in jail
Dear Suzie, dear Suzie - I appreciate the fan mail

[Tony Yayo]
Dear Suzie, I ain't have sex in a while
I'm in jail with my niggaz; beatin off to your pictures
You only writin letters cause I'm headed towards the riches
And I'm only writin letters cause your head game vicious
What's today's date, and today's time?
Sit-ups, push-ups and write a new rhyme
I'm about to lock it so I'ma write this letter
Was your day okay?  Is your mother better?
I'ma put this bid in, cause summertime is comin
And when it start gettin hot, also tired of cummin
I'm in dorm two lower ma, here's my address
Send my G-Unit and my mailin package
Now Suzie, you know I would never try to use you or fool you
But can your friend Kim be my mule boo?
Give me some days, I'ma write you back
Send that new don diva a quarter a pack
And when you come to my visit, don't wear no drawers
It's your pimp, your playa, sincerely yours
Goodbye.. goodbye.. goodbye.. goodbye

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
I went from Manhattan coons to Allana downstate
To Oster County and then shock upstate
But anyway ma I be home in January
'til then, keep it tight like the Holy Virgin Mary
And had a rumble in my house, a sneak thief got cut
From his ear to his chin got his ass ripped up
I got the phone on lock, from nine to ten
I just got off the jack, with 50 and Em
Listen Ms. X-and-O, you love my flow
Baby I'm waitin on your mail, here come the C.O
Ma it's Tony Yayo, girl I'm bound to blow
I can't wait to come home and perform a show
Get some ice from Jacob's, so my neck can glow
Twist some haze, twist some hash and a pound of dro
Buy some dice, throw chips, matter fact c-low
Dear groupie lights out, girl it's time to go

[Chorus]</pre>
