[ Hook ]
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
They wanna rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up, cuss me down, fuck me up

[ Verse 1 ]
Sometimes when I'm on my own
And there ain't no one around I feel all alone
Laying in my bed I'm a nervous wreck
And I wind myself up until I'm vexed
Keep telling myself they're out to get me
And I ain't sure who, so I make it up
Come to my own conclusions I'm crazy
Start thinking up all kinds of stuff
Like, fuck my girl, I know she cheating
That golddigger bitch just thieving
Act like I don't care but I'm grieving
Start switching up for no reason
Told myself I ain't got no friends
Fuck my people, fuck my ends
No rational thought, I'm low
I'm paranoid, all I know is they wanna

[ Hook  ]

[ Verse 2 ]
And then I think about beef
Over the years I've had so much grief
Whole lot of drama in and out of East
Won't let anyone take me for a chief
And mans say they got my back
But it's really all just chat
Cause when it all gets on top
They leave me alone to scrap
And I went to the ends, heard whispers
Old friends chatting bout kidnapping 
Now they hurt my pride and ego
I don't care about rap, Im strapping
But the olders told me ignore it
Cause I really ain't got time for it
And the ghetto, I already saw it
I'm in the world now, I gotta explore it
I can't let 'em

[ Hook  ]

[ Verse 3 ]
No guts, no glory, no get, no gain
No love, no pain, I'm going insane
It's all too much for the brain
I'm so paranoid, I feel strange
And it's so long-range
Been too long, I gotta make some change
Fuck the world, I'd rather take some blame
Or I could just buy a platinum chain
Diamond rings and and other shiny things
Maybe the bling'll help me maintain
Or at least that it help to explain
What's my path, am I in the right lane?
Why I feel so left out in the rain?
Why's it hard, it should be simple and plain
All I see when I'm in this game

Everybody wanna
