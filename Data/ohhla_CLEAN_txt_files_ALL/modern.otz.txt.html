[...they say nothing wrong

You know and I know
You know that I know
I know that you know that something's gotta change is gonna come ...]

[bridge]
First you clean his hands from top to bottom
Grand afferents then wash him, then you go pick the cotton
Listen y'all I'm tired man, I swear [I've been running]
For so long trying to be strong with you [I've been running]
I'm exhausted [Ohh yeah]
My feet hurt [I don't...]
Wanna run no more [I don't....]
Wanna run no more [I don't know what's a bed]
They said [a change is going]
WHEN [a change is going]
WHEN [a change is going (...) everyday]

[Joell Ortiz]
Ain't nothing changed except the chains
That restraining our physical frame
Mentally we still living the same
Its lock down
They knock down the Towers to raise tax
Anything they burn we pay back
I live in the hood; you'll never bump into Pat Seajack
But we spin the wheel every time we chill
Cuz cops hate blacks, and Hispanics they draw gats
And just slam it before the ask where your hand is
I don't see how a wallet can be mistaken for a cannon
~So please don't let em play us no more
In everyway I'm ready, willing, and able to war
Like any day I could pop I'd be in the front
Like, please let the force be with me in this pump
Housing want me to work cuz I'm still on my mom's lease
Threatening to raise the rent if I don't pick up them park leaves
Ain't nothing in this world for free
But somehow they got us fooled that this world is free

[chorus]  Joell Ortiz
THIS IS MODERN DAY SLAVERY
YOU SEE [yes]
CARRY I.D. [yes]
WATER IS A FEE [yes]
THIS AIN'T HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MAN [I've been running]
For so long trying to be strong with you [I've been running]
I'm exhausted [Ohh yeah]
My feet hurt [I don't...]
Wanna run no more [I don't....]
Wanna run no more [I don't know what's a bed]
They said [a change is going]
WHEN [a change is going]
WHEN [a change is going (...) everyday]

[Immortal Technique]
Our people are the product of genocide and slavery
Everything in the ghetto was how it was made to be
Designed in a process, Prison Industrial Complex
Niggaz transformed into numbers and objects
We pay the devil rent for living in hell
Cuz the projects was built on the spot where Lucifer fell
Incarcerated knowledge heavy weight (Heavy Nigga)
Every black man should read through the Romany Chapter 28
~Cursed in the city like we're cursed in the field
Cursed on the border, and cursed by the New World Order
Our sons and daughters were stolen by another people
___________ end of the Earth, land of the Eagle
This is the sequel to the prophecy
Freedom when peaceful then violent is my philosophy
I built an army, now I'm gonna build a nation
The foundation of a new civilization
And overthrow the plantation

[chorus]  Immortal Technique
MODERN DAY SLAVERY SEE? [yes]
IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE [yes]
PATRIOT ACT 3 [yes]
Just wait young nigga you'll see [I've been running]
For so long, my people been strong, but yo [I've been running]
I'm exhausted [Ohh yeah]
My heart hurts [I don't...]
But I'm gunning them more [I don't....]
But I'm gunning them more (Fuck them, niggas!)
I said, we gotta make em [a change is going]
We gotta make em [a change is going]
Quick motherfucker (lock and load)
