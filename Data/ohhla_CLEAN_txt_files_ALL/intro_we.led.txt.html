[DJ Khaled]
Tryin to talk to 'em...
When there's no more music left
And the lights go out, all you hear is silence
I'll be that voice

(Give it to DJ Khaled for doin it
 Y'all the big dog, Pitbull, Terror Squadians - YESSS!!)

Dade County, it's our time
The movement's here forever
And I won't stop 'til I see them devils
And I won't stop 'til I defeat the devils (nigga!)
They all told me that I would fail
They all told me that I would lose
But I'm right here, and I won't lose
Can't NOBODY stop me! I'm somebody
My brother Dre told you to BE somebody
Carol City know what I'm talkin about
The movement! (Fuck niggaz~!)
I introduce you to..

[Rick Ross]
.. Ross!
We the best of the best, fit of the fittest
Dead man gon' feel us the way I'm feelin this Phillie
No really we the best (we the best) and I'm the boss
Do I still hustle? Yes... I'm Ricky Ross
Started with the dirt now I'm travellin the world
In a new silver spurt buyin pieces of the Earth
Low mileage; don't need some
No smilin; I'm easin~!
Rollin on that thang thang, when I lane change
Haters lookin at me crazy, boy I'ma bang bang
M-I-A yo, we the same gang
C.C. to Down South, e'rybody slang 'caine
Don't see another way, if you do show it to me
Got good green? Green-ass nigga, blow it with me
Cop me a drop, paint mine real pretty
100 grand in the Chevy, rep my city

[DJ Khaled]
I rep my city like a G's supposed ta {*3X*}
I rep my city like a G.. nigga!
Can't nobody stop me, I'm somebody
From this day on you gon' be somebody
We the best, we don't fear nobody
The movement nigga, LISTENNN~!! {*echoes*}</pre>
