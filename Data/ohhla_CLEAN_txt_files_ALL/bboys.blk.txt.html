Here's a little story that must be told
	About two young brothers who was put on hold
They tried to stop the goal
	We on a spiritual plane
Tried to kill the pride
	And destroy the name
We just two bad brothers
	Who will never quit
I'm Mos Def
	Kweli (WE THE ULTIMATE)
Make sure that you tell
	Everybody you know
To get on line
	Take a ride
To the Black Star show!
