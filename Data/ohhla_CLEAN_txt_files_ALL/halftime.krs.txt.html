Right now as we rockin they shootin outside
Now we have got to chill
We have got to chill
We can't have no gunfire because hip-hop can't build

Let's leave all the shootin and the violence outside
I know there's some people in here, armed to the teeth
But understand...
It is the conciousness behind the gun
that determines if the gun is positive or negative
So let's not blame it on no pistols, no guns, no gats
Let's blame it on the conciousness of the mind holding the gat</pre>
