[Zack de la Rocha]
Everywhere I, hear the sound of, marching, charging feeeeet, booooy..
'Cause summers here and the time is right for, fighting in the streeeeeet, booooooy...
Tell me what can a poor boy do..
'Cept for sing for a Rock 'N' Roll band..
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for a Street Fighting Man!

A Street Fighting Man!
A Street Fighting Man!
A Street Fighting Man!

Do you think the, time is right for, a palace revo-luuuutiooooon..
Where I live the, game to play is, Compromise Soluuuuutiooooon..
Well then what can a poor boy
'Cept for sing for a rock 'n' roll band?
'Cause in this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for A Street Fighting Man!

A Street Fighting Man!

Well what else can a poor boy do?
Well what else can a poor boy do?
Well what else can a poor boy do?

Hey my name is, called Distuuuuurbaaaance..
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his seeeervaaaants..
Well what can a poor boy do
For sing for a Rock 'N' Roll band?
In this sleepy L.A. town
There's just no place for..
