[E.S.G.]
Just cause we live in the country
Doesn't mean that we slow

[Mikee]
Hey
Hey
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so, slow

[Verse 1: E.S.G.]
I live that C-O
The U-N
The T to the R to the Y
The E to the S to the G be screamin' south side til I die (South side)
See I ride
With Carlos, should I say the SPM
A six-three
Hot to be, I almost cracked my damned rims
I swang and bang, I do my thang
Mary Jane be in my brain
Codeine in the cup
Got 20"s in the truck
Hold up
Country life, we got horses and chickens
But our chickens transform
Into ounces in the kitchen
I ain't snitchin'
I'm spittin' on what we do in southern life
Candy cars, ghetto stars, we sip and ballin' all night
Shootin' dice, bangin' and breakin', and doin' my thang, all night
I paid the price
To have my teeth filled with ice
Look twice, you might get blinded by the way my diamonds glistenin'
E.S.G.'s who I be
Boy, I'm country like chitlins
Eatin' cornbread, I'm gon' fed, Kenny Red ain't no joke
A Last Resort like Papa Roach
Pass the sweet and let's smoke, cause, uh

Chorus: Mikee
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so
Hey, hey
Country life
Southern strife
What gives you the damn right
To come pointin' fingers down at me
My life is so, slow

[Verse 2: Mikee]
Got to keep, on truckin' baby, to the end
Cause we got to make it through
You see I know these KKK's
They on my trail
They searched my room
Country life ain't all what it seems
And
Some of y'all think it's a motherfuckin' dream, but I got
Many problems on my mind
My weed tolerance is down
And I can't get high
Besides that
It's hot as hell outside
The temperature keeps on risin'
And I ain't got A/C in my ride
I don't abide
I ain't the one
I ain't the dumb
Country man that you really think I am
Country life

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
I'm the country bumpkin, comin' out the south-uh
Rascal like Spanky and Bash is Alfalfa
Pull it up, out ya
Ki's in my couch-ah
Eight in my fam, I don't give a damn about ya
Yowza, yowza, I sleep with the cows-ah
Rattlesnakes and crickets in my overall trowsers
Got my own stable
Own record label
Sittin' on the table, eating steak and potatoes (Sip)
Sippin' on syrup
Pickin' your girl up
Take her to my trailer and she make my toes curl up
Silence them boys when they see my toys
My dooley
On twenty-two inch chrome alloys
Got a 'Burban that I stretched to fit twenty-four people
Call me Chico with security that look like Deebo
I used to hang in clubs sellin' tapes in the restrooms
Now I float in the boat with six bedrooms

Repeat Chorus</pre>
