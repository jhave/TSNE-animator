[Intro - Bow Wow]
Uh, Neptunes (Neptunes)
Uh, Bow Wow, aka, The Don, The Dutch
Fo' show, Star Trak, collabo

[Chorus x2 - Bow Wow]
They call me Bow Wow, The Don, The Dutch
Ask the girl, man she know what's up
They call me Bow Wow, The Don, The Dutch
(The Dutch) get out my face, homie don't get smacked up

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
When's the last time ya seen, a MC so clean
I do my thing, they do even think I'm sixteen
I gotta couple of cribs, push a couple of cars
I pull the Mazeratti out the garage
That's how I ride, I'm worldwide, international
Say you better, whatever, don't be irrational
See me passing you, why going ya lost
Hit you at the light, and I'ma dust ya Porsche
'Cause I'ma dope MC, and I'm down by law
Fremelay her on the way to New York
To you MC's, who jock my style
You better freeze, 'fore I get hos-tile
You wanna peice, but ya not like Bow
As you can see, I'm much realer
Was born to get on and preform, get scrilla
The freshest of the fresh, the best, you know it

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Everywhere I go, sold out shows
So many chicks, all over the globe
I got a GR plane, I fly it a lot
Girls be on board, all over my jock
I kicks lotsa game, jewels galore
On the scene, should I go Velour
Some girl in Spain, by the name of Deja
Chill wit Ming Ling, when I'm down in Asia
Ain't nobody, my same age
Flow like I flow, when I gets on stage
Number one hits, you know my style
Y'all know how I get down
I rock funky fresh gear, that's what I'm about
The Jordans, is brand new, but mines ain't out
I got braids, durag, a new white tee
What I need what an eighty, when I rock minks

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
Baby your so cooool
I feel so cool
Baby your so cooool
I feel so cool

[Chorus x2]</pre>
