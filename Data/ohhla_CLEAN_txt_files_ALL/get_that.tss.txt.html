[Too $hort] It's payday!
[$ + Roger] Get, that, cheese!
[Roger Jr.] {*vocoder sounds*} We gotta
[$ + Roger] Get, that, cheese!
[Roger Jr.] {*vocoder sounds*} We gotta
[$ + Roger] Get, that, cheese!
[Roger Jr.] {*vocoder sounds*} Just
[$ + Roger] Get, that, cheese!

[Verse One]
Now when you dreamin, it might not be real
But when you're all alone, that's how you feel
Do what you want, you just need a plan
Little money and a car, you could be the man
Cause havin money's what you're 'sposed to do
Spend some, then people start to notice you
Get all the things that you wish you had
Now all that little stuff don't get you mad
And once you get your foot in the door
Don't start actin like you can't look for more
There's always more money to be made
It's not everything, I know you wanna be paid
You should write it down and do the math
Anything in the world is what you can have
So listen to your potnah $hort
Get your money young man, you ain't gotta be broke, just

[Chorus: Too $hort] + Greedy Mac
[$ + R + GM] Get, that, cheese!
[Greedy Mac] While you standin on the wall, and you wishin you can ball
[$ + R + GM] Get, that, cheese!
[Greedy Mac] While you standin on the wall, and you wishin you can ball
[$ + R + GM] Get, that, cheese!
[Greedy Mac] While you bumpin in yo Cadillac, pockets always stayin fat
[$ + R + GM] Get, that, cheese!
[Greedy Mac] While you bumpin in yo Cadillac, sippin on yo' Cognac

[Verse Two]
Now grab a freak, smoke some weed
And kick it all night with this funky-ass beat
It's been a long day, gotta stay on the grind
Up early, hustle for a long time
You want big dough?  You wanna get mo'?
You want a Cadillac truck and a six-fo'?
I tell all the little homies havin money in the ghetto
One day you gotta let go, but don't settle
for just hangin on the corner broke
Fiendin for a hit of what you wanna smoke, on that dope
Free yo' mind if it's trapped in the streets
But don't starve; you know us macks have to eat
I don't care if they don't like me
Just left the bank and I'm rollin up some light green
Now hold on to your dreams for me
Cause life ain't always what it seems to be, you gotta

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
(Is that Too $hort?) Baby yeah I'm back, it's on
You never woulda thought I could last this long
I don't associate with non-believers
If my girl keeps me naggin me then I'ma leave her
Cause I worked too hard for way too long
to get what I got and I'm way too strong
In yo' lifetime, if you don't get yours
Can't do no ballin like yo' nigga $hort
But once you on a roll, they can't stop it
Receivin checks, makin bank deposits
And that's just the way it is
Don't come around me if you're negative
I'm the player of the year, there is no other
I buy a mansion fo' my mother
See me ridin with the top down
I need some mo' money, can't stop now, I gotta

[Chorus]
