Alright let's just go for it
Come on baby (uh, uh, come on baby)
Yeah, ey eh (uh, ah, fricky-fricky-fricky, one time)
Ow (can you feel me), yeah, ey eh (come on)

Ow pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
Cause we're about to go down and you know just what to do

Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Fly by the people as they stop to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, ah do your dance quick
Mama, come on baby, tell me what's the word, uh

Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it underway, ah
Word up (word up), it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

(Word up), yeah, ey eh, come on baby (uh, uh, uh)
Yeah, ey eh, ow (word up)
Word up, (come on), yeah, ey eh, ow (can you feel it)
Yeah, ey eh (uh, come on)

Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those Airs and act real cool
But you got to realise that you're acting like fools

If there's music we can use it, we're free to dance
We don't have no time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me
Mama, come on baby, tell me what's the word, uh

Word up (word up), everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it underway, ah
Word up (word up), it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Word up, ow (word up, word up, uh)

Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it underway, ah
Word up (word up), it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

(Word up), yeah, eh ey, come on baby (uh, uh, ha)
Yeah, eh ey, ow, word up, ow (word up, can you feel it)
Yeah, eh ey (ah, ah, word up)
Word up, everybody say
Word up, it's the code word (word up)
Word up (word up, do you like that, do you like that, do you like that)
Word up (word up, do you like that, do you like that)</pre>
