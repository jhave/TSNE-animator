[CHORUS  Carolyn Rodriguez] X1
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true?
Baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?
Are we real?

[SPM, talking]
*Yea, this is a song I wrote for my wife, before she was my wife
We've been together 18 years now, that's like half my life
And she's still by my side. I love you, baby...*

[VERSE I - SPM]
You're love is beautiful, it's undisputable
You got me rappin' 'bout it up inside the studio 
Like crazy, man, 'cause how I feel aint normal
And I'm writin' in my journal, I hope it's eternal
I'm your favorite fan when you make an appearance
The smile on your face lifts up my spirits
I wanna' trust you and know that you'll be mine forever
You want a lifetime of love, that's what I'ma deliver
But, I worry a little; and I'm not sure why
But the thought of ever losing you blows my mind
And I know that I really shouldn't think that way
I guess what I'm trying to say today is baby...

[CHORUS  SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE II - SPM]
I don't mean to sound scared or even insecure
Usually I don't trip over chicks, but you're 
Something else, something pure, and amazing boo
Mama raised a G, but didn't raise a fool
So I don't wanna lose you like I lost so many
Not really carin' 'bout a future and it cost me dearly
So many years as a playa' in a negative sense
And I guess it took this whole big set of events
To let me see things differently, I've grown as a man
And just wanna walk through life while holdin' your hand
Kiss you in the moonlight and touch your face
And let you know that you're the one that no one can replace

[CHORUS  SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin' things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?

[VERSE III  SPM]
I've broke many hearts in the days of past
And they told me one day one will break yours back
And avenge all the girls that you left in tears
But my heart was too hard to ingest those fears
So I ran through a bunch, some snack, some lunch
Some was dark, some was yellow like Captain Crunch
And we laughed a bunch, and we balled at malls
And if I could, I'd apologize to all of y'all
Saw the pain in her eyes as she begged me to stay
And, now, I truly understand how she felt that day
'Cause now I feel the same and I want it to work
Hopin' I don't end up like the ones that I've hurt

[CHORUS  SPM and Carolyn Rodriguez, X2]
Is it real, tell me are we real?
Are you just sayin things that I want to hear?
Are you really true, baby is it destiny?
Are you the one that god made and he meant for me?</pre>
