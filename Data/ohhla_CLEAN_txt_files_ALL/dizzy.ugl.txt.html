(My main man)

(He's out of sight)

(Pay attention)
(Dizzy Dustin)
(Now alright)
(Dizzy Dustin)
(He's too much)

(That's all I know)

[ Dizzy Dustin ]
Me without a mic is 23 without the Nikes
A writer said we light, but don't believe the hype
I'm fluid like a druid when he's circlin stones
I chrome the conduit and hear through headphones
Write words to match, put the herb in the batch
I shove em in the oven and watch em react
In fact, I bring it back like a holding car
Consumers take it off the rack like a bowling ball
I admit it, critics get under my skin
I discipline men with the ink from a pen
Or better yet with a Bic, I'm razor-sharp like it's chic
I break the ice like a pick, nice without the Vicks
(Dizzy Dustin) comin with combustion
Yvan Drago, I must break you when I rush in
Cause yo, it's disgusting
People treat rap like an urinal
We take it personal
I do encores on tours, night after night
Takin flight like condors, clingin the light
I hold on tight when I'm flippin acrobatics
Grippin microphones like my hands were two magnets
Hip-hop's detergent all-purpose
Quarantine the scene, clean the stains below the surface
Put it in your box, don't knock it till you try it
And all the Ugly people be quiet</pre>
