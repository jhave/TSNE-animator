[Noreaga] 
Yo, word up, I'm bout to rep my motherfuckin hood
This is my hood, nigga

[Chorus 2X]
It's laundry mat track, keep the loot in Iraq
Iraq, see the wirly world, see Iraq
Binoculars, eyes is out, sun they watchin us
Jake hit the strip, now police try lockin us 

[Castro]
It's cream on my land, original man
My team break border and court order
ESP network, TNT explosive expert
Your head jerk
Backflip, illegal life shit
Bad guys and black whips left the scene rowdy
Air cloudy, a bunch of smoke flow astoundly
New assembly, new identity, remember me
Keep remedy for the poison of my enemy
Martin Remy, Jack D to to allizy
Yo, to Motif, Dom P, personal henny
Have me hurt many
Actions, coke infractions
Immanuel and Fidel, our money well
Help the crack sell, stack bail, then we map trail
Get it all back
Smoke the black, hold the gat

[Musolini]
The streets got me thinkin bout my man's passin
Stashin, the lex with a passion, gotta make it happen
The block steamin' and 12 K the cops schemin
Security be on my back for wrong reason
I'm livin what I'm sayin on the block all day
Before I wasn't sure, but now i know it's the way
Like, if i get caught i'ma pay
Illegal life, livin trife, what can I say
Gettin bent, million dollar dream, hennessee and moet
While I'm chillin' with my man on the wooden set, Front
I strike accurate you get wet
Whatever choice you select handle appropriately
Baby 9, murder my crime, you a fake
Lefrak shine, just wait
I need half outta that cake of regulate
Taken while you scheme and comtemplate
Only results in the 360 action
But if it come back, then I'm pumpin double action
Blastin, tearin' niggaz physicals in
Try and contend, you gets no days with no wins
My clientele excel is like the devil's spell
Drove me to the streets young
So now I know it well

[Chorus]

[Mendosa]
Yo, son, I'm packin steel, where ya hard hat
You pull out you bust that
Your gat useless, where ya heart at
It fingers the trigger, change ya name to fake nigga
Beef with every nigga, watch ya back
Of course you get clapped, you didn't bust gat
Splendid nigga, dirty rat
For my Iraq attack, Bust you with mega gat
Once a cool cat, smokin dagger, put it in my back
Why you did it like that, now my skin bubble fat
Go to sleep, I wake you up
Noreaga: What, What What, What
Mendosa: In Ya crib, tie you up
Noreaga: What, What What, What
Mendosa: Hot oil on ya gut
Noreaga: Get bucked, Get bucked
Medosa: Iraq element don't give a fuck
 
[Chorus]

[Troy Outlaw]
We on a mission, not a small time thing
I'm addicted to the cash like the crack head is a fiend to the crack
But I ain't into doin no drugs, I'm just pushin hits
And stackin' chips like I'm stackin' bricks For a buildin'
Cause we be buildin' this empire fortress 
Secured tight like barbed wire for infiltrators
Regulators, manipulate
Booby traps got you hooked like fish to bait
Watch you deflate like air baloon
Tryin' to ambush this platoon you run into a monsoon
Like stormy weather, your fatigue ???
Cause we bust bullets, Thinkin' much more clever
Eatin' through your gear like acid rain, feeling pain
Livin' like a snake in the grass, you won't gain
Simple and plain, my team play the game so we can win
We want it all so we can breathe like the wind

[Noreaga]
Bustin 360, cherry red 850
He blitz devilish, get cursed for fuckin' with me
Eyebrows thick, resemble (some arabian guy)
Arabian mind with source to fire arm
Caesar, waves bangin, brown wallibies
Empty cigars stay smoked in cool cars
Queens escobars wear jewels like scars
You heavy gold, Slick Rick, changed it
Yo, the main vic, plottin on you since 86
Now its 96, you lay low, you mad rich
Strictly big shit, big play heavy wait
While in car, hear a verse, put it in park
Let the dutch spark, now we ride my weed dark
Dig deeper, black guns and black reefer
My brother's keeper, Throwin the world in a sleeper
The grim reeper, so much work he got a beeper
The word death, stamped that, it's on your chest
Yo, you bullshit, my click thick, kid, we pull shit
Grip tight, illegal life, aerolight
Thug blood, the same blood, thicker than water
Slaughter, play this shit in tape recorder
From Iraq to Yugoslavia, Samalia
Compadre, diamante, papi
World World 3, CNN history
By the powers of God that's invested in me
Since 93, locked up, I did three
Got 85 percent of y'all worshipin me
Back in L.C., hop in cap 33</pre>
