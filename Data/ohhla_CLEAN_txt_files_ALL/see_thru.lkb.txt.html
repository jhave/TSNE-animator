For you to know
You are completely transperent to me..

[Cage]
My boy just found his mom dead
Days after she got her palm read
She's 'bout to drown and what made me a jarhead
Not a marine but I'm in army fatigues
Ready to flip with an undoubtably doobiest the many demon dip
Stuck to my face till my lungs embrace the death
You see a crowd of souls choking on and smoking my breath
Flat tire, no fire, stuck out in Dippyville
You know you gone when you see blood vessels in your peripheral
My eyes are two planets of maggots that all stare
And whoever speaking to me, I am not there
She left me to go flying in mist
She slipped and sliding in piss
Psych-major, I was fucking my psychiatrist
Brother thinks he poses a threat
I was defocused and wet, only my dog when you stuck your nose in my shit
She's needy, greedy, made it to my CD
I hope you get VD, you can stand infront of my TV

[Chorus]
She's See Thru, for her to see to
Hand on your throat never seem to reach you
Let's play sane again, and we'll drown in a puddle of purple rain again
I wish today would end
Probably couldn't see it through all of the haze I'm in
When the world divides and opens up, taking me calmly
You can keep the last word, it still be looking down on me

[Tame One]
My ex braud used to smoke wet raw, till something went wrong
Off a dime, sugerdraws lost her mind
Flipped out and had the detox, up in the hospital
Went to see her after 40 days, ask Scott Little
Perm grew out, sherm blew out
Her motor functions had her spazzing and scrapping, over nothing
Said the voices in her head made threats to sound the way I'm evil
Kill people, she don't know how to act, like Vin Diesel
I'm looking at her through five inches of glass
Going through changes, tears in my eyes cause her stare was aimless
She'll never be the same again, asked me two times, what was my name again
I'm like "Damn, that Purple Rain again"
"Visiting hours is over", the nurse said and touched my shoulder
Sugerdraws attitude just got colder
Orderlys had to restrain her, I fought back tears to stream hot
Cause I'm knowing 'bout them ??? shots

[Chorus x2]
She's See Thru, for her to see to
Hand on your throat never seem to reach you
Let's play sane again, and we'll drown in a puddle of purple rain again
I wish today would end
Probably couldn't see it through all of the haze I'm in
When the world divides and opens up, taking me calmly
You can keep the last word, it still be looking down on me</pre>
