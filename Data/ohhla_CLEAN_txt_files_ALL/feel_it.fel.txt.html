Hey! Won't you yank on some of this cali? (Cali?)
Sip on some of this platinum?
If you want some daddy
All you gotta do is ask for some
I'm pimpin' up on your body, shawty
Please don't try to move me, shawty
I'm tryin' to be the life of the party
Shawty, Shawty

Can you feel it? I Wanna know!
Can you feel it? I Wanna know!
Can you feel it? I Wanna know!
Can you feel it? I Wanna know!

Feli Fel, Pitbull and T-Pain
Mami over there off the chain
Ass gorgeous, lips insane
Hip like boom and a ass like bang
One time for them boys on the block
All pushing that ying and that yang, you know
That D, that rock, that 'cane
Aww, yeah mane!
Now she movin' like she can't stop
She can't be from Thailand that way that she bang cock
I'm tellin', you mami do anything
And she throwing it back like a b-b-boomerang
I went a little bit below her belly ring
Like a belly ring, badabing, hm, badaboom
Now dim the lights down in the room
While I slide in you like, ohh can you feel it Dale!

Hey! Lil' mama cali, get married

Let it go below your waist like you at bally's

Break it up or you yeah you will get the bussines
Lil' mama askin', I'm writtin' your wishes

I'm tryin' to be your connect, fool 'round might get you wet
Like when you turn on the jets, hello I'm in to caress
Look there's a spot on your neck, for sure your bottom is next
Just know I'm all on ya cast chest, I know I'm makin' ya sweat

Keep dippin', pop up my collar, the best
We limpin', the money flippin'
