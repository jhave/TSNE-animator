Song:   Over the Moon
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
I'm over the moon,
Just doing my thing, and I won't come down

I'm over the moon, no silver spoon in my milky way
When Simon told me I was trouble, all I said is okay
Now l-l-let me turn my swag on and step up the the plate
Then I'll put London in my pocket, up-up-up and away

I've been chilling on a star, with my five star view
I wanna get so far, that I see you boo
Reaching into the jar for a dream come true
Skipping the sky-y

[Chorus]
I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing
I'm over the moon,
Doing my thing, doing my thing
And I can't, get enough
Life is feeling so good, cause I keep moving up
I'm over the moon,
Doing my thing, and I won't come down

I'm over the moon, so watch your head cause I'm throwing rocks
It feels like Red Bull gave me wings and I can't be stopped
You see I rhyme like a beast, but I sing like a flower
I'm feeling tall, so tall like the Eiffel Tower

I've been chilling on a star, with my five star view
I wanna get so far, that I see you boo
Reaching into the jar for a dream come true
Skipping the sky-y

[Chorus]

Floating in space
I love this place, ET says hey
My mind's so clear
This atmosphere, I got no fear

I've been chilling on a star with my five star view,
Reaching into the jar for my dream come true

I'm over the moon
Doing my thing, doing my thing

And I can't, get enough
Life is feeling so good, cause I keep moving up
I'm over the moon,
Doing my thing, and I won't come down

Keep moving on (and I won't come down)
I'm over, I'm over (and I won't come down)

I'm over the moon! Haha!</pre>
