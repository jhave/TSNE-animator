[Chorus: Havoc]
Got my eyes on all this paper
Where your mami, cuz that body
Oh my God, I want to thank her
Don't get it twisted, I'm not your captain
Who girl? I'm not trying to save ya

[Havoc]
Something like the 19-9 Groucho blue light
The lotto, fuck plenty models, Crys' out the bottle
Like fast cars, my foot on the throttle
Like big guns, I feel those with hollows
Niggas want beef, I got that to lend
Niggas bleed just like us, I put it in
If I done fucked yo bitch, and take the easy route
Switch the lock on the door, and change the bank account
She was just something to fuck, and ain't really count
Bust a nut in her mouth and then a nigga bounce
How we doing the shit?
Gon' see another bitch with a chick in the whip
Huh, the same thing that I said
Nigga do what he wanna do, when he got big bread
The king size bed, yeah, it's fitting them all
Ma, you ain't with it, then I'm missing ya call

[Chorus: Havoc]
Don't start tripping, how we ripping
Got my eyes on all this paper
Where your mami, cuz that body
Oh my God, I want to thank her
Don't get it twisted, I'm not your captain
Who girl? I'm not trying to save ya
Heavyweighter, about my paper
I'll upgrade ya, something major
I'm the boss

[Havoc]
Oh, as I come through the door
Throw valet the keys, to the 07, it's on
That's one of my exotic whips
Now peep my exotic chick, take a look at her
Look at her ass fat, see it through a wool sweater
Don't hate on me, she do better
Who better, she pick me, MVP
VIP, you just lose better
But I ain't worried bout losing
Big ya crews and all them Cancuning
All worry about me, who want to screw in
Paparazzi watching the kid, and my movement
Trying to get they hands on the sex tape
Damn, why they wanna get they hands on the sex tape
I know why they wanna get to the sex tape
And that'll be the day that the bank break

[Chorus]</pre>
