Song:   Who are the Pimps?
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Stick up!!!
All gwan put your hands up in de air
and turn around with your face to the ground
Stick up!!!

Here we go
Who are the pimps?  Who are the pimps?
Wimps, sitting behind a desk
You only get a glimpse of the action or reaction
when you don't respond to them TAXING
You fuck a lot when you're tax exempt
Like with the church, the rules were somehow bent
The more money you make, the more money you can have
You lose your mind after a while trying to just
grab and grab and grab and grab and grab
until the pimps roll around real mad, what they say?
"Pick up that money hoe!"
You done all the work, but now a part of the show
You're a hoe, you pimped all around real fresh
Got letters on they chest spelling I, R, S
And they be taxing, asking, sitting back relaxing
Pimping asian, european, blacks and chicano
Hah hah!  But they can't pimp a wino
Why?  Because a wino don't want nuttin
It's when you try to get ahead they start frontin
Capitalism -- the system of pimps and hoes
I'm sorry that's the way it goes
In this particular system everyone's a slave
Racist is how they want us to behave
White Johnny, be fighting black Michael
Both are blind to the system's sick cycle
In a circle psychotically they slay each other
with a grin, because of color of a skin
"Pick up that money hoe!" (3X)

Now we don't want to get you all alarmed
A little education never did you no harm
When Africa's free the African will be free
Capitalism says we're ALL in slavery
They're not looking at the color of a human brother
April 15th they're looking at your mother!
"Pick up that money hoe!"
You work all week, and now your money has to go
to a pimp, and it's you that limp
They cut your check and take a tenth
Don't wanna hear no lip, about support of family
Cause on a piece of paper that's a fantasy
They don't care if you're in a bad mood
Your wife needs shoes, your kids need food
Uh-uh, pick up that money honey
The pimps so serious they're funny!
They'll look you straight into your face
and tell you that your money's going to a good place
Like Social Security or Welfare
But if you go to the Bahamas you'll see them all there
"Pick up that money hoe!" (4X)</pre>
