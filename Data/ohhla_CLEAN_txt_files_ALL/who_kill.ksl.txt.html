Black America, tell me who's killing who?

Black America,
Killing each others
Dying in the hands of the young black sisters and brothers
They're killing their own race
Go anywhere in black america and you'll see that's only face
To watch Black America cry, no one see no one, DIE
I blow this delight to keep'em alive
We've got to change the reflexions of the majority
you look in the mirror of Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Drug dealers are doin' the cherry in our community
Destroy Black America, brother where's your unity ?
And see throughout the subject that we must talk about
That we can point the Black America that sells drugs to
A kid who don't even know her mom's your biggest customer
They're home starving 'cause you're always selling drugs to her
And what did you do with the money?
You went and bought mo' drugs so you can make mo' money
And kill the hope and dreams right in Black America eyes 
Lettin' the few to know that drug is a way to survive
If you don't respect one another then help one another
Will destroy one another and that's what they want my brother
You killing me, and I'm killing you
Now stop and ask yourself how can the black dream come true
We got to change the reflexions of the majority
You view in the mirror of mirror of Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Black man gotta stop calling the women a bitch
You're mother is a black woman too
So that's make you a son of a bitch
This is the wrong word to use my brother
That same word kept our black women back in the gutter
Nobody was there to pick a black lady up
In Black America, where time is rough
U didn't care and it went away 'cause she was that to you
My point is Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

We fought together, lived together
And if we don't get it together we all die together
'Cause all we got is each other
Black american girls and boys and black fathers and mothers
Get involved with the children, it starts at home
The Black America we save, could be our own
We gotta change the reflexions of the majority
You view in the mirror of  Black America
Tell me who's killing who?

Black America tell me, who's killing who?
killing me, killing you, killing you
