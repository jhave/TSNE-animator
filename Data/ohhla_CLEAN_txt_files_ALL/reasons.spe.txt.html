[Verse One]
Ayo hon, give me a few seconds
You see I gotta talk about you
See I can't do without you
Still though, I do you
Would ever realize I'm realer than the realest guys
You like them cause they got doe
You like me cause I wink my eyes
The right way
I got you gassed off what I might say
On top bottom
+In between The Sheets+ like Is-ley
You always say, "Yo, on my birthday surprise me."
Butt naked, jump out of cake, and look lively
Sooooo
Jump
Remember everything I told ya
Wasn't to insult ya
But you're swoll like a cobra
And when we talked it over
Everything was still kosher
You was mad that I left you
You got mad when I wrote ya
I only did this cause I felt that I was supposed to
I felt that we'd be closer if you went around like roller coaster
Instead we hot like toasters about to pop
Tours about to start
Album's about to drop
And now all the honey's hot
Cause all the money's in knot
And you're just some dummy I forgot
The reason is ever so clear
We goin' nowhere 
Now you wanna be down?
Don't make me go there
Cause really
If you wanna know why the fuck I'm leavin'
Why I got reasons
Cause you got caught cheatin'
And suckin'
Steady fuckin', now you got nothin'
I think I better chill
Let my man say somethin'

[Chorus] [Phonte]
The who the what the where the when the why
Reasons I should leave you
Sometimes wifey but never my spouse
So many reasons, but I can't even call 'em all out
The who the what the where the when the why
I, I, I
Wantin' to leave instead of waitin' you out
So many reasons and that's exactly what I'm about

[Verse Two] [Spectac]
Yeah, I know it's kind of sick the way I'm leavin' you
I left you
And since you like young guys, I'll hook you with my nephew
Happy and I'm glad I left you
I'm young, F-U
While you waitin' for some new dick, to come to your rescue
I wish I would have left you
Back when
I first cut that ass off
Instead I let that ass back in
But I forgive you
That was my fault back then
This time around you forgot me
Like Tito Jackson
Hopefully
We won't need no further actions
Take that ass to court
Take your single ridin' Kia Sport
That's what I thought
You wanna call it even
I wanna call the reasons why you got caught cheatin'
Came home heard the breathin', no squealin'
Started up the staircase
I had this real sick feelin'
Had him in your mouth, kneelin'
That's what I saw
As I peeked through the door
You gettin' freaked on the floor
The worst part, you did it raw
In way you and I ain't never did it before
You god damn whore
But I'ma call it quits now and end all this shit now
You know damn well, it ain't no way that I gets down
Maybe you should sit down
Hear some advice
Next plane out of town, you be on that damn flight
And since you like to change, like the four fuckin' seasons
I'ma let my man tell you all the god damn reasons

[Chorus] [Phonte]
The who the what the where the when the why
Reasons I should leave you
Sometimes wifey but never my spouse
So many reasons, but I can't even call 'em all out
The who the what the where the when the why
I, I, I
Wantin' to leave instead of waitin' you out
So many reasons and that's exactly what I'm about

[Verse Three] [Phonte]
She was phenomenal 
I mean for real, she was phenomenal
5'6" with wide hips and flat abdominals
Blessed with a presence that lingers around and follows you
Met her last fall at a peace rally for Amadu
"Excuse me sweetheart, I don't mean to bother you.
You seem a little lonely, maybe you could use some talkin' to.
Might want me to put my arm on you
Or else one of these off brand K-Mart niggas might try to Target you."
That's when she started laughin'
So then I started askin'
"Why don't you get a real nigga with a heart of passion?
That ain't scared to spit it at you in a harder fashion.
You flyin' high right now, but you ain't far from crashin'."
She pulled me close and licked her lips to talk to me
She said, "On the real, what you did was lovely. 
And, you a lot different than these jigs that follow me. 
Here's a big apology, cause I dig your honesty.
But, I'm to myself and I ain't tryin' to change that.
I got a girlfriend who's panties remain wet."
I said, "What made you change to the same sex?"
She said, "Fuckin' with that gutta nigga named Spec!" (Owww!)
C'mon

[Chorus] [Phonte]
The who the what the where the when the why
Reasons I should leave you
Sometimes wifey but never my spouse
So many reasons, but I can't even call 'em all out
The who the what the where the when the why
I, I, I
Wantin' to leave instead of waitin' you out
So many reasons and that's exactly what I'm about

[Outro] [Phonte talking]
C'mon Spec. C'mon man. You look like, youknowhatimsayin'? 
That nigga, he look like he a good nigga. Youknowhatimsayin'?
Hoes they see the dreads and shit youknowhatimsayin'?
They like, "Yo this a righteous, positive nigga." Man, fuck all that
Man, that nigga be feelin' them bitches out. Word up
I've seen it happen. It's not a pretty thing
"Yeah, what's up baby? I'm Spectac." Yeah they, youknowhatimsayin'?
They let the little soft voice fool 'em
The next thing you know they knees is, is at they, is at they damn ears and shit
And they hurtin'. Peace.</pre>
