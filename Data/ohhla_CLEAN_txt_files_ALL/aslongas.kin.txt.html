[Verse 1: Kinetik]

I started rapping as a kid, I was a hit in school
Fast forward I'm the object of ridicule
And some will reckon that my prospects are minuscule
Forever slow and they're wishing that I never blow
So I try and plan for the future
Starving artist, I'm branded a loser
So I can either keep it real or eat a meal
For now I'm snacking on cans of tuna
Then I remember the days of my youth
My friends at the parties and raising the roof
I was hustling pennies just to make it to the booth
And lay a couple of verses, some would say it was worthless
Under the surface my focus and drive
Said to open my eyes and to go for the prize
Before I turn ghost in the sky
So whenever you hear this flow just know that hope is alive

[Chorus: Tone Richardson]
We're gonna make it somehow, cause you know we're gonna make it
You know we're gonna make it someday
We're gonna make it somehow, cause you know we're gonna make it
You know we're gonna make it someday

[Verse 2: Kinetik]

Another month with another bank statement
I'm in the red with no money in my savings
Not to mention I don't have a pension
I'm at the show getting "no's" at the entrance
Am I an underachiever
I guess so when I'm looking at the funds on my Visa
And some folk will only praise you when you're hot
Not when you're scraping the pot and tryna make it to the top
And even though I've never slept round a gutter
I still feel as though I let down my mother
I could've been a doctor or lawyer or such
Accumulating six figures and raking in big business
But then again my focus and drive
Said to open my eyes and to go for the prize
Before I turn ghost in the sky
So whenever you hear this flow just know that hope is alive

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Tone Richardson &amp; Joanne Francis]

We're gonna make it some how
Some way, some how
We're gonna make it some how
Hey, we're gonna make it 

[Outro: Tone Richardson]

Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[Oh, we're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[Hey, we're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[Oh, we're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[Hey, we're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[We're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[We're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[I feel it in my bones]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[Hey, we're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[We're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[I believe]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it
[We're gonna make it]
Gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it, gonna make it</pre>
