(Talking)
We now return you to you're regular-
scheduled programming
I'm bout to bring out the whole-
Young Money fam right now
We gon' set this shit off
My nigga Mac May for president
G-series out in the streets right now
Hit a nigga on MySpace or somethin' man
Holla

(Sample)
Day dreamin'
I fell asleep beneath the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day

Day dreamin'!

(Hook)
You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'ma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

(Verse 1)
Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared
Oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past
You might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders
Are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there
Cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow
Though, it's Hell on Earth (Hell on Earth)
So wit' that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm tryin'a stack n' mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes when I flow
They say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get mur'd, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove
I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride wit' my Glocks up
You already know

(Hook)
You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'ma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

(Bring it home mang)
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
You might see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cooold
It's so cold (America)
It's so cooold

(Verse 2)
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothin'
For a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of forty acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had, into a pool
You get up on the news, lyin' bout how the levy's broke
Now Weezy lost two Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
You took everything we had
Uncle Sam, you Satan fan

(Hook)
You already know
What the fuck is poppin'
Baby I'm what's hoppin-a
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch wit' me on the low
I'ma be a G until the day that I go
I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow</pre>
