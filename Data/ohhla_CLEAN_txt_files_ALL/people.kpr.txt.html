[Chorus: Killah Priest]
(People) Is the world we live in
Full of innocent, Yasa's word, we the victims
(6 billion people) To the suburban area
Filled with doctors and lawyers
Cops and judges, we all suffer from paranoia
(6 billion people) From the White House to Hollywoods
To everybody hood, to down south, to deep in the woods
From my hood (people) to my hood, let's make it better, overstanding
(People) To six million people, that on this planet
 
[Killah Priest]
As the moon appears like a pearl in the mists of the clouds
I move up through the shadows til I'm at the cliff of the aisle
I sit overlooking, the borough of Brooklyn
As the Devils start to settle and the cement is pushed in
The ghetto comes to life, you can feel it's pulse
I hear, every corner breathing like the streets awoke
It grabs you, it makes you, so you can't escape
It's the phantom, it haunts us, it changes shape
And the building's most chiling, described by children
As the gateway to Hell, it holds the ghosts of millions
Come close to it, it gives you the most grossest feelings
As the black sky open up, my soul is exploding
Back down to the surface, where these seeds are nurtured
With alcohol and drugs, which leads to murders
Born poor, broke and hungry that's when thieves emerges
But to, rob their own, defeats the purpose, and
 
[Chorus]
 
[Killah Priest]
I write for children, who really can't express their feelings
I'm their voice, their thoughts, the way they talk
I'm their worries, their fears, their dreams, nightmares
Through that tunnel of darkness, I'm the light that's there
Just stare, look into my endless eyes
See a child walking on stage, his very first time
And the same in the White House when light goes out
The night comes down, the Earth leases unrighteous sound
With gunshots, echoing, through the dark
It's the sand of the ghetto's heart
Put your ear to the ground, you can hear it pound
Subway trains, run through the tunnels like blood through his veins
People in cells, carry like fluid to the brain
Clouds filled with red rain, the sewage drains as the nostrils
And I'm the arsenal, I'm here to set fire, til the entire empire is on
 
[Chorus]
