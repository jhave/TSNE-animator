Full term love (2x)

[Verse 1]
To be or not to be that is the question
Brothers be hawking sisters sometime with no intention
of tryna get serious, I mean make a commitment
Come on honey insecurity flows in by the shipment
Pardon the expression but are you already taken
I live around the way boy so don't be tryna fake
And if you wanna know me better I suggest you follow
'Cause I ain't tryna start up nothing destined to be hollow
You say you understand good no need for me to wonder
Wanna be my man alright well here's my name and number
But if you're not sure you better stop look listen and
Learn because I'm looking for a love that will last full term

Full term love (4x)

[Verse 2]
OK we're on a date you wanna take me to movies
Dinner and dancing and after that a little room please
No I'm not the one so the thought you can delete
Because it's very tracky and it's only been a week
Now you wanna hit the sheets (no) don't really think so
Make it all complete (no) I don't really think so
Wanna be fast then before you even blink I'll be talking to another
(Where'd) you meet him at the rink oh
Speedy Gonzalez you better slow down
Because I'm levelheaded with my feet on the ground
Why don't you try and do something constructive for instance
Committing to a love that will last the full distance

Full term love (8x)

[Verse 3]
You wonder why you see me at the bus stop everyday
It's because I have a job so there's nothing no one can say
Don't try to treat me like a stepchild with ring around the collar
Or even a pest because I don't want your dollars
It's simply just a cool thing called love and understanding
A little sincerity and that's all that I'm demanding
A brother who can say "honey your wish is my command"
And if you can't get it then I'll leave you where you're standing
I'm tryna get something that's mo' better
You see an easy around the way go sweat her
I'm telling you now without being undercover
That I might be an around the way girl
But I'm a full term lover brother

Full term love (8x)</pre>
