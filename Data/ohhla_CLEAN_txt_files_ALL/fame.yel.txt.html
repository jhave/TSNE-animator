[Intro]
Fame fame fame
Fame fame fame
Fame fame fame
Fame fame fame
Fame fame fame
Fame fame fame

[Verse 1]
Running like a fool I got a no damn motay
Headin to a label on a low key dope race
Gotta be on time, gotta go do show phase
Kinky lick, gotta go for cold tape
Man they sure want me to do a song for the whole place
Without a microphone, DJ and no stage
Someone put my products on my pockets of jose
Knowin inside of my heart these people are so fake
Pictures of New York, skyliners are back dropped
23 floor up, pound lookin at cap tops
I'm so fuckin nervous that I can't even act now
Thinkin jumpin out this window ain't such a bad drop
Smakin the black top cause I'm on the have a lot
I'm just a have not
This in my time and am I lookin at that watch
It could be the end of it all, maybe my last shot
But I got a funny feeling it ain't right
I tell my manager but he just thinkin it's stage fright
Minus the fuckin sweat that's drippin off of my face
I realize if I do it then it's only for a price
Doin my cookin, add a ho with a big bite
Em other be kitchen, dealin for late night
Do they realize I'm in terrible shape right?
Can't even afford to get my little boy a bike
I sit down in front of LA Lee
The president of death, you ain't the boss performin
Into my left a KP and 30 of egganaughts who walk foreign
He say Yelawolf is an emcee from Alabama
Yelawolf you can have the floorin
I told him if you wanna see me seen
Come catch me tourin but I ain't performin for the fame

[Bridge]
It's just like that
Fame fame fame
I lost a deal with Death Jam
Fame fame fame
And I went home on Christmas broke
I didn't know what the fuck to do man
Fame fame fame
Shit
Fame fame fame

[Chorus 1]
Money comes and goes just like the falling rain
Frederico go get outside and collect the change
Someday we'll look back and think what have we gained?
And the whole we can say
More than fame

[Verse 2]
What's the use in complainin about the decision I made if it's rainin
Then fuck it, pull the umbrella out, haters entertaining
I'm a ball for them focused
Got a lot of shows I gotta go hit
In the back of my mind I'm thinkin did I blow it?
But you notice all the people you roll with are losing their focus because of my ego
'Cause I'm hopeless, won't listen to nobody
They sit and go on about how I won't make it
You won't make it
I keep fuckin up relationships with executive folks
With these checks to cut for deals, I'd be broke and
Stuck in the south with nothing but my old shit
And no new whips, new house, new clothes
New dough, you know you gotta go face it
Look er in the eye, say I'm sorry for fucking up
These rappers are coming up
What you gonna do about it?
Just sit back and watch em and get up and make a move about it, be about it
See it's about the way you committed, now you gotta go and get it
I got a question
Are fuckin up? Answer
Fuck yea
I ain't about to be another white boy stuck here
Hit the road, do any fuckin show that I could get overseas
Let's go Canada, let's go south by south-west
Yelawolf expo, kill that, made it mine
Focus, let's roll
Never lay when the mama tryin to get a hold
None of em have me, and here come Interscope

[Interlude]
Yea
Then I got a deal
You know?
I don't know
I guess integrity goes a long way man
Gotta know when to hold em, know when to fold em
Shady Records
So american

[Chorus 2]
Just give me some place that I can hang
Somewhere way back in the back to drink a drink
You ain't gotta tell me that I ain't the same old same
I've seen some things
We won't change

[Chorus 1]
Money comes and goes just like the falling rain
Frederico go get outside and collect the change
Someday we'll look back and think what have we gained?
And the whole we can say
More than fame</pre>
