Uh Uh

Like What Peter Gunz Like What, Like What 
The Lord Tariq is Like What, Like What 
Blac Haze Like What, Like What 
The Lord Tariq is Like What

[Peter Gunz]
Niggas hear the name niggas run
Opposite bitches hear the name bitches come
Soak a little sun in the south with Blac Haze
Prepare myself as I brace for Blac Daze
These motherfuckers don't understand me and my man
Set niggas more quicker than sand
From the BX, double park the GS, get the fuck out
Cock your gun back in time for the BS
Talk a lot of shit, but you can't blame me
You didn't know I'm rollin with the EKG
South Beach gettin my piece from a Doms
And me cause the trick, like the way a nigga rhymes
So I prime, in a bruise spine
Poppin a six, getting another bicking bruise in mine
I shine like sun, first like one
Blow the fuck up,because another verse like none
Just Gunz, let the name echo for life
Because I still put this sliding dick up in your wife

Chorus: repeat 2X

Like What Peter Gunz Like What, Like What 
The Lord Tariq is Like What, Like What 
Blac Haze Like What, Like What
The Lord Tariq is Like What, Like What 

[Lord Tariq]

Fuck the money, is long now, the crew is strong now
Guess its safe to say I'm on now
Run through your town, with the four pound
Bust the door down, and lay your law down
With fake badges, posing as cops, we'll put a hole in your knot
I roll through your block, holding or not, we molded a rock
Thats bigger than creditials, what I'm into
I killed you and I meant to
Be glad for for the flower that a motherfucker sent you
While I was high, when I bent you fucking
I got things to see, people to do
There's places to be, there's bitches to screw
So make a who you, I'm killing your crew, I'm living a view
A place where killas kill killas, and I'm iller than you
I'm realer than you, straight forward like Kobe
Y'all niggas can't hold me
from quite a thug, a new age, Monticoly
Rock sounds like David Bowie, my rocks ain't music.
I front a mic to the streets, however you gonna do it
I'm runnin em through, gunnin em to it
I let you front with your fluent
I got a flow, and y'all waters a little shorter
You caught me like style, and I'm holding a key
And with a gun I'm quite wow
You should be rollin with me motherfucker

Chorus

[Blac Haze]
I got my niggas Lord Tariq, Peter Gunz
Blac Haze representin, I be the one
Niggas better peep game, and fly straight
From the Florida Keys, to the Tri-State
Make it hot motherfucker, ya'll heat up
EKG cause they stay weeded up
Watchin real motherfuckers beat it up
Like What like a nine sweet as what
Bitch made ass niggas, yes we blast
Lord and Pete Blac Haze, in the E-class
Playin hatin motherfuckers, getting buck wild from the bottom
Still screamin up top you want some other shit
Niggas die scared stressed
North to South we fuckin up the mid-west
Semi Falls, some bitch niggas butter cheese
Blac Haze I made this for the G's
Straight national, where my niggas in a six?
You ask Amaru do bitches suck dicks?
Do niggas turn tricks?  And asses die?
Don't waste you fucking time trying to ask about

Chorus:

Like What (6X)
