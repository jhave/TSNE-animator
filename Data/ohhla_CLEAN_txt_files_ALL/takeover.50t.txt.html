Yeah, Big Ballin' Texas stand up
My nigga 50/50 Twin, done went and got a real nigga for this one
I don't need no introduction

[Lil' O]
When you see the red Lac, when you see the 84's
When you see the pop trunk, when you see the neon glow
When you see the piece and chain, looking like yellow snow
Lemonhead in the watch, call lemon glow
When you see a young nigga spitting off, let him flow
Game face on, like I'm still selling blow
Who else could it be, but that boy Lil' O
Fat Rat Wit Da Cheeze, 89 double O
That's Braeswood block, grab your glock
Let that bitch, go buck-buck-ba
If you in a truck, or in your drop
Turn this shit up, let it knock
Me and 50/50 Twin, you know that means we fin to win
Grinding for them Benjamins, real niggaz go tell your friends
Let them know the real is back, tell em that the trill is back
Nigga how you feel bout that, bitch we pop the seals and Lacs
Texas boys Texas toys, Screw banging Texas noise
Big thick Texas broads, giving niggaz Texas joy whoa

(*talking*)
Hey, hey, hey, 50/50

[50/50 Twin]
Lil' O and 50, you know what this is
Leak out the real, whole world gon to feel
Sip a lil' lean, take a puff of the kill
On no steal, swimming in mills
You don't got tell me to
The ice on my neck blue, I'm already chill
Mean mug, keep a gangsta grill
Kay Slay now go run city if your friends is trill
Me I wreck, I rip I tip
On 4's do's go up, on that whip
Stay with a grip, can't afford to slip
Straight shoot to Jamaica, watch me jump ship
R.I.P. to Pill, real niggaz stay still
Roll up on them swangs, as I swang off a cliff
A mob boss, I don't really like rims
When it come to these hoes, my hoes are pimps
I'm gorgeous George, I'm charge in charge
My confidence, too high for these fucks
Toss Moet cups, or Ferosh and such
Guarding these, wear invisble cuts
Half of these niggaz out here, dumb kluts
From North to the South, real niggaz stack bucks
Half of these niggaz, out here dumb kluts
Lil' O real nigga, say keep in touch hey</pre>
