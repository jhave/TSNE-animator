[Talking voice]
Yeah man, just left town man
I'm here, here
Had to get outta town baby
Where you stayin' now?
You can pick me up at the round busstation
Or I can take a plane
There's your cab? I'll be right over
It's gonna be a few sec, and I'll tell you what went down

[Kool Keith]
I stayed in New York, depressed, walkin' mad through the block
Watching brothers go down, my project friends smoking rock
My group divided and everthing was undecided
I was drinking, thinking: "Damn, man, my boat is sinking"
Everybody's wack and new groups comin' back
They on Arsenio, booty's on video
Watch this clown rhyme that's paid for on primetime
Everybody's mean, they're hard, they're killing mothers
Shootin' bang bang, fakin man killing brothers
I had to turn off the radio from all the Walt Disney
Mickey Mouse and friends all talking pop and lippy
Girls excited for what? And over-infatuated
People got their brain washed and folks got manipulated
They start beleiving Donald Duck made the earth
The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth
(The industry was cursed since the Dinosaur's birth)

[Chorus]
It's over now
No problems in this world
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl
It's over now
My mind was in a twirl
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl
It's over now
No problems in this world
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl
It's over now
My mind was caught up in a twirl
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl

[Kool Keith]
Flying nighttime, eating peanuts on the plane
With no moneycontrol, my stress builds on my brain
My ticket's oneway
I'm out to southern Caliway
I left behind some people that wasn't even equal
I thought back with chicks and freaks in 86'
When Marley was in in control +the funky magic mix+
I had the limousine on hold with the real chauffeur
Ripped the ???? up with Ultra and I felt like Oprah
Girls in flocks and fans in lines from blocks
I didn't even hear a peep of you rappin' mister
I was your idol and probably on your older sister
Now you bad you signed stupid with a recorddeal
Your image is butt you perpertrating Shootin' Steel
Holdin' guns on albumcovers just to make funds
You the man quick fast payed out the ?anoass?
You can see I'm back and clear on stereo
with my own style, my intimite material

[Talking voice]
Ye, your style changed every year
Think about what you did
Used to dance, used to wear suits
Then you came back to wearing hip-hop clothes
Then you went back to wearing suits

[Chorus]
It's over now
No problems in this world
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl
It's over now
My mind was caught up in a twirl
It's over now
I'm home chillin' with my girl

[Kool Keith]
No accountant, my lawyer keepin' checks on the low
Money, expenses for trips I didn't know
Agencies finding shows I could get myself
Writing rhymes at night in the house by myself
I open mailboxes, all I see was more bills
Gettin' cold chicken, walkin' down Bronx hills
Askin' moms for 50 cent, just to pay my rent
I had no will to ill, my mind was out to kill
I called up Kurt, got a big deal signed with Capitol
Money's flowin' now wild suckas out blowin' up
They my pupic care, and pupils still growin' up
Sucking mean while the g'ism as it hits the rhythm
They want that new style, no money it's called freestyle
Taping off the radio, smokin' from my crack vial
They on my tip now, as always as usual
You forgot me, but I didn't forget you

[Chorus]
2x It's over now
   No problems in this world
   It's over now
   I'm home chillin' with my girl
   It's over now
   My mind was caught up in a twirl
   It's over now
   I'm home chillin' with my girl

Yeah...
