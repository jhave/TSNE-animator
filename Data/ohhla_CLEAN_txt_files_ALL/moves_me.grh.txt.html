[Zion]
I feel .. uh
I feel .. m-mm
So good, y'all
So good, y'all .. yeah
I feel .. huh
I feel .. ha-ha
I feel good, y'all
So good, y'all

Hey, yo, put it together
Piece by piece
Life as a puzzle, stay supple
Release
It take a coupla thoughts, let's bubble
Abandon trouble, negative speech make it crumble
I speak each
My dream, black beach
Livin' like the sheik
My queen, fly physique
I leave the concrete world behind
Retreat to the forest, free up my mind [ugh]
It's like a cake, to bake it take time
I make my livin', celebrate takin' my strides
Know what it is, I wanna have a couple kids
I'd be a good daddy, livin' prosperous
My esophagus, how I spark with this
North Star shinin' during the Apocalypse
That's how I do, prayin' that God really do

[Grouch]
I finish between two mountain peaks
I seen a few fountains within reach
My all-natural pace is set held to gamula (???)
Fakes is bet on
Me, had to make a livin' head on
Straight, fit the pieces to the puzzle
Put your bread on the plate
To eat your 'nother strugglin' fate
This mara-thon's on chaira (???)
Moment of yourself with yourself as you prepare to jump
There's the thump
I hit the head of the nail
Ready to sail
Grouch is not designed to fail
My output is a sign to yell
Final destination, man, only time will tell

[CHORUS  Grouch]
Whether you gotta
Make it last longer
Look a bit farther
Push yourself harder
Study, get stronger
Overcome hunger
Victorious livin'
Make it, or give in
Whether you gotta
Help it last longer
Look a bit farther
Push yourself harder
Study, get stronger
Overcome hunger
Victorious livin'
Make it, or give in

[Bicasso]
I make my moves make moves that make me
And take from the energy that breaks the fakes
Seen the straight path lately
It keeps me focused, afloat through this showbiz and note that
Most is a hope that we dreamed when it seemed like a joke
Then it's close when we toast this place
We got to
We say we ought to
But who talks shit?
Thought of it quickly, never followed it through

[Zion]
In my world I'm the president with ten cents
Spent on sentiments, tense
Intelligence is a quota
It only make good sense 'cause it make ignorance a little shorter
Spend a half-dollar of your passion
Pass the cash 'cause now you askin'
But I put a whole bill up on the faithful
'Cause when it get real hard you need a crateful
Helpin' you stable-ize yourself, energize your health
I live the life that provide the wealth
I stay stealth in the silence
With an abundant flow
'Cause what you give is what you get, and now you know

[CHORUS  Grouch]

[Grouch]
I don't want to plateau out
Run through the backdoor
I think o' days when I only had one, though
Bask in the sun, got my own piece o' earth now
Tellin' la visa that forever's gonna work out
I never work out and seldom eat healthy
I look to my peers, and some of them do help me
It takes years to master the mind and body
To never pass my prime
I'm out ..

[Bicasso]
Where I wanna be at 'cause I wanna go and hit
This livin' they were talkin' about
I caught fools was livin' in debt
When we havin' these doubts
And circumstances is turnin' fools out
But I never make the same mistake twice
I shake the same dice
And patternize to live this life right
The question that I'm askin' is, what's satisfaction?
Money or time?
Well, if time is money then I must be a multi-multi-millionaire
But now  I'm still livin' local, and it's crystal clear
Man, I put that on my vocals; this time next year
I'ma be bicoastal, bumpin' in your borough
Bet, B.I.B.
Borough on a path, man; I practice
I passed this beyond the songs you know and love
Twenty years from now I'll be Josh of the jazz club
Freakin' the brass while you fiendin' for ass
I'll ask you a question, and there's a lesson, and the answer is 
direction
What you need in life
I broke it down into sections that you feel is right
I break it down into sections that you know is tight

[Chorus  Grouch]

[Grouch]
Whether you gotta
Help it last longer
Look a bit farther
Push yourself harder
Study, get stronger
Overcome hunger
Victorious livin'
Make it, or give in
Victorious livin'
Make it, or give in
Victorious livin'
Make it ..
Make it your life</pre>
