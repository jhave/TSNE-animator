At the table sayin' a prayer holdin' hands
And we got two stolen Benz everything's according to plans
If anybody in the fam gets pinched
Don't worry 'bout your kids control your wench
Don't worry 'bout the money it's gon' get rinsed
And don't worry 'bout me I won't approach the bench
Now let's roll out and get that paper retho
It might look easy but it's not sweet though
It's either do this shit now or don't eat yo
This is real life this ain't no TV show
Word up- backed out 
With the macs out
'Nuff clips to shoot four duffels full of loot
22 Dilinger a piece for the boot
Couple of bombs 
Remote for the alarms
Outside still runnin' two big black 1500s
Me and Styles wasn't blunted
Must be your point to deal with money
Even though I was nervous somehow it was still funny
I hopped in one son hopped in the other
Word to mother both trucks burn rubber
Figure we could blanff with a mil or two
In a tentacle 
I pulled up behind chemical
Doors locked Styles left the other one
Down four blocks it's on now ready or not

[Styles]
Synchronize your watch feed time to cops
Get the rocks out the safety deposit box
Kisses here and up all the guards on watch
And the first thing I grab honey in the fotch
Split for nothing 
You get the same you hit the button
Before we hit the safe 
Where's the videotape
Gotta look it in the face- forget it
I want your eyelids in the bag got your seven digits
Money and death- what you pick?
And don't be a prick your life is worth more than chips
Money is paper and the banks built bricks
All of a sudden I heard a different gun's clip
I couldn't be hit
Cuz I didn't feel shit
So I duck into cover
Yell for my brother
I yell yo

[Jadakiss]
Then I yell yo back
You can bounce now dog I filled up two sacks
Here's the dough keys to the truck go get in it
Cuz time is our life and we ain't got a minute
I looked outside and I saw the Lieutenant
And I thought to myself, "Damn, Styles is finished!"
We ain't come this far for this shit to happen
Damn, nigga better get the Captain
Heard six shots 'bout three hit the Captain
Heard a few more but by then they attacked him
Area surrounded parking lot packed in
Just knocked my man off now I was trapped in
But you know I'm going out in a blast
With this last pineapple like they use in M*A*S*H
And as soon as enough cops've filled up the room
I pull the pin</pre>
