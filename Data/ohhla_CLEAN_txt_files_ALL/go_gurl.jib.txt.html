{Beatsta Music!!}

[Jibbs]
Yeah, okay
Young Jibbs
The Beatstas!!

[Chorus]
If the party start jumpin and the beat start knockin
With cuties on the dance flo' out there poppin
Go girl (go) go girl (go) go girl (go.. go..)
Go on, get your money up~!

[Jibbs]
The way your boy flip, makes you say the game over
Sales ice cold, make music called polar
And I ain't even did commercials for Coca-Cola
Start bitin on that shocked watch with tuffsola
Geez - and they wonder why J.I. braggin
I done spit so much fire they should call me dragon
But not like Sisqo; plus I got butter like Crisco
So I copped the iced out cristal
AND, they say my mouthpiece is lethal
So if you want to battle then my words gon' eat you
Then spit you back out, should've knew I'd beast you
And I am my own writer, I don't use they people, no

[Chorus] - 2X

[Jibbs]
My flows so contagious, delivery so sick
You might get pneumonia just from hurrin me spit
So don't make threats talkin what ya ain't did
Cause alls wolf tickets do is make ya look dead
I'm hongry for a meal so I couldn't be a cactus
Cause bein drought ain't a part of my status
Livin off water might not be the baddest
But I'd rather freeze ice than put it in my glasses
They askin... what type of cars gettin driven
Pulled so many strings they think I play guitars for a livin
Metaphors is the bars I am fittin
I ain't even in the sky, but ya boy meetin stars for a livin

[Interlude]
If you wanna look fresh and you tryin to go shoppin
Then I've got shorties start lookin stop stoppin
Go girl (go) go girl (go) go girl (go.. go..)
Go on, get your money up~!

[Chorus]</pre>
