More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chrome Glock and a ???
Livin' Like a killer
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chrome Glock and a ???
Livin' Like a killer
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chrome Glock and a ???
Livin' Like a killer
More mail than the rest of the pushers
Cause he got a chrome Glock and a ???
Livin' Like a killer

God damn, I'm lookin' at my picture in the paper
I know I shot the bitch, but you know I didn't rape her
Called up moms to get the whole low down
Said leave town, the feds kicked the door down
Reaching for my indo and lookin' out the window
I know I should've burnt that bitch with the Pinto
Watchin' my back cause you get what you give
And niggas who kill ain't got long to live
But I really can't trip off a 187
I done smoked so many, close to 11
Cause i'm in the shit deep, I can't even sleep
Can't wait for 12 o'clock for a late night creep
Don't take me to jail, i'm a 2 time loser
The cops wanna trip, i'm a have to get my Ruger
Got bullet-proof windows on my gold-plated Lexus
Need to take a trip, got a cousin in Texas
Sellin' dope for awhile so you know I got ends
About 40 g's only got 3 friends
Smith &amp; Wesson and 9 millimeter
Always wanna see ya, and dying just to see ya
To all you Og's on the run, yo I feel ya
Cause life ain't easy when you livin'like a killer

Livin' like a killer, or should I say dope dealer
Ain't no glock like the one I got
I pack my heat for protection
Ain't no glock like the one I got
I pack my heat for protection

[C-Murder]
Livin' day after day, so fuck the future
You let your guards down and a nigga might do ya
Just like the Pen. everybody can't win
If you fall on your face than a nigga goin' in
Don't cross that line or ya might get choked
Fuck what your sayin' you can keep your smoke
In jail or not i'm a handle my shit
You wanna act like a hoe so i'm a treat you like a bitch
Down with No Limit so you know I got clout
Quick to get the gat and put some wire in your mouth
First degree murder, pre-medi-tated
An unsolved death that's drug related
I guess you could say that crime's my hobby
Aggrivated assault and a massacre robbery
Can't see my face cause my life ain't healthy
Man that crack just make me wealthy
Got ends and ends from the dope I deal ya
If I come up short than I gots to kill ya

[Master P]
That's the life of a killer
Or should I say dope dealer
Ain't no Glock like the one I got
I pack my heat for protection
Ain't no Glock like the one I got
Some people like Smith &amp; Wesson
Ain't no Glock like the one I got
I pack my heat for protection</pre>
