(chorus 4x)
Get Buck Get Wild
Lets Tear This House Like Down
Lets Tear The Club Up Thug
Lets Do This Stuff Right Now 

(Juicy J)
Throw them thangs and show them gold
Gangsta niggas on the floor
High as a bird or a fuckin kite
Sercurity screaming oh-noooo
Players thuging in a line
Party crunk like I'm on the grind
Mtv these ghetto streets
Hoodlums throwing gangsta signs
Fumes smoke is in the air
Bullet holes just everywere
Niggas drunk off hen and gin but I don't think they can compare
Where them dollars
Get'em fold
Get your drug kick in control
If you bucking in a crowd 
Better hold tight on your gold
Haters snatching what they can
On a hustle thats the plan
Fuck a wall flower coward 
When we moving no one stand
Everybody to the bar
Nothing but heavy ghetto star
Never taking shit from fools
Got them tones out in the car
Cause we hard on that liquer
Five gallons drinking wit cha
If you ain't got nothing but weed
Hope you got some more of the swisha
One of my niggas got Erk&amp;Jerk 
One of my niggas got some of syrp
One of niggas got some of that yert
Leave yo body high and hurt fool

Chorus 4x

Chorus 4x

(Lord Infamous)
Kaiser Soze watch me rotate
Let this floor vibrate her back
Watch out the side and bounce this ride
And put em in torture rack
We got it loc enough to choke em up
Then broke em off they stump
We got another ghetto junk
To keep the concrete jungle crunk
Fall up on it, my opponent
They only panic and quit
Because the hype from Scarecrow nigga
On some ole other type shit
Watch we manipulate these mads
And get em motivate the hurt
I'm the master of this madness
(?) rock this earth

(Juicy J)
I don't give a fucking while
Don't move a fucking crowd
I'm a tear da club up thug
I'm gonna do that shit right now
Ain't no motherfuckin threat
To the motherfuckin click
Three Six Mafia in the bitch
Hypnotize is the click
Prophet Posse move your body
Let me see you stumble rumble
In this motherfuckin jungle
DJ Paul, take em under
Juicy man never feel the thunder
Rollin crowds just like a blunder
Let me see you tear da club up thug
Let me see you take them under

Chorus 2x (Fade Out)</pre>
