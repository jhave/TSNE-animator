Do you think, everything, everyone, is going mental?
It seems to me that it's spiraling out of control and it's inevitable
Now don't you think
This time is yours, this time is mine?
It's temperamental
It seems to me, we're on all fours
Crawling on our knees
Someone help us please

Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright?
No not slightly
I wanna get a flat I know I can't afford it
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
Well it's very funny 'cause I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles

Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

Don't you want something else
Something new, than what we've got here?
And don't you feel it's all the same
Some sick game and it's not insincere?
I wish I could change the ways of the world
Make it a nice place
Until that day
I guess we stay
Doing what we do
Screwing who we screw

Why can't I sleep at night?
Don't say it's gonna be alright
I wanna be able to eat spaghetti bolognaise
And not feel bad about it for days and days and days
All my magazines, they talk about weight loss
If I buy those jeans I can look like Kate Moss
Oh no it's not the life I chose
But I guess that's the way that things go

Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life
Oh yes, I'm fine
Everything's just wonderful
I'm having the time of my life

(scat singing: Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, etc)

Oh Jesus Christ almighty
Do I feel alright? 
No not slightly,
I wanna get a flat I know I can't afford it
It's just the bureaucrats who won't give me a mortgage
Well it's very funny 'cause I got your fucking money
And I'm never gonna get it just 'cause of my bad credit
Oh well I guess I mustn't grumble
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles

But I guess that's the way that things go
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles
But I guess that's the way that things go
I suppose that's just the way the cookie crumbles</pre>
