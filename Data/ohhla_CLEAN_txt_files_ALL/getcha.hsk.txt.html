(Intro) Da Rockness Monstah
Heltah Skeltah!

No sore losers

[Sean Price]
Yo, listen I'm playin' to win, you playin' to lose
I think it's the skillz; you think it's the shoes
I'm properly trained
Always stay on top of my game
I could give it to you wit no off of the brain
I'm blockin' ya frame
My defence intense, showboat
But I neva rode the bench in the trench
Listen, watch how fast my competitors fall
It's nuttin' to crush 'em cuz truthfully I'm betta then y'all

[Da Rockness Monstah]
This is where I shake, rattle and roll
Straight ache and batter your bones
Shatter your knee caps, ankles and toes
NO...!!!!
Dis ain't the clash of the average Joe's
Dis is where championships are born outta massacre yo
GRRRRRRRRR!!!!
Warrior spirit, I'm playin' but I ain't playin'
No DJ'in' but I'm record breakin'
I jump off as like I'm levitatin' it
Crush you and now cool in the game
This calls for a celebration

(Hook) Buckshot 2x
'Getcha Team'
Let's play
Da Incredible Dream
Clear da way
Can't stop my scene
I'm here to stay
My style is mean...OK!!!!!!

(Outro) Da Rockness Monstah
GEAH!!!!!!!!!
You know what it is boy 'Getcha Team'
