Xzibit:
When it comes to shit like this 
I always get it right the first time
playa haters and snakes
waitin' for mistakes
But that's the breaks the highs and lows
Of the industry
D.I.T.C. and X to the Z
Bringin' it live
Get it crackin' to the third degree
Xzibit breakin' niggas down like H.I.V.
We gring rap to your city like B.E.T.
But still feel California
Is the place to be, Catashtrophy...

Tash:
The Alkaholiks is back to fry you
Xtra crispy
With the skills that make the plots 
to dis me Xtra risky
Cause the time it takes to infiltrate
And stop my forward motion
California will have broken off
And fell into the ocean
Cause i rocked around the world
With my ill type skill
Step for real or I'll leave your grill scarred like Seal
Cause I regulate the sectin where the drinks
Is gettin blended
Certifed bartender 
So catch the 40 
When I send it your way

Xzibit:
Niggas that hustle
Till the day light break
Go to county 20 times
Still can't go straight
Don't nothin in the mothafuckin' 
World come free
I'll never see a nine to five
Cause it just ain't me
(It's like this)
Xzibit shall hustle, lift build muscle
And think like Russell
Survive and bring it live and direct
To any crowd through out the world
Like this come home
And smoke a spliff in the benz
With Swift

Chorus(2 Times)

Xzibit:
I'm fucked up J-Ro

J-Ro:
Yo i'm fucked up to 
Lookin' at these bitches
From a birds eye view
My name is J-Ro from tthe Likwit Crew

Hurricane G:
So what nigga is it you wanna do

J-Ro:
My flow is metaphorical
Historicly correct
What do you expect from a nigga
With my intellect
East coast representing West coast gangsta
New I ain't trippin'
I call up King Tee we go dippin'
Through the streets
Pumpin' hard core Likwit beats 
Flowin' air blowin' loungin'
Inn them leather seats
Think gback how we used to rock the house party
Now we jsut fuckin' it up for everybody

Xzibit:
How dare you try to compare
Yourself to the original 
Professional Xzibit break you down
Like correctional Facilitys
Limit all capabilities muthafuck MC's
Hard to read like Japanese
I'm spreading like disease
So I can't be stopped
By who you run with your click
Or the Btich ass cops
Xzibits' first LP
It hit your black like crack rock
I'm blowin' up your spot by remote
Mr. Cut Throat

J-Ro:
I"m from Cystal-ifornia
I warned ya I'd be on ya 
The Ro is outer national
Cold as Henne-sota
I smoke 12 MC's a day
Just to fill my quota
From Fourty 0-hio
All the way to Ore-gin
Buddy my fingers are bloody Now I'm Washing-ten
I clown from Brew-york
Down to Mi-ti-ami
I soak up game like a shammy
Understand me?

Hook

Tash:
So Elizabeth it's MC's 
That's comin' to join ya
Some will be from NYC And some will be from California
Cause I drop the lyrics on you
From beneath the Earth's surface
Where I write rhymes so fresh 
I try to bite my own verses
Cause the purpose of my flow
Is to let you know
My style is badder than the water 
Down in Mexico
Cause RICO blend styles liek juice and gin
I got the Likwit shit
That have you seein' double
Like the Twins
