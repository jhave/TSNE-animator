Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
It's a big black sky over my town
I know where you at, I bet she's around...

Yeah, I know it's stupid, I just got to see it for myself...

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her - Oh, oh...
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh, oh...
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home - Ooh, ooh...
I keep dancing on my own...

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line...
Stilettos on broken bottles - I'm spinning around in circles...

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her - Oh, oh...
I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh, oh...
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home - Ooh, ooh...
I keep dancing on my own... I keep dancing on my own...

So far away, but still so near, the lights go on, the music dies...
But you don't see me standing here... I just came to say goodbye...

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her -Oh, oh...
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home - Ooh, ooh...
I keep dancing on my own... I keep dancing on my own...

I keep dancing on my own...</pre>
