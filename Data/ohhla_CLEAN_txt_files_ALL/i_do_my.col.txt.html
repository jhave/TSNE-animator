Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Big nerve out of the bullpen with the assist
We goin' back to war tell them boys to re-enlist
I got more shit you don't wanna be a vic
I'm bangin' yall heads it's bout to be a bitch
It's bout to be a lick I'm feelin' very vigorous
I'm bout to be set for life like I'm jigga's kids
All terrain music you know how real it is
I got the beat an shit now look what I did
My man filthy told just grab my balls on it
So what did I do? Yeah I grabbed my balls on it
What should you do? I say bet it all on it
Yeah thats my advice just bet it all on it
Do what I say so I ain't talking for nothin'
Don't take no from a holes yeah especially in public
J. Cole we way swoll either hate it or love it
Got hoes we take those if you dont like it then fuck it

You got your feelins hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it
You got your feelins hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it

Look at the product it's nice
Fuck wit fire and ice
Cheated on my girlfriend until my tires got sliced
Just got some x pills we gonna try em tonight
hang on tight girl you going for the ride of yo life
Everything was fine until she said I wasn't her type
Oh I get it all the time its because that I'm white
She was like "nah I'm used to dudes packin' the pipe
so you can just drop me off if you ain't tappin' me right"
I hysterically laughed girl I aint scared of yo ass
I don ate more pies than even sara lee has
so when I get done with that you wanna marry me ha
play in the backyard so I can bury the cash
and I can bury the bone cuz I am hier to the throne
I don't need no help see I can carry my own
no time for tricks bitch curly larry or moe
I hit with a big stick it's only fair that you know

You got your feelins hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it
You got your feelins hurt?
You wanna talk about it?
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
Guess what bitch I don't wanna hear about it
I do my thing I don't care you you feel about it</pre>
