Intro:
Party-peoplllllllllllle!
Yeahhhhh, Tag Team music, in full effect!  
That's me, DC The Brain Supreme, and my man Steve Roll'n!  
We're kickin the flow!  
We're kickin' the flow!  And it goes a little something like this!

Verse 1: Steve Roll'n
Tag Team, back again
Check it to wreck it, let's begin
Party on, party people, let me hear some noise
DC's in the house, jump, jump, rejoice
Says there's a party over here, a party over there 
Wave your hands in the air, shake your derierre
These three words mean you're gettin' busy:
Whoomp, there it is!  Hit me!

Chorus(8x): DC
Whoomp, there it is!

Verse 2: Steve Roll'n
Upside down and inside out
I'm 'bout to show all you folks what it's all about
Now it's time for a *nigga* to get on the mic
And make this mother*fuckin'* party hype
I'm takin' it back to the old school
'Cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you wanna get down, I'ma show you the way
Whoomp, there it is!  Lemme hear ya say ...

Chorus

Whoomp!  Shaka-laka-shaka-laka-shaka-laka-shaka (4x)

Verse 3: Steve Roll'n
Point blank - gin and juice I drink
And then invent as I puff on dank
Rock the mic, uh oh, I crave skin 
Rip *shit*, find a honey dip to dip it in
Slam dunk it, stick it, flip it and ride
That B-double-O-T-Y, oh my
Ooh, that's it, come on, come on 
Whoomp, there it is! I'm done.

Chorus

Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!  (Whoomp!  There it is!)  (2x)

Verse 4: Steve Roll'n
Some say I'm crazy cause I'm pushing up dasies
the underground sound that you *niggas* have found
Amazing, outstanding, demanding, 
Comanding, you people dancing
(Whooooo!) *Shit!* That's a breath-taker
Our producer, a.k.a. the undertaker
You wanna come down to the underground old school?
Here's a shovel, can you dig it, fool?

4x:
Can you dig it?  (We can dig it!)
Can y'all dig it?  (We can dig it!)

Verse 5: Steve Roll'n
W-H-double O-M-P as I flow,
To the fly *shit* from the school of old
Hard core keep' the folklore wrecked
3 to the 2 and 1 mike check
Mad skill, flow ill, on the mess of steel
That's the thrill of the microphone I just killed
Party people, there's your party; Tag Team is through
Whoomp there it is, I thought you knew!
 
Chorus

Outro:
Yeahhhhh, Tag Team music, comin' strrrraight at 'cha!  
That's me, DC The Brain Supreme, and my man Steve Roll'n!  
Bring it back y'all, bring it back y'all, bring it back, heeeeere we go!
