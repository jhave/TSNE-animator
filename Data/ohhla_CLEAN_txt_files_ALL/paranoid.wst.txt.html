[Intro: Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid
Don't be so paranoid
Don't be so....
Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Verse 1]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight oh here we go
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Kanye West]
Baby don't worry about it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing, the wrong thing
You worry bout the wrong thing

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you</pre>
