My afterword analysis was the average made me anxious
But I began to breathe the substances, these bugs gave me a brain cyst
Somehow I caught a cluster of clay, now everyday's Christmas
Don't you dabble with my destiny peasant, please keep your distance
Every man that escalates is easily erased
And your faculty is a fallacy to my family, that's to your face
I grate the gravel and grass to dig graves for gremlins
But they've had it up to here with how many I've sent to heaven
I indeed not indifferent to the spirit of ism
Every Jones is justifiable, just read it in my jism
The killers keep the kilos in the kitchen while the kids nap
But I lost love for larceny from the impact of the lid slap
Motivation made into the net of the mic's mesh
You never even noticed the novice was holding niceness
Over and over the observations had to open me
Peripheral vision and pitch control to prove the potency
You're on quite a quest, but let me quiz you with a question
Did you read the rest and did you reach your point of reference?
See now it's simple, call me "son", I'll refer to you as "surrogate"
The turntables turn cause you was tugging on your tunicate
Underwent the upset and made your whole unit urine
In the vents, sprayed a variety of verbs on the vermin
The weasels, weaknesses was wrecked on a Wednesday
X marks the xenon, be the xenolith on my X-ray
Yesterday you saw me spool my yarn to the youth
Zigzagged through the zone and broke the zodiac like Zeus
Zigzagged through the zone and broke the zodiac like Zeus
Zigzagged through the zone and FUCKED your microphone
