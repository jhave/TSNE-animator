[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm just +So Far Gone+ 
October's own 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains, I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm, Yeah
But I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

[Talking]
You know, everything gone be alright, I promise
Apologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... Forgive me. Yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh, And life is so insane
Look what I've became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you're born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
Ohio girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest
As a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain... Me, yeah

[Talking]
Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask
what type of act you puttin' on like... Man</pre>
