and when I shoot nigga look shoot to kill
call it a murder cause you ain't gonna live

[Mack 10]

I feel you, I know you want to be hard
but just know I'm gonna kill you

and I ain't the one to be trusting
cause I feel like busting
I got hot hollows that'll run right throw ya
(?) runaway and Turk gonna do you
so do the right thing homie ya understood?

[chorus]
MURDER Bloody Bloody MURDER
