Walkin' to an undertone
Ears don't hear to clear cause I stuck a pencil inside my temple
My blood escapes from outta the hole
Your broadcast is white from every one of my channels
Nothin' but static remains, I ain't really changed
I just disconnected and chucked all of my feelings away
I'm numb now, they call me dumb somehow
I chose myself as a target to unleash and take all the pain out on
So I'm the victim of my own wicked torment
Spare me with the tears of sorrow, I quite enjoy it
I was never meant to belong
Odd shapred pieces never fit the puzzle of life society's built on
So here I sit with a hole in my head
I tried replacin' information and I wound up dead
Nothin' but static remains on my hands and my brains
Are leakin' out on the floor as I die screamin' in pain

You dealin' with a person who ain't got nothin' to lose
Type a motherfucker hang himself with the lace inside his gym shoes
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me
You dealin' with a person who could really give a fuck
Type a motherfucker get the stick and somebody gon' get stuck
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me

I'm the wrong one to test, laid ho's to rest
Go against me and I kidnap the nest
Second guess me, I'm pushin' pause on your life
Like you're stopped at a light, I'm sneakin' in like a thief in the night
To cause murder, nah man don't hurt her, man you soundin' like a bitch
Get a grip, too late her neck's slit, watch the blood drip
It forms a puddle by the side of her head
And now it hit you that she's dead
In a rage you lunge at me but my blade cuts a hole in your lung
You're grabbin' at me but both of y'all are done
I'm the one nobody thought could ever do something
So gruesome to the point where people call it a rumor
That never caught me till this day the spirits still haunt me
In my midn is where they hide, I hope nobody'll find me
I can end it with a slit of my wrist
Or I can murder motherfuckers to help me get with this shit

You dealin' with a person who ain't got nothin' to lose
Type a motherfucker hang himself with the lace inside his gym shoes
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me
You dealin' with a person who could really give a fuck
Type a motherfucker get the stick and somebody gon' get stuck
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me

Man who you fuckin' with, I got no conscience
Fuck the whole world is how I feel to be honest
Walk up in a crown of G's, blast off hot lead
From the barrel of my gun to the cheek, now they dead
Blood stains, streaks, where they were standin'
They body slayin' section pick them up and put them in my collection
Don't start static, always lookin' for more
Watch your back when it's dark and you alone it's on

Electroshock brainwave hair rise
Look in a killer's eyes,static with me you only fantasise
Rub the wrong way, quick reflex
Eager to jump at fuckin' anyone and put 'em in check
I let things get to me now, I'm the one startin' the static
Easy come easy go, problem solved with automatics
Deep breaths takin' no need, ain't necessary
Cause the static bein' started doesn't scare me not at all

You dealin' with a person who ain't got nothin' to lose
Type a motherfucker hang himself with the lace inside his gym shoes
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me
You dealin' with a person who could really give a fuck
Type a motherfucker get the stick and somebody gon' get stuck
You better watch your back, you better watch me
Ain't no tellin' where I might be or what I got with me</pre>
