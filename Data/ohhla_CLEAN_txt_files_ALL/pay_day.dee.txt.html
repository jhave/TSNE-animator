[Intro]
You tuned in to Jay Stay Paid (*NO*) 5-1 FM
  For the freshest hardcore J Dilla shit
  you ever gon' hear in yo' life baby

[Frank Nitty]
You know it is I, the boy Frank Nitt'
Pumps blowin, jewelry glowin on some Detroit shit
And you know about the spit the jewels ain't got nuttin to do with that
Bring it back, I'll beat up the track until it's blue and black
It's Detroit nigga, Jay Stay Paid
It's hip-hop, but it's more than graffiti gettin sprayed
So turn the strings up, and the bass too
It's Frank Nitty, how you doin? Nice to meet you
You niggaz see through, like the moon roof
We switched to the four door from the old coupe
Yeah we upgrade, and Jay Stay Paid
We still movin forward on the plans that we made
So this is a warning, why you niggaz yawnin?
We not the killer bees but we swarmin, nigga!
So turn the strings up, and the bass too
It's Frank Nitty, how you doin? Nice to meet you
And I'm that nigga you heard of, and word up
Frank 'n Dank nigga, you can fuck what you heard bruh
But hearin this you need to pay Jay Deezy
And I'm watchin y'all rats and niggaz so cheesy
So please believe me, you can picture that
I know you thought we left, but we'll be right back
So - turn the strings up, and the bass too
It's Frank Nitty, how you doin? Nice to meet you
You, and you, and you, yeah
Your boy Frank Nitty
F'n D, Frank 'n Dank, J Dilla
Forever, whatever
Yeah</pre>
