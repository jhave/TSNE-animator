[Intro]
Yeah, what's pimpulatin' motherfuckers? Celph Titled, aka O.J. Pimpson. Bwoy
Fuck everybody. Let's do this shit. Yo, yeah, check it

I told the skrilla guerilla never shave your back
Cause the god say grizzly in this game of rap
Aim the gat, point it at your left nipple for shizzle
Bring the beef here, I handle it to the gristle
Launch a missile
That's what I'm known for
Hand grenades and napalm cords 
Lay you flat, run your ass over with lawn movers
Your soft rap, I ain't feelin' that
I treat your wig like a decal and peel your cap
Your little demo makin' niggas wish you could be me
I'll turn your face blue
Lookin' like the bottom of your CD
See me?
I got chainsaws with remote controls
Chase you down the block, chop your head down to provolone
Rip off the T.V. antenna, while you watchin' Opera
Stab your chest and leave more holes than Caddyshack gophers
Straight out of motherfuckin' Tampa like the Devil Rays
Took a trip to Hell and snatched the chicken off the Devil's plate</pre>
