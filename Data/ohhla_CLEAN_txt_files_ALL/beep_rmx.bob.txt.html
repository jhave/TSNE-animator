[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
Shorty been eyeing me (Valentino)
She looking like she thinking about trying me (Haha)
She want it she can't take no more (Yeah)
I'm about to take her to my spot 
I'ma get it hot she going, she going... (And let me)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (Hahaha)
She gonna let me (Ooh)
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I'ma tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep (That's right)
She gonna let me 
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'ma have her screaming like 
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Come with me)
I'ma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go 
I'ma tear it up

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Yeah, hahaha, LUDA
She told me that she wanted to knock my socks off
So I slid my three-thousand dollar crocs off
She got her rocks off, and I got the cops off
In my fire red lamborghini, hot sauce
I was just a block off of Peachtree and Pharr Road, hey
I scanned her over like her booty had a bar code, hey
I made the car fold (yup) and then the car slowed
Weeooo weeooo wee, I went into alarm mode, ooh
'Cause she was badder than the baddest of the baddestess
Her butt was fatter than the fattest of the fattestess
And I was glad it is, see what the saddest is
So I can take her home and she'll see where the apparatus is
Hey, in my private pool, yup her body drips dry
She was bare foot, I did her in my flipflops
Ooh, tick tock, the clock goes boom
So we quickly Luda-christened every room
LUDA

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino (Lil' Kim)]
Shorty been eyeing me 
She looking like she thinking about trying me
She want it she can't take no more
I'm about to take her to my spot 
I'ma get it hot she going, she going...
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gonna let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I'ma tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gonna let me 
Beep, beep, beep, beep
I'ma have her screaming like 
Go, go, go, go, go, go
I'ma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Yeah it's your girl)
I'ma tear it up
(Q-U-Double E-N-B-Double E)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I back it up switch it up just for you daddy
Dior lipstick, kiss your tattoos daddy *mwah*
I'm with you for the night, just play your cards right
I'll let you do some thangs to me
Ummmm, on the hood of the Bugatti 
Caesar picotti heels on my feet
I'm in the drivers seat while you beep beep beep
Who needs the freak of the week
You with the freak of the century
Open up the history books, it's gonna mention me
Boys call me Candy Girl, aka the truth, haha
Honey Girl, and for me he got a sweet tooth
He gon' drown in my wet wet ooooh
I hope that watch is waterproof

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino (Lil' Kim)]
Shorty been eyeing me (Hahaha yeah)
She looking like she thinking about trying me

She want it she can't take no more
I'm about to take her to my spot 
I'ma get it hot she going, she going...
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gonna let me
Beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh)
I'ma tear it up when I
Beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh)

Beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh) beep (ah) beep (oh)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bobby V, I got you
Hey baby, my name ain't important
Umm, for now you can call me The Motion
Yeah, I need love like an orphan
So I could be your bug-a-boo, no arguing
Lil' mama let me beep beep like a motorola
Now I'm in love knee deep but it's at her shoulders
But being that I'm a G, I try to keep composure
But I swear shorty got me weak like the weekend over
From the window to the wall she get even lower
Yeah, she got the game, I'm just trying to keep the score
And I promise to be good and never leave it sore
And if I do I promise I will treat it more 
Gentle the next time and even more
Will I lie or cheat, either or
Shit I'd rather beep like a freaking horn
And keep it blowing, aiight

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
Shorty been eyeing me (Oooooh)
She looking like she thinking about trying me (Trying me no)
She want it she can't take no more 
(No more, no more, no more)
I'm about to take her to my spot (Moooore)
I'ma get it hot she going, she going...
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
She gonna let me
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
(She gon' let me beep)
I'ma tear it up when I
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
(She gon' let me beep)
She gonna let me 
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep
I'ma have her screaming like 
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Let's go baby)
I'ma have her screaming like
Go, go, go, go, go, go (Ohhh)
I'ma tear it up

I'ma do it just like this
I'ma do it just like this
I'ma do it just like that 
Said I'ma do it just like that baby
Baby, oooh, oooo
