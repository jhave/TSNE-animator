[Chorus: Joe Budden]
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
You know I keep it filthy out in
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
Check it.............

[Verse One: Joe Budden]
Rockin spikes and a beater, beside me a diva
I'm hearin all the talk of how you ride with a heater
Make sure I don't survive but when I see ya, ya sleep with a broke heart
Like you went and took advice from Alicia
Tell me if you really wanna take it there
Best in the world if you ain't remained aware
Latest gear, love, no, hate it yeah
You and your scared style a get aired out, start, stop and stare now
Change the trucks grill yeah the car got veneers now 
'Lot of rappers spittin shit, I don't wanna hear now
They talkin Gucci but they shoppin at Sears now
If you weren't prepared now? You ain't get the warnin yet
So I'm a go hard early call it morning sex
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
Tinted up, rims silly
If a nigga try and kill me chalk it up, had the brother wildin
With mind playin tricks on you get off Shutter Island
Showin you somethin you never would see, I'm gettin checks every week
You tryin to meet your executive needs, I'm in executive suites consecutively 
Somebody had to body ya, guess the job was left to me
So when I kill the track they can't charge me with double jeopardy
They asked you if I'm a boss and you say no sir
How you don't concur my golfer got a chauffer  
Standin on the couch in the club with a nympho
Reppin Slaughterhouse see the blood on the window
Let's see I get wealthy, being broke gettin healthy
So I ain't tryin to buy whatever shit they try to sell me
Got a broad up in the telly I could trust her what you tell me
Still bringin Lunatics with me yeah I learned that trick from Nelly
'Cause I know it can get urgent, when they see you just splurgin
Strip club, in the private room tryin to fix the curtains
Wanna 'cause a big excursion run up on the kid squirtin
Make sure the Mac ain't broke and you ain't buy the Knicks version
Out in..........

[Chorus: Joe Budden]
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
You know I keep it filthy out in
New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly, New York, Jersey, Philly
Niggas gotta feel me

[Bridge: Joe Budden]
OWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Slaughterhouse gang!!! My brotha from another mother! Let's go to the D!!!
Nickel!!!!!! OWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse Two: Royce Da 5'9]
Blood on the speakers, puke in the booth
Hard hats bazookas, poop on my boots
You all laughin 'til you get hit shootin from my gun
I am in Doublemint, condition like chewin gum
Bum, you older than fuck
A hop, skip and a jump from layin down holdin a cup
And there's nothin more impressive than being in one of my sessions
My views excitin like a dude viewin a warmin undressin
And y'all must have lost y'all sense Ashton Mart dark dark tint
The weed stankin like the moth ball scent
Y'all bunch of pop lame ass niggas 
Lyricless Wacka Flocka Flame ass niggas
I am it, there is none before me, hush your nigga mouth quick
Like Benzino, after me and Joe we did 40/40
And you can tell that bitch nigga I will kill him
You have no idea of what, y'all are dealin
I'm a walkin solid hundred dollar bill and I am so fuckin fly
Had to buy my fuckin house without a ceilin
I am a apocalyptic pop a nigga trigger 
You might wanna stop it if you was the opposite of killer, a gorilla
I'm like five percent killer, five percent Eminem
The other ninety percent, cap pealer
I'm that iller, my speech is dead
Yucky like you lookin at Mo'Nique legs
Sick man!!!! I go harder than you can withstand
I'm on lean like Bacardi on a kick stand
I'm at the party in your bitch pants
I'll Kadeem Hardison six man you bitch fam!!!
The A-R is the choice of weapon
I am the voice of B-S and yes I'm Detroit reppin
My whole ice, look like meow yen
Her thighs, look like she's been practicin moy tai</pre>
