[Nate Dogg]
I need me a bitch, with some big old thighs
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some pretty ass eyes
I need me a bitch, like I need some cash
I need me a bitch so I can floss that hoe and make my ex mad
I need me a bitch, ain't no need to lie
I need me a bitch so when I do some dirt she be my alibi
I need me a bitch, like I need a 6-4
I need me a bitch that'll shine my rims up and open my door
I need me a bitch, who is all of that
I need me a bitch cause I'm a fly ass mothafuckin' nigga who was born to mac
I need me a bitch, like neva before
I need me a bitch and I couldn't care less if the bitch is yours
I need me a bitch

[Rob Stricklong]
I gotta fuck wit cheeks, got a house up on the beach
Everyweek she call me just to beat up the peach
'Til she reach a climax, scratches on my back
Hit it from the back, baby told me she like that
Infact, you the first one to make it feel right
I knew she wasn't lyin', knew the cat was real tight
And afta tonight, you gone remember me
Armed Robbery, put my love up there where your liver be (Haha)
I told her never speak on me (Damn)
'Less ya want your burnt out friends ta creep wit' me, go ta sleep wit me
I hit her frequently, take them women off the chain
Can duck game, eva see the bitches run the train (Uh-uh)
It ain't the same (Uh-uh), afta I knock it out the frame
You wonder why just now ya start gettin' brain
I knock 'em out, pull chickens wit'out a doubt, fo' clout
Ask Nate Dizzal what I'm all about

I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I need me a bitch (Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh)
I need me a bitch, who ain't hard ta please
I need me a fine ass mothafuckin' bitch with some sored up knees
I need me a bitch, who ain't scared ta flirt
I need me a bitch in the middle of the grocery store she'll lift up her skirt
I need me a bitch, like I need my crew
I need me a bitch to pass on to my boys soon as I get through
I need me a bitch, this I can't deny (I can't deny)
I need me a bitch I love when she wallin' out cause she still look fly (Fly)
I need me a bitch, and a Coup Deville
I need me a bitch a car with a big back seat so I can make her squeal
I need me a bitch, like I need a drink
Bitch who can hold her breathe real good, its either swim or sink bitch
I, I, I, I need a bitch
I, I, I, I need a bitch
I, I, I, I need a bitch
I, I, I, I need a bitch</pre>
