[Verse 1: Twista]
I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars
Well I treat bitches like drinks
When I step in the club and by out the bar
So let me quench my thirst with you and a friend
Instead of the juice &amp; gin
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in
Glass full of ass for a true motherfucker
With that that turquoise Coogi on
You remind me of a blue motherfucker
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in Prada
But I think Gina was hotter
Cause her skin tone was like a piña colada
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies
So I ordered them a mai tai and hot sake, then I got cocky
And asked them do they come to this club a lot
Well ya got a brotha hot
Hop in my bubble drop
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita's one wit the karma of margarita
The other one like two shots of tequila
And they all fine I really don't know what to think
As I get bubbly and choose and try to figure out

[Chorus: Highbeam]
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
[4x]
What's my favorite drink?

[Verse 2: Twista]
Don't want the middle Cosmopolitan ass
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neopolitan mast
No telling what these thick bitches would do
Reminiscent of a big old pitcher of brew
But hit ya like a slow screw
Dip in a strip a club in LA with a bankroll
Where the weather ain't cold
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll
I met two dancers named Moet and Cristal
I was checkin they style
We had a session It was wet it was wild
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remi Red
With skinny legs
Both of them game to give me head
With a little bit absolute vodka for they homie Tasha
Tell her to come closer
So y'all three can give me a Sammy Sosa
If I was mayor I would campaign ass
Drunk politician with women swimming around the champagne glass
Drink so much that I might hurl in the sink
And if you ask me why
I couldn't figure out

[Chorus: Highbeam]
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
[4x]
What's my favorite drink?

[Verse 3: Twista]
If you would suck my soul
I shall lick your funky emotions
Look at that big old donkey you toting
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop's cup
And have a toast wit King Boo
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck
I holla Church cause its pimps in the party
Let me sip on ya body
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi
Or a long Island havin sex on the beach
Or in the 'llac sunroof let back with the tech on the seat
Got a red bone I call her strawberry daquiri
Bring her back for me
Carry packs for me
Had her suck off my facultay
Got a little mamma name Mimi
Who remind me of Martini and Asti Spumante
How she move to my cd
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat
She help me shake up dope
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think
As I get bubbly and choose
And try to figure out

[Chorus: Highbeam]
What's my favorite Drink?
Girl can I sip on you
Sip on you
[4x]
What's my favorite drink?

[Outro: Highbeam]
Hennesy mixed wit some of that Alize
Gimme a shot of that Remy
And a whole lot of Tanqueray
Keep it comin with that Cognac
Pop the Moet lets sip on that
Naw playa put ya money back
Cause these drinks on me
Give me a bottle of that Belve'
Long island iced tea
Hook me up a martini
All these dinks on me
I want to have a sex on the beach
How about a gin &amp; juice for me
So put away ya money G
All these drinks on me
