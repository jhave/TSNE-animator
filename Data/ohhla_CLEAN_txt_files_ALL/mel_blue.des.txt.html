[Desdamona]
Undefined, yet refined
Pictures in my mind, of you, mellow blue
Do do do, what you do
The way you do... my mellow blue

Recline, in this chair of mine
Let your soul fly high, close your eyes - not tightly
Do, what you do
The way you do... my mellow blue

Undefined, yet refined
Pictures in my mind of you, mellow blue
Do do do, what you do
The way you do... my mellow blue

I see you, I see you inside
Inside you always try to hide
But if you ask me for the time I would oblige
I feel you, I feel you inside
Inside, my mind
Falling down unto my page and you come alive

{*harmonizing... doo doo doo, mellow blue*}

[repeat 2X]
Undefined, yet refined
Pictures in my mind of you, mellow blue
Do do do, what you do
The way you do... my mellow blue

{*long instrumental break*}

Mellow, blue... mellow, blue
Melllow, you... mellow, you
Make me, feel, make me, feel
Make me, feel, cooooooool</pre>
