Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Oh oh oh oh oh oh na na na na na
Oh oh oh oh oh oh hear me out

This is my King's Speech, I'm nowhere near the end
If I s-s-s-stutter, sorry I ain't heaven's sent
I messed my life up and yeah I've been down
I'm a changed man now, Chris Brown
You know I feel your pain 'cause I've done and been through it
I'm Kurt Cobain but I just couldn't do it
No point in turning back just to hit rewind
Back to the future, Ma... Marty McFly
Deep inside, there's a fire
'Cause I'm no longer looking at a reflection I admire
I paint the picture of a fighter, but their's someone's looking back at me and says I'm a liar

If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognise myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days

Oh oh oh oh oh oh na na na na na
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

This is my last chance, I'm on my final straw
I came so close to b-b-b-breaking like a spinal chord
I came from nothing, some kid in Camden
Now I'm flying in the birds, Richard Branson
I'm a prince, yes I will... get the crown (Shh)
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister's around
So please forgive if I make mistakes
But I'll blow the bloody doors off, Michael Cain

If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognise myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days

I'm free to be whatever I, 'cause I'm famous
Call me Gallagher 'cause I'm so shameless
The papers, saw the pages that are the cost of my failures
Victimised by the public, don't know if I could take it
So I sing
So when you feel like there's no more and nothing left but the life you've broken
No regrets, no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell them I'm just being me

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognise myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No regrets
No regrets...

No regrets!

[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognise myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days

'Cause when I look in the mirror (in the mirror)
I don't even recognise myself (oh oh oh oh)
Got the heart of a winner (of a winner)
But looking back at me is someone else (no)
No regrets (no)
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday (ehhh)
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause you ain't even seen the best of me</pre>
