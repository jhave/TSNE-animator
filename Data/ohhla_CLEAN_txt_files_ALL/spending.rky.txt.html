[R. Kelly]
I'm gonna get into you (get in too deep)
I wanna get into you (get in too deep)
Wanna get into you (get in too deep)
Oahhohh, ohhh .. (get in too deep)

All my fellas in the house if you fuckin tonight
Throw yo' hands up!
And all my honies in the house if you fuckin tonight
Just throw yo' hands up!

I wanna get into you (get in too deep)
I wanna get into you (baby get in too deep)
I wanna get into you (just get in too deep)
I wanna get into you (kick a lil freestyle, yo)

[R. Kelly]
Y'all been here so what the hell
Let's get up on our hotel
Doin the nasty, all night long
Make your body scream and moan
Tell your man that we're some kin
Play it off and bring a friend
I got backstage passes for you
Just meet me right by the bathroom
And if you don't have a curfew
Keep it real and we'll be cool
And if your ID's up to age
Then you're gonna get some "12Play"
I ain't gon' front, got it like that
The stairs goes down as room goes black
Get deep in you like +The Abyss+
You bring your ass home all pregnant

Chorus: R. Kelly, Jaz-Ming (repeat 2X)

You must be use to me spending
and all that sweet wining and dining
Well I'm fucking you tonight
	Baby it's no mystery
	You will be all up in me
	Freakin is my specialty
	I've got all of what you need

[R. Kelly]
(yo, yo)
All my fellas in the house if you fuckin tonight
Throw yo' hands up!
And all my honies in the house if you fuckin tonight (uh, c'mon)
(Just) throw yo' hands up!

[Jaz-Ming]
You know there's nobody better than
Jaz-Mack, late night like Letterman (oh word?)
From the movies to the hooptie to the Sheraton (what?)
There you go, tryin to feel up on my breasts again

[Nokio]
Shorty better guess again
I trick grips of chips and trips on you
You did flips when I tried to put the lips on you
Now we ain't got SHIT to do
but head to my crib and "Enter the Dru"

[Jaz-Ming]
The who?  You nuttin but a star joke nigga (oh word?)
No few for your Benz Jeep car broke nigga

	Aiyyo listen my advice is
	fellas pay the prices
	If she's fuckin you
	and not those sexual devices

Chorus

[R. Kelly]
Pull that, boo-ty, ov-errrr, yeah
and jump in my ride, babe
Cause once I get you home with me
And fulfill your fantasies
You'll say bust the flavas
then give that ass to me! Oahhhhh, yeah

Chorus

I wanna get into you (get in too deep)
I wanna get into you (get in too deep)
Oahhhhoahhhh (get in too deep)
La-di-da-da-da (in too deep ??)

	Baby it's no mystery
	You will be all up in me
	Freakin is my specialty
	I've got all of what you need..</pre>
