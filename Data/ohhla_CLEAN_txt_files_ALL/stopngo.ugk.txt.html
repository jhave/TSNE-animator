[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
We be pullin up in the hot shit (ERRRRRT!)
And that's cause we the star of the show (whoa)
Now if you gettin money and got whips (ladies and gentlemen!)
And pull up on your stop and go's (OOOH-WEE, show out)
This (show out) is (show out) the (show out) way (show out)
We (show out) stop (show out) and (oh boy) go (show out)
Don't (show out) block (show out) my (show out) way (show out)
We (show out) stop (show out) the (oh boy) show
 
[Bun B]
Please rise for the president of the South
And all hail to the chief with them diamond teeth in his mouth
Make way (way) Big Dick Chaney is 'bout to enter
King committee's in session (session) but first on the agenda
Bend the corner on them fo's, 'Llac turnin on them Vouges
One time for the haters (haters) two times for the hoes
I suppose it's only right for me to grip up on the cherry (cherry)
Oak wood wheel while I'm drippin cranberry (berry)
And very few have accomplished what we have achieved
Without a rabbit out of a hat or a trick up the sleeve (trick up the sleeve)
I got a steady hand (hand) and a steady flow (flow)
So on your mark, get set (set) ready go (go)
You already know
 
[Chorus]
 
[Pimp C]
Swishers and dank and pourin up big drank (drank)
Hundred thousand dollars in my grown set link (link)
I got two on, that's two hundred
You gon' go crazy nigga tryna count my money (money)
I came from the bottom they hate me like I'm a Saddam (Saddam)
198 in a spur house in Nevada
'vada, 'vada; Vegas nigga (nigga)
Got my paper pimpin through Cerwin Vegas nigga
Let me show you how we keep the parkin lot on fire (on fire)
Full kit, on my shit 26 inch tiiiiires! (tires)
Yokohamas and the wheel still wood
Keep a bad yellow bitch cause my dick feel good
When you see us in the hood nigga
 
[Chorus]
 
[Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Dope man, yay and the dro in the drought (whoa)
Pull up in the spot with the brains blowed out (heyyyy!)
Wheels cost a whip (whip) whip cost a house (house)
UGK and Jazze Pha show up and show out (OOOOH-WEE!)
She wanna chill with the crew
Kick it in the crib on the hill with the view
You know you wanna holla, what it is what it do
She love me for my old school drops and my cool 
cause my shit be the truth (whoa!)
The wheels never pause (ohh!)
Counter-clockwise when I +SKERRRRRRT+ on 'em all
And when she fall through and see the plaques on the wall
She'll probably call a couple friends, shit call 'em all
Down come the drawers - oh boy! (OOOH-WEE!)
 
[Chorus] w/ extra ad libs
