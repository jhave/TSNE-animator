Song:   The World Is Crazy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I think everybody in the world has lost their mind
I believe they lost something they cannot find
Cause everybody is going crazy
And everybody is out their goddamn mind

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna watch the news to see no bad news
Don't wanna be glued to the YouTube
I ain't paying no attention to no sick dude
Eat them people up like his child needs food
Killer mommas storing babies in the dumpsters
Ain't no education for our little youngsters
Politicians operate with no structure
You're working dirty, that's why we don't trust you
Everybody just wanna be famous
Whiling on the internet, acting all shameless
Yesterday the motherfucker was nameless
Now they're on the talkshow, ain't really same shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody just following a blind man
Buying water for the motherfucker sandman
Hoping in the ocean, looking for Bin Laden's body
The world's going crazy

[Chorus]
I think everybody in the world has lost their mind
I believe they lost something they cannot find
Cause everybody is going crazy
And everybody is out their goddamn mind

[Verse 2]
I asked my momma what the hell is really going on
She said the world's too cold, keep your coat on
I heard a priest tell a lie at the podium
The whole world in a state of pandemonium
Don't wait for an answer, it ain't coming soon
They pick cause is killing like it's hot new
AK47 in the classroom, kids killing each other like it's cartoon
Everybody unemployed, no education for the kids got me so annoyed
They put the money in the prison like they're paranoid
They put the Bible down to pick up the tabloid

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all following a blind man
Buying water for the motherfucker sandman
Hoping in the ocean, looking for Bin Laden's body
The world's going crazy

[Chorus]
I think everybody in the world has lost their mind
I believe they lost something they cannot find
Cause everybody is going crazy
And everybody is out their goddamn mind</pre>
