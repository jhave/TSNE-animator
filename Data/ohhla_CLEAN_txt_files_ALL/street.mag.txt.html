Yo Don!
I got a white... mask
A black cape, two pair of silver gloves
and nobody know who I am
I will not take my mask off to reveal
Check it out but I'ma drop lyrics
You know what?  Hit it

Yo niggaz wanna get in the backdoor, but fuck it
Rappers can't rap a lick, chompin on other dick
I gotta do this for X, and make them brothers quit
Don't try that sissy shit, that gettin busy shit
I bang a nail up in your dooty hole and booty quick
Rappers know me, I'm bugged, I chop your ass right
Take that body and bag it, then I'm out of sight
I got the F.B.I., not the F.O.I.
tryin to find the design, and ? went underline
The pure facts on the stupid wicked wax
People they know, I'm out the hospital
Cold buggin and illin like Dr. Doolittle
You better walk up the street, now look around black

See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (8X)

Back to hell to the graveyard
With fog on the street, you see the Ghostrider homepiss
I walk down on your block and see you sleepin
Cold jump in your bed, and fuck you up, yea yea
Down with the X, I'm at the basement
Got the body and bag, up on the pavement
Cement I went, just hid em in the vent
I put the rappers upstairs and let em air out
Before the cops came, I cleaned the blood up
I called detectives in town and said yo whattup
I wasn't home - somebody's in my house
I took them rappers back out, up in a pickup truck
Think I'd tell on myself?

See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (10X)

Yeah
I'm not gon' reveal myself
Still standing here with this black cape on
White gloves, these big silver boots
Ain't nobody notice how I fly, how high
So I'll see you on the next issue
Catch me at the Forbidden Planet</pre>
