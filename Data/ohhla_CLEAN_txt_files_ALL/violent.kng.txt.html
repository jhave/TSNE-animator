I am a phenomenon...

[Verse 1]
Don't get it twisted for a minute
like I wont enter your skin and
create havoc all through your respiratory system, now you asthmatic
Sad and tragic, but through the madness I laugh at it
I start to unravel like gum wrappers. Stab 'em with thumbtacks
attackin all you wack bubble gum rappers
I am not human
I can get rushed and socked by thirty-two men and I am not movin
confusin you with this new shit, I will influence what you spit
I'm choosin all of this music, you're stupid. Your musics useless
Y'all ain't stoppin my verse
Hope you got faith, you're locked in a church
It ain't safe to walk through this Earth
There's a man with two horns in his head - he's quite sickening
They're saying he was born from the dead - Gothic description
On stage chokin himself to he's dyin
Got a million of my fans screaming loud WE VIOLENT!

[Chorus]
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!

[Verse 2]
Everybody in the house tonight (uh huh)
Turn to the person next to you (ok)
Now soon as this motherfucking beat drops (WHAT!?)
Balls your fists up, you know what to do
Swing on him, kick him and punch him
Hit him in the stomach till he shit out his lunch and
his pupils is dialatin. His balls, they vibratin
The crown rushin the stage, I love it
This is the same shit and I made it
I get off on chaos, I'm sniffin up napalm
Go on stage at a rage, half of my face ate off
Put eighteen holes in your chest like the game golf
I spit crazy pores from the head, I am way off
They callin me hell's spawn. A terror never capture America terrified
They sayin I shouldn'ta left it
Now I'm in the industry, smokin weed wilin
Got a million of my fans screaming loud WE VIOLENT!

[Chorus]
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!

[Verse 3]
Light of a God, heart of a soldier, blood of a king
Lightning rod, shockin your shoulders buckle your knees
Various fight techniques. You watchin the right, then the left'll swing
Take your best swing, now meet the seven piece
Rumble in the jungle, ballin knuckles
Throwin punches at him till he stumbles
Drips of blood become in bundles
I like fight songs that make y'all violent
Like them girls in them thongs that be sayin "he wilin"
Don't grab the mag if this man touch you
Mike Tyson his ass if his man punch you
and bite off his ear is he head-butts you
Where my Fat Killahz at?
If you beefin we eatin, know where he livin at
Kick him and beat him and leave in his kitchen smacked
This is for all my crazy fans that like to woop some ass
Drinkin on that Jackie Dan cause it's gets them mad
I can't believe, it I think I'm dreamin
I got a million motherfuckers screamin

[Chorus]
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't wanna get in this mosh pit WE VIOLENT!
Y'all don't want my fighters to start shit WE VIOLENT!
Stage grabbin the crowd
Get crazy and wild
Got a million of players screaming loud WE VIOLENT!

WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE
VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE
VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT! WE VIOLENT!</pre>
