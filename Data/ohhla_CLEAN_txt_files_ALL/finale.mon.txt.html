[Gudda Gudda]
They call me Young Gudda
I'm all about the doe still
And anybody in my way, Roadkill
Evrything my hands touch turn to gold
Money, Knots and Jewels with no records sold, (Yeah)
I'm Manhandling rappers with no effort
So imagine what'll happen when I start applying pressure
Guillotine flow who ready to get severed nigga
In or out the booth you could get leveled nigga

[Jae Millz]
Yo, We are Young Money
Nigga you can't chocha
It's bout to get real ugly, Amarosa
YM vultures, there ain't a family doper
We done changed the way the game look, Sammy Sosa (Ha Ha)
This is life this ain't a job, Audemare and Shapor
Just symbolize I go hard
Navy on Navy Camero I did all for the yankees
Did it all for New York and this love no need to thank me

[Tyga]
Uhh, fast money I don't slow dance
Young Money motherfucka till the world end
Money over weight, bitch, Rosanne
I don't listen to these kids, Grown man
Skinny nigga dubbed up, low hand
Lindsey the white benz, same colour mike skin
Make ya soul spin when the ping loading
Au revoir, goodbye, now applaud

[Lil Chuckee]
Young Money lil G
Battle juice in my blood
Jumpin at the boy
Man, you better have ya bungee cord
Since Wayne took me off the leash
I ain't lose a fight yet
Now come drag ya dog out the ring how he love that
Yung wid a attitude, watch how ya talk to me
Keep playin freddy boi, I'll leak on ya elm street
Trouble is what you want dog, pain is what you don't get
It's Young Money till the bone grizzle

[Lil Twist]
Young Money good night
And yeah I'm gonna shine like an Ultra Violet light
Lil twist cold cellar like it's opening tonight
31'st nigga to write, You need a telescope sight
To try to see me, I'm so far gone
Even though I'm goin out kids, I'm so far on
I gotta house full of cheques like the playboy home
Wrapping up my lifestyle and I smashed this song
Twizzy

[Nicki Minaj]
I'm in that cotton pink bent
Put mass on the guts
White on white whips
Kunta Kinte on the clutch
You at the bottom of the pole, Totem
Like Lamar Odom, I ball, scrotom
Flyer than a cricket so they call me Nicki Jim-any
And it's going down like Santa in the chimney
You don't ball break ya baby back ribs
You need more assist than the handicap kids

[Shanell]
Young Money we rockstars
So fuck wit ya magnum on
And hold on we go long
You feel that, We get that
We in that, we run that, we bus back
We hit em when we see em coming back for more
Back for more..

[Mack Maine]
Michael wade family in the building you can't hold us
Me, taz and wayne we the 3 new moguls
Buffet around here ya'll boys scrape the plates
And we don't eat up in our whispa they got paper plates
Soon as we leave the club damn let the models go
One word I forgot to say on his album, Hollygrove!
This track different now they nod this the genesis
Young Money murderers, We killin shit
Forever..

[Drake]
Alright I got this, you can never get this
I built it up from nuthin you would think I'm playin tetris
Thousand dollar sweater on but I never sweat shit
Swear the beats they give me got a motherfuckin death wish
Yeah, tell me who controls kings, I don't follow rules, stupid old things
I'm flying through the city in a coupe with those wings
My team deserves some motherfuckin supabowl rings, Young Money

[Lil Wayne]
I'm so in this bitch, CEO in this bitch
Lil Weezy stand tall, Tippytoe in this bitch
Blood gang motherfucka da da doe in this bitch
Make ya girl get Barry Manilow in this bitch
In the body of the World, money is the blood
And everyday I be back and forward to the blood bank
Uhh making deposits till I fucking faint
New Orleans, nigga how about no fucking saints
It's tight on our end call that bubbafranks
Matter fact it's too tight add a couple links
I'm the barstender you a women drink
Yeah it's young money but the money aint
Gudda tough, Nelly nice, Nick Nasty
Streets bad, Tyga ill, Drake magic
Millz Harlem, Chuck wild, Twist Dallas
And Mack Maine rap, sing and manage
Uhhhh

It's Young Moolah Baby...</pre>
