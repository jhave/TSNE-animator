[X-Raided]
I had a heart full of pride and had to set it aside
As I was nailed to the crucifix and stabbed in my side
Impaled, toothpicks jabbed in my eyes
Niggas cry but the truth is they're glad that I died
Inhale, conversatin' with Satan himself
Starin' in the mirror lately got him hatin' hisself
Inhale, green smoke like it's oxygen
Rise up out the grave, gotta get my props again
I pray for the day that I could say I got revenge
Got a vendetta cuz I been hated by lots of men
My rage, just way too strong to contain
I'm sinkin', but I'm way too strong to complain
I'm cheatin' the reaper every time he come for me
When I die, will you nigga cry, ride, and die for me?
I'm creepin', prepared to take a breath without thinkin'
Of consequences, of starin' in the face of death without blinkin'
The Unforgiven X-Raided, take my name in vain!
Nefarious nigga, feel the need to explain the game
To various niggas that got it twisted up like cornrows
I'm sick of this bitch shit, I'm comin' for you mark hoes

Chorus (X-Raided + Kingpen):

(X-Raided) Niggas I used to fuck with
(Kingpen) Consider Me Dead
(X-Raided) Yeah all you niggas can suck dick
(Kingpen) Consider Me Dead
(X-Raided) All them hoes I used to mack to...
(Kingpen) Consider Me Dead
(X-Raided) BITCH get a rose over the tattoo and...
(Kingpen) Consider Me Dead

(2x)

[X-Raided]
Nigga I can't stop now, came too far to turn back
Flames burnin' in my brain, my heart done turned black
I opened my mouth to speak and I don't recognize my own voice
And when I close my eyes to sleep, dream of wildin' with my homeboys
And wake up, the image lingers
When he throw up the set it make me wanna break up the niggaz fingers
Blow up the set twice a day, fake nigga I respect not
Load up the Tec and spray your life in one day nigga
I detect cops and you look like a bitch
You shook like a nigga that done did somethin' wrong
False form ass nigga
Get on and blast nigga
Did harm to the last nigga speakin' on my name
And I got these East Coast muthafuckas sleepin' on my game
I sleep even though my brain got me ready to seek and destroy
What?  You speakin' on my joy?  You speakin' on my pain
And it's been seekin' out my brain
Through this pen to this paper to this track
To the DAT and in your ears, nigga for years
Yeah....

Chorus

[X-Raided]
When I die don't come visit me at my grave
I'll come up out the casket
Like "Night of the Living Dead" to get that ass bitch
Ride 'til a nigga dead like Killa Tay on Crip
We got to admit you deserve respect but on Crip
You niggas gay Cuz we bloods like Dracula
We'll turn a nigga round me
You weak thugs will have hurtful necks around me
We jump niggas like strangulations
And got a gang of patience when it comes to killin' lames
Layin', waitin' all night for an opportunity to spill your brains
Either you or me, gotta be one, holla at 'em
And I'm comrades with clouds so get decapitated or bombed in crowds
And never capture Raided I mob around
Turn your skin black and blue and orange by the time it's found
Tied and bound and tarred down
Two-faced, many faces better kept
Before we chop you up in suitcases
And disappear without any traces
And we all got game!
Paid with flames, all got game!
Knock y'all brain, Mad Man we all got fangs, bitch!
