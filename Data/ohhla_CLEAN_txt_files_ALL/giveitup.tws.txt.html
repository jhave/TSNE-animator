[Twista]
Now I be, in the club hollerin at hoes like "Hey now"
Sippin Everglo, y'all want me to say now
So on the streets and on the block since Twista +Red Hot+
They give it away, give it away, give it away now (ooh)
She got dreams to have a +Californication+ with me
I could see from how she lookin she couldn't wait to hit me
Come on over here lil' mama so you could babysit me
Bounce that ass in front of me now that's the way to get me
Thinkin about how she suck by the way she part them lips
and let me look at that tongue
Thinkin about how she fuck by the way she part them lips
and let me look at that tongue, get it?

[Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Mami make your money, make your cash
Make like a bongo and pop yo' ass
Pretend I'm Mystikal and +Shake it Fast+
Watch yourself - sticky panty bang rash
Dangerous piss in the dub is grass
Count some money bitch pose and laugh
You know P keep the niggaz on they toes
Let me speed it up for these hoes
Pop pop pop pop, pop pop pop pop
She be beatin like a bongo 'til she look me in my face and just squat uh
Man I know her type I know she gon' rock
She get naked and she stand up on the yacht
And you know she gon' do it until we dock
Kiss the girl {?} baby that's all you got?
I treat that ass like a beat and make it knock
Trust me nigga that's the key to keep 'em locked

[Chorus]

[Twista]
What it mean when she be jukin in them juicy coutures
That girl wanna give it up, watch her
In my crown holder, she in her Republic jeans
That girl wanna give it up, watch her
Lil' ma what's up, I see you in the party
Now you with somebody I can tell how ya movin ya body that I
You wanna fuck, you and I might get a ticket for speedin
while I'm takin you home in that blue Maserati and I
Wanna hit it cause the booty too fat
When I'm around look at how you act
Look how she shake it for me when she do that
Look at how she lookin at me behind dude back (watch her)

[Chorus]

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)</pre>
