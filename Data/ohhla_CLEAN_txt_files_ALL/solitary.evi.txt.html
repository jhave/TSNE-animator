[Verse 1-Evidence]
Have you had a day, where you didn't talk to nobody
Saw no people, heard no evil, probably
Turned your phone off, drove with no destination
No navigation, off-road to outer places
Past the city limits, become an out-of-towner
Not a 9-to-5er, I'm around enough
Born a only child, was never lonely
Straight from the homie, but don't lose touch
There's a place where you'll find alone
I keep ridin' tryin' to find it, but time is low
'Ye told me 'Drive Slow'
I keep my eyes outside, peeled for the next sign to go
There's a time when you'll find your soul
and time to disregard yellow lines on the road
Not sure what's expected, here come the exit
I'll be back, but for now, who knows...
 
[Chorus-Krondon (Evidence)]
I gotta find my mind, so I roam with nowhere to go
(Yeah, I'm on my own)
Quick before my brain explodes, I'm out
(I'll be back, but for now, who knows...)
Stay low, late night, I don't doze
(A different day comes, another one goes)
I ain't searchin' for help, for a hurt empress
I need me and myself
 
[Verse 2-Evidence]
I found a place, I found a phrase, a sentence
Instead of exit, waitin' at the entrance
Stay beneath the surface until earth pushes me back
Turf is territory, I'm watchin' the map
Where I go, who I interact with, though
Effects me, and could lead to a trap
My life, my life, my life, my options outweigh them
Can't get a plane, got thoughts about AM
Say to myself "Use caution, it's mayhem"
Alive on arrival, I'm stayin'
It's called survival, and only strong survive
Melle Mel got live and crime never stop payin'
There's a time when you find your lane
and time to disregard what the people are sayin'
A CA state of mind that I'm in
Off on my own shit in Solitary Confinement
 
[Chorus-Krondon (Evidence)]
I gotta find my mind, so I roam with nowhere to go
(Yeah, I'm on my own)
Quick before my brain explodes, I'm out
(I'll be back, but for now, who knows...)
Stay low, late night, I don't doze
(A different day comes, another one goes)
I ain't searchin' for help, for a hurt empress
I need me and myself
 
[Outro-Sample from Gang Starr's "The Planet"]
"So fuck the bullshit, I'm audi
I'm on a mission, 'cause if I stay I'll go crazy"</pre>
