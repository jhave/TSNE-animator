[Intro]
Mr. Perez.. do you swear to tell the truth?
the whole truth..
and nothin but the truth
so help your God

[Pitbull]
he's back for another one
this time he's back harder, stronger and and and a little more troublesome
double the guns guns
double the fun fun
double the bitches bitches
double the fun fun
we can take it to the north from the bridge to the south to.. DIRTY, DIRTY!
we got them choppers choppers.. in them thirty thirty
you can be a hell of an elephant nigga
you aint gotta be intelligent just to see the rels of a nigga
shot and shit when youre firing click
you aint no thugs or a gangsta, so stop lyin yo bitch
i see, i study tupac like a history lesson, his murder was a mystery that made history breachin but
no matter how much juicy he had when it came to the law he got no poetry justice
but thats the truth dawg..
That what? thats the truth dawg
truth hurts, but but.. but thats the truth dawg!

Verse two
Dont make me flip out turn around and hurt you
I aint the violent type, im a nice guy

imma hungry huslta, made a steak through your ribs

truth hurts, but but.. but thats the truth dawg!
