[Intro]
"This is the place where stars are born" - MC Shan
"And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin" - MC Lyte

[Bekay]
The big city of dreams, feel pity for fiends
Gritty shifty in schemes, pretty shitty it seems
But we walkin on the gold mine, lovin this place
Ace, Babu, Coalmine, up in your face
Along with - introducin Bekay on the mic
I stare right at Flatbush Ave when I'm prayin at night
Some pack gats, leavin other cats blasted
And even the white chicks be rockin fat asses
Always hot, not just when the summer here
Coney Island cyclonin it, or jumpin on the wonder wheel
Fiends on the floor look for crack 'til they knees break
Or Puff could be a dick and make you walk here for cheesecake
Ain't no war, but we rock camouflauge
Ridin bikes, one on the pegs and one up on the handlebars
If you poppin shit y'all kids is just hatin
on the home of Biggie Smalls and the original Nathan's
Go door to door, see we more than sorta raw
And you can cop anything you ever really needed in corner store
Where everybody says they sell crack
And the DT's all dressed up in the old Giants throwbacks
It kinda gets me alive, cause when I'm up in the hood
Half them dudes yo they think I'ma cop (BE-KAY!)
Embrace it as heaven, stars is born
in this place, where Masta Ace is a legend
Anywhere else ain't breakin me fam
Cause I grew up in Brooklyn, these streets yo, they made me a man
What'chu poppin? Your crew lame (IS BROOKLYN IN THE HOUSE~!?)
You know we are son, the top of the food chain

[Chorus 2X: scratched]
"This is the place where stars are born"
("Go Brooklyn")  "You know the place!" - Lyte
"This is the place where stars are born"
"And all of those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talkin"

[Masta Ace]
I'm from the B-R-double-O-K, L-Y-N
If I wasn't, then why would I yell I am?
You see, this be the home of Spike Lee
Folks think it's dangerous - I don't know it might be slightly
But that depends on which blocks you be steppin down
Cause certain neighborhoods they never put they weapon down
I lived in Flatbush, grew up in Brownsville
And every now and then you see me around Steele
I used to hang a lot in Bushwick, Decatur and Evergreen
Some of the best parties you ever seen
I lived in Clinton Hills, on Myrtle Ave, near Fort Greene
I screwed up my face hard and walked mean
I spent a lot of time in East Medina, where the police are meaner
And I wish the streets was cleaner
Cause it's crime every where, it ain't fair, but who care?
Not the Governor and not the new Mayor
I guess we forced to live this kind of life
If you ask me, Brooklyn be the best place to find a wife
If you want a chick to hold you down, and have your back
Brooklyn be the ideal habitat
Cause she ain't havin that, let's hit the par where we gather at
Form a cipher, and spit a battle rap
You wanna come through you need a referral
It's M.A. and Bekay in the song about my borough, c'mon

[Chorus]</pre>
