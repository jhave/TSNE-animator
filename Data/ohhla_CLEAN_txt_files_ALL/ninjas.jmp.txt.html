[Jumpsteady]
We got many Psychopathic ninjas on this track
Chopping off wigs like a fly guillotine attack
Jumpsteady your shocker rocking the blue blockers
A Bruce Lee one inch punch heartstopper
You're messing with my own I'll turn you to stone
Give you busy tones floating under tanker stones
Thats full circle three full of justice motherfucker
Got you silly like a tar tapping trucker (like a tar tapping trucker)

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
You see it's all explanatory motherfucker tell a friend
Got a glock that busts harder than a drill team sargent
Never been a pig so it's nice to be respected
The talking is injected by the venom of my weapon
The deadliest disease when I strike the inner core
Ain't no time to tell your mama that you love her anymore
Ain't no calling on your homies ain't no calling on the lord
Somebody should have told you about fucking with a corpse

[Violent J]
It's Violent J y'all and I'm out of control
Steady sniping off a California highway patrol
Rocking a chemical imbalance in a stolen school bus
Full of screaming little kids we doing ninety plus
Running cops off edges rat a tat tatta
Busting shots swirving and throwing kids at them
Jumpsteady in a chopper and away we get
Watching everybody else falling over the cliff


[Jamie Madrox]
It's the triple x baller
I'm in love with your mama but your daddy be player hating so I don't call her
I'm a ghost see my ninja level foe
Call me storm shadow hatchet when I'm slicing at your dome
Mr. Bones.. Madrox..who you tripping on
My appetite is planetary when I'm screaming Unicorn (Unicorrrrn)
Show me who we bumping on show me who we smoking with
Handle like some lunatics and get into some killer shit

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
S-H-A double G Y
Why? cause I runs with a hat-chet guy
Let me go ahead and check my watch (for what)
So I can see how much time you got (ahhh)
Before the hatchet that I run with swings doowwwn, and splits your face
I understand why everybody wants to be down with me (why)
I'm rolling with Jumpsteady (rolling with jumpsteady)

[Anybody Killa]
Psychopathic we crazy then a motherfucker
ABK in this bitch undercover
No pads no cuffs no jail
Watch us beat you in the head with my forty until you tell
Detroit hatchet family on the scene
Juggalo deputy bitch you know what I mean
Taking over the world with no means to quit
We so underground hatchet swingin usual shit

[Legz Diamond]
Next time lets get it wrecked
Making hair stand up on the back of your neck
I'm coming for you haters for the bitch that you are
You can run you can hide but you won't get far
Got bullets for you bitch running your mouth
I hear you talking that shit you'll get your fucking brains blown out
The game is deep the sixth is high and so am I
I dont live and let live I take an eye for an eye

[Chorus: Syn]
Psychopathic ninjas on a killing spree
Creeping in the shadows of eternity
Psychopathic ninjas you will never see
As the phantom plane becomes your reality

[Monoxide Child]
This ain't no two hand touch so get your helmet out
Or you might just get planted on your neighbor's front lawn
We some gravediggers with the shovels and boots
We on some wicked shit hiding in tunnels and under stoops
I'm on a whole different level leave you and the devil
In the dust with a sign saying heaven or bust
I'm not your priest or your reverand
But ive been known to bless a mic
that'll make you swear to god you've been living sin

[Jumpsteady]
For a locus I'm a hundred torn deaths from above
To O.J Simpson I'm a fingerless glove
For a pilot I'm a ghani with a beard and a trench coat
Chilling first class steady sipping on a coke
To a parent or a cop I'm a game of Morton's list
For a crab I'm an illusive deadly confisc
At your birthday I'm Jeff Dahmer baking a cake
As you ponder why your best friend is three hours late

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I stay concealed like I hid it in my back where it's at
I'm the sniper on the roof busting shots with my gat
The subway scatters with bullets flying through the air
Cause I leap off the roof thirty feet without a care
Just to break off my leg and shit (why)
Get up and beat a motherfucking pig with it
Cause cops ain't shit they get they're motherfucking throat cut
Wrapped in bloody sheets and tossed up in my trunk (tossed up in my trunk)

[Violent J]
Oh Bruce brother nerds sipping gasoline slurpees
Rocking a rare breed of suit and these herpes
Raised in a jungle communicating with snakes
I'll squeeze your throat piece off till it breaks
Like a boa constricter a pressure inflicter
Lotus pod pro tools with a bitch shifter
We'll always be underground not just at first
I ain't trying to play myself the fuck out like Fred Durst

[Jamie Madrox]
Fat kids stay big and funky like marshmallows
And stomp holes in your fucking mary's like the goodfellas
Not in it for the cheddar, or even for the hoes
But I love the juggalettes like peach Faygo
Newports and a blunt of funk
And a half a cup of syrup when it's time to get drunk
Nightclub in my trunk with my disco balls
And my hatchet in the air screaming FUCK Y'ALL

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm the urban legend in your backseat
With a hook to your head when you're rolling down the streets
Most people they look at me and run
Like they up in the club and I pulled out a gun
You know your bed (yeah) thats me under it
Pull the covers under your head I'm a smother it
Then it's back off into the moonlit sky
THROW YOUR HATCHETS HIGH (throw your hatchets high)

[Anybody Killa]
What you know juggalos wanna do
We know you see is a gang of painted faces coming through
You wondering you gonna hide
You gonna try and see you that you won just to stay alive
It don't work bitch don't even try it
Peeling holes in your chest from the gun that I fired
Come correct or don't come at all
It'd be a shame to see a bunch of motherfuckers fall

[Legz Diamond]
I'm giving props to my homies on the southwest side
Coming from the family till the day that we die
Clown love to the street team slanging them tapes
Shout out to double A and the ?????
Peace to the dogs running on the eastside
My street teams runnning motherfuckers up worldwide
My juggalos we one big click it's the chaos theory come on get with it

[Chorus: Syn]
Psychopathic ninjas on a killing spree
Creeping in the shadows of eternity
Psychopathic ninjas you will never see
As the phantom plane becomes your reality

YEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!</pre>
