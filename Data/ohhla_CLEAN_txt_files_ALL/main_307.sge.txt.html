[Chorus] [x4]
"Then one day it all dawned on me yo 
I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team
Easier said than done" - Mobb Deep on "Peer Pressure"

[Verse One]
Waste away
Sad to see you go the way that you do
Today through with yesterday's truths
You know better for the forward actions
As for your past friends, all were lost in a holocaust
Of thoughts in a backwards caption
Unlucrative talents 
That used to give balance 
When you had to live with two abusive parents
Waste away 
Create expenses for yourself
I know you're sensitive for the negative effects ever felt
Day to day
Jammed in between your weekly pay checks
Remember when you were free?
I seen you at your apex
Don't tell me you're in a better place just cause the rent is higher
Spent fuel on retirement?
You don't know where the fire went?
Waste, the future is charcoal
Everything you make is reduced to a bar code
Everyone mistakes, payin' dues is a lost road
Going place to place faking moves when your car's towed
Going gold with a fool's heart
I'd rather be a fool with a heart of gold
Lose my breaks and save my truth till tomorrow
Remember when I'd hate if my beautiful scar showed?
Then one day it all dawned on me yo

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
The lowest common denominators let the arts suffer
The only heart you follow is road kill on your car bumper
You're Archie Bunker caught in slumber
I hope you burn to death 
With the trends that are hot this summer
You need to hold the breath you're talking under
Until you're close to death 
And no one's left in the pop culture you cocksucker
Freedom to choose between margarine and butter
The choice should be between fingernail clippers and lock cutters
A little something for the sweet tooth of chocolate lovers
Besides candy rappers reproducing 2Pac covers
Biggie Small wonders
Makin' milk from robotic utters
The whole motherfucking pop cultures are smothered
Back in the day
NWA made cops shudder
And 808's replaced rock drummers
Turn them into job hunters
Foundation crop dusters
You were chillin' now you sound faker than Raekwon's stutter
Your whole essence is a stocking stuffer
On Christmas Day 
I'll open your presents with a box cutter
Give away secrets to the keys of life
While I strike these chords 
I'm ignored while I counter-points Bill O'Rielly tries to score
Wipe the floor with your psyche some more
And fight the war with Michael Moore in a Nike store
Battling the general consensus of shit
As petty as it is 
Das EFX rocked that band aid ten years before Nelly did!

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I don't wanna be famous like the artists on your play list
The more emotion I put into it the harder they diss
Actors with scripts thinking they ought to repent
I'd rather be rich and have a whole lot of resent
It's the pitiful public I get from rush
While I'm busting dope lines I'm misquoted
And you might think I wrote it
For all you know it's all for the dough
I fought off a forty O
And bought the clothes that were affordable
A Scorpio with the stinger sticking into singers and tawdry holes
Your chorus flows with an awful show of raw audio
They call me slow to adapt, I said FUCK THAT!
