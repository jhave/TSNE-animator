Song:   Never
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
Never, never never

No

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
No no no never

Momma said never be a quitter
Never since I was young
Never been in my roots
Dont let never make you a bum
Never my only so she said
Never beggin for crumbs

If never found out your slippin
Then never might be a gun

Never think suicide
Never steal
Never lie
Never run up to a gun
Fight and think you gone survive

Never that lil 6 nuts
6 is for the flies
Never become a snitch
If you would rather be a quiet

Never know em
Never met met em
Never seen that fella
Never never never

When they put you in that room
Thats what you tell em
Hell never to the law

Never I'm a be a star
Never catch me up to mar

Never worry
Never bury
Tears on your teen jersey

Keep it 42 be worthy
Never go without the curry

Never the greatest of all time
You in a hurry
Never its too early
Never have no mercy
Never

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
Never never never

No

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
No no no never

Never cross a man as far as you can throw em
Never put ya fate at home
Boy y'all know em
Never get in the herd
Never get into church

Never cook in your life
Buried 6 feet under dirt
Never hate
Never envy others
Cause they getting cake
Never grind
Never hustle
Never see your dinner plate
Never be fake
Never be a snake
Never play that shit dog

Till they bring that pepper spray
Never be scared
Never hurt your head
Never cause if they was killers you would already be dead

Never pout
Never ever have doubt
Never that be the reason
You still sleep on mommas couch

Never brag
Never be stingy with cash
Never get in for business
Mind your own
Take em now

Never cry wolf
Never daddy ma boo

Never less than a survivor
Never

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
Never never never

No

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
No no no never

Dont be slick
Never silent
Dont be bricks
Never
Get your wig split
Never rob your click
Never
Never miss your blesses
Never start second guessin
Never get to heaven never cause you missed the lesson

Never bite the hand that feed
Never live in greed
Never succeed
Never doin dirty deeds
Never chunk

Never give up on your hope
Under pressure dream big
When its rough make a toast

Never sell your sole
Never for some dough
Never diamonds
Never pearls
When you die
Never go

Never back down
Never let your hat down
Never see no bully
Let them know your background

Never cross the line
Never cross your kind
Everyday let it be
Never worry
Never toss your mind

Never lose sleep
Never cause you got beat
Never know peace
Never when you in these streets

Never
Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
Never never never

No

Never give up
Never hold you head down
Never fear no man
Never trust anybody
Never say you cant
No no no never

Never never never</pre>
