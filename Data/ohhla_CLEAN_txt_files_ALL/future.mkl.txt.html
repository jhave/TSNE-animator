[Jamel a/k/a Assassin]
Yo, yo, Wu-Tang Clan, still fatter
Off the datas, for, my father gonna get home by now
And Uncle Justice, we gotta hurry up

[Shamel a/k/a Dragon Breath]
Yo, I block the bronze, the Kid Golden Arms
I tear by shorty, with the Iron Palm of Dragon Breath
Burn through your body, you see about
A head Gotti, for Balardi, for Malatti, I'm scratchin' the table
Scratchin' the trashboard, lost laws
Of Dragon Breath, is like an Iron fire

[Jamel a/k/a Assassin]
Be in subzero, my ice power go like a river
My nigga Tero, I'm all set, with my ice power
Niggaz don't mess with me, I'm the Assassin
AS to a S, AS, IN, you can't mess with me
My praying mantis is deadly, my praying mantis is poisonous
It goes through your bloodstream

Everybody go through they bloodstream
My praying mantis is deadly, you end up in a hospital
You better shut up, before I put one
In your praying mantis, man</pre>
