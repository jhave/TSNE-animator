(Daz)
Motherfuckers know that it's on tonight
we came in here to fuck it up with a shoot out or fight
Niggas don't understand that it's on tonight
hap hap hap it's on tonight.. Young Gotti!

(Kurupt)
Take preparation (preparation) meditation (meditation)
Convalescent solo solo psycho store storm and store propane
to roll the game rearrange change rain or snow
but for real explain the exceptional view
With the exception of an exceptional feud I view
Impose the arsonists to burn a bunch, extreme kerosene
Helium dioxide aquanated oxide acquitted lop side

(Chorus)
Baby this is it fuck da world
I'ma be the first nigga to fuck da world
Converse apparel inspired by..
Fly out the barrel five out the barrel

(Kurupt)
Just take position ammunition, convalescent Converse
Where we at first is where we at last, where we last cash
One last toke will make your smoke ride high
I'ma give everything like pushing the button
Now how does it feel when you die for nothing?
Metropolis crumble, apocalypse mo' lines surround and dine
Let loose in at least a Nam, calculate keep time
Finish the World War I've been a star
The knock quiminitar(?), strange and restrain
Retired and rewired, melodically molecules
Strategy and logic enables our positions then points us missiles
All sided equal... deeper than pistols
For instance... unknown the science of forensics
Get your backpacked like ten sticks
Hit like ten sticks hit with the effect of tense ticks inglow(?) sticks

(Chorus 2x)
(Kurupt) Baby this is it

(Daz)
It's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight..
Boop boop hap hap, nigga it's on tonight
We came in here to fuck it up with a shootout or fight

(Kurupt)
Nigga you want war? Yeah right, I'm mic sky like stiletto
Holocaust to high school, roscoe to Vasco
Impossible lives the hospitalized
franchise strip niggas is broke for ranches mansions avalanches
Alarms ring cause harm in court
like platinum and gold
I've sold a whole, explosions hit explode implode
Popped out bodies dropped off on Rider's road
I've seen and foreseen the unseen
and able hardly able to separate the myths from fables
I'ma buy a Baltic while you purchase fireplaces
Poisonous supply and occupy in space
The midnight I could hide the dark until the spark
Light up the night nothing everything in sight
I'ma cross the finish line with both legs broken
Flow coke broken both toke smokin' (wha?)
Daz dilly machine dean two shottie
The life of a party is a live scene
Gastra.. neo kung-fu niastra
Monsoons swarm en route like harpoons
Young black Sinatra analytical ANTRA
a million percent proof bound to found the youth
uncrude uncoil bubble and boil turmoil
Don't specialize and ill crack your bones
Now fuck with that (automatic cardiac attack)
Forced to front in your chest back, (?)no raptor arab(?)
Kuruption! Yeah that's me!
New word to the dome, cyclone stallone
stainless steel momomamamarron(?)
get done cloned and choke in stone

(Chorus:2x)

(Daz)
Yeah and thats how we doin this shit
Daz Dilli, Fredwreck, Kurupt the Kingpin Young Gotti
Servin y'all suckers to one inch
Yeah fuck that oohhh!
Straight to the dome nigga phill smoke some sit back
For all the real thugs out there
Meditate penetrate on these suckers
Yeah nigga it's on tonight, fuck da world
fuck da world.. hap hap hap hap hap yeah!
(voice sings in background)
(old man's voice)
I said end of the world ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!</pre>
