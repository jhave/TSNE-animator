Album:  Fourth Dimensional Rocketships Going Up
Song:   The Ride of Your Life
Typed by: jimbotwain@comcast.net

Enter in to the spacecraft filling up
That won't touch back again 'til the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
It's a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light

And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up it's the ride of your life

Riffin in the octave of the
Infinite provactive
Come get within a rocketship
Dimensions of a positive
Inventions that is monstrous
I'm givin it my all
It's just my sentiments
Took over and as I give in
To the power of just livin
In the now, I put the div-idends
I holler from the spirit
Within all of us
I'm driftin on a cloud up in
You're meant to feel the shower
Follow in, as I devour
Y'all with synonyms and vowels
Ladies and gentlemen
It's our time to dig within a tower
Over ignorance, the final hour's
Here so come and crowd around
And listen up on how I'm stayin driven
By the sound I feel it liftin
Higher how my daily livin
Is the style it's like my children
Seem scattered through the villages
And towns, and when the Gift
Is in the house
I bring the lyrics
That come down from up
Inherent to the sound
From a mysterious, profound
Very indigenous way out
Chief innervision, and
I think I've really truly found religion now

Enter in to the spacecraft filling up
That won't touch back again 'til the job is done
Way outta the range of normal
So far where ya are that ya no longer see the sun
It's a journey not of sight but sound
Ready or not your bound
To also embrace the light

And drift on
Let your soul be again reborn
For these songs buckle up it's the ride of your life
