Yeah, I pump it up and I don't quit for jack
I'm back to rap on wax so guess who's back
The chart hitter, not a quitter or a bullshitter
These cats know I'm the best one out the litter
Yeah, they talk, but they be talking diarrhea
Cause none of em got the capability to be a-
Nother Mikey D cause I ain't having it, kid
You can do what I do, yo how the fuck you biddin?
I've been through wars and I came out untouched
I'm too much, whenever the microphone is in my clutch
I get props, I get stopped by the cops
That's how it is hops, when my tape's in a box
I've been through crews like a ho
And took em out, I always let niggas know
I keep the soul cause I'm a lyrical pro
I play it mellow, word em up, I'm on the down low

	Know what I'm saying, shit is real, G, I'm on the down low
	Gotta represent in '94, I'm on the down low
	K-Cut and Sir Scratch, LTD, shit, we on the down low
	Coming up with motherfucking platinum shit
	You know what I'm saying?

You know with Mikey D's freestyles is rougher than a rapper with practice
I'm fantastic, true meaning of what bad is
15 years on the scene, could never fall back
A small pack, you're fucking right, I think I'm all that
You know a nigga with a doubt?
You can bring him to my session and watch me take him out
He'll RIP when I rip him and I stick him
In a bodybag then I'm gonna zip him
I'll throw him in the ocean, and watch him sink
Cause he shouldn't waste ink on them rhymes wasting time
Cause them rhymes stink
Mikey D's reanimated and these other rappers hate it
I got skills, they can't fade it
I keep the soul cause I'm a lyrical pro
I play it mellow, word, I'm on the down low

   Twin Towers in the house, on the down low
   Word up, Shaqueen in the motherfucker, she on the down low
   Different Shades of Black in the motherfucking house, on the down low
   Word up, everybody out here is on the down low
   Know what I'm saying, my man Monte, laurington nigga, he's on the down 
low
   MC Lotto, Bomb Squad, all the motherfuckers I know, they on the down low
   Rick motherfucking C-O, Red, Mark Miller, they on the down low
   Boom bashing in '94, know what I'm saying
   Everybody in this motherfucker's on the down low
   We on the down low
   Sir Scratch, he's on the down low
   K-Cut, on the down low
   LT is on the down low</pre>
