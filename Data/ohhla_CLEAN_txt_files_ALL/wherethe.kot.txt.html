Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[D-LOC]
you know the king klick, yeah we got the bomb weed
we got the southern kali shit that make ya eyes bleed
daddy x, d-loc and that boy Johnny richter
bdub, big pak, lou, munchyz the heavy hitter

[Chorus]
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
It's in my backpack , but you can't touch that
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
I need to take a rip , quick, tell me where the weed's at
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
you know I'm holding, always knowing where the weed's at
so where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
somebody's gotta know where the muthafuckin weed's at

[Verse 1 - Daddy X]
It's on this time, in my prime blowin hella smoke
I got the mountain side growing going out for broke
we got them hillside's saturated Koast II Koast
I got a sack in my sock, an ounce in my coat
I got a fat bud in the case of my guitar
I got the flavour of the month chillin in the jar
I got that Whitehouse buying president
I got that Nassau spaceship THC
I got some weed in my garage and under my bathroom sink
ounce in my X-Box living room by my TV
I got a nug on my desk and in my dresser drawer
and when I'm running low my hidden stash is in the floor
furthermore I got some backup underneath the stairs
and the eighth I got stashed in my underwear
wrapped in my sweaty balls , that's why I'm flying high
you wanna take a lick, trick , taste it good life...

[Chorus]
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
It's in my backpack , but you can't touch that
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
I need to take a rip , quick, tell me where the weed's at
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
you know I'm holding, always knowing where the weed's at
so where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
somebody's gotta know where the muthafuckin weed's at

[Verse 2 - Richter]

wanna know where the weeds at? well I'll give u a hint.
just follow the scent rising outta my tent.
Imp flowing outta the vents into a Lincoln cont.
or my dropped Cadillac bc I done did it again.
I'm back to ballin to win, don't let me hold it all in
I only need five breaths but fucking calling it 10
getting control of those ends, blowing smoke like the wind
I'm back to Rollin in my bus, don't even let me begin
cause when I'm in it , I'm in, when I'm out it, I'm out
these cats are loopy bout prints they got a problem no Doute,
I call it fifty fin and my lair's my house,
I got one rule there it's don't show up unannounced
gotta call before you roll through, get the all cool
I might be like wait up , yo I'll call you
cause no one knows what Johnny Richter's got chronic
but when it's cracking, we be the toughest motherfuckers that's cracking
but anyway...

where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
It's in my backpack , but you can't touch that
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
I need to take a rip , quick, tell me where the weed's at
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
you know I'm holding, always knowing where the weed's at
so where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
somebody's gotta know where the muthafuckin weed's at

[Verse 3 - D-LOC]

I got the bomb weed, you know I'm blowin hella tokes
I got the good shit that leave you laid up on the floor
I got the crip nugs, i got the big sacks
I got the type of bud that kick you in your fuckin ass
I got the type of weed that make you wanna bug out
without a doubt the type of shit that get you drug out
we getting super high, we gettin super ripped
we puttin it down for all the weed smokin klicks
so where's the weed at ?, i need to roll a blunt
put that shit back , fill it up, don't front, lick it up , stick it, burn it
smoke it to the butt, finish that shit and roll another one up. So...

[Chorus]
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
It's in my backpack , but you can't touch that
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
I need to take a rip , quick, tell me where the weed's at
where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
you know I'm holding, always knowing where the weed's at
so where's the weed at?, yo, where's the weed at?
somebody's gotta know where the muthafuckin weed's at</pre>
