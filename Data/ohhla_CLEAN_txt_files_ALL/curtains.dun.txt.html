[Killer Mike]
DF, get it right nigga, Uh huh, Uh huh

Kill the drama
Its similar to a
Take beef to any hood
Break beats on nigga's momma
You niggaz gutter
But I'm foul vicious and slummer
Spit on your boss, ride his main bitch and his runner
Outkast found a monster
Heartless head hunter
Spit crack in the winter
Flow heroin all summer
The peace treaty's over, the war is all force
Appetite for destruction, dinner is your corpse

[Brother James]
Man I know it's so sad
Watching this game switch like fags
Gotsta deal with it, so we spit it to let the world feel it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but homes
You can miss me with that talk
Yappin' don't make it happen
By the way I fought
Handle loc, that's being responsible
Know that a man needs money in order to feel comfortable
So ya'll can, stop all that frontin'
Your crew is not saying somethin'
I told you we was coming

{Chorus}
It's that down and dirtaaaay
2nd generation
Dungeon familaaay
2nd generation
dirty dirtaaay
2nd generation

[Chamdom]
Abra-Kazam
Abra-Kazoo
Out of the blue
Gobble the crew
Put me in the booth
Magical proof
Never not know what G Rock might do
Better know this
Georgia G Rock like killa
We go off the track like some nomical lyrical aviators
Now haterz wanna fool with them skeetaz
You'll never defeat us
So why try meet us
So bust at the at the streets
I pull up in a light green ???
You know a sepina try to block me
Carrying your torches and hitting that hooch
Bouncing in booths and poppin that cooch
Now hoot, cuz they saw some of G Rock
Copy cats trying to copy our style
So trouble when they see us
Acting like four fake cowards
Boy you ain't Chamdom

[C-Bone]
Four speakers I stay on
Big things from the green zone
From the big lake to the small flip
Aquemini, don't fuck with
I been rich, so why switch
Dungeon family 2 click
Country ain't no bullshit
The whole world, nigga we rule this
Believe that

{Chorus}

[Concrete]
Niggaz better use they brains
They trying to get wise
My skill is sharp as fuck nigga
Don't make pull out my knives
Cuz they gone cut they fuckin' shirt and and Ima hang you to dry
I want this whole cake nigga
Fuck a piece of the pie
Always speakin about the truth
I never had to lie
We gonna torch a nigga
Tie him up and cover his eyes
What happened next?
Who knows
It's a surprise
The suspense will kill a verse before he opens his eyes

[Boulevard International]
??? como ????
Yo tengo ????
Jump out a shed ????
So ???? left scared
????
No te gusta ???
Hay mi no importa
Don't give a damn where you from
Take your heart before somebody ???
???????????
And we all slum
Esta la muerte ????

{Chorus}

[Nathaniel]
I'm super weight affiliate
Hang with nothing but kings and G'z
I'm a triple beam Georgia
Slinging them c's and ki's
Can't stop me
Aquemini plus dungeon family
A lot them spots and pop them glocks
You understand me?
I spit this for my thugs and cuz that doing state time
Cant break or take mine
I rewind, my shit grinds
I lace tracks like ru's
Chase stacks and put it down for CPK ooooh!

[Slimm Cutta Calhoun]
Aquemini Calhoun!
Young slimmy bust a benny with dat shimmy
Gimme, you control da strip with jack and trimmy
Scoop a cola from big kenny
Headed out to Adamvilley
Blowing dro, gulping Remi
Don't low my tote, get plenty
Hot hoes get with me
My foes get near me
Hear me clearly
Know the dilly really silly
We ain't playing, leave them lame
We ain't talking, we just ran nigga
Drop him where he standing
And spit like glock nines and cannons
When I snap shots at random
Creep, creep up like the phantom
Top down, we'll handle em'
When my attitude is mental
That means Ima fuck you up
With DF duece bumpin out the trunk, what what
With DF duece bumpin out the trunk, what what

{Chorus}</pre>
