{Badself!}

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Hey pretty lady, what's your name and number?
Whenever I see you, my heart's like thunder
I'd like to know you better, and that's no lie
Just give me a chance and let me try
You're an angel from heaven, a blessing in disguise
Time stood still when I saw your eyes
Let me show you the things I one day felt
So go on!!  {Badself!}

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
You got a body that's stickin'; some men die for less
You got a face of a queen in a beauty contest
You're a lady in the 80s, never wild or crazy
Just takin' your time, not having any babies
Not depending on others to get what you need
A modern-day woman with the will to succeed
Tryin' harder every day to increase your wealth,
So go on!  {Badself!}

Verse 3
[Marquis] All the girls don't like her because she's independent
          They're so envious because she's not with it
          She's a real lady; her mind's on other things
          She can't be bought with gold or diamond rings!
[Kid Ice] She's the one I want to be in my life
          The lady I need to be my wife
          Never in a crowd, she keeps to herself
          So go on!  {Badself!}</pre>
