[Kanye West]
Yo whassup this is Kanye-to-the
Y'know good music is in the building
The Roc is in the building
I just called, called to shoutout my dawg Game
Chillin in the streets right now
That "Dreams" joint is crazy
We gotta get, get started on our next joint my nigga
Holla

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream...
(Was it all a dream?) {*2X*}
(Was it all a dream?) Dream (dream) dream (dream) dream
(Was it all a dream?) (Jay-Z: "It was all a dream") {*3X*}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack - Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match
(Jay-Z: "It was all a dream") Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far 
Now I'm in the {dream} cause I rhyme {dream}
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's {dream}

[The Game]
Aaliyah had a {dream} Left Eye had a {dream}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
And if you don't know, now you know
It was all a dream (Jay-Z: "It was all a dream") {*4X*}
