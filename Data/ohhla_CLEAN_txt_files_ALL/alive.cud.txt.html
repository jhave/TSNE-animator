[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah
And everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah

[KiD CuDi]
I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm in myself I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide nothing's right
My skin is burning when my rock begins to speak
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move
I smell her scent and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah
And everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah

[KiD CuDi]
I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl and I'm hoping to find some light
You call it Heaven, I can do it for the same
Ain't nothing wrong I bin feasting on something brave
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, uh
I hope she can find a man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah
And everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah

[KiD CuDi]
Nananananananana, whoooa
Nanananananana
Nananananananana, whoooa
Nanananananana

[KiD CuDi]
I watch the sun collapse
And took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf
Go where I wanna
Let the moon shine be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away the light never left me, uh
I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light
Rather that than the evil
Feelin in a of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
You're fate will be whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
We'll fight no more, I let these things just be, be, be, be

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
Everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah
And everytime, the moon shines I become alive, yeah

[KiD CuDi]
Nananananananana, whoooa
Nanananananana
Nananananananana, whoooa
Nanananananana</pre>
