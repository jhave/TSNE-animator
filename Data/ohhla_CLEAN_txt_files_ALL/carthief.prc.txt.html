[Sean Price]
Yeah I'll do it
Uhh, one two y'all, you don't stop
Cause I got rhymes so fresh and rhymes so hard
Rhymes that you never even heard before
Now if you say you heard a rhyme, we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night, P!

Yo, I'm Sean Price, and you not
Big bullets with big guns from bigshots {*scratched*}
I'm Sean Price, and you not
Big bullets with big guns from bigshots {*scratched*}
I'm Sean Price, and you not
Big bullets with big guns from bigshots {*scratched*}
Just a b-boy with breakbeats and a big box
I sling ball your Slingblades, don't get chopped
Yeah, rap suckers whack and lackluster
No shine, you no rhyme, get back buster
Pah please, y'all niggaz is car thieves
{*chopped and scratched beyond recognition*}
Y'all bummed out to the 5th degree
I'm gunned out, squeeze the 5th and breeze (P!)
Yeah, stop stuntin, I know that you puss
Same nigga four years ago that voted for Bush
Roll up the kush, crack a bottle, smack a model
Cocky, Rocky, ask Apollo
Got my mind on my money nigga that's the motto
If Sean Price Mike Tyson you was Cus D'Amato, let's go

Cause I got rhymes so fresh and rhymes so raw
Rhymes that you never even heard before
So if you say you heard a rhyme, we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night, P!

{*laughing*} Yeah, P!
Kimbo nigga
I want my bread nigga
That's how I get my bread
All day dog, all day
