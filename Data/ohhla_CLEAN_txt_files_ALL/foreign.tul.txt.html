Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Foreigner, what you come around here for?
Foreigner, don't come knocking on my door
You don't come around here blocking all the sun
Don't bring your winter here, we don't need one

Foreigner, I know you wanna make me cry
Foreigner, who ya foolin'? You ain't sure
I'm sure I can't imagine what you thinking of
When I land on my heart and destroy my love

Bad guy, bad guy, you're so addicting
Bad guy, bad guy, I'm so conflicting
Bad guys, I can't to tell them though
My heart says leave but my body never close

Rocking big, we just rocking big
Rocking me, you just rocking me
Love how you take what you want and what you need
Rocking me, you just rocking me

Come my my but tell the big arraign
Coming home tonight
I'm wrapped up in this guerilla outfit
And there's no need to fight, foreigner!

Foreigner, why you gotta be so rough?
Foreigner, why you gotta act so tough?
Bust that mitt that got my hostage jugular
It's no negotiation, no, you won't keep me up

Foreigner, your demands are crazy
Foreigner, no one is gonna save me
Dropping your bombs on me, what's the reason?
Come break my heart baby, charge me for treason

Bad guy, bad guy, you're so addicting
Bad guy, bad guy, I'm so conflicting
Bad guys, I can't to tell them though
My heart says leave but my body never close

Rocking me, you keep rocking me
You keep rocking me, you keep rocking me
Love how you take what you want and what you need
You keep rocking me, you keep rocking me

Come my my but tell the big arraign
Coming home tonight
I'm wrapped up in this guerilla outfit
And there's no need to fight, foreigner!

Oh baby, I can't get away
I am your slave
Forever

But baby, I can't get away
I am your slave
Forever

Sleeping with the enemy
