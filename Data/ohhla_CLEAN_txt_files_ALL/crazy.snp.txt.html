"Black folks can't never have no fun!"

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
These streets beeeee walkin down the avenue
(Crazy!) From Hollywood to South Central!
These streets beeeee.. crazy!
Long Beach to Comptoooon!
Always up to no good! Craaaaaaaa
(Crazy!) Crazy..
Always up to no good!
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
(Crazy!)

[Snoop Dogg]
Have a look outside and take a stroll with me
California lifestyle, you wanna roll with me?
I can take you in and out and where it's gonna be
Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong of me
I'ma stay down, you see me on them corners G
At your local liquor store, gettin some optimums
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real no.. the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
and when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know...

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
On the 110 Freeway flo', back to the block
In the seven deuce Coupe, hoppin hippin the hop
Sippin on some Henn with my nephew Infrared
Young pimp on the grind tryna line up some head
Had fun, did, done, on the West we run
Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooohhh-la-la
Fuck the law we don't get caught we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin the cops
You niggaz out there just be makin it hot
But don't trip if you fakin a lot
I'll break you, shake you, and take yo' spot
{*singing*} Because if you think that you gon' slip through California
without gettin banged on.. brother you're wrong

[Break: Nate Dogg]
(Always up to no good!) I really love my dog, grew up together and all but he
(Always up to no good!) Hell yeah I love New York
that's why I married the broad but she
(Always up to no good!) We can't hang 'em up 'cause I'm a balla y'all and he
(Always up to no good!) Let me tell you about these streeeets
(Always up to no good!)

[Chorus] w/ the phrase "Always up to no good!" at the beginning of each line</pre>
