[Verse 1]
I'm gangsta steppin
Representin my block
Jokes be the name
702 comin through yo hood
Putting hollow slugs all up in your brain
All up in yo gang
I'm givin a fuck
I be the one thats gunnin for fun
Sin City gang with a ??
You can hang with the Sin City gang
Fuck no
I'm ridin dirty
With the heat in my hand
Stay bumpin when I'm swervin
All days to the curbin
Wonderin why the bottle keeps turnin
I'm creepin and callin your homies 
Up on it and you callin for help
But nobodys there
Now I'mt he suspect of a bloodbath
And I left him dead cuz nobody cares
Joke doggy dogg bringin heat everywhere that I go
Cuz a gangsta like me will bust back
And a bulletproof vest on my chest in case anybody blast
Fuck that I'm ridin
Wearin all black wit a hard hat hangin low over my eyes
And the briefcase right by my side
9-milla glock and a chrome .45 and I know
That all of my murderers 
Heard of this gangsta crackin necks
Runnin all night with a jet black 9
In a g-ride killin up your whole set
Givin a damn with a strap in my hand
Unloadin on every punto that I can
Fuckin up playas in Las Vegas
And erasin these hataz is the masterplan bitch

[Chorus]
So know whatchu gon' do 
When we hit them sticks
And hit your block 
Like some maniac ridaz
So sick and do shit to you Ripley's wouldn't believe
We got some other sick tricks
Hidden up our sleeves
So just pass the liquor
Pass the weed
Pass us the PCP
And you gon' see
How we pull straps out of our hat and bust caps
And make you bitch ass niggaz take foreverlong naps

[Verse 2]
I twist 'em up like a tornado
Turned tasmanian
Crack a cranium
Devlish like that evil motherfucker Damian
Cuttin loose
I'm startin funk like Fox
Doom juice with doom roots
I'm rippin fruit loops apart
I'm infested with the doom
Infected with the plague
Got a bitch to lick my wounds
My enemies is dead
Pay attention, then I rinse down with siccmade niggaz
That'll kill a bitchmade nigga
Twist 'em like a french braid nigga
Jump on the place
I'm meetin Osama Bin Laden
You betta jump on your cellular phone
And call your mama
Cuz aint nobody gon' make it home
It's all drama
As I parachute out that motherfucker
I yell geroni-MO
But you don't hear me though
At 30,000 feet up in the air it's impossible
See I'm that nigga
That'll land in a bitches yard
Dick hard enough to cut through
A pack of glass and in barge
And get my fuck on
Up in her crib
I don't need her permission
Cuz I aint gonna let her live
I stay sick with it
And come equipped with it
After I finish with that bitch they know Eklypse did it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm fresh out the county jail
Just graduated from an anger management program
I like to punish niggaz
Slow your roll like a traffic jam
It's that nigga with a frown turned upside down
I keep it rough nigga style
I walk the walk 
I talk the talk
It aint that punk David Banner
It's the motherfuckin hawk
Chokin bitch niggaz out
But I keep it gangsta with the sawed-off
Your body hard off
Your motherfuckin face be tore off
Gotta keep it gangsta
Because we dog bitch niggaz
Got itchy fingers
Along with triggas that'll scratch em
And load 'em up unload 'em 
And let bitch niggaz have it
Ghetto savage
My claws 3 loaded automatics
That'll rip your ass like Wolverine
When I'm on that OE and Listerine
A grousome scene
Send him home and get shot in the neck
Have your bitch ass smokin a stick
Just to deal with his death
Now 1 plus 1 equal 2
Thats what I assume
And many bitch niggaz hang with other bitch niggaz
I got him now I'm comin after you
I put it in and do him
So hop your bitch ass in this effect
Make no mistake
Yeah nigga you dead
I take his soul across the foggy lake
No escape
Bing the chalk
And the yellow tape
It's just another flat-footed cop
Closin a bloody murder case
I aint playin no games
And I aint speakin in riddles
But you niggaz is sweet and colorful
Like a bag of skittles
All about my skrilla and bits
Always pack pistols
It's kinda mystical
And thug niggaz appear like ninjas
Off my gangsta whistle
Apocolyptic season if the sickness
You must forget
I reveal the strongest weakness
When I hit yo block and leave you wicked
Some niggaz call me a demon
Cuz I see the future livin grousome
Creep up on a snake ass nigga like an eagle
Sin City Dark angel</pre>
