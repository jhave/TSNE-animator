Song:   On My Way
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm on my way
And I'm movin' top speed
Ain't no lookin' back
so don't even wave to me
I'm goin' for a time to chase what I believe
In other words I'm following my dreams
So many set they mind to do the same
Even if it seems a little strange
(They still do it)
Take my advice, that there's more in life to gain
If you just willin' to fight through the pain
(and keep kickin'!)

[Chorus]
Can't nobody change me
Or what I believe
So I'm here to make it and
need to go out and achieve
Outdone by no one
New life's test run
Thought my time was up
But the journey had just begun

Can't nobody change me
Or what I believe
So I'm here to make it and
need to go out and achieve
Outdone by God's Son
New life's test run
Thought my time was up
But the journey had just begun

This life we live
the struggles we face
the path we're on
The moves we make
At any time can all be replaced
Like a memory in your head just being erased
So I'll move on
just to keep the lead
And make sure that
nobody gets in front of me
(look out)
It's like I can't stop now
The power that I feel
when I'm hearin' the crowd
(Juggalo!)
It's just so addicting
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
the love that you get
with no sight of friction
(FAMILY! FAMILY FAMILY FAMILY...)
will keep you moving
til you're all worn out
That's the type of feelin'
that I'm talkin' about!

[Chorus]

I got the secret and it changed my mentality
Now I'm pushing all my energy into the galaxy
Like a Jager Bomb, gives you personality
I'm on my way, so don't try to come after me
(get out my way!)
Advertise every time they criticize
Instead of looking deep into what's real in our eyes
So, realize..
Some look at us as a joke
and get upset 'cause they got choked
when they tried to provoke

[Chorus x2]</pre>
