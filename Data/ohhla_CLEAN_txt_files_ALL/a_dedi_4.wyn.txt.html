[Andre Benjamin]
It's just my interpretation, of the situation

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, and this is my dedication
What's poppin? +Dedication 4+ hoe
And this is dedicated, first off
To my city (a dedication)
The lost city of New Orleans
But um, I wanna speak to my city
And I wanna let them know that
We can't be lost for long
And we damn sure can't be lost forever
So it's time to find ourselves
within all that water
Within all that dirt, within all that blood
Within all that pain, within all them cries
It's time to find ourselves
New Orleans, because
Memories are everything
When I say memories are everything, I mean
It's important what you are remembered by
And trust me
I, you, we don't wanna be remembered as the lost city
Rather be remembered as the city that found glory after all that tragedy
Strength, yeah~!
Also I built a skate park down there to get them kids off the streets
You're welcome!! But ummmmm

Fuck it! Rise above it, yeah
So, lotta people ask me, what'chu gon' do for yo' city

And I do my best, trust me
And that's what the fuck I do for my city, yeah
