What Is A Juggalo?

[Violent J]
What is a juggalo?
Let me think for a second
Oh, he gets butt-naked
And then he walks through the streets
Winking at the freaks
With a two-liter stuck in his butt-cheeks

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What is a juggalo?
He just don't care
He might try to put a weave 
In his nut hair
Cuz he could give a fuck less
What a bitch thinks
He tell her that her butt stinks
And all that

[Violent J]                               
What is a juggalo?
He drinks like a fish
And then he starts huggin people
Like a drunk bitch
Next thing, he's pickin fights
With his best friends
Then he starts with the huggin again
Fuck!

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What is a juggalo?
A fucking lunatic
Somebody with a rope tied to his dick
Then he jumps out a ten-story window
Oh!

[Chorus (2x)]
What is a juggalo? 
A juggalo
That's what it is
Well, fuck, if I know
What is a juggalo?
I don't know
But I'm down with the clown
And I'm down for life, yo

Southwest? (we juggalos)
Down river? (we juggalos)
Jefferson? (we juggalos)
Fuckin everybody (we juggalos)
I'm that juggalugga locoroni
Get the fuck up 
Get the fuck the out of here

[Violent J]
What is a juggalo?
A dead body
Well, he ain't really dead, but he ain't like
Anybody that you've ever met before
He'll eat monopoly and shit out connect four

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What is a jug..?
What the fuck? Connect four?
Man that shit is whack
Don't worry about my shit
Just rap motherfucker

What is a juggalo?
He ain't a bitchboy
He'll walk through the hills
And beat down a rich boy
Walks right in the house
When you're having supper
And dip his nuts in your soup, gloop!

[Violent J]
What is a juggalo?
Well, he ain't a phoney
He'll walk up and bust a nut in your macaroni
And watch you sit there
And finish up the last bit
Cuz your a stupid ass dump fuckin idiot

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
What is a juggalo?
He's a graduate
He graduated from....well
At least, he got a job
He's not a dump puts
He works for himself scratching his nuts

[Violent J]
What is a juggalo?
A Hulkamaniac
He powerbombs motherfuckers into thumbtacks
People like him till
They find out he's unstable
He Sabu'd your momma through a coffee table

[Chorus (1x)]

I'm that juggalugga locoroni
Get the fuck up 
Get the fuck the out of here
I'm that juggalugga locoroni
I figured you wouldn't understand

[Chorus (2x)]
                              
Detroit? (we juggalos)
Cleveland? (we juggalos)
St. Louis? (we juggalos)
Everybody? (we juggalos) (3x)
Fuckin everybody? (we juggalos)
Everybody? (we juggalos)
What is a juggalo?
