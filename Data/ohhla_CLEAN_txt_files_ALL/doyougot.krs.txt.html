[KRS-One]
Turn it up now, it's yo' time (ha!)
Thanks for yo' nickel and yo' dime (ha!)
The Kris-Style will blow yo' mind (ha!)
Let's get it started, RIGHT ON TIME (ha!)
The elements, I represent all nine (ha!)
I do the written or the freeflow rhyme (ha!)
These rappers nowadays they be so blind (ha!)
You lookin for the skill but you won't find (ha!)
Real live skills I show mine (ha!)
Whack rappers I'll pay them no mind (ha!)
Improvement, they showin no sign (ha!)
DJ's, I hang with the dope kind (ha!)
All you cats, know meeeee (ha!)
I'm not ashamed of who I beeee (ha!)
I teach about G.O.Deeeee (ha!)
It's YOU that's frontin, not meeee (ha!)
I keeps it bumpin in the C-L-U-B
Eleven albums, what are you tellin me?
I am B-L-E-S-S-E-D
You are C-U-R-S-E-D
I don't need radio +OR+ TV
All I wanna do is recite my poetry
You hear somebody preachin, YEAH you know it's me
You hear the t'cha speakin and yo, you gotta see
