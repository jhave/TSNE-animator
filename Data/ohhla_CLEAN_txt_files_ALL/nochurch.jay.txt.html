[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human being to the mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer, who don't believe in, anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright alright, no church in the wild

[Jay-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollin in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hidin from police
... Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
... Drug dealer chic
I'm wonderin if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek
All for Plato, screech
I'm out chere ballin, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus]

[The-Dream]
I live by you... desire
I stand by you... walk through the fire
Your loooooooooooove, is my scripture
Let me innnnnnnnnnnnn, through your encryption
Yeah~! Yeahhhhhh

[Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without tellin me
... Sunglasses and Advil
... Last night was mad real
... Sun comin up 5 AM
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkin 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbin the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love Is Cursed By Monogamy"
That's somethin that the pastor don't preach
It's somethin that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money we can't keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
