Aiyyo Prince Paul, is this a Gas Face lyrical remix?

[Prince Paul]
Yes indeed Serch
And it goes a little umm-ah, somethin like this..

Verse One: Pete Nice

Gas, past tense, made facially
3rd Bass'll express, KMD
Three blind mice on sight
Zev Lover, gave it the first light
So I revise on remix
Swing super unleaded on my gas dick
Kicks em in the grill, for non-believers
I leave em speechless, backstab deceivers
Sub Roc cut Serch with the clipper
I change oil, I unzip my zipper
A riff of Aretha, a face of saliva
Don't gas the 3rd, the 3rd is liver
And try your luck, but your ass got waxed
so all negative vibes got axed
I beg to differ, I cleanse my system
Another victim, the Gas Face I give em

"Oh shit.. oh shit.. oh shit.. oh shit.."

(MC Serch)

Verse Two: MC Serch

Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black
Musta been the same guy who set up the ??
(Make the Gas Face!)  For those souped up supremicsts
Can't forget about the cocaine chemist
that made crack a household name
Silence for Yusef Hawkins being slain
Lamebrains, who can't accept us equal
Black and white, wrong or right we're all people
Trying for better days, to let our kids see some
Tenement Square, people fightin for freedom
Beijing students fought armies with guns and knives
At Kent State, they took four lives
Nelson Mandela's not free
cause he can't even vote in his own country
One day these problems will scatter
Can't you see the Gas Face is no laughing matter?
"Oh shit!"

[MC Serch]
There it is for ninety-one ninety-two ninety-three

[Prince Paul]
Yo whassup whassup whassup

[MC Serch]
Yo Prince Paul who we givin the Gas Face too now G?

[Prince Paul]
Yo we givin the Gas Face to, Jerome Williker, of the Bronx

*laughter*

[MC Serch]
Ye-yeah!  Hey yo no Gas Face for Chantelle
No Gas Face for the Brooklyn-Queens
Connecticut Long Island New Jersey Strong Island posse
None of them get the Gas Face

[Prince Paul]
Cause we love everyone! {*laughter*}
Stupid man, y'all sick ("oh shit!")

[MC Serch]
Yeah we sick but we out too, peace</pre>
