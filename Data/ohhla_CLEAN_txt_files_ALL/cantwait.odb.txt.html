How many celebrities from the ghetto?
(Dirty your crazy, I'm crazy about your music
Dirty your crazy, you're a nutcase you're a fucking nutcase)

(Chorus)

A to the Pox doing Night Fever
Cancer, herpes, mumps, seizures
Diabetes, TV if your against me
You die easier!
Cops don't have a show whatsoever
Ain't no more doctors, ministers
Nurses can't give us searches
There won't be electric, won't be churches
Cause your body go against you
Whether it's a lie or whether it's true
You can't use violent mentalities anymore
It ain't lambskin
You can't use the word napkin
Nigga ya sleeping

(Chorus)(x3)
Hold on Hold on Hold on
HAHAHAHAH

I'm diplomatic playing pen and pad
Ratatat you're a scaredy-cat
Cause I have a tat put you up like that
You can't stand that, cause you gotta scat
You couldn't even move
Don't know how to groove
BITCH TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES
Take up the brew
Motherfucker you knew!
Fucking with the doo
Dirt Dog don't make any room
