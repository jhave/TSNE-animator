Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on the dance floor burnin' up
Music turn it up
Baby I'm
Real hot so is it my turn to touch you
Look like you're buzzin on Ex with 3D effects
Baby you
Look like you have no clue of what comes next
Me and my dogs will be there
Tell your girls prepare to share
We'll play the dancing truth or dare
If someone's standing there, stare say
Hey baby what's your name
Don't stand looking insane
Do you want to ride the train, welcome to the fast lane
If you're in love beware
'Cause these people they don't care
All hands in the air
This is what we call truth or dare

Kelis:
I am the one with the brightest hair, leather I don't care
Baby I
Don't ever want to take the shirt off
That's my dare
You got a girl but you touching on me like you don't care, baby you
Do you
But just don't get caught out there

Me and my girls will be there
Tell your boys prepare to share
We'll play the dancing truth or dare
If someone's standing there, stare say
Hey baby what's your name
Don't stand looking insane
Do you want to ride the train, welcome to the fast lane
If you're in love beware
'Cause these people they don't care
All hands in the air
This is what we call truth or dare

4x
Come on Come on
Baby shake it up

Rap verse:
Man, I got ten surrounding me
Hounding me
Center of attention
A riot it's bound to be
Though I'm in the middle
My jewels you're bound to see
In a pool of women
All of them drowning me
I'm ho hoppin', flip floppin', ho hoppin'
Now her head in my lap boppin'
I ain't one to care
I ain't used to fair
Baby you can keep the truth, chose the dare

2X
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Me and my dogs will be there tell your girls prepare to share
Me and my girls will be there tell your boys prepare to share
We'll play the dancing truth or dare
If someone's standing there, stare say
Hey baby what's your name
Don't stand looking insane
Do you want to ride the train, welcome to the fast lane
If you're in love beware
'Cause these people they don't care
All hands in the air
This is what we call truth or dare

4x
Come on Come on
Baby shake it up

4x
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</pre>
