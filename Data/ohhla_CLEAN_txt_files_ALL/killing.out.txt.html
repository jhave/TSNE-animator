(Intro) Crypt
Yeah, AOTP, ok, King Mag, Vinnie P, whadup nigga?

[Crypt the Warchild]
Yeah, the real is back cocksucker, this is 08
A lot of people show love, people sho' hate
A lot of niggas fall back but I won't wait
This doe will be made, I motivate to those states
We build destroy only just to keep building
We kill the noise only just to reach millions
Time to step my game up, change myself
I neva point the finger I blame myself
I make this music for me, refuse to sleep
He who works hard, he usually eat
We two but we deep, we grew some more beat
We Q to the D, we glued to the streets
Who's who when he speak? That dude is a key
He who barks loud, he usually sweet
Maneuver the beat, paralyze the bassline 
Dismantled kick snare and I neva take time
Laid on the line even if it takes mine
Laid on your mind even if it takes nine
Shots to your melon, Cerebellum on the Stateline
Spit 20/20 Primetime like its Dateline

(Chorus I) Planetary
Everything is real in this field we walking
We talking, we start this, no comp nigga
We lock shit down
And this shit gon' burn
All day you in the way, Paz it's your time

[Vinnie Paz]
This is ignorance at its finest
I'm most high like Dalai Lamas
I cock back the four/fifth put you in pajamas
I don't think that I even needed my fist to stop it
My word bond it's similar to a Prince's promise
I shoot 3 at you three times like Clinton Thomas
Fuck around wit Pazi and get you hit wit llamas
I ain't even really trying to go war wit you
I'm just gon' let you know that I'ma let the four hit you
Put you in the Tabernacle let the Lord hit you
Send you to the blue Mosque let Allah get you
Break your jaw wipe the mothafucking floor wit you
Break your jaw wipe the mothafucking floor wit you
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrtttt...
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrtttt...
Brrrtt...

(Planetary talking)
That's why they hate you nigga
Stop that, let's do it

(Chorus II) Planetary (Crypt)
Everything is real in this field we walking
We talking, we start this, no comp nigga
We lock shit down
And this shit gon' burn
(All day you in the way, Plan it's your time)

[Planetary]
I drink wine out the holy Tabernacle, its shackles
Throwing that ludicrous shookeries, that Judas statue
Planetary get at you wit Warchild at the chapel
It's rotten like Adam's apple that infested the battle
I ejected poisonous outta my brain to tame
Evil thoughts that arose as we toast to fame
As we say a prayer for the fallen labels
As we eat the Last Supper off Angie's table
Breaking bread wit the Army
Sound of the streets called me
Satan's messenger tried to harm me
But he ain't stronger then me, NOPE!!
Mag I'm just like Moses
I call the rules of the game as I walk in the ocean
This is what we like to call poetry in motion
Catch us overseas wit the crowd wide open
It's the New Testament Heaven sent so bow down
Kiss the ring of the Lord, man our time is now

(Chorus III) Planetary
Everything is real in this field we walking
We talking, we start this, no comp nigga
We lock shit down
And this shit gon' burn
All day you in the way, Mag it's your time

[King Magnetic]
The jig will cause a drip in your throat like you blew Hov
You only see the burners when they use like a new stove
I'm too old for new roads, too cold to warm up to new hoes
Do shows for two O's and two buck
The two bucks will do something, too much
Move up, move out, you bruise up, shootout or shoot up
At odds wit my new luck, I'm nos when I'm souped up
In arms wit a toothbrush, if God couldn't rule us
Then God doing too much, I'm one in a million
Meaning five thousand others is wanted for killing
Outta five billion I'm the one or the runner up
Twelve bars you almost on my dick like my gun is stuck</pre>
