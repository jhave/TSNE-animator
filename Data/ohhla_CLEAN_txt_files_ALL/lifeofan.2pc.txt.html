[Intro/Chorus - sung]
In the life we live as thugs
Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin wit my gun in hand

[2Pac]
Why explain the game? Niggaz ain't listenin
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space
Have these bitch niggaz snitchin
Where are we now? Guns found daily, the feds surely hope
that they could finally nail me for sellin dope
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap
Attack, words bein known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition flashin my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggaz knew me, truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice - got a death wish, bitch!
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam
It seems niggaz ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin you back, explode the track to confetti
Unload it, cause niggaz ain't ready - the life of an outlaw!

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Code three, attack formation, pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin to get you
Merciless madman screamin kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire, makin all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin fiends, scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives, come closer, exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggaz ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws - never surrender
Death is for a son to stay free; I'm thugged out
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels, can you picture me? Life of an outlaw

[Chorus]

[Outlawz]
City under siege, it's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves, G deep from the street
Plenty beef, I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb Deep, this nigga from behind tryin to creep
No haps wit no straps, jack, it's on to bounce back
I house a rap so fat, they snatch my style off dap
Come to grip with hollow tips that get'cha
Snip wit clip or get the picture
I wrote my life down like a scripture

But still I'm lost, in the land, of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy, matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin solely for themselves, too hot struggle in hell
Somebody need it, ou know we lost hope and we needin it
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalous
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit, six months in advaced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it

Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin
Attach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin
Creepin deep into morning, peepin out the weak
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for itself
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind
Findin it funny, matter of fact, cause it is
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw

[2Pac + Napoleon]
Eh, Napoleon
What's up nigga
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ah yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out

Well now they all say they roaches and parasites
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night
Drink 'til we fist fight
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathin for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase the hand, hide yo' stash, beware of them marks
Aiyyo Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly
And let me bust back to them niggaz till they all sweaty

[Chorus] - 4X with ad libs</pre>
