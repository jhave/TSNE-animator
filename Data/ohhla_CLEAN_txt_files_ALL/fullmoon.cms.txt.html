Intro:
Freak freak y'all
And you don't, don't stop
Keep on y'all
And you don't, don't stop
(repeat 4 times)

Follow me like one time
Everybody love me like they do the sunshine
Niggas just got off work
Time to unwind
Strobelight smokin thick (??? ???)
Got my mind made up
All night i'ma stay up and fuck a lot
But nah, I ain't a playa
Girl I'll house you
You in my hut 
Thinkin of a rhyme trying to hold my nut
Armand on the cut Com Sense MC
Baby put that ass in the air where I can see
Feel free feel good
You ain't in the club trying to find a real love
I spill dubs on Heiny's and tequila shots
Where studs and chicks pee in the same spot
It's hot as hell
Freakshow on the dance floor Is that you I smell?
I'ma give that ass room
Better yet, let's fuck in the bathroom
If we have room it's a full moon.

Chorus:
It's a full moon out tonight
Party people here just feel alright
The place is packed and the mood is right
Now have a good time y'all
A good time y'all
I know y'all niggas ain't come here to fight
Ain't nothin but love so don't be uptight
Black Latin Asian and White
(repeat)

There's some hoes in this house
It's thick like them hoes from the south
Toothpick froze in my mouth
Y'all chicks don't know what I'm about
I did "Retropsect For Life"
They think I got a wife
But I got style to mine
So I dog 'em like Phife or Snoop.
Already boned 3 out the group with my crew I rock steady like the park
I hear foot steps in the dark
From them househeads
Dancin in the circle in the house like  curfew
To work you to the bone
Old school cuts get me in a zone
In the line I get restless
I'm straight I'm on the guestlist
The red light specialist
Love is the message
From B-Boy to raver expressions
I get open like the bar at the rap sessions
Diggin in the crate with Armand
The phenomenon
Com think faster than a Muslim doing Ramadan
I'm a wand 
in otherwords I'm wildin'
It's a full moon and peoples is howlin

Chorus
(repeat 2 times)

Chicago rock the house and
New York rock the house and
DC rock the house and
London rock the house and
Australia rock the house and
Europe You gotta rock the house and
Party People rock the house and
Japan rock the house and
New York rock the house and
Chicago rock the house and
Atlanta rock the house and
Detroit rock the house and
Cali rock the house and
Texas rock the house and
Alabama rock the house and
Black man rock the house and
Go on</pre>
