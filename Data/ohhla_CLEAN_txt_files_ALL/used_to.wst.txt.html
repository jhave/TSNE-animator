Baby, It's me... Maybe I bore you
No, No it's my fault cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby Puffy, Jay Z
Could all be better for you
Cause all I could do was love you

Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah, uh, uh)

Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are the cause
All I could do was love you

Baby when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I'd twist through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla Holla Holla (yeaaahh)
Holla holla holla (yeah, yeah)

Oh! I used to (wheeen I used to)
Love you (used to... Love you)
Oh! But I don't (baby no not any more... I don't love you)
Love you (noooo, used to ... love you)
Oh! I used to
used to love you

You're gonna miss me now...</pre>
