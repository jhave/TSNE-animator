[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
Real niggaz bust ya pistols in the sky
I'm a muthafuckin' G and til I die
I get that paper, and I'm chillin' on the low
All I need, is more money more

[Hook: Lil' Flip]
Cuz, I gotta get paid, I gotta stay paid
I gotta get paid, I gotta get this money
I gotta get paid, I gotta stay paid
I gotta get paid, I gotta get this money, man

[Lil' Flip]
I get that paper for shizzle, I'm breakin' bread with my niggaz
I ride around with them triggas, I clap back nigga
I shoot that uzi like hoops, I ride around in them Coupe's
Got alligator on boots, my pockets fat nigga
We overseas with the Wu, we blowin' trees with our crew
All my clothes brand new, you gotta love it man
I'm on top of my game, rocks on top of my chain
Catchin' planes to Spain, nigga, you know I'm thuggin', man
We pushin' whips you can't buy, 24 hours we high
I believe I can fly, I'm fucked up, dog
I smoke that shit you can't get, we spit that shit you can't spit
Fifteen tracks, no skits, so fuck all y'all

[Chorus]

[Raekwon]
Shorties bouncin', forty ounces, Lex gon' kill up all the bouncers
Round my shit, gon' fall up out you
Raw that nigga, bring horror up out you
Thought about you, blow that forty and call the cops too
I'ma be out by four and route you
Pussy ass nigga, bring horror up out you, valor the couch, too
I'm amazin', when they pass the gauge in
Sky blue Phantom with beige in
Stop changin' it, ride it for a month
Then come up, make my change in it
Not done, the best, to get it, Uncle, let's get it
What's really real if Lex can't get it?
Shaolin whip big techs again
Fuck around and caught me a Mexican bitch

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
I blow your face off, cake off, then buy an acre, stayed off
My mustache like Adolf, don't let me pull my cape off
It's Superman lover, fuck it, no other
We just a group of bad brothers, y'all pussy, now check it
Rap DeNiro, crazy Shapiro, pushin' through customs
Back from Europe, and we changin' our Euro's for money
The Wallabees gummy, with so much paper I'm dead
Call me a cheese dummy, and we dip our leaves in honey
Awwwww, you wanna see the hammer?
Awwwww, you wanna hit the canvas?
I will not waste my time on frontin' ass
Niggaz, that do not excease

[Chorus]
