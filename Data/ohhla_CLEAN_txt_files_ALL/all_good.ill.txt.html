[Illa J]
Relax your mind {*3X*}
Close your eyes
It's Yancey Boys...

Doo-doo, doo-doo {*4X*}

Set your mind free, let your mind free
That's the past, don't remind me
This the present, and that's the future
No (negative energy) I will mute ya
Only positive energies surround me
Only, open minds around me
Only, free spirits around me
I let my vision guide me
And, I let the rhythm find me
I don't panic I just work it out
Plan A, let's do it
We got shit to do, let's get to it
It's all good, that's what Dilla said~!
Get your shine on, get that bread
You know what you need, doo-doo {*2X*}
Doo-doo, doo-doo
You know what you need, doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo... doo

By the way, this is for those with a purpose
This is for souls with a purpose
And souls that make music with a purpose
I'm tryin to bring the underground to the surface
I'm tryin to get that Rolls Royce with the curtains
Anyway, peace out y'all, I'm closin the curtains
Closin the curtains
It's Illa J, I'm closin the curtains
Jay Dee... Yancey Boys... peace</pre>
