[INTRO: Cool V]
Uh
As we take you Uptown
Downtown
We got a little somethin for the ladies
Biz, break it down

[Verse 1: Biz Markie]
Once again it's Mr. Diabolical
Who have you pullin your hair out by the follicle
My posse's so deep, it could fill a bus
But this is for the dimes lookin good to us
Like Carmen, Sandra, Lavern and Veronica
Camille and Gina, Danielle and Monica
Sherley, Vanessa, Betty and Wanda
To Julie, Rhonda, Gill and Yolanda
(Who else?)
Lauryn and China, Penny and Shelley
Leslie, Rachel, Tamika and Kelly
And to that girl I met when I was in Texas
Got a name like a god - Alexis
Joanne and Nancy, Yvette and Yvonne
Debra, Dinah, Daisy and Dawn
Arlene, Sabrina and there's more if I can
Oh yeah - Beth, Bunny, Annette and Dianne

[Chorus: Biz Markie (&amp; Cool V)]
Hello ladies
(What's up, what's up)
What is your name
What's your name and your number, girl
(Smooth it out, Biz)

And Kim, I found your number, it was under the table

Sarah and Terry, you're all dimes in America

[Chorus: Biz Markie (&amp; Cool V)]
(Say what)
Hello ladies

[Biz Markie]
If you don't know what a dime is
It means that you're a 10, baby, you know what I'm sayin
On a scale from 1 to 10, you know what I'm sayin baby, yeah
This goes out to all the beautiful ladies out there
Whether you're skinny, fat
No hair, long hair, it don't matter
Peace

[Cool V]
Yeah
And that's from Cool V and the B-i-z
We're doin this strictly for the ladies this time
Word up

We got you on the remix
So just step to us, give us your name, your number
I ain't gon' say it, baby
Haha
