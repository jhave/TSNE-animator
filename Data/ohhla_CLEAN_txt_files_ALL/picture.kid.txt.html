Living my life in a slow hell
Different girl every night at the hotel
I ain't seen the sunshine in three damn days
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey
Wish I had a good girl to miss me
Oh I wonder if I'll ever change my ways

(Hook)2x
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you 
While I'm lying next to her
I put your picture away
Sat down and cried today
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to her

[SHERYL CROW]
I called you last night in the hotel
Everyone knows but they won't tell
But their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right
I've been waiting on you for a long time
Filling up on heartaches and cheap wine
I ain't heard from you in three damn nights

(Hook)2x
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been 
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him
I put your picture away
I wonder where you've been
I can't look at you while I'm lying next to him

I saw you yesterday with an old friend

(Kid Rock)
It was the same old same how have you been

(Both)
Since you've been gone my world's been dark and grey

(Kid Rock)
You reminded me of brighter days

(Sheryl)
I hoped you were coming home to stay
I was headed to church

(Kid Rock)
I was off to drink you away

(Both)
I thought about you for a long time
Can't seem to get you off my mind
I can't understand why we're living life this way

I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you to come back home
I found your picture today
I swear I'll change my ways
I just called to say I want you 
To come back home
I just called to say I love you 
Come back home</pre>
