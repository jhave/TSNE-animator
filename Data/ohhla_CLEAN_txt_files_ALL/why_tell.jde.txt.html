[Intro]
Yo this one's for all my ladies
That been thru a similiar situation like this
It don't matter what color you is, how old you are
Where you from, what you've done
All chicks been thru somethin' like this
Listen

[Verse 1 - Ms Jade]
If I had that thing on me woulda shot you right then
If I had that thing on me I woulda popped you right then
Nigga, yeah you played me and said you was down for me
And If I ever had beef you had the full pound for me
Fuck your trucks, fuck your niggas, fuck your bitches and shit
Im thru wit you, yet I'm still gonna handle my shit
Financially there when I needed you but so the fuck what
You stopped callin', came thru wit that bitch in your truck
Bet you expected me to cry nigga, I smoked fly nigga
And I'ma be striaght from now til I die nigga
Fuck you and everthing you stand for
I shoulda knownn not to never fall in love wit a whore
Fooled youself, like I wouldn't ever get it together wit out you
Listen up wasted skin I'm much better without you

[Chorus - Lil' Mo]
Niggas you toyed wit my teenage years and my womanhood
I hate you, hope I make it understood, Good bye
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all

[Verse 2 - Ms Jade]
Took me to the spot that you like to gamble at
Had my boys in the spot that you liked to gamble at
Luckily you was may day, walkin' around like it's ok
Big man in the streets, huh, yeah ok
Lead me on, told me I was gonna be your wife
Nice cars, big house, living a beautiful life
Yeah it's true I stopped fuckin' wit u plenty of times
But I change plans wit my girls for you many a times
Stepped back and thought about the dumb shit you put me thru
Broke alota niggas heart's cuz I was fuckin' wit you
Honestly I'm kinda glad that I learned from my mistakes, nigga
Be a better person, fly bitch, get this cake nigga
You gonna see I was the best you had
You say you love me and you sorry, well that's too bad

[Chorus - Lil' Mo]
Niggas you toyed wit my teenage years and my womanhood
I hate you, hope I make it understood, Good bye
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasnt at all,all, all

[Verse 3]
Nigga if you see me in the street, I don't want you to speak
And if I ever have a show. I don't want you to go
It' ain't no comin' back to you cuz, I'm hatin' you now
And usally when I hate a nigga then I'm layin' em down
I can't seem to understand why I fell for you
Pushed keys overseas, went to jail for you
When you got knock, I came through wit the bell for you
You had beef, I was there bustin' shells for you
I risked my life, shit I did a fuckin' ? for you
If I ain't miscarry woulda had a kid for you
I shoulda robbed all that fuckin' coke I hid for you
You gonna play me after everything I did for you
I'm pissed off I know you here the fuckin' anger in my voice
Stay around, blow town, you make the choice
But if your here when I come back
I'm still on your ass
I'm mad as shit, I'd probably wind up killin' your ass

[Chorus - Lil' Mo]
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all
What you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all

[Outro]
Yo I just wanna thank the guys
The guys who, who made us feel like this
Made us understand how strong we are as women
Yeah, I know my ladies understand what I'm sayin'
Yeah y'all know what you gonna do
Take it on the ?

[Chorus - Lil' Mo]
Why you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it [yeah come on bounce back]
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all,all, all
What you tell me that you love me, why you tell me that you care for me
When you didn't do it
Why you thought that you was there for me
When you wasn't at all, all, all</pre>
