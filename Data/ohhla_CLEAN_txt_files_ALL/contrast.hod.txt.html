Taj man this beat crazy nigga!
Now if you feelin Vibe Beats put your hands up
If you feelin O.F. put your hands up
If you got somethin in your cup and your blowin somethin up
Put your hands in the sky, throw your hands up
Now all my mamis in the club
that's poppin and movin y'all thang (y'all thang)
I said shake it to the beat, shake it shake it to the beat
but please don't thrash y'all frame
I said all my mamis in the club
that's poppin and movin y'all thang (y'all thang)
I said shake it to the beat, shake it shake it to the beat
but please don't thrash your frame - hit me~!

[Karma]
Welcome to the time space continuum
I'm the Wiz Kid, spittin pure intelligence
Mass murderer, with a swag that's elegant
Toot my own trunk if I could, they call me elephant
Snuffalupagus, Sesame Street
It's the Kar-toon with my boy (Hodgy Beats)
Puttin on wax somethin from another realm
The type of shit to stick to your skull like stylin gel
In detail, we crack like seashells
with a record that need sales
We group bars like prison cells, top climbers you fell
Oh well! Game over
You get sent back like an e-mail, fake over
It's time fo' the takeover
Outer beam science from NASA solar
Carbonated tastes like a cup of soda
Rambo ammo bandana soldier
Grasp the mask a token of smokers
We should let this bitch breathe like Nasir to Hova
Definition mack, he givin niggaz the cold shoulder
Bullet shells in the speaker, the mic on the holster
Momma always told me to brag like I'm 'sposed to
I'm the Wiz Kid, the icon on the poster
Motherfucker! ... Vibe with me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You, can't, stop, that
music that we makin holmes
Niggaz they be fakin holmes
Bitches we be takin home

[Hodgy Beats]
If I was a city she'd put me on
She'd fuck a HypeBeast no crook T on
The Obama kush is the mush we on
Captain number seven, cereal Lucky Charms
I must be wrong cause I'm runnin with a scandal
Gettin my cake, you can blow out all the candles
Rob you for fit if you lookin like D'Angelo
Move forward like, Lamar Odom, I can't go
I'm a superhero minus the cape
Bring it back to the 80's, listen to my tape
I +Bathe+ in my sales like a fuckin +Ape+
Hold a burner if a nigga trip I'm gon cremate
Fuck the he say/she say
What she say is he play and we spray
Cause I like to spray it, I'm a motherfuckin..
I ain't gotta say it, I'ma just replay it
Henny on the rocks, blunt chase it
Drink the whole bottle I face it
Everything's slow like The Matrix
A whole week inhalin, I'm on day six
I took five nigga, I'm 'bout to +Take 6+
Cause I'm in my zone
Yeah, yeah, yeah I'm in my zone
Yup! I'm in my zone
Nigga leave me alone, I'm in my zone
One day, I'm ridin chrome
I'ma be ridin chrome
Nigga leave me alone
Why? Cause I'm in my zone
I just like to slow it down y'know, ha ha
Came here with the motherfuckin Wiz Kid
Hodgy the motherfuckin Beast, motherfucker

[Chorus]

[Outro]
See now all my mamis in the club
that's poppin and doin y'all thang (y'all thang)
I said shake it to the beat, shake it shake it to the beat
but please don't thrash y'all frame
And now all my mamis in the club
that's poppin and movin y'all thang (y'all thang)
We said shake it to the beat, shake it shake it to the beat
... but don't thrash yo' frame (yo' fresh)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)</pre>
