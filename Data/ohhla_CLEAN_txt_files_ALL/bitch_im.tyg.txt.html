[Verse 1]
Bitches all in my car, they want to run with the star
Got all these niggas mad, pop the trunk flash a face off
Nigga you ain't met T-Raw, hit the bass so hard
Got bitches taken it off, I can't fuck wit she too tall
Got a bitch dat play ball, found the pussy I charge
Make that ass applaud, i don't cuff it like the law
I fly a bitch to milan, she don't know what I'm on
I play the game so crazy, she thinking this shit soft

[Chorus 2]
Reel em in, wheel em in, like bana white in wheel a fortune
Why you all up in her face, man she thinking that shit torture
I I win again win again cuz nigga I stay scorching
I'm the man man on fire kill the style like abortion

[Chorus]
Cuz bitch I'm the shit
Bi-Bitch I'm the shit
Bi-Bitch I'm the shit
I ain't worried bout shit
Bi-Bitch I'm the shit
Bi-Bitch I'm the shit
I'm on my own shit
