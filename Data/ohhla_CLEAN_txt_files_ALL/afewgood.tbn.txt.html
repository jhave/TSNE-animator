[Intro: Mack 10]
Ha, Talk about the best of both worlds
Yeah, The king of the conscious rap
Me, The king of the streets
Ha ha, You know who it be
I don't need no introduction
Hey bone, Check this out
Get it how you live, Homeboy

[Verse 1: T-Bone]
Yo, Strap up the boots, I'm ready to shoot, Load the ammo
Bone soprano wit glocks in a green camos
I play rappers like the grand piano
General to call shots like I'm Joe Bonano
What, The west is back
Cept this dude ain't black
He latino dawg, And he rock gringos
Black, Indians, Palestinians, And phillipinos
And I cash money like vegas casinos
I'm armed and ready, Palms are sweaty
Kinda like em, Cept I got a sharp machete
And I'm quick to toss wack rappers off of levees
Words is heavy, Kinda like a old school chevy
Oh, Hip hop will never be the same
It's time to change, I'm bout to rearrange the game
Ready to fight back, So when they say who's that
Tell 'em it's just the king of the conscious rap
Oh

[Chorus 2X: T-Bone and Mack 10]
See, All we need is just a few good men
Cause ain't too many left like bone and mack 10
We know nobody's perfect, So repent for ya sins
So ya betta get it straight cause he's comin again
[He's watchin]

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I got the hood on smash, Homie
Although I'm ballin full throttle, I'll never run outta gas, Homie
I'm so fly as the days go by, I'm better
So I dump, Re-up, And keep gettin mo cheddar
You know what it do, Mack 10 a savage
Got hustle in my veins, So I fiend for the cabbage
Fresh balla till the end, Tell a friend and a neighbor
Ain't that I got so much flavor, It's that I got so much favor
I'm like pac, My mic styles against all odds
And you don't wanna go to war wit a child of god
So if ya see me in a six-fo, Tuck ya pistol
It's on if ya miss so, Be careful what ya wish fo
A rhyme sayer you respect like the mayor
Plus ya arm is too short to box wit god, Playa
See, I'm all for jesus, But I'm nothin like mase
I'm too ghetto and gutter, But I'm covered wit his grace

Chorus 2X

[Verse 3: T-Bone]
Yo, Yo, Been through the boot camp and training grounds
I've spent 12 years developing this conscious sound
Patiently waitin, Seein women get degraded
Hear my favorite rapper shot and get assasinated
Whatever happened to hip hop?
We used to pop lock and break dance, Now we just gang bang and crip walk
I'm tired of hearin all the murders and the gunshots
It's time for us to take a stand man and kick rocks
We gotta make a change for the best
The west, Only represents sex, Techs, And a vest
And death rush on street crooks that ride hard for they sets
It gets old man, I'm tryin to see my people be blessed
Yes, I'm bout to change it all around for the best
And help the convicts learn how to deal wit the stress
Minus the drugs, Ak's, Gun, Knives, And bullets
And try to save all of the thugs before there's none of them left
Yes

Chorus 2X

[Outro: Mack 10]
T-Bone, Bone-A-Fide, King of the conscious rap
Number 1 hustler, Mack 10
Ha, Ha, God is powerful, Man
Bone, He got me on here doin somethin positive, Man
Can you believe that?
Betta yet, How ya love that?
Ha ha, Yeah, Westsiide
Another prayer where he right
Ha ha ha</pre>
