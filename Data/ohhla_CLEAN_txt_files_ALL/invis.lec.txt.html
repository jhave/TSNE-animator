[Intro]
Lord it's amazin all of the places that you put us
So amazin, the stages you put us on God
We don't want any of that glory
Father God make us invisible
Father we wanna decrease that you might increase
John 3:30 ain't that right
Diamone? Make us invisible
It's been hard though
Father God through all of it I promise

[Lecrae]
I wouldn't trade it for nothin the long nights long flights for nothin
I mean I'm sittin in the airport writin cousin
No I never woulda thought in all my wildest dreams
I'da seen all of the things I seen
I mean I seen Katrina she came through hungry
Took anotha city where desire is from ye
Cause only to yrs back we came to share that
Glorious gospel seen em holdin they tears back
Now we got New Orleans in our backyard God is good
Cause a few whoadies got saved since dey been in my hood
And we got to show em love with our time &amp; money
But for me, yea it was more time than money
But if time is money then I must be broke
Cause I love to get it in with people after the show
We talkin this places and covenants why for the love of it
Me me yeah I'm lovin it we should be lovin it

[Chorus: Diamone &amp; Lecrae]
Feel the power when ya reach the unreachable (the unreachable Lord)
But there's more here than just the physical (just the physical God)
The best when ya complete with the impossible
Make me invisible, you're visible

[Lecrae]
Lord erase me if I ever turned and lived for myself
Cause your glory's infinitely greater than my personal health
And Lord I know I'm not worthless you give me my worth
But I know I'm not perfect to lolly the earth
And can't nobody do it like the way you do
Usin me and my whole crew to reach the world for you
And it's true they watchin everything that we do
Yeah it's true that we're an illustration of you
I look at verse 26 in Genesis chapter 1
It says I'm lookin like my daddy the more I follow the son
And the more I follow the son all my days look brighter
Cause he placed a hope within me got me feelin all excited
Got me feelin like a writer like B on the train (whatup BJ)
Standin up and tellin everybody Christ is King (Jesus)
If ya see me on the TV or the world wide web
Know that I be givin Christ da cred
I know why some people see me but I don't trip
I pray the Lord will keep me focused on a missional tip
And use this music as a tool to get Christ inside of your dome
I can't just say it on the mic I gotta do it at home

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Your boy ain't a rap star, I'm nothin like Jay-Z or Game
I got a funny soundin name and I don't wanna be famous
I don't make a lotta change, my heart has been changed
I just wanna know Jesus mayn, to make it plain
It's like I got a message penetratin my soul
It's the wisdom the Father gives regeneratin my soul
I'm sold on being soled that the glory is his
I'm trippin that he would even make me 1 of his kids
Get credit for so much but the credit ain't ours
My God how can I tell em this in sixteen bars
Prepare a phrase tear a page share a stage
But no I could never fully communicate your glory alone
And at home I pray we'd all be some regular dudes
Find a ministry we can share in while speakin these truths
I'm greatful that you know me if you send me I'll go
Lord I'm dyin to serve and I'm livin to know you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
