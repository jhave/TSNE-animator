Let's go
Let's take 'em back

[ VERSE 1 ]
Remember them niggas from the Bridge be the realest
Pissy staircases, the Hill for the dealers
Told you what crack was and what the blue steel is
And yeah, only my real homies could feel this
Remember Fly Ty, damn, the nigga doin years, kid
Baby mama drama, the cops nearly killed him
"Infamous" came out, but look, rap is wack now
The fans that used to bump to it, half of them doin crack now
Block full of crack vials, life of a black child
Bitches got AIDS cause they don't believe in Lifestyles
That's they whole lifestyle, used to have a nice smile
Now her teeth is missin, and she lookin type foul
Pregnant by a nigga on trial, facin life now
A true story, even though it might sound foul
But shit is crazy

But that was back in the days

[ CHORUS: Kira ]
Ooh I can remember back in the days
I reminisce on you but now the game done changed
The streets still cold but niggas ain't built the same
Things done changed, it ain't the same
I wish I could go back again

[ VERSE 2 ]
Remember when we used to call weed buddha and sometimes sess
Now it's nothin less than 'dro, the haze is the best
It was big gold chain, now it's diamonds on the neck
Went from two-shot Dillingers to fully loaded Tecs
We used to be in love, now it's all about the sex
Bitches with fat asses and nice big breasts
We used to love to rhyme, now it's all about the checks
Flossin around in Bentleys, they used to push the Lex
And now we drink Henny and still sip Becks
But used to hit the ave with the click to catch wreck
Your crew was your posse, and now it's your set
It was Deceps then, now it's the Bloods and the Crips
Do the crime, do the time, now everybody snitch
Death is a bastard, but life is a bitch
Shit's crazy

Take 'em back
But that was back in the days

[ CHORUS: Kira ]</pre>
