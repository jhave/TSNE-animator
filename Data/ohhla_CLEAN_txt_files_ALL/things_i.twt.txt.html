I need to talk to y'all for one minute (ohh)
Have you ever been so mad with the one you love
And you said some things that you regret in the morning (ooh ooh)
But your pride still won't let you admit when you're wrong
But wrong (ohh) is wrong and you're more an adult when you can admit that
Ya feel me (ooh)

[Missy]
See baby last night I was pissed
Cold as ice on my wrist, freezer type
I was like pissed right
I said a few things that made his brain go ding
This chick sick that make 'em just wanna quit
Now don't give up on the good love
The backrubs in the bathtub, yeah I'm just a dirty slut
I'm just a spoiled teddy bug
Yeah I get petty, forgive me if I act too silly

[Tweet]
I've been thinking things over, ohh, and I apologize
Woman enough to say I'm sorry, ohh, I didn't mean to lie
When I said to you

[Tweet]
You make me sick, yeah, you can pack your shit, ooh
I'm a be alright with or without you
You say crazy things when you're mad
But the things I really don't mean baby, yeah
You make me sick, uh, you can pack your shit
I'm a be alright with or without you
The next day I be callin', tryna get you on the phone
Hook up with you

[Tweet]
I'll do whatever makes it better, ohh
Cause I have crossed the line, yeah
I have overstepped outta my boundaries
We spent so many times together, ohh
So forget those lines when I told ya

[Tweet]
You make me sick, you can pack your shit
I'm a be alright with or without you, yeah
You say crazy things when you're mad
But the things I really don't mean baby, ohh, yeah
You make me sick, you can pack your shit
I'm a be alright with or without you
The next day I be callin', tryna get you on the phone
Hook up with you

[Tweet]
Boy I thank you for being so patient
I said some messed up things for sure
I thank you for being so patient, patient
And standing by me, ohh, ooh

[Tweet]
See, it don't feel good to hurt the one you love
Even when you're mad
I said some hurtful things, I'm sorry

[Tweet]
You make me sick, you can pack your shit
I'm a be alright with or without you
Crazy things when you're mad, I don't really mean it
You make me sick, you can pack your shit, yeah
I'm a be alright with or without you
The next day I be callin' on the phone tryna get ya, ahh, ohh

[Tweet]
