[Redman (Snoop Dogg)]
(Mary Jane!)
Ladies and gentlemen, your host for the night
(This gets me)
Doctor!
(Ugh, ugh! All choked up!)
On top of that, we got Uncle Snoop!
And my man Nate Dogg
From The Bricks!

[Nate Dogg (Redman)]
How do I maintain in this world? 
(And you say Brick City!)
A world that's proven meaningful 
(And you say Brick City!)
How do I survive the haters?
 (And you say Brick City!)
How to take the very thing I work fo'? 
(And you say Brick City!)
Where do I go when I'm hiding?
(And you say Brick City!)
Only I don't know, I just gotta' go buy

[Redman]
Yeah, yo Snoop!
If I feel in love with another drug, I'd always be broke
Then I'll never have that Purple to smoke, I don't do Coke!
Dogg, I rarely drink Pepsi
Only Reggie weed would give you epilepsy!
When I talk, dog - never indirectly!
I'm blunt - you got weed, chumps?
I do about 45 over speed bumps
So when you tryna roll, your weed on the flo' 
(Gimme me some weed, nigga!)
Joe Piscopo, I play too much
That's why my Saturday Night is Liver than yours
I'll fight niggas over Mary Jane
Even beat Steven's ass on Jerry Spring
Ask The Dogg, my weed religion - basic!
Only nation for the weed, is Gold Nation
Now you high, then throw it up
Even Rick James had to sing about her, it's

[Chorus: Nate Dogg (Snoop Dogg) {Redman}]
Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
('Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day!)
{Brick City!}

Oooooooooooh  (Ha ha, Mary Jane)
{Sing that!}
Oooooooooh, Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
('You know what, see I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all night!)
{And you say Long Beach!}

[Nate Dogg (Redman)]
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She's my main thang (And you say Long Beach!)
Stay away from hocus pocus
That gives me headaches, mayne 
(And you say Long Beach!)
And when my sack gets low
No, I don't get uptight
I go and find my girl
Once again, it's on tonight!  
(Yo, Uncle Snoop!)

[Snoop Dogg]
One for the money, and two for the show
And three for the papers, and four for the dro
Here we go, let it flow
Just make sure the end's tight
Take a poof, tell me what it hit like!
Paper bag, fill it with the chippers
My new nickname, Mr. Black Jack Tripper
Two bitches and a pad, at the same time (Hey, Snoop!)
And I cracked 'em both wit the same lines
"Do you like to smoke?"
"Can I take your coat?"
"Hennessey with a dash of Coke?" (Hennessey with a dash of Coke?)
Niggas tryna holla' like "whoopty whoop"
Let the bitches co-ride in Snoopy Coupe
You're rollin' with a motherfuckin' winner
And you might win a treat to a TV dinner
We got rules to the game (nephew)
Nephew, the only bitch I love is Mary Jane!
Now, tell the truth!
 
[Chorus: Nate Dogg (Snoop Dogg) {Redman}]
Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
{And you say Long Beach!}
('Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day!)
{And you say Brick City!}

Oooooooooooh (Ha ha, Mary Jane)
{Sing that - and you say Long Beach!}
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
('You know what, see I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all night!)
{And you say Brick City!}

Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
{Yeah, and you say Long Beach!}
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
('Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day!)
{And you say Brick City!}

Oooooooooooh (Mary Jane)
{Gilla House - and you say Long Beach!}
Mary Jane (Mary Jane)
(''Cause I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all night!)
{And you say Brick City!}

[Snoop Dogg *singing*]
Mary Jane
She make you do thangs that a nigga wouldn't
normally do, do
Mary Jane
She make a nigga do thangs that I wouldn't normally
wouldn't do-hoo!
Oooh, Mary Jane
I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all day
And I'll be fuckin' Mary Jane all night!</pre>
