Song:   Somebody's Gotta Feel This
Typed by: BennyO@worldnet.att.net

I used to party with the Betties on the lower east side
Never drop top forty cause I always rock b-sides
G-rides with a hundred spokes to match
We roll two deep...three freaks...four amps in the back
I kicked that crack game rap game now I let my axe bang
Livin' in sin and it's a beautiful thing
I wanna twang like Hang...rock like roll
Got soul like Stevie when I'm under the sun and so

Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this
Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this
Somebody's gotta feel this
Someone's got to feel this

I never had a lot of money never made much sense
Been chasin' bunnies like a dummy overlookin' my rent
He spent every rent cent puttin' hickeys on his bed
Hes rockin' dickie's slippin lickin honeys steady
Lookin' for love I put my talent on hold
Told my soul to glow it said get up and go
And so I packed my bags with a whole lot of realness

(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this

I see these people makin' money and it's funny to me
Tryin' to act that fresh I wish they'd bump into me
'Cause it ain't nothing to me want to eat a little more
Taste a little bit pride from every drink that I pour
I've been a whore for years showing love to my peers
Never sold for any less than what I see in the mirror
Steer wide to avoid the blows I've been dealt
Let the six strings ride when the twelves are felt
So when you see me tuggin' on the end of my roap
You better raise up or duck when I reach in my coat because

(Somebody's gotta feel this)
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
Someone's got to feel this
(Some-some-some body's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this
(Somebody's gotta feel this)
Someone's got to feel this

Feel this</pre>
