Fuck them ho's
Got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

(David Banner)
I got a four-five man
And I could give a fuck about you ho's
Y'all say it, fuck a ho!
(Snoop: Nigga what!?)
(2pac)
Fuck them ho's
Got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

I got a four-five man
And I could give a fuck about you ho's
Y'all say it, fuck a ho!
(Snoop: Nigga what!?)
(2pac)
Fuck them ho's
Got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

(Verse 1, David Banner)
Shit I'm bustin straight out the coupe
David Banner and Snoop
Done with some sticky green
Sippin a hundred proof
Niggas gon' hate, but fuck 'em
I buck 'em up with my five
Fourty off in the front
And I'm bustin to stay alive
Screamin out Mississipp.
Rub ya bitch, a pimp
Niggas gon' hate until ya start bustin slugs at them
I pray to God for McGuiness, he witness a nigga struggle
The envy, a minute I wanna see if ya nigga buckle
Hustle until the mornin shine again
And if I have to run my ass up in the crib
And them bitches said Banner so trifle
I got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

(David Banner)
I got a four-five man
And I could give a fuck about you ho's
Y'all say it, fuck a ho!
(Snoop: Nigga what!?)
(2pac)
Fuck them ho's
Got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

I got a four-five man
And I could give a fuck about you ho's
Y'all say it, fuck a ho!
(Snoop: Nigga what!?)
(2pac)
Fuck them ho's
Got a fourty-five, screamin out survival

(Verse 2, Snoop Dogg)
I'm a teacher and a tutor
I love blowin Buddha
A big plate of food-a food-a
This is what I'm true-ta
A bad motor-scooter
A big game shooter
Download my face on MySpace on yo computer
You can say that you'da
You know that'chu done screwed up
And now you got to see me
I'm plottin shit, shot, and shoot up
I'll leave ya bloody as fuck on the curb
What'cha doin bruh?
Walk up on ya real slow
Fourty-five and two in ya
Catchin 'em up, chewin 'em up
Slowin 'em down, screwin 'em up
Makin 'em fall to the ground
That Dogg Pound, David Banner sound
What y'all niggas wanna do now?
Huh, huh?
(2pac)
Fuck them ho's
