Yeah!(2x)

(Tray Deee)
Comin from the city where no pity is show
And everybody want to be a G when they grown
Same song in my hood  
As it is in yourz  
They send real niggaz to the pen and score
Wars caused by yall  
A bitch is a punk  
Speakin on the ones that's the quickest to dump
Same fools ridin that'z been down for yearz
Cuz that's the shit when they around they peers
Three cheers to the turf for whatever its worth
Cuz imma represent till I'm set in the dirt  
My mentality, battle the opponent to dip
And checkin every nigga that ever wanted to step  
In my direction  
Wit a question fo testin
This action I represent fo inspection
When some jump then I'm dumpin  
Pumpin fear in ya ear  
When ya hear that I'm bumpin

(Techniec)
It's groovy how I sooth thee  
Light complexion
Who's next to flex
These MC's, please
I'm feed up. Head up
And that's just the way I display
Any time a day a duel  
Dynamically wit the lyrical tool
Fuel on the fire warms the desire
To get this rap game stretched down to the wire, sire
My pimp-hog status will blast ya seat
From t to the e-c-h-n-i-e-c (Techniec)
Free from all this nonsense, guilt, and shame
Can't trust no hoes
They the one's to blame
But what I did been through, seen, and touched  
Got a mental insent  
The hoes talk to much
And outta my mouth comes nothing but game  
And outta yo mouth please keep my name
Cuz verbally u herd of the t-e-c
But why chase after he u cannot see

(Bad Azz)
Recognize game when it's all in yo face off safety
Close range with a mask on when I'm not dead  shoot
Out the window of a coup  
Dump wit the vest I swoop
To the spot, to law low from the do-low
Put my gun away, cuz they got done away
By a rather pull a trigga type nigga
See the stages off mic  
And shootin gauges off bikes  
It's like, livin and dyin  
While laughin and cryin
In the same breath, U gain less  
Messin in the lex
And I'm stressing for real  
Unless U feel  
That U strong enough, to go long enough
It ain't nothing but a thang  
Nigga can u hang ?  I bang
Similar to a gang  
Hit U up, and on the mic I ain't nothing nice
I leave U wit yo mental disturbed  
Sellin cabbage, smoking chronic on the curb
Hoppin at my boys about them dallaz  
And impalas wit the switches
Still lovin none of ya hoes  
Trustin none of ya bitches
Cuz the key is to see through the trickz in they set
Life is like craps  
I hit, niggaz bet

(Cinema)
Now I gotta make my ends
The best way I can  
Cuz my man's in the pen fo' ten
Told me to handle his biz
Told me to handle his kids  
And stay away from his tricks
But the simp chose to take another route
A love and a cell  
Ain't what the game is about
Traded in his Benz for a Chevy Suberb
Hit the throttle and I'll be ready to swerve  
Herb, smoke out a nigga hizzy
Spare tire ya whole chizzy  
Fo' us to get buzy
From city to city we mash  
All he ever seen was the 95' tag pass
Cinema, the lil' cinnamon, pretty one
Known to get em up wit anyone
From sunup to sundown
Servin pound fo' pound
Smoking till the yay run down

(Lil' C-Style)
Ahh, it ain't to many crews that can do this shit
Rue bitches ass, promotin gangsta shit
Cuz see that's what people know all bout the compilation
And since the shit droped  
Everybody got conversation (odelay!)
Some people love us, some people won't  
But do I give a fuck?  No I don't!
And when them Dogg Pound killaz step next to me
I try my very best to bury his ass  
C-I-X feet deep!  
Now that's Gangsta  
So U can throw a lick
And make that grip  
And continue to dip  
See I trip
Cuz the click I got wit spit (Dogg Pound!)
Gangsta shit and we commit (commit what?)
A revelation of performin confusion
And fuckin niggaz up in this game of music

(C-Style adlib)
Now that's gangsta!
Hahaha, yeah!
Now that's gangsta!
