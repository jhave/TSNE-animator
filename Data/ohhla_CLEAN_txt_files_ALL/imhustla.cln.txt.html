[MessCalen]
I live everyday nigga like it's the first
Every city that I hit, I treat it like it's the turf
Fresh out of jail nigga life is grear
The police think a muh'fucker sell cakes
When I walk out the mall with hella bags on 'em hoes
Ride back to the spot and pop tags on 'em hoes
I'm seldom seen homey, cause niggaz be snitchin
Talkin to them people nigga gossippin like bitches
So I stay with a bitch, and a jar of that dro
You can't borrow my weed but you can borrow my ho
I said, I stay with a bitch, and a jar of thar dro
You can't borrow my weed but you can borrow my ho

[Chorus: Female singer]
I like the way
He ballin out control and in every way
Cause in the Bay
We always on the hustle each and every day, baby

[Redman]
Now first of all I ran from here to Oakland in my draws
Pick uo the intercom and yell, "Fuck you", in the mall
I grab my ball, then I collect your applause
When I take out, half you MC's at the seminar
You know? air you out, spare you mouth
From MC to MC you can't compare the clout
Dick sqaud be on the rise like cook-up down south
Got Mr. Keebler high and started pumpin out his Townhouse
You know? fa sheezy
I keep the forty-four hidden so the nozel don't show
When they go by I light it with the high pro glow
Funk Doc a.k. Reggie Nobow

[Chorus]

[MessCalen]
They call me Messy Marv, what you know about me?
I never made 106&amp;Park but nigga I'm a G
I smack AJ and stick my dick in Free
Me and my niggaz stay on T.V.
Channel 7 Cheryl Jennings, Channel 2 Dennis Rihcmond
I swang this 06 somethin into the curb
I got Blue Dolphins and them green big birds
MessCalen nigga, I'm fresh to death
In front of Murder Dog lookin like Hugh Heff
So I stay with a bitch, and a jar of that dro
You can't borrow my weed but you can borrow my hoe

[Chorus - 2X]</pre>
