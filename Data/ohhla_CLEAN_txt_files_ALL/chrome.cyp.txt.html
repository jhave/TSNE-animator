You can't hide from the man with the master plan
Huntin for your head "How I Could Just Kill a Man"
Ayo, where you at baby keep your head low, damn
Got you on the camcorder in the black minivan
You crossed line, time for the light to blind
You can run but I never be far behind
You never know when it's gonna come, paranoid
Cuz the mentality is seek and destroy
Better look around before you come out your door
Cuz shit catches up but you don't want no more
Only time will provide the right sign for real
You might die cuz you hesitate to find the steel

HOOK 2X:
You better never let me catch you alone!
Bring it on, bring it on! Bring it on, bring it on!
You might die in the Valley of Chrome!
Keepin on, keepin on, keep, keep, keepin on!

[Sen-Dog]
Listen up mothefuckers I got shit on my mind
The spotlight's on me and it's time to shine
I smack any brat that be jumpin outta line
I smoke any fool try to diss on my rhyme
I get y'all, wearin no can't protect y'all
Wash your brain and have you infiltrate the
Same bunch of suckers that be tryin to hate me
Wanna take me out so they can try and replace me
Fuck what ya heard, have ya seen lately
The size of my clan is improving greatly
No one will hold 'em back, bringin the big heater
Watch a nigga run scared, faster than a cheetah
Speed of light, move faster than sound
But I'm still on they back and I'm gaining much ground

HOOK 2X

No matter what you seen, we still smokin the green
Represent for all the people still a part of the scheme
Playa haters, imitaters wanna roll with the team
But they fade away, hate away, all for the cream
They wanna instigate ?to get a losse forget my stake?
Take advantage of the rilla, rob killa who scrapes
Cuban motherfuckers who don't know who I am
Better step aside suckers watch the heater expand
Get outta hand, see the light, you and your clan
Better scram outta here before you get slammed
I stand strong, keepin on, when I'm rollin alone
But you sorry bitches hideaway, place unknown

HOOK 4X</pre>
