(Intro, Usher)
Gonna do it for the ladies
Gotta keep it hood
Where we at Polow? (Heeey)
I see ya Rock
Keep doin this right
But we just gettin started
Yeaah man

(Verse 1, Usher)
You see you're searchin for somebody that'll take you out and do you riiight
Well, come here baby and let daddy show you what it feel liiike
You know all you gotta do is tell me what'cha sippin on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin all night loooong
Look him in the eyes
While you walk the other side
And I'm thinkin shawty I got a thing for you
Doin it on purpose, why do you work it
I can tell by the way you lookin at me girl

(Hook, Usher)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
I wanna make love in this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)
In this club (Hey)

(Verse 2, Usher)
Ya got some friends rollin wit'cha, baby then that's cool
You can leave 'em with my niggas, let 'em know that I got'chu
If you didn't know, you're the only thing that's on my mind
Cause the way I'm starin at'cha, got me wanna give it to you all night
Look him in the eyes
While you walk the other side
I can't take any more, baby I'm comin for you
You keep doin it on purpose
Why do you work it, hey?
If you close your eyes, it could just be me and you

(Hook)

(Verse 3, Young Jeezy)
I'm what'cha want (What'cha want)
I'm what'cha need (What'cha need)
Ya got'cha trap (Got'cha trap)
I'll set'cha free
Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally (Heyyy)
I'll be like ya medicine
You'll take every dose of me (haha)
It's goin down on I-3
I'll bag ya like some groceries (Wooo)
And err'time you think about it
You gon' want some more of me (Yeah!)
Bout to hit the club, make a movie
Yeah, rated R
Pulled up like a trap-star
That's if you hadn't wrecked the car
You ever made love to a thug in the club wit' his ice on?
87 Jeans and fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table
On the bar, or on the flooooo'
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah you know I'm tryin'a cut

(Usher)
I just want, give me a kiss
If we keep touchin like this
I know ya scared, baby they don't know what we doin
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl and I swear
I'ma give it to you non-stop
And I don't care who's watchin, watchin (Watchin, watchin)
In this club, on the flo'
Baby let's make love
