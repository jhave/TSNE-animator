[Verse 2: 50 Cent] (*R&amp;B Sample) (Lloyd Banks)
Ha Ha!!! You heard Banks say it so you know I got the mack
I pull or pull out spray hollows at your back
I don't give a fuck It's goin down like that
I done been through every hood dead niggas don't rat
In the heart of a victim murder is monumental
I don't complicate shit kid I keep it simple
My bullet wounds will tell you a story 'bout what I been through
Southside trauma, drama with the llamas
I conversate with killers It's usually about life
Politic with bonders It's usually about white
I'm the poster child for violence i'm the boy in the poster
When them shots start to ring out i'm the boy with the toaster
Yeah listen up kicko, I hustle, I get dough
You fuckin with a sicko, I spaz let a clip go
Cannon out the rental, beam to 'yo temple (*Money, money, money, money, cake!)
I squeeze blow your mental, all over your friends (WOO!)

Now I don't hear the sirens but they probably on the creep (creep)
Plottin to pull me over plant the (*Cake!) in my jeep (WOO!)
So I be skippin cities seven states in a week (Yeah)
Can't a motherfucker breathe and tell me I can't eat
Show me the (*Money) Uh the (*Money) Uh the (*Money) Uh the (*Money) Uh the (*Cake!)
Nigga slow down, pump ya brakes (Yeah!)
No mistakes cause the jakes run the plates
Then your headed upstate for rollin 'round with a steak (Uh Huh)
Niggas start up the beef and run straight to the cops (Uh Huh!)
