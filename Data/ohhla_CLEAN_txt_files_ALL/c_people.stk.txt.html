If it wasn't for the bad
There wouldn't be no good
I want you to honk your horn
If your just glad to be leaving (yes sir)
Me I'm big haystak its just a pleasure to be here
A lil jam I wrote for people that mean allot to me
And it goes a lil something like this

I dedicate this to true friends
Ones that's gonna be there
Whether your in a bubble eyed Benz or the Federal Penn
Ones that will show you love when your surrounded by hate
Wont say nothing behind your back they cant say to your face
The ones that will come to your grave and pour beer on your plot
Cry at your funeral whether you like it or not
The ones  that'll put money in the mail
The ones that will go check on the kids and Gail while you in jail
Now that's a real mother... tsshh
The ones you can turn to when you need em the most
Tell you to stay focused and keep your enemies close
The ones that aint worried about what they can get out of ya
Be there with 20 people talking bout finna kick tha... tsshh
The ones that watch suckers come and go cuz they was really friends
Prove they loyalty to ya time and time again
The ones that know you and what your all about
The ones your life wouldn't be the same with out them damn...

Coool peoples
And you'll always be, cool with me
coool peoples
And you'll always be, ever so cool
(Everyone can relate to this one here...)

Leaving you was the hardest thing I ever had to do
I don't know if it was your mouth or my attitude that destroyed our group
Went out dancing or just walking in circles
Screaming at each other till we both turned purple
Heard you got a new man and got a new plan
I wish you the best you know what I'm saying
Regardless you'll be (coool with me)
From time to time I think about ya till the hours pass
Reminisce on how you was shaped like a hour glass
Come to think of it we aint even spoke in months
Hit me up lil momma we can pshhh

Cuz you coool peoples
And you'll always be, cool with me
coool peoples
And you'll always be, ever so cool

The ones that you lost along the way but will find they way back
The ones that had love for J before he was Haystak
The ones that will watch your back when you drunk in the club
Come to your girls and get you to keep you from shhh
The ones that will always be behind you
When you get that big head they going to be there to remind you
Where you came from and who you really is
The ones that's been there since yall was little kids
The ones that loved you told you can do anything you wanted to
what ever you decide to do give em everything you got boo
People you can turn to in your time of need
Holler at your home boy the hustle he might front you some weed
The people that who will be there in jail to see your ass
Put they fist to the glass (one love homie)
The ones that will be down to the very end
Yawl aint related by blood but they just like ken

Coool peoples
And you'll always be, cool with me
coool peoples
And you'll always be, ever so cool</pre>
