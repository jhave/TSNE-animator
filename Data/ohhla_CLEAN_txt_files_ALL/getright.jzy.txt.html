Song:   Get Right
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Heard it's popping at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawgs tell 'em get right
Call up them broads tell 'em get right
Poppin' bottles 'til we fall
Let's get right

Heard it's popping at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawgs tell 'em get right
Call up them broads tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right [x7]

[Verse 1]
Everybody switching them sides who can you trust
Believe what you wanna believe what's to discuss
Young the type a nigga that throw you the whip and ride the bus
And still give the nigga my last, enough is enough
Bad bitch with me and she makes bread
Let her ride the dick like a Ten Speed
They tell me turn up so I change gear
They know me in this motherfucker like Cheers
Hood nigga yea and I'm living major
Whole fucking hood know I made ya
Whole fucking block know I saved ya
Your own fucking folks knows I raised ya
See I kept it 100 from the fucking start
Call me Mel Gibson, got a brave heart
See they money get low and they get tight
Homie gone with the games, nigga get right

[Chorus]
Heard it's popping at the spot, time to get right
Call up my dawgs tell 'em get right
Call up them broads tell 'em get right
Time to ball 'til we fall, let's get right
Let's get right [x7]

I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Sparklers on the way, yea we blowin' these figures
Keep 'em coming we gon' do it all night
Got the whole hood with me, we 'bout to get right

[Verse 2]
So now you ain't fucking with me, that's how you feel
Like I was ever fucking with you, get for real
And I ain't done what for who, nigga for real
You claiming that you put niggas on, get you a deal
Acting like Rico from Belly, that's what you doing
Homie don't really know what it is, what you pursuing
But fuck around nigga with Young he'll get you ruined
Thought we was going in tonight, fuck is we doing
Real talk nigga I ain't the bitch type
Don't make me fuck your bitch, bet I'm your bitch's type
Have her looking broad day with a flashlight
Dull ass niggas stay tryin' to find light
Acting ass niggas give 'em 3 strikes
Heard he rapped to the judge gave 'em 3 mics
Never in my life seen niggas acting like dikes
Nigga go'n with the game, homie get right

[Chorus]
Heard it's popping at a spot
It's time to get right
Call up my dawgs tell 'em get right
Call up them broads tell 'em get right
Poppin' bottles till we fall, let's get right
Let's get right [x7]

I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Sparklers on the way, yea we blowin' these figures
Keep 'em coming we gon' do it all night
Got the whole hood with me, we 'bout to get right
Get right...

Let's get right [x7]</pre>
