Song:   Glorious Day
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus: Dexter Wiggles]
I thought I'd never, see the sun
I thought it never shine again
Then the sun came, back round again
Since you came in my life and then
Like there was no clouds, stand on water
Glory came to shine again
It's a glorious dayyyyyyyyyyy

[RZA]
Yo, they say great minds think alike, we used to drink all night
Think about things that's wrong and how to make it right
Ice cold bottles of brass, and time flashes
A hundred blunts passes, before the God askes
What's the square miles of the planet, why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water, how much is granite?
Every second is the past, every second is the future
Every second is the present, how long does it last?
True I Master Equality, God Body be
Flowing like the Chi energy, inside your arterries
Hand design jewels and rhymes, like fine potery
Even if you went ten time platinum and struck lottery
All the material that you gain in this world
Wouldn't match the price of a snowflake in hell
Bobby, did it all, boy, before you was born
Ya'll front like ya'll thugs, but ya'll niggas be pawn

[Chorus]

[RZA]
Whether million or billion, or trillion, or quadrillion
Or quintillion, or even six sextillion
We still be building, revealing the truth
All the knowledge that these devils be concealing, it wont stop til
Every soul is killed, then, and healed then
Opressed by the pen, serve the clip, angel wings
Only to be awoken by a Killa Bee sting
Injected with the venom of truth, I defend the youth
The black choppers, I spot 'em through the circle
Go 'head, bust my whip, snake, my shit is gun proof
But the darkest spot in your mind's not sunproof
Here comes the proof, son, we present the proof

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
