Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Live nigga bully foot brassed up on rap shit now.
Check it out now

VERSE 1:
Yeah, yeah, yeah re-lax that shit you talk
Before I sick my bitch on you that'll bounce with your dick on a fork
I'll bring a bigger storm to calm your clouds
I own a couple things; I even own a farm with cows
I own the moment when my niggas run deep through crowds
Like how a pregnant woman breast milk leek through her blouse
A lot of niggas like to wish on a star
don't give a fuck who you are
I know some niggas that'll piss on your car
Now see, every time we step in a place
I give y'all niggas shit that put a foul look on your face
And rob ice like I was never more able
Don't drink coffee 'cos my diamond be cutting the glass on the table
Hey, I be the lost found tribe of "Jabas"
Bust niggas then I plant another bomb in your ass
And then I put my students all in a class
To clear my ruler ship
And make y'all niggas fucked up doin' the math

HOOK:
One time now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)

CHORUS:
I know ya-wanna-get up-on it
Let me-show ya- how we do
Every-time we-drop that-shit you
Know we-put it-down for you (HEY, HEY)

VERSE 2:
How many times you gon' crush down somethin'
You need to change your name up, to Bus-A-Bus down somethin'
You fuckin' with the highest my nigga
Tryin' to fuck with the giants, might as well call me Goliath my nigga
C'mon, drop hot shit on the spot; sop it up with a mop
Before the hungry come and shop on your block
I know some niggas that'd love to blood suck you all
A thing of the past, because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bustin' the same bullet, struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' "FUCK YOU ALL"
Gathered up about a thousand young ?box? who brawl
As decoys, in case they needed to duck you all
That's why you better move tight with your click
Niggas be thirsty and quick
Just to be off into the night with your shit
C'MON, we keep it street to give a damn who you are
Make niggas wile, and bitches spread, and put they hands on the car
Now let me frisk 'em, and shake they asses down to the floor
One dude wonderin', "What them niggas is poundin' me for?
What them niggas grillin'? What them niggas houndin' me for?"
Before the poundin', "What them niggas was surroundin' me for?"
Well let me tell you what the fuck we was surroundin' you for
We came to get you once but now I come to get you for more
And while they get and got, niggas drinkin' ten-dollar-henne a shot
Getting' drunk and wilin' out in the spot

HOOK:
What the fuck now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Truck shit now (C'MON)
Turn my music up (C'MON)
Turn my music up (UHH)
Hot shit now (C'MON)
Street shit now (C'MON)
Truck volume (C'MON)
