[W.C.]
Twist the cap back and turn it up and
Back to get it crackin' in this motherfucker
Comin' through like pardon me, excuse me
Smellin' like ooh-wee in a blue T, y'all know who I be
Dub Sizzleen, eyes full of Visine
Leanin' in a 745-LI Beam'
Big bucks and big trucks, buzzed and faded
You and that toothpick lookin' drug related
New money, new day - same to nigga to pull over
jump out and knock the Murray's Grease out your tupay
West West baby baby, don't test baby baby
(Here I come with my hankerchief in hand)
I got 'em packin' the spot like back in the spot
This West Coast shit is like crack in the pot
Can't nobody serve it like I serve it
Got 'em shakin' like Michael J. Fox, these niggaz lookin' nervous

[Chorus]
We do what we do
This West Coast is voodoo on you
(See the Lord is my shephard
Got me so hood, a nigga can't help it)
We do, what we do
This West Coast is voodoo on you
(And just for the record
I came in this world by myself and butt naked)

[The Game]
Nigga it's time for the re-up
Since everybody wanna be us, then G up
Blaze the motherfuckin' weed up
Everywhere we go they showin' us love
And by the time we leave they throwin' up dubs
I've been in this shit, almost got 10 in this shit
Your favorite rapper I done been in his bitch
Who showed you how to put gold D's on a Bentley?
The nigga that showed me, he from Eastside 20's
I'm the West Coast Don, the Compton phenom
that drop bombs on you niggaz, nothin' but dope rhymes
I was coached by the O.G.'s, taught to stay low-key
Now everybody know me, Mr. Fuck the Police
Unite the Coast, bury the snitches
All my niggaz got two strikes and they stare at your bitches
Like what the fuck you gon' do when niggaz run up on you
with a gun up on you and pull the trigger nigga
Welcome to California

[Chorus]
We do what we do
This West Coast is voodoo on you
(See the Lord is my shephard
Got me so hood, a nigga can't help it)
We do, what we do
This West Coast is voodoo on you
(And just for the record
I came in this world by myself and butt naked)</pre>
