[Sample]
As the cloud gathered 'round, paving a way
Laid out on the street, in a burning way...

[Documentary sample]
Ok, let's get in here, get some good samples
Get one with good wings.... next, tests will be done
To determine these are the dreaded killer bees
Something no one in their right mind would ever want to do
Excite a swarm of angry killer bees
Thousands of killer bees came swooping down the sky
And began to plot their attack

[Bronze Nazareth]
Killa Bee, rhyming on mountains, burning the forest down
Tucked with a spear, mouths revolve like all our crowns
We sting like white horse, up in your nose
While black talons and desert eagles is scraping bones
Needles to a knob, my tracks came through veins
On tracks, though we run trains
Each wheel spin well, stay in one lane
Stay your gun aim, posteriors
A murderous rhyme scope, with you in the crosshairs
I slice off ears if I'm not verse of the month
I'm purposely numb; tuck it from a cursor to young
Slurping up rum, burning up slums, smirking at nuns
Dirtiest guns, tossed in the murkiest ponds
My thought's worth the Earth's weight in a purple-less dimes
I should shine enough to sit on thrones of landmines
Moving with Michigan militia
Bullets, rhymes, darts, or criminals might hit ya
Stinging precision with a sawed off paragraphs
Seduce a queen bee into a bubble strawberry bath
Number one Miller draft pick, Killa Bee drastic
Amoco rhyme, chemical flow
Cement jungle habits, Killa Bees, nigga

[Timbo King]
I'm still tripping off of Bishop, when he shot Raheem
I pop off sixteens, like glock sixteens
Bank stop the guap that's mine for the taking
My team all gunners, we whip four runners
We wild out, pull out the Nick Cannon on you
I warned you, my Killa Bee Gang niggas'll will swarm you
We outlaws, who don't give a fuck about the mayor
Block rebels coughing on sour *cough cough*
The mighty dollar is the power
Blackout, goons come in all different shapes
Orangutan gorilla niggas beat up apes
Old school, new school, man, I dropped out
I learned when that van come around, they hop out
I been iller, I send killas with chinchillas
Then laugh at it, back at the crib, like Ben Stiller

[5-Star]
Aiyo, cock that, my verbal gat is spraying like Windex
Killa insects swarm with poison out the index
Reflex, like a hero chill in subzero
Mingling with thieves at cyphing out DeNiro
Oil for your earhole, we massacre your nations
Grazing off the track, lost legends out the ancients
Tainted vocals, Agent Orange up your socials
Wars with the Almighty, tearing down your coastal
Global attacks, shooting missiles at your fortress
Take off the mask and give knowledge to the orphans
Enormous like Goliath, live with street science
I'm gunning down your man with the six shot appliance
Murderous raps, turning mics into artifacts
We set traps that mingle your weak raps
Anthrax wax, burning cracks through your shields
Bzzz, Killa Beez all on your battlefields

[Killah Priest]
The great Turkish lord, crescent shape sword
With weapons of war, his brothers adored, the legend that swore
My blood oath, standing on an enemy's coat
Which was the double headed cobra, and the beak of a vulture
He speak to a culture, his speech was vulgar
The two-faced arrow, parted the air
To put his heart in the pair, the coveted ark was near
The horse stood on his hind legs, outside of the grave
Where your highness was slayed
One million hunchback, then form, face worries, attack
The Philistines Byzantine, Pagan helmet was cracked

[Documentary sample]
Killer bees continue to conquer new land
We must all adapt to life with this predator
Or, catch a deadly encounter with a lethal swarm
The truly scary fact about killer bees
Is that no matter how careful we are
You can be at risk, almost anywhere
Their venom is potent, the number of stings make them so lethal
Do you know how to survive a killer bee attack?
They are things you should know, that could help save your life
If killer bees attack, they're four rules to follow, which could save your life
Run away as fast as you can, cover your head
And seek shelter, such as inside a house or car
Whatever you do, do not jump in water
Killer bees will wait for you to surface...</pre>
