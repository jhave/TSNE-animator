Record industry's most wanted: "Rip the Jacker"
Wanted for the '98 slayings of several rappers
One of which went on to be a successful actor
Here's the re-enactment: He called me at my man's crib
The phone probably rang two times, then I answered
He sounded really amped up, he tried to scare me
He told me that Def Jam wanted to ban me
And told me Trace at the label wanted to bang me
Damn I wanted to get in her panties, she was scared of me
Canibus hates the media and the magazines
They add so much credibility to elaborate schemes
Internet chatrooms with live feeds
of a rapper bein eatin alive by live bees
Sound barriers like the Lockheed, even with knock-knees
I run across rough terrain at mach speed
That's a rhyme from like 9-3
As vivid in the mind, as pictures with 600 DPI's to a sheet
If i'm high when I speak the knowledge is deep
Solid as concrete, this is real hip-hop for the streets
I never leave any witnesses, it's ridiculous
They served me court papers in the studio I did this in
Missin from society, because they lied to me
They didn't want to accept my doctrine of society
I studied with hundreds of scientists and science teams
At various Ivy Leagues, they respect my esteem
What do you want me to rap about? Go ahead try a theme
Gimme a person, place, or thing - I'll create the time and scene
Somewhere in Afghanistan, U.S.A survival teams
Keep a eye on their surroundings in the Jihad Regime
A total riot scene, back and forth they encrypt fiber optic beams
On my album out next spring
You motherfuckin right nigga I'm about that cream
I promised my self I wouldnt shoot it without that scene
It doesn't look right like Cash Money without that bling
Siblings, I mean we all got the same last name
Jermaine Williams, that's my name
Say it again Jermaine Williams, danggg
I think he goes by the name of the Canibus Man
And occasionally Rip the Jacker but never Stan
Get it through your head and don't ask me again
Box cutter, blade runner nigga rap 'til you sweat
Have you ever read the book called "The Catcher in The Rye"?
It so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy
Canibus is comin for y'all round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
A lotta y'all shine, but y'all can't rhyme
And it's about time that I put y'all in line
Twist your mind with twisted rhymes
As weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side
Flows that'll buy the quite bow for the times
No need to hide your friends are all associates of mine
Dont be a stranger come over some time
I got coke if you do lines, you get a Rover to drive
If you hear the engine knockin, just pull over to the side
I guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time
Halloween: True Hollywood Stories release date
We should have a "Who Wants to Battle Canibus?" sweepstakes
And limit it to three states; New York City: home of the greats
Philly and out West, piece-a-cake
Old school rappers, I wouldn't be around without
ain't got shit to say but keep puttin albums out
Don't let what I said get you upset
Box cutter, blade runner nigga rap 'til you sweat...</pre>
