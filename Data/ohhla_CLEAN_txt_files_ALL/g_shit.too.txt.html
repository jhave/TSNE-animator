[Intro: DJ Crazy Toones]
Punk! DJ Crazy Toones in this motherfucker
Finna bust your niggaz heads

[Verse One: W.C.]
Yo, we're back niggaz, Fuck giving Dap to niggaz
Westside 'til I die, what's happening niggaz?
It's that Rich Rolling, loc'd out, Big green, smoking on
Crip Walking, surplus post the shout
Hitting a sip and then perking on this liquor, working them triggers
And when my album dropped, it's curtains for you niggaz
I got a cult following, I'm dangerous
My fans look like a gang of deaf niggaz throwing up sign language
I'm the Dub, with the A to the K, I am
I would've killed you niggaz last album but the trigger jammed (*Gun Cocked*)
So I shook Def Jam and hit the switch man
Now it's Anybody Killer; if it ain't Lench Mob or Big Swang
Fuck! niggaz, Fuck! bitches, Fuck! all the hype (Hype hype, Fuck! them)
Fuck! you, you ain't tight your A&amp;R's a lie (BITCH!)
Fuck! radio and videos and Fuck! a label
I walk in your mixer meeting, piss on the table (*Laughter*)
Wrecking tours, take a Cheque, on who they're checking for us
Stepping out the Cadillac with suicide doors
So let the liquor pour, mother fuck a metal floor (..DJ Crazy Toones!)
I'm trying to put my Chucks down on the pedal of the '64
Check skrilla, check figures, stay checking niggaz
Lot of cowards try, but they can't get with us
It's the Tech gripper, vest splitter, claim the west nigga
Catch you in the bathroom and take that chain off your chest nigga
Ain't nothing changed Loc, I'm coming to you niggaz
Still down to catch a fame with any one of you niggaz
So after this; I'm done with you niggaz
And since most of y'all can't take a ass whooping I'm gunning you niggaz
And rapping's running L.A.'s streets
I'm getting twenty thousand a show to skip across stage on my feet
In presidential suites, getting licked to my feet
Leaving nut stains and Golden Bird chicken grease on the sheets
Niggaz mad cause I'm maneuvering past in a new Jag
Windows down yelling; Fuck! you fags (Fuck! you)
Leaning on that new leather like shoe tags
Cause me and money go together like pockets and blue rags (Nigga)
Like tricks and whores, like rain and storms
Like guns and drugs, Kirk Franklin and porns
Like dicks and pussies, like weed and zags
Johnny Gill and Eddie Murphy, like police and fags
When we come through; look at how they all frown
Me and Cube walk through; we shut the Fox Hills Mall down
Niggaz want to get me, cause their bitch came with them in their Hemi
But left with us in that Bentley
But what do you expect? - she was curious, the diamonds are so serious
Make her wants our CT Experience
Slingshot, chest up, heads of the best is us
Whores down motherfucker, West up!

[Break: sample of Public Enemy 'Rebel Without a Pause']
[Chuck D] Bring that beat back, man
[Flavor.] Bring that beat back
[Chuck D] Bring the beat back
[Flavor ] Y'all want to hear that beat, right?

[Unknown] Please stand up!

[DJ Crazy Toones]
I'm standing the fuck up nigga!

[Ice Cube] Crazy Toones nigga!
[DJ Crazy] Right, Who is you?

[Ice Cube] Ice Cube, nigga!
[DJ Crazy] What you got, loc?
[Ice Cube] The Pyroclastic Flow
[DJ Crazy] It's The CT Experience!

[Hook: Ice Cube]
Gangsters shit up in this, you know how we get down
West Coast nigga, with the trademark frown
Come through the spot, with nothing on the waist
Cause niggaz all around me down to catch a case

[DJ Crazy Toones scratching quotes below]
Ma-ma-ma-many people listen to... Ice Cube
To find out what time it is
I'm-I'm-I'm running, I'm-I'm-I'm running.. Los-Los-Los Angeles, Los Angeles

[Verse Two: Ice Cube]
I was raised by the Gs, under palm trees
Dealt with the dealers, adopted by the killers
Got a Ford for a car, plus a double R (Crazy Toones nigga)
Rappers get my autograph, bitch you can do the math
I want that beat fool, I'm down with C Toones
We from the G School, you niggaz see through
R&amp;B ass niggaz, rapping with your shirt off
Leave them face down in the street when I skirt off
Niggaz in the hood look, they call me Rupert Murdoch
Sly as a fox, thick as an ox nigga
I'm so sick; when I come through the block
Never sold a bird but niggaz call me Chicken Pox
(It's a motherfucking CT Experience..)
Understand that, understand this
We infamous up in this, who you're fucking with?
Break your wrist, take your shit, then we take a trip
And when they find you, mistake you for a naked bitch
Gangster shit up in this, you know how we get down
West Coast nigga, with the trademark frown
Come through the spot, with nothing on the waist
Cause niggaz all around me down to catch a case
Gangster shit up in this, you know how we get down
West Coast nigga, with the trademark frown
Come through the spot, with nothing on the waist
Cause niggaz all around me down to catch a case

[Granny] God Damn!
[Toones] I'm serving all you bitch ass niggaz
[Unkown] That's right, me and you gon' get hurt if you keep on messing
around!
[Granny] God Damn!
[Toones] Use your turntables niggaz


[sample]
Yeah, shit, this is dedicated to all you biters out there
Y'all better watch y'all's ass!
Where you from?
