Haha, haha, oh boy, N-O-R, N-O-R, oh

With Timbaland this time

[Timbaland]
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on

Uh, you see just how I roll nigga, roll nigga
Bulldoze, roll o's nigga, o's nigga
Timbaland with that beat so, beat so
Homey with that cheap dro, Miami and that beach so
Drink up more heat though but only for a beat though
Catch me at ? ? with brands up at Ecko
To all these niggaz frontin' actin' like they wantin' somethin'
Niggaz tryin'a rock me to sleep like ? ? does it
Na-na, and I ain't gotta call for it
Na-na, hell nah ain't gonna fall for it
Always with good roll on tour gotta stall for it
I ain't them other dudes with braids and a pink fro
Niggaz only creep through the hood just when they tip toe
Waitin' till your mans come home, gather your boom box
Niggaz never been in them real clubs like ? ?
So is you men or mice or, I'm in the candy paint
Old school iller ?, drinkin' that Jaegermeister

[Timbaland]
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on

[Female]
Ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on, ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on
Ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on, ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on

Now, go head homey you can call me your henchman
Cause all them dudes dumber than Jessica Simpson, stupid
Courtney Love, stupid, you ain't a thug stupid
Deep down you just really need a hug stupid
Ha, ha, while I'm travelling Vegas
Luxory hotel, pyramid spaces, room service
Room service, and I don't like fake dudes
Hate fake gangstas and hate fake boobs
Tear that make-up on, a little mascara
A little Britney, a little Aguilera
Black girl ass livin' the Riviera
Nah I ain't Justin, won't cry you a river
Lie you a river, won't try you a river
But stone you a river, what, clone you a river
Bone you a river, what, or throne you a river
I'm a alcoholic, shorty could you loan me your liver, hey

[Timbaland]
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on

[Female]
Ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on, ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on
Ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on, ooh, oooh, ooh boy come on

Yeah, uh, figure deal us, them niggaz real us
For years niggaz bought our slang, niggaz steal us
Ha ha, nah mean, nah mean
See me with the nah mean, give a nigga nah mean
So can you really hear all that
Norey-orey's got a hit, gotta figure deal that
Bang on bedroom backboards
Treat her ass like a layer, so now I gotta slap boards
Slap boards, for a hard nail cores
The same as G4's, nigga got the energy
Even on that late night, Norey got energy
Even on that wake up fuck I got some energy
Even on that quickie mami, papi got some energy
Sly nigga, tear the walls off crotch
I snap your girlfriend's, girlfriend's, girlfriend's watch

[Timbaland]
Ooh, oooh, get down come on, ooh, oooh, get down come on
