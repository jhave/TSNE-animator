Song:   Mackin' On Me
Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus: Toya - 2x]
Who do, you think, you are
Sliding off like that, macking on me

[Big Pokey]
Huh say, I'm one of the coldest you ever seen
Hitting the corner clean, gone on the sticky green
It's in my bloodstream, like go and get it
Come back with it, take you home and hit it
Go on admit it, I know you feeling me mami
In a minute I'ma be up in it, drilling you mami
Got a dude then I'm stealing you mami, and making you mine
It's 400 pounds of pimping, breaking you down
I'm a eight baby, I'm a let you by the lake
Wanna lock the gate on my estate, you can't escape baby
You might checkmate, if you make the right move
Right dude, wrong nigga, you might lose

[Chorus - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
Ha, it's the S-E-N-S-E-I
Everything is everything, what's the deal now
I see what it is now, you playing hard to get
I'm in it to win it lil mama, most niggas'll split
I'm trying to beat it up, till it's hard to sit
Sit you on the back of the Harley, hardly fit
baby you in the presence of the Hardest Pit
In the tub licking my stubs, and I don't give a (aah)
That's cause, you got it like that
I ain't seen, too many got it like that
You got a glow about you, I gotta know about you
I'm in your head right now, I know I got you

[Chorus - 2x]

[Big Pokey]
This is how we gotta be, me and you on the low
Ain't nobody in our business, ain't nobody gotta know
On the floor, in the bed, and you tug in the head
Till a nigga pass out, make you put your glass out
Toes squeaming on the luck, cut her get close to me
Quit your job, switch your car, travel coast to coast with me
I don't know what it is about you, but you so throwed
I'm high on you like a sack of weed, and I'm so blowed
Baby girl you blow my mind, maybe you could slow me down
Ain't no breaks from you boo, say lil mama take your time
With me, cause you already know I'm off the chain
This ain't a game, go on ahead and do your thang

[Chorus - 5x]</pre>
