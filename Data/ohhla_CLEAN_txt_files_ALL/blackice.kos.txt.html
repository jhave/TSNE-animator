[K-oS]
Sometimes we look at life too serious
cause we dancing by the pale light
I wake up in the morning and I feel delirious
Cause of something that I did last night
But then an angel came onto me
She said that, "Life is more than you see
You got to be the change that you be
so don't die, just try..."

[Chorus: K-oS]
We just some fools with the lights turned on
hoping your coming too, and turning up the moon
I'll play it cool till the night's over
When are you coming back, 
to save this heart of mine, yeah

[K-oS]
Time to take it slow
Black ice, white snow
What is the truth, is we don't really know (Uh-huh)
If so, then life is a mystery,
This could be the end of all history
But wait! The sun rises to the east
And the world still spins 360 degrees
On it's axis this intergalactic practice
of rhyming proves that there's no beginning or ending 
or timing and it's been a long haul
Rise like the sun and get your back once more
people party in the light game show 
Once again, we dumb it down to ease off the flow
What's the the definition of this thing called "Black"? (Huh?)
I had a premonition 18 ways back (Yup)
That black's the color of the universe of whence we came
I wonder if my souls on ice again

[Chorus: K-oS]
We just some fools with the lights turned on
hoping your coming too, and turning up the moon
I'll play it cool till the night's over
When are you coming back, 
to save this heart of mine yeah

*instrumental until 3:45*
[K-oS]
Come on!
Ah, come on!
Fools with the lights turned on... (Repeat 2x)

*beat-box at 4:21*

[K-oS]
...Oh, oh, oh you think so?
Check it out! Okay
I've got something for you
It goes like this, check it out
Wake up in the morning, press the cold gate
Brush my teeth then I'm hitting the streets to meditate
Went outside, and the sky was rather grey
But I paid no attention kept moving upon my way (Uh-huh)
Went down the block and skipped a little further
Until I saw a kid and he said, "What's up with emcee mur..."
That was then, son (son), this is now
I live in the moment like a why to a how
Wow, that's profound, just break that down
That's when I proceeded to show him the pro to the noun
I said, I found, instead of trying to be what I was
I'll be what I is which makes us the Wizard of Oz-- (*Static*)</pre>
