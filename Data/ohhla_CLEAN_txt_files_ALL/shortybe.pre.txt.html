[Intro]
you hit me up on your cellphone
You go girl wit your thon...thon..thon...thongs
Sexy black come over here
And let me put a few love buzzes in your ear
You smile at me
Girl your so fly
Shorty, you never had a thug like I...

[Chorus]
Say shorty would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Say would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?

Say shorty woyld you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Say would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Say would you be mine? (Would you be mine?)
Shorty would you be mine?

[Verse 1]
I'm like shorty would you be mine?
Think about you all the time
You on my speed dial
dont answer the phone and I'll be damned if I hit redial
(Can you hear me now?)
Good,from the first time you called I knew you understood
But do you comprehend?
Girl,get wit the plan
I'm like one hour,compared to a minuteman
I'm everlasting
I want longevity]
Under Pretty Ricky baby where you need to be

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know you young, but you ready
(I know you young, but you ready)
See, we can bump and grind like R. Kelly
(We can bump and grind like R. Kelly)
Baby we ain't gotta fuss and fight
(We ain't gotta fuss and fight)
Let's time our time and do it right
We gonna make love tonight
I'm like a love rollercoaster
Flip you over
Make you scream my real name
Aladiamond Blue Smith when you feel the pain
Aint runnin game
That ain't my territory
ask Remy Martin whats the real true story
When I push pull me closer
Let me put this thing on ya
Like your lover suppose to
I'm the one you need girl
Girl,let me show ya
I'll turn you to a woman from a child
I'm yo destiny
Baby I'ma soldier

OHHHH.....

We gonna break it down
We gonna break it down
shorty,shorty,say would you be mine?
(Shorty,shorty,would you be mine,shorty would you be mine?)
Shorty,shorty,say would you be mine?
(Shorty,yeah,shorty would you be mine?

[Verse 3]
I'm not gonna leave ya
I'm not a cheata
A heartbreaker or deceiver
I wanna be wit ya
Now shorty would you be mine?
Through hard times
Easter,christmas,Thanksgiving,even Valentines
Forever today and beyond
Baby whats wrong?
Aint nothing wrong with slow grindin to a slow song
Now give me my neckbones
You feelin so tender
Let me play some of this Teddy Penda
whats on my agenda?
Putting ice on ya ring finga,yeah

[Repeat Chorus]

OHHHHH....
