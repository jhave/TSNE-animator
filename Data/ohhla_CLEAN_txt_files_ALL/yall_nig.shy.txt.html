[Intro: IMF Blue Steele]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[IMF Blue Steele]
All my lumps on bezels, I always been amongst devils
Sold rocks on them blocks, whether chunks or pebbles
If you try to get with it, you gotta want that level
If it's high up the ladder, son, size up the matters
Son, I sold rocks in projects and pack it, dunn
I ride with a mask and gun, dive when I'm blasting, son
Cuz I will leave you leaking, ya heard?
I'll put ya bitch-ass underneath that cement, ya heard?
When I reach for that bird, from the street to the curb
When that E-pill pop men, and that detail shock men
Yeah, he saw me when my ass pulled the drop
Pulled it out, he knew his ass was getting shot
I'm the, type of nigga that'll laugh at the cops
Throw a middle finger up, ya got beef, then ring it up
You know ya softer than Scott Tissue, then I diss you
In front of ya bitch and every nigga on this block with ya

[Chorus 2X: IMF Blue Steele]
You niggaz ain't tough, you niggaz ain't real
You niggaz don't buck, my niggaz bang steel
So get it through ya mind and don't front on me
Cuz I'm that nigga you niggaz had probably wanted to be

[IMF Blue Steele]
Who said this life is easy, when you messing with these streets
I learned my lessons in these streets, shit might get greezy
So my weapon in my crease, I'm stepping on ya feet
Disrespecting on ya beat to live my life on T.V.
And I spit crack like a put a mic on P.D.
These niggaz can't write or see me, turn his mic off, easy
IMF forget his ass, he don't want Goliath to step on his midget ass
And that's word to B.I., Aaliyah, Left Eye
I confess, I wanted the best that rest in the Stuys
And for now, these rap niggaz barring from rap
Stay far from me, I swear to God, my squad'll come and clap ya
Pa, I'm not an actor, them scripts get sent to you
I'm still in magazines, with flicks, still interviews
Nigga, extended clips the minimum
And them clips'll make a nigga drip his minerals

[Chorus 2X]

[IMF Blue Steele]
Don't even get in my thoughts, I like to burn candles and talk
Within a prayer to God, before my Leah's in the stars
I'm prepared for the job, spent years in them cars
So I ain't hiding when you set fire to hairs in the jars
Cruise controller, Blue's the soldier
No rules, show you, that use the holster
With one flick of the tongue, ya move them boulders
Or, lift that mountain, ya hear that bouncing?
Through the atmosphere, ya laugh and fear
Thinking that what I say might smash ya ears and cause acid tear
Then man listen, I'm past prepared, the boy's here
Yeah, set to go, so let's go
All I need is a couple of cheques and baguettes that glow
Fed, vest and a tech, let's go
And what I drive, it, cause the optics
Of who's in the eyes, I be confusing all you guys

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: IMF Blue Steele]
I hope the same nigga you could borrow a gun from
Be the same nigga you could borrow a lump from
Cuz when I clap rounds with them hollows and dum-dums
He in the background, nigga, hollering "Run, son"</pre>
