Intro

If I tell you that I love you and I put my trust in you,
If I say that every minute all I do is think of you,
Will you do the same for me, are you really down for me
Let me know just how youre feelin
Would you give it all for me

(Verse 1)

How would you feel if I told you - all I ever do,
Is reminisce of the times that I spent with you,
Rollin through the park on a Sunday afternoon
Dedicatin slow songs - to say that I love you,
 
Its for my honey wit the pretty brown eyes
Never givin up on me - never tellin lies
Makin promises together we ride,
I put this one on everything Im glad shes mine,
 
And I love it when we all alone
Never miss a beat when da slow jams on
Babygirl please understand,
I wanna be the only one that ever hold your hand - yea!  And show me 
that your down for mine
Keep my reservation till the end a time
Youre like a treasure I was blessed to find -
My Precious One  and Imma love you for life

(Chorus)

I wanna love you like you never been loved
I wanna rock you like you never been rocked
But I gotta know the deal, baby tell me how you feel
If I change my world for you, are you feelin me too?
Verse 2
 Hey girl Ill never leave you perfect man is what you need,
Theres no such so thing so Ill do anything you please you,
 I know you want me girl and I want you too, feels just like a dream 
just to be here with you
 I would drop in a second just to think youd be gone,
 Living a lonely life I just couldnt go on,
 We felt lost in love from the first time we met,
 You were so down for mine you showed me much respect I know its hard to 
love a nasty boy like me    
 You know you had a choice and 
who you liked was me,
Some times I wish this world was just me and you
My love is unconditional best believe its true, Thank the lord 
every day for connecting us two,
So tell me baby girl what you wanna do
Im that one second to none show much love to you
They wanna know how Im rollin; Im rollin with you yea!

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)

You know Im feelin you girl, I just cant lie
Things wouldnt be the same without you by my side,
I lose my mind every time you come around
And Imma do whatever just to prove that Im down, You broke my game 
and set new rules,
And all I wanna do is rock with you, come on!
Dont be afraid cause Imma take my time,
And before the night is over you gone be just fine

(Chorus)
