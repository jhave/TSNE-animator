[MURS speaking]
Say it the same way? Ha

[Verse One]
She was only 5'2" and she loved to argue
Girl had a mouth on her 
Till it went south on her
Then I had to bounce on her
Yep, clean house on her
Now she's cussin' and she's screamin' standin' out on the corner
But I love her and I miss her
It was hard to dismiss her
When I know in three days I'm gonna get back with her
Damn 

[MURS speaking]
That was the wrong verse. Hold up. Hold up. Aiight
It ain't about her. It's about this

I'm talkin' sunshine, blue skies
Dress lookin' too fly
Look good, feel good
How good? Real good
Health, wealth, knowledge of yourself
Your best friend being there when you need some help
Shelter, clothing, your car when it's rollin'
Thankful for the little things, that just keep growin'
Holdin' onto memories
Forgivin' all your enemies
Lettin' go of hate so you don't waste energy
Assemblies 
Field trips
Remember that realness
Usin' inner strength 
To you triumph over illness
Honesty, loyalty
Somebody that will spoil me
Love my dirty drawers and treat me like royalty
Checks
Respect
Posse in effect
MURS &amp; 9th Wonder it's like B.F.F.

[MURS Speaking]
Ha, ha, ha. Best friends forever! Ha, ha, ha. Look

We watch Heroes
Euros
Checks with ten zeros
Flicks by Tarentino
Pacino
Deniro
Hugs, kisses
Love, Christmas
Knowin' you're gonna get everything on your wish list
PB&amp;J
Soft batch
Chocolate chips
Payday
Walkin' through the mall like you got a grip like

[MURS talking]

True school
Barbecue
Soul food
Summer days
All day
No work
No school

People out to do thangs
New tattoos
The smell after new rain

Your very first kiss
Or the first day of spring
Blings
Crushes
Cherry ice slushies
Puppies
Kitties
A pair of big...
Forgive me
Hickeys
Girls who ain't picky
One night stands
Commitments
Quickies
Las Vegas, Nevada
Hakuna Matada 
Songs by Sinatra
Or Afrika Bambaatta
My God daughters
Otta pops 
Swimmin' when the water's tax
Silver Hawks, Thundercats
Aye, where is 9th Wonder at?

[9th Wonder speaking]
Hey you got to put that down. Girl you can't keep...girl...Jada...quit trippin'.

I'm talkin' about Jordan, Jada
The crib Winston, Salem

Fruit with no pesticides
You and your auntie doin' the Electric Slide

[MURS speaking]
C'mon baby, you know you can go. It go one, two...ha ha.

I got love for my momma
For survivin' all the drama
And I'm hopin' that the world fall in love with Obama
My first pair of Jordans that I bought when I was 21
All my money, not dependent on anyone
Care Bears
Apple Jacks
Runnin' Man
Cabbage Patch
G.I. Joe and any show that came on after that
Cadillacs
Old schools
Rainbows
No rules
Waterfalls
Sun rays
Football Sundays
Three day 
Weekend
Sleep in 
Monday
A five hour flight
Touchin' down on the runway
Livin' out desire
Clothes fresh out the drier
Seein' my name when they handin' out fliers
Shows when they sold out
Girls when they hold out
Girls when they give it up
Money, when I get a cut
Walkin' in the crib see your new born sittin' up
One love, one life, c'mon y'all, live it up

[Sample]
When you love it
So glad darlin' baby</pre>
