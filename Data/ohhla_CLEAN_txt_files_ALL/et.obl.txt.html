[One.Be.Lo]
Aiyyo my rhymes be the tightest like bones with arthritis (that's tight)
Rockin with the S-U-B, that's why they like us
These crews like computers is filled with mega-byters/biters
And I'm the new virus in town, I shut 'em down
Sound wack?  Not the slightest, they filled with new surprises
Rap SCUBA diver, deep like tuba choirs
Rappers can't handle it, Joe just use your pliers
No doubt about it baby, I got what you desire
I coulda had way more hoes/hose than firefighters
But I choose not to date those roles, I'm strapped for higher
I got more game than ESPN
Just walk over to her like "let's be friends"
Went to her house like -- "Little Pig, let me in!"
She opened up the door with the sexy grin
And then (eh-eh) then (eh-eh) that was all she wrote
A lotta motion in the ocean throw me off the boat
like Jonah, I want it in a special way
Cause she shine in an extraterrestrial way (what?)
I said she shine in an extraterrestrial way (what?)
She shine in an extraterrestrial way, E.T.

("Shine shine shine..")

Yo, that night we both shined like a +Binary Star+
I still can't believe we let it go this far (far)
This shorty was a forty on scales of 1 to 10 (yeah)
"Thanks, come again!"  I was like, "I wonder when?"
It really didn't matter cause yo, she had a pen and some paper
(put my number down) Gimme your number, I'll call you later
Just like she said, ring-a-ling, "Hello?"
E.T. phone home, I played it smooth like a cello
Mastermind the plan and pulled it off like Velcro (I did it)
Hit it and now she feelin all funny like a elbow
"Why you holdin back?"  She said, "I'm not"
Communication is the key, unlock
We put our heads together like a Mt. Rushmore
I found what I was lookin for, plus more
Now with you I wanna spend the rest of days
Cause you shine in an extraterrestrial way
I said you shine in an extraterrestrial way (uh-huh)
You shine in an extraterrestrial way, E.T.

("Shine shine shine..")

Yo, we all know the women outnumber the men
But I wanna play you +Close+ like my name was Glenn
Put me in a cornfield, I'm lettin all you's know
So fly momma shoulda named her UFO, yo
She beamed me aboard, we headed back to her planet
Outta this world man, you wouldn't understand it (nope)
Now everybody think I'm all crazy and shit
Can't believe I did a song about this alien chick
But it's true, you can ask Decompoze and Phrikshun (yup)
I'm known to drop science but this science fiction
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind," kinda
Broke telescopes like you could never find her (shine, shine)
Shinin like a "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"
Now everybody's wonderin who you are
Don't mean to break your concentration, if it's any consolation
I was thinkin me and you could make the perfect constellation
She said, "Ain't nobody never told me that"
I replied, "Girl, can't nobody hold me back"
Kick a flow while my man Decompoze the track
You better recognize the signs like the Zodiac (Scorpio)
We shine in an extraterrestrial way (what?)
We shine in an extraterrestrial way (what?)
We shine in an extraterrestrial way 
Homegirl she was outta this world like E.T.
