[Everlast]
I got the complex subtext
The rough neck statue, the jury factor results in bone fractures
Manufactured sounds and images
Got me scramblin like football scrimmages
Johnny Unitas (unite us) god I trust
I don't need to get paper every time I bust
Maybe, I'll do it for charity
Now my label wanna jerk me for my royalty
I guess that's what you get for loyalty
Life's a bitch, don't take the shit personally

Chorus:
Life's a "bitch", don't take it personally
Life's a "bitch", don't take it personally
Life's a "bitch", don't take it personally
Life's a "bitch", don't take it personal

[Everlast]
Beatch!
Call me a visionary advissery
Known to bust cherry on a young berry
Now tell me how much weight can your back carry
And tell me how far have you come now?
I'm sick of all these fake rock b-boys who think they down
Cuz they have a tattoo and turn they hat round
They call my sons, just call me Sam
Recognize who I am boy, we ain't fam
This ain't the Sopranos, know I roll with the Rhythm Cubanos
And millions get McDonalds
So get the fuck on before I give you a tray
And even I drive thru the valley in my blinged up whip
I don't fear no evil, pumpin full clip
Cuz you ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
By 2002 you'll be history

Chorus

[Everlast]
Beatch!
Yo I motivate to propogate my oral linguistic
Mystical science, act up defiance
Bitches get slapped for a nine compliance
Catagorize me with industry giants
I'm callin shots like my man Chick Hern
I can't mix your burn, while you wait your turn
I get respect in this hear, and that's hard to earn
I don't do it for the paper, I got money to burn
My soul motivation is rock the whole nation
Make a roll scholar, out of dust pation
And all you drug addicts with your thug tactics
You might go to jail if this hards really stick

Chorus 2X</pre>
