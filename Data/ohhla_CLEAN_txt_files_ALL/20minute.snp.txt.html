Hey yo Goldie Loc let me hear some dog (puff)
We gotta go some for the hood that's on the real
Yeah, this is a public service anouncement from the mathafuckin LBC
Yeah, check this out cuzz, uhm, 

Hey yo Goldie Loc
let's do this for the homies in the hood
The dub, waddup
No disrespect to them other hoods
But this is where I'm from 
3-2-1 I can't cum
No other way 
No way, no how
You know the bowwow do it Long Beach style
To the fullest young nigga row
With my steal I cap home feeling like a O
No he didn't, yes he did
Bank your chin in her crib
This ain't no fed
But now he did
On the other side where the cowboys at
Where the brown blast black 
And the black blast right back
That's a fact in the city where I'm from
You betta get ready
Caus here they kitty come cum
Nigga we can dumb on your bitchass
I ain't trippin caus I'm from the oldschool
And I never hesita to blast
See, we be innin
You gotta beginnin to win
Holla back nigga in 20 minutes

[Goldie Loc]
Gimme your mic and watch me brake these niggas
How they figga
Bustas get shot tryin to plot
Blew the dice hit them twice hit a seven
Now Snoop watch me trip when I back your eleven
Mix for licks to double my chips 
Some bangers so much I got cheers even go to there
Now back up and watch me stack up my dirt
I steal like G'z when you woke up and it hurt
Watch me try matches no need for no practice
Fuck around and get straight stoned with the package
Dogg get the weed bangin 
How the homies feel 
If me and you left here for hangin
I feel like givin it up
Caus I'm a young nigga livin it up
Me and Snoop ain't give a fuck

You know I get my ride on all on his own
Check this out dog, you don't know me shit
You know I respresent the eastside Long Beach with the crip nigga

And keep my hands real close to the heat
