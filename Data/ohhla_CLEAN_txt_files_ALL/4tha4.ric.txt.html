Niggas gonna ride high to die
And I'm 'gon stay ridin' high
Ride high to die
This for the fo sho's
You know what I meant
This is for the niggas and we ride fo sho
For the niggas gettin' scrilla on they grind fo sho
For my niggas locked down doin time fo sho
(for my ni.. for my he..), ugh

(Lil Ric)
Straight from the block with a glock
Is the best of things
Been servin' caine on the corner
For the scrilla sippin' on a
Millers, fuckin' with killas
Smokin' bomb
And twomp sacks, fuck this brew
We meet and straight yack a fifth of that please
Straight to the trees
Mobbin' villan life, livin' that wicked rich life
Nuttin' nice off the heazy
You will not want to see thee
Gorilla motherfuckers puttin' a mash straight down
That ass seein' all fucked up and bucked down
Got scrilla downtown, bet I got a swoop
Then fuck the bitch on a fuke in my niggas coup
Whoomp there it is, case gets dismissed
Back on the streets with glock and block zibs
Shits more funky than a weak dead donkey
Man it's on in the ghetto
Everybody got metal
Lookin' for strips daylight
Through midnight this shit might
Go down on sight
Now I'm gettin' through the city of life
4 deep in a rented Jeep Cherokee
I see my G from the block and
He taking flockin' a reno
But come up on some quick c-notes (c-notes)
They got a kite for my nigga big track
Him and Spice doin' 23 and ones of FED max
Bought an AP strap to donate to the hood
That's ready to clock a (?) track
With the whole click if it's good
Now I'm rollin' through the southside
Smokin' vegas gettin' high
Deep on the scene with the gangsta lean
Triple beam sceems workin'
Niggas from every turf spendin' bread with this loot
Knuckle heads see the feds got they 
Eyes watchin', this niggas in his 50 knockin'
I hit back and ugh, early mornin' make me shoppin'
See Lou with it with Eightball
On the mission for scrilla gettin' bigga
And we 'gon straight ball
Since the hall where them wild juveniles played
Been witness in murders from the buck shot
To the ten gadge spray
We 'gon ride, ugh
And ya

Chorus x3
This is for the niggas who we ride fo sho
For the niggas gettin' scrilla on they grind fo sho
For my niggas locked down doin' time fo sho
And for the bitches who be lovin' us 'doe

See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
See me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
And man, a few of my niggas doin time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin' us 'doe
See me and my niggas be ride fo sho
May me and my niggas be on the grind fo sho
May some of my niggas doin' time fo sho
But punk bitches be lovin' us 'doe
We 'gon ride
Yeah what's up 4-tay
And I'm 'gon stay ridin' high
Don't ride, ha ha, yeah</pre>
