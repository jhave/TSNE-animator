[Chorus: Vanilla Ice]
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
Freestylin on the mic so let if flow
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
First on the microphone psycho

[Verse 1: Psycho]
Taking rappers like hot dice, like hot nights in vegas
Got says they hate us cause they are fuckin with the greatest
Niggaz that pull gats and steal gats just like potatoes
Knowing they couldn't break us or take us
Now fake us take us out, no doubt
Make us serve your ass with a teck
Making rappers "Bow Down" like the Westside Connect
I want the Ice like Cube, So I blast with the Mack 10
But trust me, I'm throwing up the dub just like Dub C
Plus we fucks it up on both coasts
Don't show clouts when I rip shot, put niggaz in zip lock
Fuckin with this hip hop fanatics still automatic
Yes I smoke kryptonite, get it right, my shit is tight
Got "Wicked Ways" like Mr. Mike
Get the gauge in the night these niggaz running loose, get the bodies
These niggaz in khakis and not versace
Somebody should have told you, son it's on like that
With the ice man, bitch and I'm gone like that

[Chorus: Vanilla Ice]
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
Freestylin on the mic so let it flow
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
And next on the microphone c-note

[Verse 2: C-Note]
I got some buisness that I gotta handle
Shit is kinda risky, But I'm gonna have to take the gamble
Niggaz they trying to plot a scheme on me
Double and triple teams on me
I'll make them bleed for me
And that's how it is going down
I won't be satisfied until I see that ass six feet underground
Cause you fucked around and pissed the wrong brother off
You lied to yourself when you said I was soft
Now that's a no no, with manhole I'll formulate a plan yo
That will make your children bastards and your wife a widow
Trying to battle me that's a sin
And be like toni braxton and you'll never breathe again
Cause I hit hard like thunder, straight from the under
Ground with the sound that will make stevie wonder
Hard, but let me continue
Serving mc's like lettuce on the menu
Pound for pound up in this game to be the best
Back the fuck up off me motherfucker cause I'm stressed
You'll wind up in a casket fucking with me
You get your ass kicked - hit you harder than an accident
Lets get down to pleasure
And beat the kid out the treasure
Let me measure this here joint cause it'll be nothing lesser
I'll bet'cha that I'll get it wide open like hostetler
Vanilla kobe surround all of you like kobe
And leave you in suspense like who done that
You checked with grandma
I'll be the last man standing off lyrical stamina
I round up 100 mc's in one city
Knock off 99 and a half
And that leaves a half that wanna face me
I'll leave him face down in the dirt
Call the paramedics check the body for surgery with anesthetic
Total mass in a mass stocker, hit the creator
Set it off like michael myers in a double feature
Feature funky rhymes that are hard to swallow
Send your ass until tomorrow, you'll be hoping to escape the horror
Now pay attention to today's lesson
And in for your possession
Recognize these freestyle confession
I'll step aside a case like Kojak giving up the evidence
But I leave no fingerprints
Yo put the scrip off in a case like Matlock
Come bumpin on your block
And clean your ass up like Dr. Spock

[Chorus: Vanilla Ice]
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
Freestylin on the mic so let it flow
Freestylin on the mic get in the go
And next on the mic it's the ice, so let it flow!

[Verse 3: Vanilla Ice]
It's the incredible party rocker, the heart stopper, hit dropper
Hypnotize you all like big poppa
Getting everybody blazed with the funky don't stop
As I detonate the spot like oklahoma on your block
Like it will be the day that I don't blow up any buildings
When you hear me boy gonna beat the microphone I'm killing
Registering 10 on the richter when I shake it
With the earthquake based my taste blowing out your woofers
Put you in a state of shock like mick and mike so get it right
Making is the night
Just to let you know my click is tight, right
We got women up front shaking ass
Just about stripping want to put on the glass
Pass the phat philly as I heat it up like chili
Put down the gun son, there is no need for the 9 milli
Got the meat for the barbecue so spark a few hops
Watch as I raid your spot like spartan infatruate your whole block</pre>
