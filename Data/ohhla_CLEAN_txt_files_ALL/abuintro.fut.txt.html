Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Abu, it's your boy
Oh, DJ X tray day
Hey man I know you going to read up on the spice already
I have two catches in the bag already dead
Good, you need to go get those
Cause every time a free man can come here
You know we got to turn up
Um, turn up?
Man astronaut status man, turn up
Turn up brings all our five on the net you know that
Man I
What the fuck?
Turnip green?
Man I'm not talking about no motherfucking turnip green
I'm talking about turn up man
Turn up?
Turn up?</pre>
