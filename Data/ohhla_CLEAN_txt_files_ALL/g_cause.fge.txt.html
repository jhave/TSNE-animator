You know what I'm sayin on the rice and peas riddim

So all my warriors and gangstas 'round the world
You should learn your history before you stray
It's not a game, so If you can't
You will might find yourself playin russian roulette

[Verse 1]
Yo! Shoutout to all my warriors and all of my thugs (Thugs)
Learn your history before you start buss slugs (Slugs)
You might turn around and see your flesh on the rug
Ya hear me ya hear me ya hear me, yo!
Shoutout to all my warriors and all of my thugs (Thugs)
