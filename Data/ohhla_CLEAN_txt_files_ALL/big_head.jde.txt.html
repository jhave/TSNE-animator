Dancin til they feet hurtin (all night)

Get your big head on the floor

This a Timb trick so you (know its tight)
Uh, stackin the ching ching
and its obvious I'm gonna get a little vibrant thing
Tear the floor (up in the club)

Move, from the bottom to the top
Got ya self a gun and get prepared for the glock
