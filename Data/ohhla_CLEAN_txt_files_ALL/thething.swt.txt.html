[Conscience a.k.a. Treefrog]
This is a time of growth for those that know
And it's a time of hope for those that don't
But if you're mind is open you'll get shown
We've had our sights blinded; All of my like-minded
People need to get up and discover the right time; it's now
Just start opposin' the powers that are rose
In ancient days; And pave the way to disclothe it
So control it's sickening; Most just sit and stare
At a television with a distant glare
And I'm ashamed to admit it, I'm a slave to the shit
As much as anybody but I'm not afraid of it
This is where the change comes in, this is where we make some difference
Embrace what's within us; And escape from this prison
All it takes is a little bit of faith
And a little bit of love to get rid of all the hate

[Chorus]
But the thing about it is we can't just sing about it
We can't just sit around and wait until they fit us out
We figure out where we're goin' while we live in doubt
If you want my truth, listen now, we'll just think about it
The thing about it is we can't even think about it
Can't afford a minutes time to figure how to bring about a change so
Take a second and shake your head and then
Take a step ahead and think about it

[Dusty Melodica]
Now the ball is in our court while we sit and watch passively
The face of the earth changes drastically after we
Clear space at this rate for strip malls and factories
We risk take a cruel fate at a pace beyond gradually
No more crops for us to harvest and feed
Self-seficiency replaced by clone copy-written seeds
Now ask yourself how can we be free
When the water that we drink is owned by some company

[Metty the Dertmerchant]
I hear the weap of the streets and cry's of the skies
See weakness disguised as disceiptful lies
But we all lead to survive; And sleep through our lives
Weedin' for highs, all sheep and no pride
Never speak of a lie; I let the fear fortify
My inside's'll die tryin' to fit in the design
I'm reminded daily of world gone crazy
Guns mean safety for orphan babies
Ignore the distortion, you're forced to perceive and believe
What's supersede's as love but who agrees

[Chorus]

[Mos Eisley]
You survive in the wild with a wife and child
Our whole human history's a line, a type and a file
So live your life in denial, and try to live on your own
Without ya colour t.v., heat, a friend or the phone
While the average guy lives an elaborate life
Waits days a slave wage beneathe a passionate eye
Now we ovulate, copulate and overpopulate
Never stop to think about the things that we were taught to hate
Now the stage is set, watch the players place their bets
Take a sec, shake ya head, feel alive, make em' sweat
Realize that the system can't exist with out belief
Appreciate ya true potential, un-twist your mouth and speak
We're workin' on buildin' a world our children can live
Understand I can't be free while your still in this prison
And I can spend my days preaching as so on and so forth
But it won't change 'til we don't wanna go on no more

[Chorus] - 2X

This is a time of growth for those that know
And it's a time of hope for those that don't
But if you're mind is open you'll get shown</pre>
