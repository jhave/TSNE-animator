[Intro]
Ah here we go, here we go
I gotta go (ahahahaha)
Ehh, you motherfuckers (arhd)
Ehh, I just gotta dig on
Play my track
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

[Teflon]
Aha
City All
Yeah (oww)
4 life
Life, uh

[Chorus: Teflon]
Ayo, it's all live nigga
But it's alright, one five fo' five nigga
But it's all tight (gimme that!)
Where you from nigga? (that's right)
Make it real clear (clear!)
The ville (ville!) (that's right)
The hill (Hell yeah!)
We still here

[Teflon]
Another year scratchin'
But this time around, Loud that got down with the action
Nigga, y'all know what's happenin'
We full grown nigga
What you call Hell, we call home
So pack your fuckin' bags and move on nigga
Hostile takeover, still got the hill top
Lock and let this steel pop
I... take your place soldier
Nine years runnin', been a long time comin'
And you can bet your sweet ass I'm comin' for all mine cousin
I'm a Brownsville slugger where the pounds will slug ya
And them hounds will mug ya but the town still love ya
(Fi-Ayaaah!) get yours
Get raw, get pissed off
We trained to muzzle the big dogs
Train hard or get your cabbage twist off
This tough love baby
But you still got to learn how to bust slugs crazy
On a hilltop but you still got some rough dogs baby
It's all fundamental to hold guns and blow guns is essential
Welcome to Brownsville

[Chorus with variations]

[Lil Fame]
Whatever, whatever nigga
I grip it, cock it
Pop, pop, pop, pop it til your blood run
Hear the flood come now!
You niggaz just caught amnesia
I should grap this fuckin' bat and beat your ass into a seizure

[Teflon]
Let 'em know it's/what's real son
This ain't no luggage tight trippin'
M.O.P. first fam, slip the clip in

[Lil Fame]
Heat up your chest and mind
Show your people flesh and blood
When I join the gun orgie with this forty S and dub (OHH!)
I put it down with my niggaz from the dungeon
Since the days of pigeon coups, Kelly courts and free lunches
We hit the industry and straight send it for the hill
And every verse I spitted
Bitch I did it for the Ville (C'MON!)
I'm from B-R-O-W-N-S-V-I-double L-E
What the fuck you gon' tell me?
This is the place where M.O.P. foundation was built
And some of the illest killaz was killed

[Chorus w/ variations]

[Billy Danze]
Nigga, you fuckin' witcha man the Danze now!
(SHOULD THEY BE ALARMED?!!) should you be alarmed?
You betta grease your palms, you betta grip your arms
And step lightly, I pop shots from both so don't entice me
It's the RETURN of the realest niggaz M.O.P. (FIRST FAMILY!)
Some of the world's most illest niggaz
Guerilla niggaz with all intention to win
All intention to sin
It's on and poppin' again nigga (Man, fuck M.O.P!)
Whoa Flip, he just playin'
It's obvious the man don't understand what he's sayin'
Maybe he don't see Manna &amp; P-Loc over there postin'
Maybe he didn't know Shaq was back and double-toastin
Ready to smoke shit (THE OL' BK WAY!)
We gentlemen tell em all goddamn day
Say what you wanna say about it but don't doubt it
I fill your face full of lead and knock holes through the back of your head

[Chorus w/ variations] 2x

Hahahaha
Arhhhhhhhhhhh (nigga!)
Hahahaha (Shhhhhhhhhhhh)
Hahaha
Nigga! (ow!)</pre>
