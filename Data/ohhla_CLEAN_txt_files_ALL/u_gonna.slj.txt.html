You gonna-gonna feel me now...

Uh-huh, yeah look, feel me now

Yeah, gon' feel me now
 
[Soulja Slim]
It don't stop, you know how I do's it
Always known, for making cut throat music
Don't ever rap about, I ain't got nothing to do with
I'm a old veteran, ya'll be on some new shit
I'm bout to lay this down, and get a few things clear
The head cutter, like to see it when it's done from ear to ear
Did a year time in a cell, oh well
Kept me some'ing air freshener, to kill the weed smell
I done mine's, and they still getting it out me
Until I get off this paper, I'm gon' stay in and out it
My lil' dogs around me, no convictions can take a leg
When we step into Spade's, whats you see is what you get
Representing me and mine's, like cut throat period
With that look on my face, cause I'm stone bone serious
I rap for the streets, I can never fall off
Wasn't feeling me then, you gon' feel me now dog uh
 
[Hook - 8x]
(you gonna-gonna feel me), you gon' feel me
 
[Soulja Slim]
Point blank this real life, don't feel comfortable telling tales
I don't knock it because it sells, but see me I'ma keep it real
P wasn't upping no mail, so 'fore I jacked the clown
I went on bout my bidness, that's why we don't fuck around
Created a different sound, Cut Throat you hear it now
Be cool, cause I can really make ya'll seem lost and found
I roll with two four pounds, told you that months befo'
Keep playing like you don't know, and I'll be up at your front do'
Move on it slow ha-ha, that's how I play it
I don't forget nothing, forgot you showed me where you stay at
I'm doing me you 'spose to hate that, but don't diss me
Your whole new family'll get it, fucking 'round with me
See that 2Pac clone you got, that gon' be the first
Put 504 Boyz, on side of his hearse
Now I got a murder rap, I'm going to trial
Guilty or not guilty, you gon' feel me now uh

I been getting mine's, I ain't never been signed
Never knew what a contract looked like, till I own mine's
Cut Throat Records official now, and I'm the first artist
Quick flip won't lose out, long as I take the office
The game is infested with sharks, and I'm in deep water
I re-rock the game all over, like some shake from a quarter
They water whipping ya'll to death, look I'm solid
Stay my distance from cheese eaters, don't know if they wired
I'm out chea', and I'm trying to be out chea'
Bet you see me riding some'ing, two thousand and fo' year
Oh yeah I'm bout my work, yes I'm is
I done lived in some places, that give you boys the chills
For real I'm to the bone, with the meat showing
Ain't no dope gon' be cut, without me knowing
I been jones'ing for a lil' while, I'm still wild
Maintain and get this paper, and make my own self proud
