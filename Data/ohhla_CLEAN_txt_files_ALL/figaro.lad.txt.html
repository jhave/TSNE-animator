(hit em off)

Chorus [La the Darkman]

We deal wit lucci, knowledge, bitches that go to college
Niggas bubblin bricks,  that see twenty million dollars
I move wise, Chinese secret enterprise
Black spies givin niggas Darkman neck ties, so civilize

[Havoc]

What up nigga, Havoc, yea that grimy bastid
Get outlasted, you on some pretty rap shit
Fuckin wit thugs, violate this, one in the mug
Show no love, four-pounders was holdin us, that's a must
Straight up and down, in gats we trust
Think you bust, touch the stainless steel gats that never rust
It's the lust, to get me vexed, don't take much
You get blitzed on, shitted on, TNT rush
Through the door, knocked off the mothafuckin hinges
Relentless, runnin through your hood right off the hit list

[La the Darkman]

Yo yo, between the gods and the goddesses, devils and demons
I'm weed steamin, gold 32 karat tech gleamin
Cream feenin, like Casino, Trapicante Gambino
Rollin strapped on a bike, New Jack sit, like G and Nino
Shit is real dunn, me and Hav rap for guns
You just a son, you be hung by the skin on your tongue
P.R.'s on the run, change my name, identity
Got a dynasty of clanmen wit cheese like the Kennedy's
Non-friendly, see me in Brazil sippin Henny
Check my pinky ring medallion, it's a form gold penny
I'm drug, put my foot in my victims in cold blood
Life is cheap for you thugs when you give the dirt a hug
You move slow, direct effect of sniffin snow
La's song, home alone smokin wit a red bone
That get's messy, Darkman blow spots like Joe Pesci
In bars, wit twenty yards, "Get out of jail free" cards
You can't fuck wit this Monopoly, knocker, dumb ?boka?
Dreaded one, straight Vodka, best selling crime shocker
Tellin street stories, famous in the ghetto, knife glory
Takin lives, cuz the RZA shouldn't of let me out the hive
La the Darkman

Chorus 2x

Word up, civilize, knawi'msayin, La the Darkman
Mobb Deep, get sniped in your sleep, word up, word up
