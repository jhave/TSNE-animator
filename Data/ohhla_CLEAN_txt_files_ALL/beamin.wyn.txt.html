(BG)
Niggas be hatin
'Cause BG got it
Every top of the line car they got
Look I ride it
From the Hummer to the Rover
To the drop jag
B and C lex truck 
Nothin' my click ain't had
Everybody head was fucked 
When they heard bout the deal
Cash Money hotboys climbed for 30-mill
Already was straight now we livin larger
Already was ballin now we ballin harder
??? bitches can't take me 
Cause my wrist stay flossed out
Niggas hate me cause all day i'm flossed out
Ghetto made me 
My dog, Baby, saved me
Niggas find out they hoe got fucked, ??
That's how it go
It ain't my fault I got mega cheese 
Walk that walk 
Talk that talk i'm BG
Paperchaser to the fullest get my grind on
Gotta do it cause I made that song Get Yo' Shine On
  
(Chorus)3x
Me and my click be sizzlin hot steamin
Bouncin' through diamonds high beamin'
  
(Wayne)
Wha
I'ma flosser baby, baller baby 
A fifteen year old shot caller baby
And I'm racin through 
In the all black chrome 
A Mercedes Coupe
Got yo' wife at my house 
And she naked too
And all my niggas all around 
Sayin 'Shake it Boo, go ahead to what you do'
It's Weezy dog and off the heezy dog
And I'm surrounded by the ice
It got me freezin' dog 
And it's plain and simple 
Won't change 'cause it's natural 
Lil' Wayne a pimp y'all
Got the game from Beatris
I'm tryin to see six numbers
Pull up at the Grammy awards in six Hummers 
Leave the Grammy awards with six womens
And make a stop at the gas station for six rubbers
Put it together
This is the life when you get full of the cheddar 
Don't try to end it or you would'nt get better, what
  
(Chorus)4x
  
(Wayne)
La, la, la, la
Here I come star rapper
I get the fast money
Short, cute hot boy that rapper Cash Money
Standin out the roof of my car 
And flash hundreds
Take your girl to the mall
Spend a G like that's nothin
She lay on the floor 
Open up the spot 
Take off her draws
Let me see the cunt
Don't stop Lil' Weezy
We's ain't nothin nice 
But gats in my Jesus Christ 
Nothin but ice 
When they see me at night 
Behind ?? I stay high
Snatch yo' wife 
Run up in her with the K-Y
But it's on man
Ever since I was born Wayne
Nigga get out of line 
I get dirty like John Wayne
I'm bout stuntin', flossin'
Whatever come wit it
And I don't shoot guns
Unless they have a drum wit it
At first they wasn't wit it 
Thought that I was jokin
Now I got 'em all payin attention like they owe it
  
(Chorus)</pre>
