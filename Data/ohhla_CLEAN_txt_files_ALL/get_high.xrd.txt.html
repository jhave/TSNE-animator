Typed by: PittsburgOG925@aol.com

Do you wanna get high
Uh do ya wanna get high wit me
Do you wanna get high
Uh do ya wanna get high hey

[Verse 1]
Just another day livin in the hood
Why is everybody all up in my business
Can somebody tell me why can't you do your own thing and let me do mine
X Raided loc knows how I feel
People in my mix tryin to sob my tale
So drop it like it's hot
Time to shake the spot
When I need some weed I head to the block
Singing Mr. Weedman don't do me wrong
Like Bob Marley, I'ma smoke until my brain is gone
Mr. Weedman you gotta do me right
If it's the bomb I'll be back every night
Mr. Weedman don't do me wrong
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone
Mr. Weedman you gotta do me right
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night

[Chorus]
Do you wanna get high
Uh do ya wanna get high (Get high) wit me (Get high)
Do you wanna get high
Uh do ya wanna get high (Get high) Hey (Get high)

[Verse 2]
Raise up all the windows and blaze the J
Kick back and let the Calgon take me away
All I really wanna do is ease my mind
If I let them, they'll have me stressin all the time
I wanna get twisted, kick back and rid my brain of the bullshit
So drop it like it's hot
Time to shake the spot
When I need some weed I head to the block
Singing Mr Weedman don't do me wrong
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone
Mr Weedman you gotta do me right
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night
Mr Weedman don't do me wrong
Like Bob Marley got me smoking till my brain is gone
Mr Weedman you gotta do me right
If it's the bomb bomb weed like every night

Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high (Get high)
Wit me (Get high)
Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high (Get high)hey
(Get high)
Do you get high (repeat 3x)
Do you wanna get  
Do you get high (repeat 3x)
Do you wanna get  
Do you wanna get high, uh do ya wanna get high (Get high)wit me

[Verse 3]
All I really wanna do is ease my mind
If I let them homies stressing all the time
I wanna get twisted kick back and read my brain of the bullshit
All I really wanna do is ease my mind
If I let them homies stressing all the time
I wanna get twisted kick back and free my brain of the bullshit
So drop it like it's hot
Time to hit the spot
When I need some weed I head to the block
Singin uh do ya wanna get high wit me hey
