[Intro: Raekwon]
Uh... lay back.. word up, just bless 'em
With the bulletproof... more cases for ya eyes...

[Raekwon]
Flawless crowns, sevens, bags of black
We kill industry niggaz and build maps
High powered money, blimps with emblems
Pimps, all of my hoes'll spray you under the tints
Yeah, car shows with cases, writing niggaz out in the Beacon
Down in the antics, Lex, you should take it
Wide world of sniffers, spiroglyphics, caesers and blue eagles
I'mma make my music the business
And now for the record, I'm on niggaz, go head, ditech it
I'mma leave you left, freezing and naked
Silverback gorillas, taught to bite tongues out faces
Fleeing in clubs, fly in something silver
Catch me with the Germans, hard body dealing with hard white
Dominican complexion with some hard ice
Can't nothing rock me, I'm legendary

[Outro: Raekwon]
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what
It's on you bitch... word up...
Back to that ice rocking shit
The muthafuckin' good sneakers on
With the persian muthafuckin' scarfs hanging on
Catch me flying in that muthafuckin' XO
It's on, with the shit on the other side
The steering wheel on the other side, my nigga
You know what it is, it's going down
Cuban Linx man, Part 2, The Purple Tape
It's on, thoro, do it...</pre>
