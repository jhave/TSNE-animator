[B-Real]
Living in the big city 
The American dream 
Is far roaming in the streets of greed 
Everywhere I turn I'm on a mission for more 
But I ain't selling my soul 
With the dope theres no girl 
I'm on a one way box to the top 
Hitting the strip but got a sound that would rally the block 
I'm in the fast lane and I won't stop 
You ain't nothing but talk 
You couldn't hang on the rope by ball 

[Sen Dog]
This life that I live 
It aint for the weak 
Got my roddy gangster that came off the street 
I'm trying to keep the peace 
but I gotta keep my pace 
Got these drunk police 
Want me all rappy 
And I'm searching for the higher ground 
I want my head in the sky 
So high that I can't come down 
Leave your lies in every town across the nation 
Cause you can never stop to play 

[Chorus]
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Cause what goes up must come down 
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
How high can you get? 

[B-Real]
Cruising in the drop chevy 
Got my foot on the floor 
I'm hitting switches and my brim is heavy 
You wanna look inside 
And see whos crossing the brine 
Curiosity is killing you 
With stick in the prime 
I get high from the brim in the set 
Never gripping the square 
But all you haters couldn't hold my
Don't need a clip for my ? straight 
You should leave it alone 
And check your toe cause my line will spit 

[Tom Morello]
This right heres as high as it gets 
Somebody likes it..the hell 
Cause you stepped on the sex 
But guess who will show you, you gotta pass the check 
Got my clock on deck and my custom vest streets 
You came, for me I'm the best 
And you can keep the dress 
Cause I'm smoke at the less 
Turn a step back I'm tired of getting pushed 

[Chorus]
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Gotta rise up to the top (to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Cause what goes up must come down 
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
How high can you get? 

[Sen Dog]
I go psycho, crazy Michael Myers 
Except the stages on fire going higher 
Cause when I lean on a flyer 
Theres so much more to make the whole city rise 
This defines a man to get the whole world lifted 
Wall man trying to make a land with a mission 
There's no way you can stand in this position 
You can't take the heat get the fuck about the tension 

[B-Real]
Go with the will to hustle, you see if we hit the floor
you'll never stop it you ain't got the muscle 
Were going to world top, homeboy this is the show 
We gotta blow up the stage be out the door 
Sometimes we all nedd an escape 
So when we form our track 
Well get your mind while we get the stat 
I made a pack with a crew on the hill 
We continue to build with all the people who believe their bill 

[Chorus]
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Gotta Rise up (to the top, to the top) 
Can't stop (How high can you get?) 
Cause what goes up must come down 
So we gotta rise up to the Higher ground 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
Rise Up (Rise Up) 
How high can you get?
