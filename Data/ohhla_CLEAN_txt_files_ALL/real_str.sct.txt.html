Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Real street nigga
Real street nigga
Real street nigga
Real street nigga
Never tell on nobody
Been a 4 to 34?!?

Pay my respect to John Gotti
Look at all the shit he did
Ain't tell on nobody
Real street niggas
They don't talk I the interrogation
Folks put the pressure
On them on the investigation
But with every street nigga I am money making
I got it at the streets too
Jucked up and down the pavement
All my life, reputation
Fred Grant, Jessey Lincoln
And no, I ain't gang bang
I know real gang bangers
I'm a real street nigga
Can't no nigga outtake me
You rappers have never seen the streets, so stop faking!
Big to your hustle, know that money make you impatient
Real street nigga work the doughs at their track crazy

[Chorus]

You ain't no street nigga
I can see through you
Where my niggas juggie?
Where my niggas working?
If you out there in the streets
Money is the purpose
Gotta know to work the corner
You get time for it
In the road, run up tricks
I put my life on it
With all these plots
I could be a brick mason
With all these bags
I take money vacations
Put G's on the plot
Shout a risk crazy!
Put G's on my watch, got a real diamond
I never see you on the block
When I was out grinding
I got bills in the air
I got bricks flying
I'm a real street nigga
The other rappers lying

[Chorus]

They gon'vouch for me
They gon'vouch for me
All the real street niggas
They gon'vouch for me
All the O.G. bossing
They gon'vouch for me

Young Scooter got a lot of street credit
Pull up in any hood and sell a hundred bills
You in the trap, you gotta have some plan
You wanna ride foreign, gotta whip it Yale
The code of the streets is to never tell
The streets, how I eat, I eat bad meals
Just tell me what you need, I can make a deal
The streets have B.o.g. working

[Chorus]</pre>
