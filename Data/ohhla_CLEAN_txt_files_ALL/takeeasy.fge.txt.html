[L-Boogie]
Brethren don't cut me when I'm going
I don't hear myself
We bout to drop, drop drop drop
You can bring the beat up a little bit in the headphones
Bring the beat up a little bit
We bout to drop. We bout to drop, drop, drop, drop

[L-Boogie]
I got Moxie, I'm so damn foxy
Industry try to block me like cops and paparazzi
Full stop, don't copy, just cop me properly
Everybody same policy, universal equality
Responsibility, polity, to survive economically
Some people do it comically, fruits of freedom, equality
Invest your money properly, people owe me apology
Intellectual property, stealing stolen commodity
Souls searching or controlling and robbery, cold lack of camaraderie
Clones, copycats bother me, mine, own, blind cats, follow me
Honesty, honesty, honestly, all these jokes are common-league
Puppets with no autonomy, yup it's Fugees entirely

(Chorus Clef) + [L-Boogie]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your crew I said tell 'em take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy
take it easy, take it easy [too sleazy]
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy [Ay papi]
Better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy

[Clef] + (L-Boogie)
You movin bricks but you better take it easy
Here's a tip, you're too flashy
I don't tip twice, but you best friend he DT
And that dog sniffin in the back ain't Lassie
And I ain't rhymed in a minute, but ya'll ain't catch up
And that ain't blood on your shirt, man that's ketchup (That's ketchup)
Picture Clef getting a writer to give him help
I'd rather kill myself become a ghost and write for myself (OH MY GOD!!)
Cuss I'm the top celebrity, top celebrity, top celebrity, MC (Bing!)
I flow for the thugs, gypsies, and hippies (Bing!)
A ghetto maestro with a Nat Turner flow (Bing!)
Malcolm X come out, hit the Klu Kulx Show (SHOOWOOWOO)

(Chorus Clef) + [L-Boogie]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your crew I said tell 'em take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy
take it easy, take it easy [too sleazy]
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy [Ay papi]
Better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy

[L-Boogie]
Don't you know originals get plagerized, majors minors, must supervise
Haters, Climbers get scrutinized, Placaters, Blind and stupid guys
Wicked people choose homicide, Dregs of society heathen 'em
Beggars, bogus misleading dem, Nigra, Negro, Negrito 'em
Angelitos con libre dem, Chico's, Chica's completing them
Addiction, fiction, bleeding them, capitalism eating them
Misunderstanding cheatin them, The ignorance defeating them
True loyalty is leaving them, got royalty believing them
Eyes open deceiving them, Reconciling, Receiving them
Reckless driving and grieving them, Matthew Andrew and Peter them
(Slow down)
We 'bout to reconcile (repeat)
We 'bout to reconcile (reconcile)
We 'bout to reconcile(recon, recon, reconcile)
We 'bout to reconcile, (tell 'em to give off my style) (Slow Down)
We 'bout to reconcile (reconcile like Public Enemy)
We 'bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (reconciliation) (tell 'em to get off my style)
We 'bout to reconcile(running with my crew again)
We 'bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (tell them to get my off style) (repeat)

[Pras] - (Overlapping L-Boogie)
(Ay yo!)
(Yo yo yo yo yo!)
Stop the track, what ya'll thought I wasn't coming
been in the L.A., few flicks, few millions
back with the Fugees, foo-fighting for a few billions
dub plate dealing, sound boy killin
anything we do, we want that cap for me realin?
Angelo, Simone, Michelle, you know them willin
Can't fight the feelin, when I pull in the SFR, every girl love's a ghetto superstar (that's Pras baby)
Run hip hop like pin stripe Lees and
I got love for my crew like Big had for Cease (C's)
Pull and sqeeze on these MC's
I don't really wanna do it, take it easy

[Clef]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your goons that they better take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy
take it easy, you better take it easy (L-Boogie: too sleazy)
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy (Ay papi)
Mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy

[Clef]
We got L-Boogie in the house (Lauryn: what)
Prazwell in the house
Clef
Jerry Wonder, yeah

Big Ro (Rohan) I see you in the back
Let's get this thing started
Let's stay focused, focused, focused, focused

Oh, If you don't know what's goin on man
The Fugees back on the street, serious thing right now
You scared yet, ah pack your dibby dibby dub box</pre>
