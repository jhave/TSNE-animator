Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The only way to rise is to move the best as I can
The only way to rise is to move the best as I can
Niggas plotting on the boss but they can't see in
Looking right in they eyes, it's a mirror and damn I won't stop till the end
Fake friends, they don't eat when the cake sits
Niggas jumping off the court, I was playing beans
Saving shit, aiming shit, aiming shit
Feeling like caving shit, learned at 14 the game is sick
Tryina get by, when you got no handouts
Came from a group home, he a new home
Now you gotta learn the rules of the game
If I am to change my chains, yeah
Now how am I supposed to love the rain
When everyday it feels like it be pouring again
I was poor like my friends I was out looking in
I was thinking things matter when they really don't matter
Most things just a symbol, I ain't gonna die for the cedar
Real friends come around, you both climbing the ladder
I got used to the pain, I got used to the power
We all born real, but life get sour
Thanking earth everyday I'm connected to flowers
I be over niggas heads like the top of the shower
Yeah, you gotta pay attention, not to mention
I coming from the top position, lock position
I'm coming when the, motherfucking cops is missing
Leave a couple guessing, who need a blessing
I motherfucking need a message, he stressing, flexing
But he be dressing, like God bless him
Don't test him, won't pass, fake niggas came guessing
I come through the dreams and gonn deal with you
Lil b ain't no sucker, never been no buster
Like the bank just trust us,
Thugging to the end, Halloween hso, it's lil to the end, fuck my foes
That's how I feel</pre>
