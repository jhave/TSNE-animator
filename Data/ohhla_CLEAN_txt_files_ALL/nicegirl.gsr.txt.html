[Boy Big]
You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
Just a nice nice girl girl, in the wrong place

[Guru]
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
You wanna take my chips, I wanna take you on trips
So you can help me, get my money
Go ahead, try it for me here's the story of my honey
I'm the Owner and I'll do more than bone you
Maybe help you advance, like Prince did Apollonia
You looking right I see you hooking tonight
But something about you, got me pushing up tight
Do that dance like Aphrodite cause you mighty
You might be the chick that make me trip just slightly
Ya eyes glisten, your breasts, ass and thighs is hittin
If it ain't love, then this thug is just smitten
I feel ya aura like I'm reading ya horo-
-scope, and I hope that I can see you tomorrow
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this?

[Chorus: Boy Big]
You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
And I think I'm diggin you in a major way
You're just a nice girl, in the wrong place
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Whatcha doin in a place like this?

[Guru]
What's a nice girl like you doing here like this?
Busting your heels like this, I know you feel like shit
And you feel like calling the quits, but you need that dough
Paying for school, I can see that yo
You're intelligent, similar to Angelo
I'm understanding you, I got big plans for you
Your whole awaistance got you going places
You chasing money, ain't no funny faces
You're/Your shit serious, niggaz is delirious
I like your little outfit, I like the way you're wearin it
You say your last man was too jealous
You're too young to settle down, girl I'll let you tell it
You're not a video chick, not a groupie bitch
Just an ambitious young woman with juicy lips
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this

[Chorus]

[Guru]
What's a nice lady doing in place so shady?
Your innocent stare and derriere so crazy
Conversation stimulating, you witty
You got me debating on, taking you with me
I'm in the back drinking Yak, with you on my lap
Give me a dance cause, this is my track
You holdin it down for your whole fam
You wasn't happy with your last old man
Ma, you're doing things your way
You're making your own pay
Gotta have a business of your own one day
Hon it ain't nothing to it, I wanna see you do it
I'll tell you one thing, your last man blew it
A perfect blend of, beauty and brains
It's my duty to explain what you do to me and
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this?

[(Boy Big sings til end]
Now that I see that you be gettin ya money
You look prime time, I know you be gettin ya money
You look so fine, you've changed my mind
And all I wanna know is why, why?

Just a nice girl..</pre>
