[Too $hort]
Yeah we ridin' on a Saturday
Top down, spittin' at the bitches
$hort Dog... Motion Man

I'm turnin' heads, everybody wavin' and smilin'
My shit stays clean 'cause everyday I be wilin'
Chrome everywhere, I don't care what's the year
If I whip it, I look like a real fuckin' player
In a '6-6 Stang with the top away
Seein' girls everywhere 'cause it's hot today
Blow my horn, so I can see what's goin' on
What's your number girl, I'ma call you on the phone
Hit a corner, talkin' to a bitch I just met
Bout to turn her out, see how rich I'm gon' get
Ching-ching, it's better than that bling-bling
Control a bitches mind and have her seein' things
My name is $hort but you can call me Too
You can't find me bitch but I'll find you
I'm sittin' here lookin' at you and your two friends
Parked on the corner in my brand-new Benz

[Chorus: Motion Man] (Too $hort)
(With my top down)
We comin', we players, we ridin' on the weekend
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
Bikinis on bodies, they down for the freakin'
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
We movin', we scrapin', them tires burn screechin'
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
We comin', we players, we ridin' on the weekend
(I got my top down, car full of hoes)

[Motion Man]
Since young been gettin' down
Little summertime driller for peoples to bump around
Bald headed, my dome glisten and glare
Bright and scorchin' to the eye for you people who wanna stare
I'm a summertime cat, Winter, Fall, Spring, all of that
Hot, top down, trunk with rattle up in the back (POUND-POUND)
Rumble erratic, Motion up in your town
Lot of fools look and nod, special haters just look around
We fully equip vehicles from the ground up
We like to get at the ones with fat cheeks
Major chunky in the rear with that extra rump meat
I get my walk on, talk on, baby hold on, phone on
Get your call on whenever you wanna meet
like Mike Vick, peoples they know how I get down
What you know about this that and the third
Motion freaky with his tales as I'm pullin' you off the curb
Party drank with the herb

[Chorus: Motion Man] (Too $hort)
(With my top down)
We comin', we players, we ridin' on the weekend
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
Bikinis on bodies, they down for the freakin'
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
We movin', we scrapin', them tires burn screechin'
(Top down, car full of hoes, gettin' freaky)
We comin', we players, we ridin' on the weekend
(I got my top down, car full of hoes)

[Too $hort]
