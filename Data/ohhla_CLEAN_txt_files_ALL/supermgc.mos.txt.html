[Malcolm X]
"You're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution
a time where there's got to be a change. People in power have misused it
and now there has to be a change and a better world has to be built
and the only way is going to be built is with extreme methods
and I for one will join with anyone, don't care what color you are
as long as you want change this miserable condition that exists on this earth."

[Mos Def]
Ecstatic
Ecstatic ecstatic
Classic
Flow

Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, Brooklyn we keep 'em open
The heavens expand the stars advance feel the boogieman

Mojo hand healing power like Bang
Snap, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Great name, greater than all your riches
Yah Dante Flaco Bey that's the business
Repeat, I rebuke these snitches
We know the truth, you can't confuse me bitches
Strong magic that bust all your wishes
Cherokee Chief rock upon cha rock it don't stop
And let's get

Yes
You're now rockin' with the Def
Lararara
Oh Oh Oh Oh

It's like heartbeat, you make me feel
So... REAL

Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, Brooklyn we keep 'em open

Again again
Super magic black origin freshly out of dopeness
Definitely out of dopeness, sketch another opus
Knock off your set, come close and get 'em open

Get it here, let it go!

Ectasy

The heavens expand the stars advance feel the boogieman

Nice!
