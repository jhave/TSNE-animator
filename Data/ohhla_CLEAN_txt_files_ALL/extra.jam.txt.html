[Verse 1 - Jamie Foxx]
Last night me and my dogs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups and downs had me in a twist
Started dancing with this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

[Chorus]
Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the Embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

[Verse 2 - Jamie Foxx]
When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was laying next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember

[Chorus x2]

[Jamie Foxx (with ad-libs)]
Extravanganza
Extravavganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember
And I remember

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Bein' at the bar tryin' ask what that hypno hit fo' (Hit fo')
Knowin' I can't afford to get mo' (Get mo')
Here's a broke nigga tricked buy one bottle on six flo' (Six flo')
Or, or  leave the club now
Do like I did, come back when u get dough
A fishstick nigga now we messin' wit lobster
We messin' with Grammies, we messin' with Oscars
You messin' with that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on that stanky stank
In the morning you gon' draw a blank
The hotel said y'all was on 'em
My girl wasn't on shit, I picked the wrong one
Stead he talkin' bout I ain't like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Never meet ya mother girl
You know they love it when you love 'em
And they tell they friends girl

[Chorus x2 (with ad-libs from Kanye West)]</pre>
