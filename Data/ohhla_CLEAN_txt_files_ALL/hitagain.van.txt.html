[Intro]
I'm a rock, hit it
Hit it
I'm a rock, hit it

[Luther]
Well by now you know I'm insatiable
Cuz when you step to leave
I want a full repeat, yeah
It's a miracle
You were right inside my head, yeah baby

If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?
It is not against the law, no baby
I slave all through the week
And I need my release
I work hard so when I stop
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me

1 - 	Hit it again
	Don't care if I'm late
	The world just has to wait
	(Hit it again, hit it again, baby)

	Hit it again
	I loved it the first time
	You sent chills up through my spine
	(Hit it again, hit it again, baby)

(Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it)
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it
I hope you understand
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no

If I can't double up, it's like I didn't get enough
Call me greedy if you want, just do it
But it's something that will never change
I don't get no complaints
They know it when they ring my bell
That this could be a thing that could take a little while
Well, well

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

(I declare the point to be)
Once is not enough for me
(Two time lovin' makes me smile)
One time love just ain't my style
(Repeat the love and I have found)
More the second time around
It builds me up and I love to love
And if I can't hit it again
(It ain't natural)

I'm a rock, hit it

[QL]
Yeah, that's right
Uh, all night, let's go, let's go
(I've been sleeping with my boss)
Nine o'clock, you got a call to make
Ten oh five, they need you at the bank
Eleven, Mr. Brown is stopping by
He's got some papers that you need to sign
Eleven Twenty, meet the boss for brunch
At one, take the office girls to lunch
Don't even act like you gon' stand 'em up
Cuz they've been waitin' for your butt for months
You've been avoiding Mr. Jones these days
He wants to talk to you about his raise
I told him you had time about three ten
We don't have time for makin' love again
Remember six fifteen, your business dinner plans
You blow them off and they won't even understand
We layed around and let the whole day pass
You need a car to meet chu, instead of tellin' me to

Repeat 1
Repeat 1</pre>
