[Mos Def {*singing*}]
ay-ay, ayyyyyy-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day

{*rapping*}
yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ??? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

[Ronny Jordan (Mos Def)]
Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

[Mos Def]
yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself
To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ??? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

[Ronny Jordan (Mos Def)]
Brighter day came my way

[Mos Def {*singing*}]
begun...brighter day, brighter day
came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, wooh) fly away, fly away, fly away
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
we are lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
lookin' for a brighter day
said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
ay, ay

A brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (yeah)

Brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun
A bright..
