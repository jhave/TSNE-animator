[Ice Cube]
There are seven known wonders of the world
Yeah, hehe, you about to witness the 8th muh'fucker

I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sittin next to yo' ass and can't hear, what you got to say
My shit is loud, my ears is ringin
My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin
I feel like a vet ballin on these rookies
An old school bully, you must have played hooky
I bring it like a bookie my aggression is depressin
Don't give a motherfucker time to learn his lesson!
A LUNATIC~! Y'all know what I represent
The only rapper who wanna fistfight the President!

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
It take a nation of niggaz to hold us back

[Ice Cube]
When I bang this is dangerous, niggaz go brainless
So bang this with the fo'-five stainless
And understand that you lookin at the famous
West coast rapper, who act like a anus
Hollywood! They thought they could tame this
pitbull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like a NBA ref
If you smoke one they'll electrocute you to death
I got God on my intellect, Godzilla on my neck
When a nigga come through, who you wanna holla at
Ghostriders hit the deck, when your boy got a tec
Where the fuck is, Afrika, Bambaataa at?
We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel, and Radio One
You motherfuckers programmed by the programmers
That's why you gettin locked up by the do' slammers
Not me!

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
They music so fluffy, I'ma stay gutter
That shit is kind of popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change, in 22 summers
Straight independent, and doin my numbers
This ship don't sail, you know I'm still paid
So sourpuss niggaz, can drink lemonade
I'm doin it for the love, you doin it because
you need that advancement to spend on them dubs
I don't need a penny, but I need many
Don't worry about my money boy cause I got plenty
You muh'fuckers worry about flossin so much
You don't know the fundamentals you forgot how to brush!
These 32 teeth, will give yo' ass grief
Bite you like a Fatburger if you got beef
So who's it gon' be? Your favorite MC
You scared of the government they scared of me
Now what?

[Chorus] * except last line changed

* It take a nation of niggaz and streets of crack {*echoes*}</pre>
