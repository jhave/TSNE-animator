[Hook: repeat 2X]
Don't be mad if yo girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault yo girl's tryin' get at me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me

[Q]
It's a shame, but this game baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me

It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me - callin' me
If she's yo girl she wasn't yesterday - yesterday - yesterday
Don't be mad

[Slim]
How in the hell do you have the audacity 
Runnin' up on me tryin' to talk to me
Checkin' me
When you need to be checkin' yourself clown
Keepin' yo girl from schoolin' around
You call yourself a playa tell me how that sound
When yo girl is feignin' for me and she wanna be down

It's a rule I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she's callin' me - callin' me
If she's yo girl she wasn't yesterday - yesterday - yesterday
You cant be mad

Girl never seen a dude this down and dirty 
Thuggin' but he thought handle business but he not
Plenty women always wanna hold him just cause he rollin'
Claimin' they ain't got no job
But petty niggaz they be comin' at you bogus while you clubbin'
Try to take you for the women that be fuckin'
Talk about how he always huggin'
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin' people steady talkin'
He say she say get you ?
I saw yo girl talkin' 
But to 112 and Twista walkin' to the truck bout to get ?
No snoozin'
All the bitches be in big ballin' confusion
Niggaz trippin' off the ladies they be losin'
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion 
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil' momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cause yo kitty gone
Yo chick just chose me
You ain't cut like ? tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playaz
Or three tone ? gators
You can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty women out here dog so don't hate me
