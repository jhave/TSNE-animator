Murda muzik
All y'all niggas
Infamous
Watch ya self (*music begins*)
Infamous mobb
It's over dunn
It's over(it's over)
Check it out dunn(we got em dunn)
All y'all niggaz
Sit there
Like y'all in a classroom(stick them niggaz)
All y'all niggaz
Sit there(Niggaz best list)
Pay attention(pay attention)

All y'all niggaz to me is like new to this
I been doing shows
And I been living on the road
What y'all wanna know
Is what you can't know
I been burning down pounds of 'dro
Ay yo it's like this
I rep for my clique
Never burn my britches
As a youth
I hustled and I played ball too
I regret,not going all the way
Coulda been in the NBA
Now I'm in the spotlight
Iced out
No way out
And thugged out
Only child, to seed
Nigga need room to breathe
And bud to smoke
This life ain't no joke

Chorus[Ty Knitty]
Only my clique I'ma rep and I die 4
One head watch the other
We goin' ride for
Want another when it's time for
Action, packin', blastin', rappin' yo whatever
(Overlapped by G.O.D. Pt.3's first line)

G.O.D. Pt.3]
Yo
Speak when you spoken to
Otherwise keep your mouth shut
Niggaz is butt
We liver' than fuck
Don't get yourself cut, stalked, stabbed or shanked
Be about bank
Criminal uplink
But niggaz don't think shit stink
Til shit hit the wind blower
Until your man crippled up in the hospital
Fuck, dunn it's over
When we come through
Chuck jewels and things
Blow out your brain
Keep it simple
Sly, keep it movin'
No evidence involved when we do it
First infantry, first unit
My art theraputic
I'm sharp, the god
I tear through your heart
Hear the sound of the 40 cal. bark

Chorus

[Twin Gambino]
I give thanks to the people that's gone
You made me strong
And ready for life out there
You betta prepare
Everywhere you at dunn, you betta watch your back
And stay strapped
Cuz these days niggaz don't know how to act
That shit is wack
Like we on the block sellin' crack
But now I rap and I know God didn't give me this gift
Cuz I put time and dedication to write this shit
You don't wanna see me flip 
Dunn, I'm sick in the head
The reason, because my other half is dead
So when there's drama
I take it to the fullest extreme
Try to blow ya head off
With a M-16
Know what I mean
Comin' from Queens
Where it seems like a dream with thugs
Fake love between each other

Chorus

[Ty Knitty]
