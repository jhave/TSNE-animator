Barrington Levy: 
Unoheal, Unoheal (Rock a bet)
Murderer (4x)

Rakim:
Who want low boats of keys from overseas
Then put it in the streets and spread like a disease
Neighborhoods infected then misdirected
It ain't no cure and it's hard to correct it
Bless by the most high cursed by the lowest
Used to think the quick now thoughts travel the slowest
Close to comatose brain waves rigamortist
You forget the skit the most high tortoise
I remember so they wanna murder RA
Know what I mean because I got knowledge of self
Yeah I know, you probably don't believe me 
But be easy I'm gonna leave it up to Barrington Levy

Barrington Levy:
Who gone test, No man curse
That prejudge end up a hearse, who god bless no man curse
I'm gonna end up in a hearse, because they maskata
Murderer (4x)

Rakim:
Here they come, known bloodsuckers of the poor
Rob us for culture and now they want more
Caution they come in many forms of identity
A lot to suspect so detect the enemy
Worst than a mosquito or a vampire, 
They're not sitting at the movies or a campfire
Huh, yeah, I know you don't believe me, be easy I'm gonna leave it to 
Barrington Levy

Barrington Levy:
They let me tell me that I'm a murderer
Dress up in a jacket, then dress up in a tie
Want to deprive
I'm a murderer
Murderer (4x)
Not them.
Murderer (2x)

Rakim:
Bless by the most high, cursed by the lowest
Used to think the quick now thoughts travel the slowest
Close to comatose, brain waves rigamortist
You forget the skit, the most high tortoise
I remember so they wanna murder RA

Barrington Levy:
Murderer (4x)

Rakim:
Cause I got knowledge of self (4x)

Barrington Levy:
Watch them, watch them, watch them unfold. (5x)
I'm a maskata.
