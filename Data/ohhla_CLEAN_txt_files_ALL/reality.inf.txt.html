[Ty Knitty]
One hand wash the other, I never shit on my niggas
I roll with them niggas that be pulling them triggers
I rep the dead and the living
We the best that did it, expenses we spend it
Big faces explosive guns we smash out dunns
IM3 coming through make way what you wanna do
Choose the fifth or get popped with the fifth
Either way you got no ends, I represent QB
The biggest hood in the world, there's too many of us
It's too easy to get touched
Catch you at a show take your 'dro take your ice
Catch you on the island while you rocking on the mic
Senting kites from down south
Cut that nigga from head to his mouth
He violated in the streets
Fronted like he wanted beef
Now it's a wrap, duke rather hang it up
We the mobb
We ain't no gang but we bang niggas up

[Uno Dos]
Besides rap I blaze niggas up
My ox shit, my mutton chops
Ice pick their guts never gon'(na) stop
All your mans is gonna watch
Free performance on the block
Meantime invest in rocks buy and sell stocks
Uno Dos is papi to connect
With my eyes on your neck
Your jewels extra large like stretch I'll show you my strength
Fiends get their check on the first
Be gone by the second the third they come on stolen shit begging for seconds
I ain't gon' lay for a second
Ain't gon' wait for a second
If it's any beef can get it
Uno Dos don't forget it
I'm chum to menace exclusive
Honorable mention fuck with Knitty, G-O &amp; Twin
Y'all some dead niggas

[Chorus]
Hustle and rob
We Infamous Mobb nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous Mobb nigga
IM3's the squad
Infamous mobb and we won't stop 'til your head goes pop

[G.O.D]
We them original mobb men
Get lead lodged in
We them marksmen you hate
Them thug niggas you love
Find me in my neighborhood pub I'm yacked up bent
Crushing haze and hash until I'm content
I'm a hood nigga for life, it ain't no changing
I'm so damn dangerous, you want I'll make you famous
Take cover when I aim this pistol I'm bucking to hit you
My 41st team all pro official
Nigga I'll kiss you then kill you
No CO-D's just me then beat that body cause you ain't nobody
Been on these cold ass streets living off juice and naughty sleep
You'll be six feet under this concrete

[Blitz]
You and that metal cut them corners you ghetto's left desserted
My origins the projects rebels, steps and murders
My name is the logic connect and vets and burners
If I bang them thanks on this cannon, bet you earned it
Pop up in your zip code aim while I'm loading
Shit and I can let this clip go in the name of this Omen
Leave him holding with my clip grow
Raised on his blowing
Like times in this life of crime, ways never knowing
Contact and touch your body
Trust me I'll be up in that black van no plates rusty shotty
Cause cliques want no drama
With cliques that hold armor
Blitz approach drama from strips to Osama

[Chorus]
Hustle and rob
We Infamous Mobb nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous Mobb nigga
IM3's the squad
Infamous mobb and we won't stop 'til your head goes pop

[Kaos]
It's a potent mixture
Crime fam over infamous beats
Don't get it twisted dunn I spit for the streets
All the baseheads and dope fiends
Little one's that was sold dreams
Gungs with no cribs, dunns with long bids
I spit facts of life, and clap at mics
Turn boosts to crime scenes, who's tougher than my team
Noone and Kaos ain't scared of no gun
I look it eye to eye the dot is ready to die
If you ain't back up, cause the mobb will have you wrapped up
Moms crib clapped up dare a nigga to act up
I done hit the streets with bricks, and get back chips
Now I breathe hits on tracks to shut down cliques
It's deeper than sipping on liqs, and puffing on splifs
You might end up sipping on this chrome four-fifth
Niggas sleep in the hood, get clipped in the hood
And Papi come spitting it good
Don't end up rest in wood

[Gambino]
We got four pound chest naked running through the block
When it's on who really gives a fuck about the cops
When a nigga owe you knots he bound to get drop
Moms crying cause her little son got shot
How come?...He owe me a little cake
And the next nigga that pump for me won't do the same thing
We think long range to get those big ass chains
Big ass cars, gripping those movie stars
Who we are...IM3 reppin' to the death
And you'll never catch a nigga like me wearing a vest
Only toting a tech ready to wet the whole set
Ready to wet the whole set
Cutting your neck, beating you in your head 'til your dead

[Chorus 2X]
Hustle and rob
We Infamous Mobb nigga
That's my word to god
We Infamous Mobb nigga
IM3's the squad
Infamous mobb and we won't stop 'til your head goes pop</pre>
