Typed by: DaSun Akbar

* Contains sample from "I'm Hooked on You" performed by Jeannie Reynolds

"I'm Hooked, I'm hooked"
"I'm stuck to you - just like glue"

Alright, alright, uh-huh
	And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
What time is it?, dawgs sit righ here
Put the kids to bed - tell y'all story
	And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
First worry about my money, you know what..?

[Prodigy]
Its a cash explosion, it's rainin' dollars
We made it to stardom, the new album
The 50-50 joint ventures, it only gets better &amp; better
Might treat myself to a nice Ferrari for the winter
Gave my whole crib up, Do NOT ENTER!
'Cause the nigga inside with the shotty got a temper
And I play it by the book, man; I thought he was a burglar
I'm gettin' off 'cause I served her
You wastin' that broad with that shit they want
More money than any dope man could ever see
Man, Escobar ain't got shit on P
I'm like Trapper John, 'cause I M.D.
And I do surgery on the nigga for free
When it come to that Tae Bo, we gettin' box load
I pop a nigga over my money, man all I know 'em

[Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds]
"I'm stuck to you - just like glue"
"I love it, I love it, I swear I do, aaahhh baby"

Yea that's how that one go you'nah'what'I'mean?
(Live that money right?)
	And I ain't neva let you go, let you go, (No doubt)
And who gon' love the paper man? You gotta love the paper
If you got that much paper you gotta hold it down
	And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
So the next one, you know what that's about, (That's right)

[Prodigy]
My bestest friend, my worstest enemy (That's right)
Y'all could even save my life or be the death of me
Even get me outta drama, or put me in a locker
Y'all gon' have me wind up in that chair with the tires
Stab a nigga like Myers
But I'd rather put fire to your ass like Pryor (Damn!)
'Cause I prefer the iron
Shoot at bitch ass niggaz and do 'em like Bison
I got big jump-off that fit down my pants leg
'Lil jump-offs, your dunn know
A damn thang, niggaz talkin' thug on their song on the radio
But we the reason they fire proofed the Coupes
And we the same reason you brinin' re-enforcements through
You'll neva get me alive my gun is like glue (Come wit it, come wit it)
Shots spread like the flu, do you lungs, do your peoples
I love my heaters, I'm...

[Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds]

Yea, you motha'fuckin' right man, them hammers man, them guns man
	And I ain't neva let you go, let you go
Gotta keep them thangs on you, what you know about that though?
But you know there's one thing a nigga can't live without
	And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone
And it's the bottom line right here

[Prodigy]
You know we like; phatties with size, 'lil cutie pies
With the nightstands walk and bodies that talk
Make niggaz dig deep until they barrel the game
And pull out somethin' that'll definitely gettin' to her brain (Word)
With the perm or the braids (Whatup)
It's all love as long as it curves and it's in right space (It's all good)
With a face that deserves the front page
I got the keys that'll free all birds from their cage (Let's go)
I get pussy like James, its nuttin' to point
Y'all niggaz takin' too long to get to the point (Fo' real)
Y'all chicks makin' me sick, you lookin' so good bitch (God damn)
I gotta have you, enough I can't stop it
Gangsta love, you pretty and thug
She's like the hood nigga only if he's bustin' his gun
Mama you go girl, you keep right on, doin' what you doin'
Keepin' niggaz off


[Chorus Sample: performed by Jeannie Reynolds]
"I'm stuck to you - just like glue"
"I love it, I love it, I swear I do, eww baby"

	And I ain't neva let you go, let you go

	And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone

	And I ain't neva let you go, let you go

	And I ain't neva gon' leave you alone, leave you alone


[Outro: Sample dialogue]
Ok we gotta battle the .9 millimeter heavy duty pistols
West has the carbon 15 .9 millimeter pistol
And I got a mac-10 from Invasion USA
We're gonna have a 'lil race, you read? (Yep)
Ok, bottom two, here we go: *.9 millimeter fired, then the mac-10*
I win</pre>
