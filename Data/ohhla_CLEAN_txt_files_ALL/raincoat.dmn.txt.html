Don't touch the rain without a raincoat

[First Verse]
Now what's up with my homies out there?
Bitches straight carryin' diseases and you don't seem to care
Don't control yourself, yeah, that's what y'all do
Wantin' more cat than my muthafuckin' dogs do
And my dogs want cat like a cat shelter, all in heat
For that piece of meat
I guess it's normal, but this is drastic
Niggas are too damned cheap to buy the rubber that's in the plastic
With the Trojan man sittin' on the box
Here's a joke, they're made for you fertile ass folks
Cuz when you're unprotected and you nut
Nine months later got a gut bout to bust
And you're bitin' your fingernails cuz you can't take care of it
That's why I'm makin' you aware of it
So I'm tellin' you chumps now, you better wack it
Or buy the jacket in a package

Chorus:

This might seem like a scapegoat,
But Domino just wants to let the homies know,
When you're thinkin' about diggin' with a deep stroke,
Don't touch the rain without a raincoat

[Second Verse]
Now where your minds at homies?  Cuz the old days have passed
You need a lot more than a shot in your ass
To cure this shit of today, like gano, syphillis
And that crazy ass murderer
A-I-D, to the S, take a guess
And with a bare dick and you might take a rest
Called forever
Cuz there's no cure for the bitch
Now you, now you out quick
Cuz you tho\ught with your dick
But uh, who's to blame?  Say your name
And I hope it felt good the last time that you came
Cuz bare dicks and clits don't mix unless you're married
And nowadays even that shits hit
Cuz a bitch got a thing about fillin' that hole
So they good for the whole stroll
And she'll fuck your best friend with the quickness
So grab a five spot and buy some business

Chorus (2x)

[Third Verse]
Trick or treat, but it ain't halloween
Talkin' about kitty-kat if you know what I mean
And all you brothers that's thinkin' that you free from it
You better start peepin' it
Before you eatin' it
I know raincoats are cheap and might bust G
But soon as it pops, stop killin' them guts please!
Just because it might feel good, don't mean it's real good
Catch a disease, you'll be lucky if you heal good
And watch hoochies cuz they seem
To let you get 'em pregnant just to tie your ass in
And remember when you met her you was a big spender
Now she takin' money out your ass like a vendin' machine
And this is because she had a little child
And now you so stressed out, you wanna jump in the Nile
But, if you're careless and can't cope here's a term
Throw on a raincoat or keep your sperm in your worm

Chorus (2x)</pre>
