They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom)

Hey y'all, John Coltraine yeah he plays the sax
Me, myself I love to max
Up in the studio laying tracks
Burn it on the CD, melt the wax
And now I'm feeling fine
Cause daily music's on my mind
And I feel mellow
When I watch the girl play the cello
Hello to all my fellow peers in here for the quality
Music quality, yeah
That'll be the focus in the top pick of the day
So pass the peas like we used to say
Pass the beats like they used to say
Pass the phunk like they used to say
That's my joint like we used to say
Syncopation the true school way

[Chorus]

I don't know what you came to do
I came to drop the phunk on you
Depends on that sonic sound
But you know what?
They don't want music [2X]
They just want (a boom, boom, boom boom boom [2X])
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
They don't want music [2X]
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
The good back horn
They don't want music, they don't know how to use it
All they want is (a boom, boom, boom, boom, boom boom boom)

Oo, lala aw wee wee
Nowadays music is all about fee
The soul is caged no bits now free
Unless the rhyme was rocked by me
I got the balls to bang (baw ba-ba-baw, ba-ba-baw, ba-baw bang)
Yeah, steady, just doing my thang (steady, just steady, just doing my own thang)
I just do it (ha!)
I just do it you know
My momma said to do what you know
So I'ma do what I know
James Brown gave me the fluid
That means a baby could do it
The Peas will do it so

Do it, do it, do it
Get up on the stage and release my fluid
Do my thing, do it through the music
Phunkafied and therapeutic

[Chorus]

Wait a minute!
You got to rock with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time) [2X]
You got to roll with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time) [2X]
You got to roll with the phunk (if you wanna be sweet and fine, hey! Hey! Hey!)
Rock with the punk (if you gonna have a good time)
You got to roll with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
A woman that'll phunk your horn now (gimme that phunky horn!)
Play that phunky horn now (gimme that phunky horn)
Gimme that phunky horn now (gimme that phunky horn)
Hey! Hey! Hey!

[Instrumental]

You got to rock with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
You've got to roll with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
You got to dance with the phunk (if you wanna be sweet and fine)
I said I like to dance with the phunk (if you wanna be sweet and fine)
You've got to shake with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)
Shaking shaking shaking with the phunk (if you wanna have a good time)

Gimme that phunky horn (gimme that phunky horn)
I need that phunky horn (I need that phunky horn)
Play that phunky horn now (gimme that phunky horn)
... A break down, a break down, a break, get down

Dance everybody move your body through the music
Get it started, get into it
Come on everybody do it
You've got to dance through the music
People doing what you're doing
People grooving with the music
You've got to roll with the phunk

Roll with your phunk (if you're wanna have a good time)
R-O-double-L keep rolling with the phunk (if you're wanna have a good time)
And roll! To a phunky place
I'm rolling (where?)
To a to a to a phunky phunky place
I'm rolling! To a phunky place
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there..
It's phunky, phunk, phunk, phunk phunky..</pre>
