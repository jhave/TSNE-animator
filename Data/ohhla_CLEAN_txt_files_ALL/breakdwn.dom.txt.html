[Intro: Dom Pachino]
Yeah, I hear you, I hear you
It's tank music, load a cartridge of it
Let me see your warface, yo

[Dom Pachino]
Aiyo, P is for Powerful, R is for the Ruler
I can't be a teacher, boy, don't make me school ya
Even though I got the tools to
T is for the Truth that I speak
Plus the tons of guns that I reach
With the jewels that leak, out the side of my drawers
Like, when the twilight's tweek
E is for Eternity, I can't make an error
I kick down the door and introduce them to the Terror
The R is for Remarkable, plus the kid's ravishing
Spit lyrics with passion in an orderly fashion
Another R, don't make me rip that, chain off your neck
And be rude to, half the game I respect
Give me an R for my Rough childhood
And an O for the Obstacles in my life, in them brick barriers
Another R for the Rocket launchers and the missile carriers
Give me an I for my Identity, I made throughout my years
Give me an S for the Snakes that I face, plus my blood, sweat and Tears
Plus my blood, sweat and Tears

[Chorus 2X: Shyheim]
Spell it out for them, God, P.R. Terrorist
Break it down for them, Killarm' militant
Fill the clips, cop them shits, let 'em rip
Wait for him at the building, spray his whip </pre>
