[Intro: Napoleon Hill]
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
 because it will reveal to you why it is true
 that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve
 regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
 or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focussed and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to the gate
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight~!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
Damn, these niggas that much better than me?
Baby, I don't think this is meant to be
cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said huh
I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
and I'ma get it</pre>
