Too Short:

Say hoe
yeah you
Can I ask you a question
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that
Will you like to make love?

I saw you walking down the street, and I  had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and your so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I wont ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it, don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest resturant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on you're coming off with them panyhose
You want gold, girl whats next
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks
I want it all, Don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't

-girls voice-

Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your weight?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
???? tights and Barbie from the dangerous zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...

-Too $hort-

Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...

-Girls Voice-

Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows your bodacious behavior
I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step you to my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Jealous of  you got some, nigga please your lying
Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...

-Rappin 4 Tay-

I am the rapper that they call 4 tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't body tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
but a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me numb...

-Too $hort-

Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way to real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank hoe
Go get your bank hoe
My little dick'll have you screaming though
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I can't really say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!</pre>
