Wodie!

I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me uptown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me downtown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me in the east, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me across the river, I got them halves and them quarters

Sittin on twenty full of chrome, meet me by the dome
Ain't got no Primeco I got a Nextell phone
I 1000 with the speakers
I got a bag of that rome for the dope fiends and the tweakers
That's why I walk with a limp (a limp)
I got five G's on fourteen gimp
Fast Eddie on the gates, hot boy on the lake
My No Limit tank really cost a hundred K
My empala change six colors
I make music for the thugs and the hustlers
Uhhh!  Big Boz in the six, I'm in the drop top Rolls
Took mama out the projects, put her in a mansion on some marble floors

I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me uptown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me downtown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me in the east, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me across the river, I got them halves and them quarters

[Reginelli]
Rolex watch on my wrist nigga, I'm all crushed out
I got so many diamonds in it it's worth more then my house
And when you see me on the street check the ice on my neck
You see them No Limit soldiers, I ought ta cost nothin but the best
I ain't nothin but 17 and got a million and more
I'm tryin to decide what I'm a buy for showroom floor
I'm a baller, not a stunter and I don't gotta kick
What the sense of lyin for, if you ain't got it go get it

[Master P]
Uhhhh
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me uptown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me downtown, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me in the east, I got them halves and them quarters
I'm not a stunter, I'm a baller
Meet me across the river, I got them halves and them quarters

[C-Murder]

Embezzled on my wrist
Enough to fuck with nigga wife
But don't check me fool you might lose your life
I'm thugged out with a mill in the bank
VIP's in the club, cristile be my drink
Just stole some new rims for the Viper
And fuckin movie stars, bad bitches like Michelle Phiffer
I'm payin taxes like Bill Cosby
I do a show and hit the back door so them hoes won't mob me
I wanna see on ends in the Benz
So I made TRU Records, ask Magic bout my devidends

[Mia X]
I call it how I see it, talk about it and show it
If I say that I did it then I done it, yall know it
Ain't no stuntin round here, nigga we all TRU
Bought two houses and a Benz and I still got ends

All you kittens in the game I'm the mama cat
What you lookin at cause these diamond gonna blind you boo
H players got more cut the shit the dreams done locked up
I got it and you want it but I'm a boss hard bitch so I'm a flaunt it
Started in the projects but I'm a money maker now
I got them haters upset my crib is sitting on an acre what

[Gotti]
