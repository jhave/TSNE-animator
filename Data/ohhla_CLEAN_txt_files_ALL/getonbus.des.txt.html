[Timbaland]
Uhh...Uh...Hey baby - How you?
Why ya face lookin' all sad and blue?
Don't you like the Navigator truck I brought you?
Why you tryin' to act a fool?
Don't try to say you see me talkin' to ya girlfriend
Ask Tonya and Cheryl then give me a place, and time and when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff I'm doin' on the street
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just a average man, tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin'....giiirrrl

[Beyonce]
I don't wanna fuss with you - So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me - Cause boy I am lockin' you out
I don't wanna hear a thang - Nothin' you got to say
You should thank twice about the way you been talkin' to me

[Chorus]
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't time - Talkin' all that stuff
Give back my stuff - Is this what you want?
I don't really care cause there's no more us!
(2x)

Oohh, Oohh

[Kelly]
Ain't got no words for you - So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't ya fault - And why I ain't lettin' you in
Too many times before - I let you back in my life
But this is a new day - And this won't go down tonight

[Chorus]
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't time - Talkin' all that stuff
Give back my stuff - Is this what you want?
I don't really care cause there's no more us!
(2x)

Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh
Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh
Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh
Oohh, Oohh, Oohh, Oohh

[Timbaland]
Say what?...uhh...uhh
Introduce you to Dolce &amp; Gobanna
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you tellin' me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that to tell a man who put you on his team 
That's just like killin' a dream - (No, No baby) - That's how it seems
I work hard to put up what I have of you
I pray to God there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me - There's no need to lie fo'
Why you talkin' wit ya eyes closed?
You don't wanna talk?
Aight yo! Aight yo!

[Timbaland hummin']

[Chorus]
Better catch a cab
Get on the bus
I ain't time - Talkin' all that stuff
Give back my stuff - Is this what you want?
I don't really care cause there's no more us!</pre>
