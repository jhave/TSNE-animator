[Verse 1]
Planet Earth..
Are you there..?
Are you listening?
Are you prepared?
I see mothership connection
Deeper into spritual realms in a dimension
Leavin some battalion, descending from Orion
Travel 'til gone, hear the bust then go
To the next level brought by bass and treble dig with your shovel
Like a fossil find me subterranean, hard like a pebble
In a microscope he's still dope, coat me with your resin
Analyze, suprise! secret weapon's always hidden
I'm fittin' to decompress, yes
Ride to the sur--face, think your best is good
I'm blowin' heat up off my chest
Don't need no bulletproof vest, drop the tec
I'm selectin' my infinite power claim and reign through intellect
Fly on a jumbo jet to Tibet, meet my queen in Benin
All about livin' dreams in a tropical scene
Doin' my pimp walk leanin' to the side
The sky is so wide, I'm feelin' alright, let it ride

[Chorus]
Yo we travel through radio waves, roll and misbehave
We won't stop until we get done
I sit and meditate, let visions formulate
like the Nazarite Sampson
We pray and generate power while cowards get devoured
You bakin' deep in my dark sun

[Verse 2]
Dicin'(?) ice is the nicest
type or size of the knife is, sights like
Samurai souls: Man what the price of your life is?!
I rock for father lifers
Cats wit gats, deadly snipers
Little children ridin' they bicycles
Guerrilla fightas to the rhyme writers
Raft Riders, and math reciters
Cat's holdin' skunk deep off in the blunt wit gingivitis
Ignite yo lighter we takin' you higher, fire yo flame
We won't retire no higher than I'd be a liar
We walk a live wire, in fact he a tiger
passin' out flyer(s) tryin' to get you to come to the gig
Just to admire the rhyme-icidal: it's vital, ill-percussion is bustin'
K-G up on the AHH, 1-2, get busy cousin' with the..
While we buggin' and zonin' until
Six in the mornin we will
Rock and shock elevate non-stop, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Interplanetary vocabulary, peep hypothetical
Notions in an ocean, I'm coastin' on every decible
Amp though, stay low, beneath your radar sensory
Prepositional phrases can jump me to infinity
I spin eternally, non-phsyically: invisibly
True reality is one that naked eye cannot see
In this galaxy I'm pluto, tiny but I'm rude though
Flippin' you up on your back, I attack like Judo *Whaaooo*
Break it down to the atom my long division
is vision of precision of my triple fly blast
A decision that the lord maketh
Taketh away and ?? the will
So I chill, crack my seventh seal, thankin' you forreal
Cuz you feel "we" with purpose
Shinin' in a light
We proceed to ignite the mic to shine bright, yo</pre>
