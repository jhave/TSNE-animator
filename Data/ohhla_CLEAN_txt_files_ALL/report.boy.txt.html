[Intro: Soulja Boy]
Man I just got my report card today mayne
I looked at it man I had all F's on it
I took it back to the teacher and told her throw some D's on it
LIKE THAT! Soulja Boy up in the building (throw some D's on that-on that)
I just got my report card (throw some D's on that-on that)
I just got my report card (throw some D's on that-on that)
AYYYYY~!

[Chorus: Soulja Boy]
Soulja Boy chillin dog, just got my report card
Looked at it, all F's, took it to the teacher desk
(Throw some D's on that-on that) I just got my report card
(Throw some D's on that-on that) I just got my report card
AYYYYY~! (Throw some D's.. throw some D's-throw some D's)
(Throw some-throw some D's-throw some D's) I just got my report card
(Throw some D's-throw some D's)
(Throw some-throw some D's-throw some D's) I took it to the teacher desk
(Throw some D's-throw some D's, throw some-throw some D's-throw some D's)
(Throw some D's-throw some D's, throw some-throw some D's on that-on that)

[Verse One: Soulja Boy]
Sittin up in the classroom, she gettin on my nerves
The teacher talin 'bout, "Soulja Boy do yo' work"
She talkin 'bout adjectives, pronouns, and verbs
I'm knocked out, I ain't hearin nuttin the class heard
I'm daydreamin hard bout that Stacks on Deck
But I don't know how I'm gon' pass my next test
I got my 'port card, I'm like what the hell is this
I took it back to the teacher and then I told her

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Arab]
I always be in school but I be walkin halls
A lot of teachers give me tests, but they be super hard
I get into some trouble then my momma calls
But after I get out the office I'ma tell 'em all that I'ma superstar
And that's best
Everytime you see me up in class my head on the desk
And when you see me on them girls you know that I'm superfresh
Yeah teachers, students
Class, stupid (AYYYYY~!)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Soulja Boy]
I just got my report card, I just got my report card
I just got my report card, I just got my report card
Throw some D's on that-on that! Throw some D's on that-on that!
Throw some D's on that-on that! Throw some D's on that-on that!
I got a 47 up in math, a 67 in english
A 14 in science, man what the heck they thinkin?
Throw some D's on that-on that! Throw some D's on that-on that!
Throw some D's on that-on that! Throw some D's on that-on that!
AYYYYY~!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Throw some D's on that-on that! {*4X*}
Throw some D's-throw some D's, throw some-throw some D's on that-on that</pre>
