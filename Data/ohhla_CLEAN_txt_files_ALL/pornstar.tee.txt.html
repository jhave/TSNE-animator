[Intro]
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Damn shawty, look at you
I'm sayin man, is it just me
Or do you have too much ass in them jeans?
Come here

[Verse 1]
Ay, I been watchin you awhile now
And  I just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushin?
Forget about them other guys now
I know you ain't goin try and tell me that you shy now
I realize that your beauty could intimidate
Them suckas you aint got no business wit'em anyway
Wit such a pretty face, big booty, lil waist line
I wanna grind from behind to the baseline
Have a great time, pour yourself a shot girl
Chase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you probably use to dealin with them wannabes
But honestly I gotta say I'm who they wanna be
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave?
I can guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind we can try'em tonight

[Chorus]
We're sittin here
 (I'm lookin at you like damn)
We're sippin on Patrón, something's on my mind 
(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)
It's been killin me all night long  and I wonder
(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
Ooo girl, I wonder
 (For real, shawty  let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
It's the end of the night
I thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar
Park the car, turn into porn star

[Verse 2]
Yes, I love to hear about your interest
I gotta say your intellect got me impressed        
See your panties through your dress like a shilouette
Patrón got me thinkin sex, is you feelin that?
No  disrespect though, a simple yes/no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go              
Pull up  to the crib, get you through the threshold
Kiss you from your pretty lips to your red toes
Time tickin it's the end of the night
And you can leave wit your friend if you like
But I'm sayin though
We can ride out, back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I'm in you ain't gonna want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gonna wanna try it out
A lil more of this will losen you up
What we can't do in the club, we can do in the truck

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey would ya, stay?
Could ya play wit it with your tongue just a lil?
You're such a sexy individual, physical and mental
And if you sentimental
Shouldn't the rules bend a little
Let me start at the top, stop in the middle
Use a popsicle make shiver, giggle when it tickle
I can talk to you dirty if you like that
I finish one set of blunts start back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you a grown woman not a lil girl
You can blame it on the Patrón or the champagne
But sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now

[Chorus] - Repeat 2x</pre>
