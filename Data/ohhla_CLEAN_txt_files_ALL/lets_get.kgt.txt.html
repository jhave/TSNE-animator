Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down

[King Tee]
Huh, for your convenience I'm fully equipped with the madness
Plus I bring joy to the sadness
Mr. Insane chose to bring the noise
I flex out the best out, and I brought my boys
for the function, wait bring the pumps and the bumps in
Niggaz wanna trip I got pumps in my trunk then
I rule all I survey, bust a move
Ain't nothin changed but the god damn groove
I bring forth fat shit on the money
Homies wanna trip but I'm chillin with the honies
My girl (?) and Nikki Nicole, gets papes
I brought Sable just for old time's sake
The real ruler wrecks records, I mean wrecks wombs
But now I got the psychadelic tune
I dedicate this to my true black sisters
Niggaz bump this while they rollin on them twisters

[singers]
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down

[King Tee]
Yo I told you man I don't play around with the music
I'm funkdafied, blowin up acoustics
I'm rather remarkable when I kick the matter
Skilled in the field of rough grammar
I electrify and intoxicate the moment
I branch out and crush my opponent
It's +Super Nigga+ in the skies, wild mannered
Reportin on the sound, you got to gets down
like I toldja, and peep you can write it in your book
Cause, yo - that's that shit with that Soul Train hook, yeah
The blackness gets stronger, the soul gets deep
Make room for the Alkaholik Sheik
I persist to be the infinite all-time great
I'm told that my name gained weight
since the past, so hell, let me take it on the blast
Yo yo, pass the rug before I bust my ass

[singers]
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down

[King Tee]
Hey nig bust the funk, I feel somethin comin
+Tales From the Crypt+ or I might just be buggin
No propoganda, I stand outstander
A +OutKast+, like them kids from Atlanta
I perform microphone exorcism on rappers
I cast out the demon from them bastards
And oh Nikke, you did the track, what's the plan?
Step to the mic and show these hookers how to slam

[Nikke Nicole]
Flash for a style, Nikke is the picture
Open as I enter, I'd like to send a
track that's fat, constant non-stoppin
From Brooklyn to Compton, my shit is stompin
.. I like to parlay on the Ave
Every now and then smoke a blunt, sip a Heineken
I know a King named Tee, Tha Alkaholik
"I can rock a rhyme no matter how you call it"
Produce hits from the bassment
I make loops, if they're used, I replace 'em
Nikke Nicole, the soul sound, bring the whole crew
We can all get down..

[singers]
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
Let's get it onnnnn.. it's time to get down
