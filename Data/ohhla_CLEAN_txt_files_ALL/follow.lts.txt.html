Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Jamie Madrox]
We print then press, they copy
Like Xerox machine stopping
Like mindless machines drop it
Put us down find unknown topic
You're wicked, you're so bloody
Don't stop there bleed all our money
You'll think they're all just dummies
I don't find it one bit funny

[Monoxide Child]
Transcripts, hidden in advancement
Last kick check finding my Atlantis
Can't miss, give to something to back-whip
But I'm throwing something nobody could have imagined
Magnified by inter-twining eyes
Who patronize my likeness and pray for my demise
I despise anyone who decides to live a life of fakeness
Imitating the greatest

[Chorus]
They all are so far behind
You can't duplicate one of a kind
We're so ahead of our time
Follow our lead into the spiral (ahead of our time) [x3]

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
We in the pole position,
While you studying composition
The competition got me blueprints to see what's missing
Like a game of Simon Says but I never said Simon
Splash a little paint in their face and start rhyming
You're definition of them see, is most crafty
And lie up on my latest CDs so you can jack me
I'm not the hero, I'm the one you all hate
Resinned and recapture everything that you emulate

[Violent J]
When I drop bombs, I'm kept away
My spit burns flesh like pepper spray
You're scalp and your skull will separate
The opaque brotherhood, five all time greats
Follow the leader, if you can fit in
Don't dabble with black magic, it ain't pretend
Put your Ouija away, you don't know what to do
There's a lot of evil on the other side walking through

[Chorus]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Between us and them we lead, you all following
'Cause you all know that you all fake like some collagen
Come again, poison I be swallowing,
And becoming immune because we're building up a tolerance
No apologies, we meant that shit
Dark lotus represent and protect the blueprint
So if you follow I'm gonna lead you astray
And hope you copy cats die every time the song plays

[Chorus]
