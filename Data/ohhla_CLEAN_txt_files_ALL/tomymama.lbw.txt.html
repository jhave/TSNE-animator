Haha, yeah, this song right here

(Thank you for loving me)
My mother
(And thank you for holding me down)
Theresa
(I know that you care for me)
Renee
(Cause you always been around)
Sing it
(Thank you for loving me)
Ma this song right here is for you
(Wanna thank you for holding me down)
Haha, all the love you showed me
(I know that you care for me)
I'm a give it right back to you, let's go
(Cause you've always been around)

[Chorus - Amerie] (Bow Wow) - 2X
All of the things you do (yeah)
I can never repay you (uh huh)
I can't imagine life without you
(My mama, my road dog)

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
Anything you need from me, mom you know that it's yours
You're the only woman in my life that I adore
I remember back in the days when we couldn't get much
TV's wasn't comin and the floor was tore up
Now you juggle three jobs just to take care of me
Yo baby boy, Bow Weezy
Late night shifts, daytime to the AM
Comin home late, there was my best friend
My soulmate, yes my big brother
The one who tucked me in, put me under the covers
When I had nightmares, you came right away
Read me bedtime stories and chased them away
My beautiful black queen, my everything
The one that keeps this heart pumpin everyday
I'm a young man now, but my plan
is to show you that I really understand
Mom, I love you

[Chorus] - 2X (without the "yeah" and "uh huh" from Bow Wow)

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Look at you now, you sittin up on top of the world
Got a X5 and a Benz just to swerve
Got ya dream house now, sittin on big land
Big money, big jewels, big game plan
You told me one day I would make it this far
Have God in my life and I'm gonna be the star
I did it, well, look where we at
Don't have to worry 'bout past due bills and all that
Don't have to worry 'bout them bill collectors all on your back
Don't worry, if you ain't got it, I got your back
Don't even worry 'bout you workin 3 jobs real late
Don't have to worry when you have no food to put on the plate
Back then, I didn't understand but I do now
I look back and I reminisce on how it all went down
Went from bad to good, from frowns to smiles
Mom I really love you, understand now
I love you

[Chorus] - 2X (without the "yeah" and "uh huh" from Bow Wow)

[Break - Amerie] (Bow Wow)
Thank you for loving me (say what now)
Thank you for holding me down (say what now)
I know that you care for me (sing that)
Cause you've always been around (kick it back and)
Thank you for loving me (say what now)
Thank you for holding me down (say what now)
All that you care for me (say what)
Cause you've always been around (drop the beat back)

[Bow Wow] (Amerie)
Yo (yeah, ah)
This song right here is dedicated to my mother (and ohh)
And all the mothers out there (oh oh ooh)
Every mother (yeah)
All the single mothers out there workin hard (oh oh yeah)
Just keep ya head up (oh)
And we gonna do it like this for all the mothers now (oh oh oh ooh)
All the mothers rock, rock, rock on, uh (ooh)
All the mothers rock, rock, rock on, uh (ooh)
If you with me, rock, rock, rock on, uh (ooh)
