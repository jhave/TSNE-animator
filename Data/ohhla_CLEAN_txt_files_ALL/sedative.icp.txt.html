[Verse - Violent J]
I like to suffocate people and bite their necks
They got me in a place that ain't like the rest
And all you gotta do is try to go for the neck
And it's sedatives...sedatives...like that
Slow down, color smear all around
Weird sounds, you in the mind of a clown
And a wicked one somehow spinnin' around
Wheel me down the hallway, arms strapped down
With sedatives.

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Hangin' all out the neck from the IV
Sedatives for the lively
Study me, ask me, no answer
I'm cuttin' your neck first chance sir

[Violent J]
White walls, white floor, small rooms
After sedatives, they become ballrooms
Crows fly by my window slow
Headed that way but lookin' at me though

Sedatives.
Sedatives.
Sedative me.
Sedatives.
Sedative me.
Sedatives.
Sedatives.
Sedatives.

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm an accident, human malfunction at best
And I'm lookin' at a scalpel diggin' into your chest
If I could only move, but them sedatives
You know they saving your life, them sedatives
Some of these other patients are strong as hell
Suffocating one creep took me long as hell
But I took his sedatives, well I thought they were sedatives
But they were only medatives.

[Violent J]
I fake pain, call 'em over and play dead
And yank a fistful of hair out the nurse lady's head
High on sedatives again, put me in a tiny place
Chin strap muzzle over my face
I threw a guy off the roof first day they admitted me
I was sedated, and that's when it hit me
The only time I'm at peace is when I ain't even there
God tell me, why the fuck am I here?

[Verse - Violent J]
I want a lobotomy, no shock therapy
Come clean me nurse, take care of me
I suffocated the last 2 they sent in alone
They had to stick me in the chest with a shot of methadone
Recreation time, wheel me to the courtyard
Four guards in white and they might be important
And the sky is blue and I can watch trees grow
Watch leaves flow, enjoy the sedative show

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Well I even have my very own room these days
White straight jacket, padded walls and PJ's
But there's so many ways and every stunt I pull
I even slammed my own mouth down on the toilet bowl
For attention? maybe, not to mention a sedative
Heard one guy say "why even let it live?"
There's probably no sedatives in Hell
And that's the only reason I'm alive still!

[Violent J]
The Witch is everywhere and I can see that y'all
Stabbed one nurse in the neck with a straw
A plastic straw, yet flimsy and weak
But if you cork it with your thumb and hold it right..FREEEK!</pre>
