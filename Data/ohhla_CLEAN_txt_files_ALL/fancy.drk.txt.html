[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Go, ah go 'head
Ah go, go, ah go 'head
Ah go, go, go-go-go, go 'head
Ah go, go, go-go-go, ah go 'head

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz w/ Mary J. Blige singing along]
Oh you fancy huh? Oh you fancy huh?
Oh you fancy huh? Oh you fancy huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did
N-n-nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh you fancy huh? Oh you fancy huh?
You, you fancy huh? Oh you fancy huh?
Nail done, hair done, everything did
N-n-nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh you fancy huh?

[Drake]
Uhh...
You gettin ready so I know we gon' be here a while
In the bathroom, flat irons and nail files
Spendin hours in salons on your hairstyle
And in the mall, steady rackin up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scale, stare at the number
You say you droppin ten pounds preparin for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fuckin coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Sup girl? Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold diggin bitches in here
They get a baller, think that they ain't gotta pick a career
Guess they plan on suckin dicks until some millions appear
Like voila - you do it right he just might buy you a car
Man she play these suckas just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are, with your girls havin drinks at the bar
I say I'm buyin, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&amp;B singer
Naked ring finger (check) M3 Beamer (check)
Champagne Range, triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&amp;G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezies
who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti
You fancy, huh?

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hatin on you with they friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big, uh
Nail done, hair done, everything big
And my N.Y. girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hatin on you with they friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big, uh
Nail done, hair done, everything big and my
And my L.A. girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hatin on you with they friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
And my T.O. girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hatin on you with they friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nail done, hair done, nail done, hair done

[Swizz Beatz]
Said go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, showtime
Go, go, go, go - as (as) we (we) pro-ceed!

[Drake]
Uhh, 5-and-a-half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it, is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never, but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shoutout to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
a little somethin extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

[Chorus]

[MJB] You fancy...</pre>
