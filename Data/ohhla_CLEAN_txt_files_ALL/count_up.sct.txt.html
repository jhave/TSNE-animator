Song:   Count Up
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Everybody count up
Street niggas count up
Bad bitches count up
Young niggas count up
Count up, count up
Count up, count up
Free bail, count up
Free squat, count up
Black amigo count up
For six count up
All I do is count, all I do is count
All I do is count, all I do is count

[Verse 1]
All I do is count money all day
Used to come in Monday, now they come in everyday
Drug lords are bail, different up the hallway
Your whole year's bad, I count that shit up everyday
I don't fuck with most rappers, you know half them niggas gay
I was born in Carolina, but my friends couldn't tell any
Fuck a hater counter, for gianos mounter
You ain't worth a half of me and don't you stay around us
Niggas, real niggas OGs around me
Have a lot of bad bitches to stay on my feet
I had a couple blunts, hit the street lottery
The definition of free base, nigga B&amp;G

[Chorus]
Everybody count up
Street niggas count up
Bad bitches count up
Young niggas count up
Count up, count up
Count up, count up
Free bail, count up
Free squat, count up
Black amigo count up
For six count up
All I do is count, all I do is count
All I do is count, all I do is count

[Verse 2]
All I do is count, got racks on me right now
Hope you'll get money, you're broke ain't around
Got dirty stuff in their deems, trip over my lane
Sleep walking the bitch, but I feel a lot of them Pringles
I got bands all over my back seat
Don't play them with the back street
Fuck a nigga who'll try me
I fry that with hot wing
Lay down with the paper, nigga, count up
Fall by these haters, nigga, mount up
By dollar sign I got tunnel vision, can't see you
And now you're out for it, you can't if you ain't me
Riding it and we're wild, tell a nigga we hire him

[Chorus]
Everybody count up
Street niggas count up
Bad bitches count up
Young niggas count up
Count up, count up
Count up, count up
Free bail, count up
Free squat, count up
Black amigo count up
For six count up
All I do is count, all I do is count
All I do is count, all I do is count</pre>
