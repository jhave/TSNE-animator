So I'm walkin on water {*4X*}

[Lecrae]
Yeah, go 'head, ask me how I do it, bruh
The sky falling, but I'm still flyin through-and-through
Hey this ain't willpower, it's wheel power
When God's at the wheel, yeah that's the real power
I feel power, so I'm gon trust that
That's how I persevere, that's how I jump back
The hurricanes never go away
So I'm a stand firm, tell 'em all to blow away

[Chorus]
I bet 'cha never see me with my head hung low
I bet 'cha never see me with my eyes to the floor
I bet the boys skit, homie they ain't no more
Ain't no lookin back, letting everything go
When I see a problem, when it get tough
I don't get soft, man, I ain't givin up
There ain't turnin back, man, I will stay strong
It's time to go hard or it's time to go home
So I'm walkin on water, hey [x4]

[Lecrae]
I know it's all good, when it's all bad
There's somethin workin in me
Hey what 'ya call that?
Some people call it perseverance
Some people say endurance
But I know for sure it
It's got me secure
Yeah, I got faith, that's why I hold on
'Cause I'm an alien, I'm 'bout to phone home
I'll be long gone, see you hard times
Have your boy, love peace, and a sound mind

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I spit the Word any time you hear ya boy flowin'
So please plagerize me, take my word for it
Hey I'm Lecrae, but you can call me "Crayola"
Not because I'm in the kitchen whippin up the soda
But because I'm here to paint a vivid picture for 'ya
I know the truth's hittin by the way I pitch it for 'ya
You're fightin for attention, I've got the riddlin'
I've got the hope, boy, I'm the middle-man
Let me show you my Supply, yeah you need to know 'em
He got me walking on the water when the wind's blowin'
And when the storm's brewin', and when the tide's high
That's when I lean into the truth that I abide by

[Chorus]</pre>
