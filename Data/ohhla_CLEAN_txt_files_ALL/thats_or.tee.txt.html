Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus One: T.I.]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote
The streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin new, I seen it all befo'
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Interlude: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

[T.I.]
Yeah, ay
It's stupid how I go in knowin everybody knowin
that I'm sewin up the game, destroyin life, they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join
Others sworn under oath or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get cut, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On a fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at, nigga wishin they was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on; I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin primetime
Thought you niggaz been known, ain't no blockin my shine
Like my new Air Yeezy's you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin life, you check-to-check recitin rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind, mind, mind

[Chorus One]

[Eminem]
Man Tip told me on this hoe tip, best tip I can give you 
to hip you is never to let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig a hole, take this shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns like double stick, it's you
But fuck it Tip, it's cool - I'm chillin like a villain
like The Penguin in his fuckin igloo eatin fudgescicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love wit'chu
'Fore I tie a fuckin knot I'd tie you in one, bitch you
think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin dumb is you?
I'll give you some lumps, 'fore I split some lump sums wit'chu
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it it's official so blow the whistle
I got a trust issue, there's a bombshell, SCUD missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin stud, slut this'll
teach you not to come drunk stumblin my way, for shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slots check stub bizzle
So fuck Sizzlers, these checkers'll bust like a BLOOD blister!

[Chorus Two: Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
I don't ever know where I'm finna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[T.I.]
The credit rollin, curtain closin, movie over with (that's it)
But don't get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch, but she know I'm rich (I'm rich)
That's why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, dividend got it pourin in
Peso, euro, yen - ah-ha I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in, anythang, wearin any chain
Never gon' see me totin anythang, all you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level but you niggaz still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finished, sorry bro this where we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

[Eminem]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip? And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankerchief
I'm givin these hoes a dose of they own medicine, let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didn't
This shit's so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin it; double timin it
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
to catch on, while you strong-arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it dawg
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&amp;W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg

[Chorus Three: Eminem] + (T.I.)
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
(I bet they knew as soon as they saw me)
(Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote)
I roll like a desperado
And I don't ever know where I'm gonna go
(But still I ball like there's no tomorrow)
(Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote)
