Except im a rebel, on another level

No they aint ready to talk to you
Im gonna let these cats know man
Yo, listen here

Relay on movin home grown pies
Rather dies than to see it

Smashing everything from the game 
to that freak hoes fives

Nigga jumps across the webs, the Wilson, Grand Jev, Metro long, Polo
grounds, Saint Knick, Manhatten and we run New York

Yall want to know my style basically
Im a thorough nigga named B. Bubblin

and i demand respect
Change the Harlem Vet. from Foster, Lincoln, Whillen Projects across

to the depth witty, F had the West Indies
Im odin it right so my chicken head dog can rest with me
Most cats is unworthy
and you can find me if you wanted to on 1st Ave.
In gold Tim's and Yankee jersey
