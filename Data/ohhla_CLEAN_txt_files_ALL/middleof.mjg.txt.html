Ahh yeah mic check 1, 2
Eightball and MJG space-age forever

[Eightball]
It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog wanna hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really wanna hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really wanna hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here
In the middle of the night

[MJG]
I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she wanna romance, did she wanna hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

[Hook]

[MJG]
I'm on late night mission top let down
That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I wanna take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight
