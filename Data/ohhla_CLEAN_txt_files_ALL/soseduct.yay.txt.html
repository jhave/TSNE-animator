Aww nigga do you
know what this is
1 shot, 1 kill, whats the deal
G-UNIT! (HERE WE GO NOW!)

[Verse 1- Tony Yayo]
Aww nigga do you
know who you wit
It's tony yayo
up in this bitch
got them german lugers
wit them hollow tips
2 shot rugers
wit them extra clips

[Verse 2- 50 Cent]
50 cent, back on that gangsta shit
on my way, OT to flip them bricks
in that big, body benz you know its a 6
Got your bitch on my dick, I stack them chips
And I'm flash as a fuck my jewels are sick
from a block away you can see the kid
don't front, muthafucka you know my style
I don't go nowhere without my .40 cal
on the low, shawty got a thang for the kid
and ya know, I'm finna take her back to the crib
here we go, imma show her how a playa live
at the door, I tell her take her clothes off...shiiit

[Chorus, 1x 50 cent, 1x tony yayo]
Shorty so seductive dancing on me
The way that she move is making me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'ma turn her over and tell her lets do it again

[Verse 3- Tony Yayo]
I put the g in g-unit
baby I got game
any more good to go
and I dunno your name
is it the wheels on the hot car
meals from the shot bar
or you just wanna quickie with a rap star
ladies tell the truth, you know I'm cute
but what really turns you on is the rims on my coupe
before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
going to the tele and your getting popped off
I can't stop thinking of the things you do
when you freakin me and I'm freaking you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorties stick
baby let me fly you in my whip
stop, slow down baby
if you hear this in the club shake it go down baby
It's past my curfew but parole don't know
tear up the club, don't call my PO

[Chorus, 1x 50 cent, 1x tony yayo]
Shorty so seductive dancing on me
The way that she move is making me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'ma turn her over and tell her lets do it again

[Verse 4- Tony Yayo]
my waves keep spinning, my charm get major women
you know them black and them white and them asian women
lets cut the small talk, you know why I wrote you
I can't stand with a dime thats anti-social
gucci lip gloss, luios vuitton, and them boots from beneto vinetto cost her arm
yayos a don, my car european
you got mirrors in your pants cause I see me in them
listen, I piss out cris, inhale haze
in the mary eye gear laid all day
tattos, and piercings and rings in your tongue
shorty things like that will make my black ass comfortable
I need groupie love, the coupe on dubs
I'm in this club with a tre pound snub
don't blame it on david I'm all iced out
50 got me rich so the bars priced out

[Chorus, 1x 50 cent, 1x tony yayo]
Shorty so seductive dancing on me
The way that she move is making me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'ma turn her over and tell her lets do it again</pre>
