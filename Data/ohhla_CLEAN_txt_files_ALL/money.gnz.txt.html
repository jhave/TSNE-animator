Verse 1 *(Gonzoe)*

We in this for the cash right here
feel this here
this my year
year of years
khakis to Cordiers
they hittin me up nigga
now I juss stare
ice up
smash out
hittin no fear
on the same spot I cracked up
my first 5 dollars
same steez-aline, now wit out the poppin collars
everything bubbled out
dash board, pull it out
girls in the backseat runnin they mouth
switch up, shut up
kiss my boo before she nut up
spittin it all juss tryin to get some cut up
floatin
somebody rollin a blunt
somebody chokin
somebody pass the blunt
constantly smokin
the life, of a young tycoon
roll up green
pop X and lace 'em
an this life I lead I ain't set
if I ain't got a whip wit a grip or the woman I slip.
Come on.

Chorus *(Val Young &amp; Gonzoe)*

(Come on, come on)
Money, Money, Money!
(Westside! Eastside!)
Don't you know that we.... need the paper?
(get it, get it, come on)

(Ritzy, Yukmeez)

Verse 2 *(Yukmouth)*

my wounds can't heal fool
my world too real fo dolla bills.
