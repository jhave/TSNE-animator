[Eminem] + (Royce)
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God if you're listenin
Please give me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreamin, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm comin off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want (I just wanna be the illest MC)
That's all I want (the same time bein as real as can be)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G. Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt, Redman
I am cut from that cloth, write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, "I'm Bad" video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
while they smoked and drink, symphony, D.O.C.
Inspired me to write what, would eventually put me on +Airplanes+ like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history but hats off
When we rap as Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank GOD for the one-two cadence
Thank GOD for the lunchroom tables
I'm tryin to be the sickest nigga dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short it's been one hell of a ride
"Chronic" 1 and 2
Lookin up at the sky at the sun, up until the day the sun is you
You're listenin to hip-hop
You in Jay house, Wayne house, Nas house, Em house (our house)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You might find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

[Joell Ortiz]
When I was a lil' boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snappin pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter-chatter
It started off wack, but in the words of a 10-year old my shit was gettin phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowin how the booth would feel, what's a DATs and 2-inch reels?
How you ad lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike, y'all made a monster
Now every day's a game of +Contra+, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm tellin you
Cause anyone can get dusted long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggaz soundin, DAMN!
Weak head, y'all suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life so wipe your feet before you step in (our house)

[Chorus]

[Eminem] + (Joe Budden)
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God if you're listenin
Please give me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreamin, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm comin off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want (I just wan' be the illest MC)
That's all I want (same time bein as real as can be)

[Crooked I]
Yo, in my house the lights out, no utilities in this facility
Feelin my life's 'bout, to wipe out, these feelings I'm feelin be killin me
I pull a mic out, can't strike out, cause if winnin is really my enemy
I'll pull a 9 out, blow my mind out, is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die, get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just +Passes By+
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could fly jets
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is ROUGH, I start feelin like shit's sour
The electricity in my willpower, can still power, the Twin Towers
for ten hours, so send cowards
the message from Crooked I, Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

[Eminem]
In our, house we spittin like six hours, the way I feel now I can spit for six hours
straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in-
-side my head sounds like a fuckin drive-by, that's what the inside of my mind's like
Lookin back on, my career even, hindsight's, tunnel vision, 5 Mics
Never wanted that so bad, feel like I could go mad, nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these hoe bags that bother me but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does, even though you know that there will never come
a day someone blows past you who never was, someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back, what you gonna go back, to workin a regular job?
Fuck that, I'ma go hard grab on my, gonads - tell 'em fuck theyself
They call me a wigger/'weger like Renee Zell' but I, raised hell like a stay-at-home dad!
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, Gang Green when I'm, angry then I'm, Hulk Smash
So much passion but no compassion, if eyes are the window to the soul
then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassin, aight now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stampin Yelawolf, be ready for the most competitive
clique in the world, it's like Clash of the Titans, I release the cracker, it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done none shall ever fuck with the squadron
So come on in at your own risk; this is (our house) bitch!

[Chorus]</pre>
