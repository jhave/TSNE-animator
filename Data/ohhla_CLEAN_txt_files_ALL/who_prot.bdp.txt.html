   Verse
   
   (Fy-ah! Come down fas'...)
   
   You were put here to protect us
   But who protects us from you?
   Every time you say "That's illegal"
   Doesn't mean that that's true (Uh-huh)
   Your authority's never questioned
   No-one questions you
   If I hit you I'll be killed
   But you hit me? I can sue (Order! Order!)
   Lookin' through my history book
   I've watched you as you grew
   Killin' blacks and callin' it the law
   (Bo! Bo! Bo!) And worshipping Jesus too
   There was a time when a black man
   Couldn't be down wit' your crew (Can I have a job please?)
   Now you want all the help you can get
   Scared? Well ain't that true (You goddamn right)
   You were put here to protect us
   But who protects us from you?
   Or should I say, who are you protecting?
   The rich? the poor? Who?
   It seems that when you walk the ghetto
   You walk wit' your own point of view (Look at that gold chain)
   You judge a man by the car he drives
   Or if his hat match his shoe (Yo, you lookin' kinda fresh)
   Well, back in the days of Sherlock Holmes
   A man was judged by a clue
   Now he's judged by if he's Spanish,
   Black, Italian or Jew
   So do not kick my door down and tie me up
   While my wife cooks the stew (You're under arrest!)
   Cos you were put here to protect us
   But who protects us from you?
   
   (A public service announcement brought to you by the scientists of
   Boogie Down Productions. Fy-ah! Come again...)
