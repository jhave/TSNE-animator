Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I could show you how to cook right
Can I show you what a millionaire look like?
Aye let me show you how to cook right
This what a millionaire look like

Young nigga in the hood watchin out for hustle
All these niggas with me, I love em like my brother
I am the struggle, I am the hustle
I am the city, homie proud of me did you
I used to say pin this mouse, this nigga co-dependent
Hard way nigga, I got my meals the hard way
Selling crack, millionaire, I love the smart way
Exit the game and got rich, that's a fade away
Ha-ha, what a millionaire look like?
Yea I can show em how to cook right
Turn a man to a half, turn a brick to a jet
Nigga you do the math, you can aim right
Mixtape doing show for the 40
All I need is one mic and a Glock 40
Tot bomb for the killers who never honor the deal
And then UGK to the ceiling,
Can't describe the feeling

I am in this  fortunate
I am success... fortune live
Mansion life in the crissy
Young niggas with tints
Headshots in the day
Throwin our lives away
I understand her
I come from that land hoe
That's where they would kill a nigga and I was the man hoe
Shots fired, bullets flying
Coming out that lando
Family cryin, say that shit so times, hardcore

Mafia, I grew up when freaks and shit were poppin up
I was hustling, thuggin and keep the cocaine and we're poppin up
I have bricks down, choppas up, it wasn't no nigga real as us
City fuckin with me cause they know a nigga real as fuck
Yea, then the shit got easy
Told my dog I had a million and he didn't believe me
I told him cool, roll a brick, bringing 22 easy
I would live it up and die before I heard about Jeezy
For real

I could show you how to cook right
And what a millionaire look like
Yep I could show you how to cook right
And what a multi-millionaire look like nigga

I Am
I Am

Self-made just like Ross said nigga
You know they gave me shit potna
Relax about me nigga
Man I tell this everyday motherfuckers faded
Yea I got cutt off yo bush
Nigga fuck you talkin bout?
Hah?
Yea
And this that motion picture shit
Maybe I just embarrass a nigga
We ball and flow extreme nigga
Hey!
This meanest shit, non-fiction homie
It feel G my nigga
LA really will pop</pre>
