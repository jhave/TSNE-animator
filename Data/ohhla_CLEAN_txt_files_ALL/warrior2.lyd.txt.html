[Intro: Eminem]
Woo!!! Yeah!!! Remix!!! (50 Cent: Ha Ha!!!)
Lloyd Banks!!! (Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh!!!) Ha Ha!!!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room and he don't want the loot he's in it for the sport
Runnin circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
And you can love and you can hate it
but you can't ignore it, you can't be that ignorant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
He's straight outta a neighborhood where niggaz hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
There stomachs ache while he's loungin in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay, houses with a bigger gate
Houndin him's a big mistake, he won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin hand
Till he was sittin on green like a Celtics fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussin the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em
G-Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stoppin them

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
He's no magician man the kid does something out of nothin
So that nigga's from his hood act like he owes him somethin
They talk crazy till they send niggaz to where to buck him
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say nah it's nothin
He was gonna help 'em out but since they funny fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thuggin
He's rich now he ain't change so niggaz think he buggin
He bulletproof everything cause niggaz try and buck him
Keeps two pistols I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they 'gon get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch you slippin then creepin he start bussin

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doin a hundred twenty in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
I can give you niggaz somethin you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You ain't no G you a fuckin clown
I can take your girl and tu-turn her out
Don't hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckers somethin to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth</pre>
