[Fes Taylor]
My S.I. swagger, I'm kill'n em the best style faster
The shook and touched by a rapper
They thinking it's just music, Like my Nike Airs I just do it
This here life neck and my wrist blue, It's how fish do it
Chef it to the block, My bitches love hard cock
I stuff a quarter of soft right in their twat
My block, I'm like a soldier with fatigues on strapped
With stripes, Like a General leaving for Iraq
My drive, Be successful leaving and then fly back
Hit the road, Yeah we eating, So pieces dived that
Taylor, I was leaning on corners with my back
Up against the wall, Had no choice but fire back
Now, Benz truck with the tires on the back
They was in the Doge Shadow when my tires had a flat
Ohh, Why you hate Fes, Cause I stay fresh
Young black nigga from the hood and you make less

[Hook 4X: Fes Taylor Sample]
Been in the streets, Been-Been-Been in the streets
Been-Been-Been in the streets, Shaolin stomp with Timberland feet

[Inspectah Deck]
Is it the way that my jeans hang over my kicks
When you see me I'll be on the G strolle with my bitch
Skipping towns like I'm owing a grip, Set show em respect
I'm repping alone, I'm home on the strip
Zone with the kids, You feel me cause you know what it is
All you eying from the sideline probing my biz
Hell right now I'm open for biz
And my life style's blowing your wig
How they like wild'n with the kid
Like a nigga fresh home from a bid
Focus on tips, City boy post on the pigs
Focus on his, Supposed to stay close to the ridge
You know anything fucking with a soldier this big
Watch me now son, I'm over the bridge
Type a nigga have his outfit matching with the boat and the crib
Why you talking, Why you open your gibbs
No points for me to open your wig, Nobody know who you is nigga
