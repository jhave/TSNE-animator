[Cam'Ron]
Uh, Coke I get it and gram it
Respect the kids that demand it
Girls be lickin and stickin
Showin me tits like they Janet
Drivin a stick is a standard
When you sit in the porsche
Of Course the wrist is on force
I put the Cris' in of course
(Lets go)
Jump Jump Jump jump, get your rocks and roll
Pumpin on the pump, hit the pump da da doe
Dats the cop call, chow bow down now (squally)
Go in girls ass (ah ah ah)
Be in Huston with Flip
In Memphis with 6
Atlanta T.I
We handle D.I
God damn I be fly
Hi so Cameron D I
Bye from hammers to pies
my tan is a 9
Shit, my man imma grind
Mixed gram or a dime
The phantom of phantoms
My phantom is lime
Outlandish I shine
They aint understandin my rhymes
How I shoot cannons and 9s
Then always vanish in time

When we roll thru we hear
Aiiiiiyo aiite?

Woah, dog we like wow

Ring around the rosies cozy, blaugh blaugh

Stock Market on the cow I condone it
Get whatever will work
Youll get leveled to dirt
We be in the O
Out from jugglin work
For whatever its worth
We be wherever on earth
Gettin them checks on the first
Shit is better than work
Killa

Yes yes, the snub
Hurts like a motherfucker, yes yes it does
