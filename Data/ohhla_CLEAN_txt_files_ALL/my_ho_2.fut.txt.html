Song:   My Ho 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

That's my ho that's yo ho 2
That's my ho {*6X*}
I pissed on her you kissed her you fell in love with her I think I miss her
You took her on a trip I tried to pimp her
I'm cool with her mama and her lil sister

[Chorus]
If that's yo ho that's my ho 2 {*4X*}
She sexy she fine she say she love me
I know she lying we stay fucking from time to time
you could marry her today she still mine

Excuse my lango when I call you ho
but bitch you know I talk like that
get the red bottle turn up on them niggaz
I taught her that get them stacks
and blow yo stacks come and bring that pussy back
if you with him I don't care cause I know where your heart is at
I run my team I run my team on concient
quarter ain't got no time I know you love me
baby she told her boyfriend to buy a new Mercedes
ain't gone drop no name future drive her crazy
we could talk about anything and she gone be there for me
give her a wedding ring and Imma be around eternity
her friends stay hating she could never understand
he treat her real good but he cant make her feel like I can

[Chorus]

She in my call log she in my text messages
he hitting if raw dog I'm skeetin it on her breast
he bought her big bags I fucked her on the dresser
that nigga old news I'm talking Clyde Drexler
she want that new future she want that new scooter
me and her brother jigg together we too cool 
he wont even get wet for you for me she swimming pool
if you don't cut the check she gone be mad with you
I might wanna flex on her I'm talking tycoon
see I got real money and fuck her like a broke goons
and I never paid her but she pay the kids
she may not never forgive me for what I just did

[Chorus]</pre>
