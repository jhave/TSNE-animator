[Chorus - Layzie Bone + Young Noble]
You got some money in ya pocket nigga - that's the shit

[Verse 1 - Young Noble]
Yo pockets full and it's friday - that's the shit

You thought I wouldn't make it, you though I wouldn't rise again
And when we walk up in the spot dogg - that's the shit

bobbin through the grimey streets fillin quarters, takin notes
You know these folks is watchin me, so you know I gots to watch these folks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Young Noble]
A super sack of that sticky green - that's the shit
fuckin with sack gettin plenty green - that's the shit
when Big Hollis on the track nigga - that's the shit
I know at any given time it could come out a hit
when I'm reppin my squad nigga - that's the shit

in the booth spittin truth nigga - that's the shit
when you stick to the rules nigga - that's the shit

[Verse 4 - Layzie Bone]

And I love the game because it love me that's how positive niggaz navigate

You a hustler and you know it couple dollars in ya pocket
