Chorus
Rakeem: I got too many ladies, I got to learn to say no
Woman: Ohh, We Love You Rakeem
Rakeem: I got too many ladies, yo, I got to learn to say no
Woman: Ohh, We Love You Rakeem, Ohh Rakeem

Verse One:
Time is moving slow, life is a drag
This money to make ya, more girls to bag
Fully aware, so I step upon the square
Lookin for what? The cooty and the chair
Flex and I flex on the opposite sex
Hit 'em off quick and step to the next
It's seems I'm a feem for a sex routine
Love to hear them scream
(Woman: Ohh Rakeem)
And my response is "Oh"
Always satisfy them, you know how I flow
But since I'm not lazy, I'm buck wild and crazy
I kiss the bussom, but never eat the daisies
And my ladies love me deeply
Because I'm handsome, charming and freaky
And when they need me, they won't go
And now I'm stuck, I should of said no

Chorus 2:
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: And I love you to
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: Thank you
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: Your far too kind
Woman: Ohh Rakeem
Rakeem: Gosh
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: You feeling mutual love
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: Oh do you?
Woman: Ohh we love you Rakeem
Rakeem: Hmmmmm
Woman: Ohh Rakeem

Verse Two:
When I walk down the block
The girls stop and glock
They hop on my jock
Cause I got mad props
Tall &amp; slim with the brown skin conflection
Half them sweating my love and affection
As I collect them, I must wan't to protect them
Love them deeply, but never disrespect them
I keep a tab on the large amount
But sometimes I find myself losing count
Of Latika, Diane, Lisa
Stephanie, Jackie, Teresa
Sharonda, um um, Veronica
Latasha, Sinthia &amp; Monica
Never the less, you must give respect
To the femine queens that the God selects
I love them all, but even though
I'm rather happy, I should of said no
But yet my ego gets in the way
And always something that I'll never say
I'd just bag them, keep 'em under my wing
Put them in a posse, and et them sing

Chorus 2(Rakeem saying these lines instead)
Do you
Say it again baby
Yes I like it
Come on you can say it louder
Cuz I love you all
Thank you
Rakeem Allah the greatest baby
