[*Welcome to the wonderful world of sex*]

(Masta Ace)
I'm sayin though right after the shows over
tour bus is outside, matter a fact
this club gotta bathroom and a basment
watever, I'll have ya know

(Masta Ace)
I will be delighted to fuck you
Outside, vocal booth, plane, train, automobile or even in the lunch room
Once the period in your private area drys
We could fuck on your kitchen counter like american pie
Where I had to keep the sperm muzzle (uh huh)
I grab your head while your giving it
like I'm bangin it against the turnbuckle
Its my boys turn to to fuck you
There is 8 of them, and you gotta mouth to help
so they could take turns in couples 1, 2 aiiyo 1, 2
Check it, Masta Ace, Punch an Words on the same record
Ladies in the place all I need is a second
A small conversation, before we both naked
And if ya come back to the hotel, I wont go tell I promise
I like to swing my bat like Frank Thomas
And if ya let me get to third base when we alone
Theres a good change I'm gonna try to steal home
Sorry!!

(Punchline)
My games tight when I'm twistin these hoes I dont play
Fuck raw, I keep a hat on like Cool J
I take short strokes to make the sex last
Till they scream "go deep" like they throwin a long pass
You get long dick no cash, pure game
When we fuck, your face wrinkle up like a sharpay
Everyday all day, sex you love it
Are you the type of freak chick that like to fuck in public

(Hook)

(Wordsworth)
Now those are the first couple of verses the one with the show
Aiiyo Ace tell these women what you want them to know

(Masta Ace)
Yo, I can fuck from the morest today, to the gladest night
Have a threesome, with me, my girl and a baddest dike
And not know Ellen DeGenerus, manish type
Im talking about a Jennifer Lopez spanish type
Dont be afraid of the sex capade
Black cats that get fuck, white cats that get laid
You better eat your wheaties, and just rest up
Just incase somebody call you and say "lets fuck"

(Punchline)
I take them (?) your dressed up, sober or X'ed up
Leave chicks fatigue, they gotta rest up
Its messed up, I fuck till I'm burnt out
Forget the hair salon, I'm a sweat your perm out
Im the type to book a hotel room with 5 dikes
And get pussy like everydays my prom night
Punch always rose wit a proper squad
And my hoes stop traffic like crossing guards

(Wordsworth)
You a stranger so execpt sex for filtility
But I'll fuck you and help you collect this ability
18 and over bend your knees to your shoulders
And hurt your bladder, and make it hard for you to pee when your older
On your knees folded, dont need trojans
Deep throat till my scrodum not showin and your teeths broken
It dont matter silcon or real breast
You aint good with filasheo
Watch HBO's real sex

(Hook)
[Masta Ace] Handcuffs tied up -- Yeah I like that
[Wordsworth] Hotel Motel -- Yeah I like that
[Punchline] Blindfold camcorder -- Yeah I like that
[Wordsworth] Between us wont tell -- Yeah I like that
[Masta Ace] Aiyyo ya like that -- You know I like that
[Punchline] Aiyyo ya like that -- You know I like that
[Wordsworth] Aiyyo ya like that -- You know I like that
