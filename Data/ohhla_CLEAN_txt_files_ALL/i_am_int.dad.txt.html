[Diddy]
It only gets stronger (it only gets stronger)
It only gets more intense (it only gets more intense)
All the pressure's on your neck (you feel me, you feel me)
So Bad Boy (so Bad Boy)
I'm richer bitch!
Yeah, yeah

I got a brand new flow man, soul cleansed
Got a brand new soul man
Cause lightning struck my plane's wings and energized my things
Now I'm out lookin for that brass ring
Uhh, New York feel it in they gut
Cause if Jay comin back then the world need Puff
Emotional bond to the game I'm attached
I gave most of you dudes life, now give back (give back)
I'm the man that beefed with a whole coast
Lost my best friend and still see his ghost (c'mon)
Your lawsuit is lost, I walk through courts (uh-huh)
So disrespectful I spit when I talk (woo!)
I recognize niggaz tryin to copy my style
But never been a nigga this fly holdin it down for this long
Nigga I let y'all eat for this long
Now the King's back on the streets crack
I'ma put it on my son's name
I'ma change from the mundane, Monday through Sunday
Lved through the gunplay now I'm in one lane
Fuckin with the white man, gettin on my fun shame
Can't com-plain, fly as I ever been
Half a ounce sniffer, high as I ever been
Never no losses, I'm a winner
The boss of all bosses, I'M THAT NIGGA~!!

It only gets stronger
It only gets more intense
All the pressure's on your neck
You feel me!
So Bad Boy
I'M RICHER BITCH!</pre>
