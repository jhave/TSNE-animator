[Marsha] Go.. get you some
[Q-Tip]  Don't stop, nigga we ain't done, gun it through your fuckin road block

[Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin who told y'all to let a muhfucker back on the block
with the bullshit, see y'all done fucked up now!
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now!
You gotta problem son? Imagine how the club sound
Look and see I'm ready to spark it
Soon as I zoom on my target, muhfucker better roll out the carpet
See the way I comin through, and how I kick in the door
Watch how I coffee grind like never before.. the way I wreck from the door
So immaculate, passionate, when I'm speakin
I'm preachin, all my niggaz out in EVERY HOOD!
You tryin to compete? You better be INCREDIBLY GOOD!
Niggaz you want heat? I figured you would!
That's I waste no time to give it to you niggaz (this time)
And give you all the jewels in (this rhyme), and then I put it down to you all!
I can't get enough of it niggaz, I gotta ex-plore (many)
All of my options, I gotta get me plenty more...

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
A lot of niggaz shit sound dated
I'm like Shaq, franchise player just got traded
to the number one team in the league
See I ain't on J Records, I'm on DRE Records, Aftermath BITCH!
You need to learn 'cause you ain't knowin the half, BITCH!
And while I'm gone I'm puttin dough in the stash, BITCH!
So new and fresh I say it again
So what it do, don't test see I'ma blaze to the end
I'm comin through, so confess you niggaz know who the kid
I'm like a newborn nigga, that's securing a win
(HOT!) So new and so current and they hate this
The streets'll classify me in another level of greatness
I'm here to fix up the game, I'm givin it a facelift
New and improved, watch the way I make the game shift!
Now watch me swing it out the ballpark
I come to shut it down, don't let the war start while I come to get the...
