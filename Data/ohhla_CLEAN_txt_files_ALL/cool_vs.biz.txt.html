[Biz Markie]
I'ma make this brief, like about 30 seconds
My DJ, gets all of his respect in
super crazy blendin, so he can sound groovy
And it can only be the vibe of Cutmaster Cool V
When he cuts the funky record, it sounds so like def
And it can be SMOOTH, from right to left
But now I'ma shut up and step off from the action
It's Cool V give you hits, he do the funky scratchin
Cool V go ahead!

{*Cool V scratches his own name again and "I do damage!"*}

[Biz Markie]
