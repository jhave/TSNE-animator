[Kool Keith]
Yo H, turn on the TV
This guy like here look just like me
Look at everything that he's doing
He is what you call a clone
Look at his wigs, costumes
A whole replacement
He got no shame, look

Look at you copyin my style, actin like you creative
Flauntin your costumes and wigs
With some old fake wannabe French rap junk
My son take it personal, you and me
Ask everybody in your record company how you follow me and swallow me
You got the nerve to get the pace and rap fast, youse a rap ass
Walkin around in clown gear, you come down here
I gave birth to you
Yeah for you to be different ask anybody down South
How you talk with white stuff around your mouth
The nerve of you, with no tight rhymes, I must serve to you
Uncle Tom Buckwheat boy, youse a local town toy
And your man just started rappin yesterday
Y'all didn't even take the test today
Pay your dues and step out of my rap shoes
And tell the truth to John Sallie on NBC News
Uncreative black boy, you whack boy
Actin like you a genius, notice I called you boy

[Chorus]
Copy what you want to, steal my stuff
You can copy this if you want to
Copy what you want to, steal my stuff
You can copy this if you want to
Copy what you want to, steal my stuff

[H-Bomb]
You can flow jock detox Fort Knox sportin Red Sox
Stuff affected my uncle's Red Foxx box
Niggaz, collaborate with cheese on crackers
Jackers with Keith Rock quarterbackin for the Green Bay Packers
Actors, and actresses evacuate the premises
Y'all be out there like them two sisters with nappy hair
and corn row plated tail extenders
Message style is softer than Jill Scott, you don't even have a spot
Kool Keith lookalikes, Dr. Dre clones, memory log
Record companies signin kids that act like Snoop Dogg
Jog, 20 laps forced to cheat on my income tax relax
Beyonce's lookin for her green contacts
Ask, me who I come with, ask me who I know
You checked into Uncle Tom's Cabin with Benz green
At a buck show below prices you don't know what nice is
Don't ask me how much for my leathers and ostriches
You don't know what the price is

[Chorus: repeat 4X with ad libs]
Copy what you want to, steal my stuff
You can copy this if you want to

[Marc Live]
Executive decisions you bit for years, you know you drink beers
You can't change your lifestyle in one year
You crazy, it's hard to rhyme
Bitch jump in the booth like it's party time
I know some kids that died shufflin and tappin
I stopped dancin in '88
I'll start clappin, you just wait
You late and figured out, scientists mixed my formula
A lot of chemists own funky prototypes, you'll never sound like me
Cheap and choppy, you sweatin bullets, workin hard
Pamela said get a job
You slob, we picket your company
With Molotovs, burn down the WB
You get the tin cup, they don't know you!
Monkeys with a box of tunes, jockin now you're just buffoons
They'll replace you soon
Your kids won't be safe at school, ridiculed and ran off campus
No longer famous, you boys remember Amos
Dandy, Michael and Randy, Monica and Brandy
I don't need your two cent Grammy
(You can copy this if you want to)

[Chorus: repeat 4X with ad libs]
Copy what you want to, steal my stuff
You can copy this if you want to

[Outro]
You can copy this all the way
Whoaaaaaaaaaahhhh</pre>
