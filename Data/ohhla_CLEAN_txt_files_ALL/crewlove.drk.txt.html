[The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard, what you botherin me for?
There's a room full of niggaz, what you followin me for?
This ain't no fuckin sing-along, so girl what you singin for?
It's cause we blowin like a C4, got my whole crew blowin like a C4
20 - keep the bar rollin, fake ID's and the trash we goin
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Rain so poisoned, rainbows flowin
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lot of girls, first flight from Poland - why? Cause

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
They lovin the crew

[Drake]
Yeah~! Smokin weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seein my family have it all
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who I'm becomin
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothin
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggaz say yo' lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, then made hi-story
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin
That O.V.O. and XO is everythin you believe in, I know

[Chorus]</pre>
