[La the Darkman]
Stand up guy, with family, shared a pie
To the cops and the judge, always tell a lie
Look 'em dead in the eye, right hand high
For the D.A., get anything, 'fore I fry
Sentence me to die, cuz I live by the oath
Any nigga snitch, stick a sword down his throat
Pills, crack or coke; we hustle it all
Sometimes it seems we ball just to fall
One nigga shouldn't get caught with a brick
Then the next 30 days, feds indict his whole click
That's some homo shit, you worst than a bitch
Sit ya ass on the toilet, everytime you take a piss
Get no realer than this, money orders get sent
To the pen, for my comrades and my friends
Prisoners of war, chose not to crawl
Kept they mouth closed and live by they borgue

[Chorus: sample (La the Darkman)]
Do you remember me? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'm a soldier (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I flip that dime, I commit that crime, nigga)
Do you remember me? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'm a soldier (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(And if I get caught, I'mma do my time, nigga)

[La the Darkman]
I don't fold, nigga, I'm young, but think old
New York, baby, I was raised in the cold
Round mobsters, dealers, pimps and real killas
Power and manipulating people, we the realest
Everywhere broads feel us, to Brook, to Tennessee
I'm like a carpenter, I keep that hammer on me
I push that E., by ten thousand pills
Niggas don't, come straight, with the cash, get killed
No prints, no weapons, no witness, neither
Four A.M., in your bushes, I'm a certified creeper
You a certified sleeper, I came to bring death
Niggas talk beef, that's peace, I'm a chef
Put your ass in a box, like Boyardee
Prepare all black suits, for your family
Like George W. Bush and Operation "Push"
It's La W. Dark, I came to take your heart, nigga

[Chorus]

[Willie the Kid]
Yo, yo, niggas shaking in they boots, I shoot dice and scoop paper
You brought a gauge for this shooting range, then shoot paper
I bought a gauge for this shooting range, a few wakers
My shoe game, champagne and blue bakesters
Back day, it's all about rope chains with anchors
We paid corners til the cops camcorders ganked us
While we never on the phone, niggas Crank Yankers
Then worse than a hater, is a fucking traitor
Embassy, never fold, never tell, fuck rap
We got blue shots and gas for sale, my nigga
Bang bang bang and boom boom boom
You're big dreaming like the Boom Boom Room, I'm real life, nigga
I'm family first, guns and coupes
Willie the Kid, I'm all that, the Sidekick with the blue
Cops gave me amnesia, I ain't no snitch
And I love my niggas, I don't love no bitch</pre>
