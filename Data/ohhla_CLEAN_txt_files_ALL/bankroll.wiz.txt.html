Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star &amp; you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])

(Yeah) See me I was cheifin' on my reefer getting blowed
In my home alone that's when Sledgren hit my phone, he said Wizzle what you doing [?]
I said we should hit the club, I could swing thru &amp; grab Motor cuh you just hit money up
Then I jumped in the shower, took me bout an hr, smoked a blunt of ray then put on my star power
All black Chuck Tays, some Armani frames, 15 carats in my chain bitch I'm heavy in the game
In my truck I'm switching lanes, feel that beat off in my trunk
I'm smokin' Mary Wayne, I speed off to the hood &amp; we gone roll about 10 blunts 'fore I'm ready
I'm spending all this cash up tonite, if you let me

Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star &amp; you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])

(So much fuckin' money I don't know what to do with it. Haha yeahh)

I tap my horn once, I tap again
This nigga must not hear me, I OOOWOOP he let me in
I meet up with my mens, then dip out to the spot
The whole Khalifa gang, 10 cars deep off in the lot
You [?] off in the front, we creepin' thru the back
And we gone blow some stacks, them hoes ain't know how to act
No I.d. I'm underage but far from underpaid
I'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave

(Until I'm sleep off in a grave)

You got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know
Say you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow
Finna pop some bottles, scream I'm thru
Came to shut the club down (club down) so make some room. I'm..

Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star &amp; you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])

(Ohh, it's finna pop off now. Haha, yeahhhhhhh bitch)

Now we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name
He shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang
I'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain
The DJ play my song, I throw my cheese &amp; go insane
And I got what they need, they come &amp; shake it for a boss
These hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost
Sweat comin' out my pores (pores) this Patron got me heated
Security know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded
The hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool
My chain is fuckin' freezey, this shit is kinda cool
And I'm the kind of dude to walk behind ya boo, tell her fuck ya man, I'm the man what you tryna do [?]

Blowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't thing 'cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star &amp; you already know that I'm gettin' bankroll (bankroll [x10])</pre>
