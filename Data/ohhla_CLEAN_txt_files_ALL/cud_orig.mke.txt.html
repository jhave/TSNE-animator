And she can't be my girl {No}
But we do it like it's the end of the world

I make her holla like when momma brought her into the world
Look, I'll let him buy you dinner tonight
Then at the end of the night
You be my dinner tonight

You see, he dark, he always dim in his light
And that girl, wanna shine, I bring her into the light
Voila

         Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you (Yeah)
         We so sexually compatible (Yeah)
         How I thrill myself, like I kill myself
         When I feel myself inside of you (Yeah)
         You can be my cuddy buddy, nibble on my Nutty Buddy
         While we do some freaky things with the lights on
         Touchin' on you while I'm listenin' to T-Pain (Whoa, oh)
         Huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones (Whoa, oh)
         Do it soon as we got in the sack
         Or I could hit it in the back of the 'Llac
