[U-God]
The blade is much colder 
Slaughter house lava shit boiling
Point molten rocky mountain 
Cocky guitian string four star ninja claw to the jaw of course
You know the force the war I bring cut sting 
before I snub nose 'em cement toes them to death 
The core scuff 'em some more 
Then I hose 'em down some more
The braveheart slave 
Whirlwind all in the all I 
Might tip slip or stagger
Yo but I won't fall 
Iron body be my hobby bending you bastards
Bio rhythem fly so now
Blowin' a gasket shell toe
Elbow slow gun ho pro 
Methods of Mayhem mantis
First bury your face in the canvas quick
Then I vanish</pre>
