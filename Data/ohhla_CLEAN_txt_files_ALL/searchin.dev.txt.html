[Dope fiend talking] (Devin)
Yeah, fuckin' weed man. Fuck that weed man
Here try one of these man. Ha
(Fuck is that man?)
I don't know man, I just get high man, I just get fuckin' high
(Shit, I don't want none of that shit man. I'm chillin')
Well ah, I do. I'll take one, I'll take two, I'll take four

[Verse One]
In the forest, in the summer time
I'm hunting, with this gun of mine

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know

{Verse Two]
I'm passed out by the river side
Was it the meth, or the formaldehyde
That had me

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know

[Verse Three]
Another planet, another day goes by
Another one of these, and look how high I fly
Cause I

[Chorus]

Searching, waiting, looking
(For what?)
I don't know
I don't know

[Dope fiend talking]
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, taking these drugs man.
I wouldn't do it if I were you man. Say no to this type of shit.
You won't, you won't, you won't remember.
Oh okay okay, stay off of this shit man. Stick to the weed.
Say no to drugs.

[Devin talking] (Dope fiend)
Damn, you alright home boy?
(I don't know)
Say man, hey where you from man? Where, where you live man?
You gotta go home, where you live?
(I don't know)
Say man you got to get your shit together. What's your name nigga?
(I don't know)
Man, where you goin' man?
(I don't know)
Man, you have to know somethin'. You have to get your ass up
Before the laws come out here man. Get up nigga
Man, to all the kids out there. Say no to drugs man all them pills and shit man
And all that ole'...influence. Man, they try to put on you. Pressure</pre>
