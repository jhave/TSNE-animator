{*laughter*}
Where can I go they don't want me no mo'
Where can I go they don't want me no mo'
What if I plugged a screwdriver up into they guts
Would they mouths be laughin' at me or would they keep 'em shut
I'm running out of options and my patience now is thin
I'm goin' round and round I don't know how to get out or how to get in
Where can I go they don't want me no mo'
Where can I go they don't want me no mo'
What if I bought a gun and shot a slug in they back
Would shit change for the better how would they all react
I'm running out of options and my patience now is thin
I'm racin' round and round can't find the door some fuckin' body let me in
I I I I'm in the madness (lost soul, deep) I'm deep within the madness
I I I I'm in the madness (lost soul, deep) I'm deep within the madness
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own
What if I drive a drive a butcher's knife through the top of your head
Would you invite me to your parties make me your friend
I'm running out of options and my patience now is thin
I'm swingin' round and round I'm up and down and I'm back and fuckin' forth again
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own
What if I swung a bat and cracked your head of your neck
Would you then let me in and show me love and respect
I'm running out of options and my patience now is thin
I'm walkin' round and round in a parkin' lot with a knife and a note and a loaded mach ten
I I I I'm in the madness (lost soul, deep) I'm deep within the madness
I I I I'm in the madness (lost soul, deep) I'm deep within the madness
I I I
I I I
I'm running out of options and my patience now is thin
I'm flippin' round and round and I'm up and down and I'm deep within the madness
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own (I'm deep within the madness)
Where do I stand when I'm all on my own (and back and fuckin' forth again)
I I I I'm in the madness (lost soul, deep) I'm deep within the madness {*4X*}</pre>
