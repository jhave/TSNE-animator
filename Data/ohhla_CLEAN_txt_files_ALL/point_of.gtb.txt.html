(G.B.) (x16)

Scarface:
What if I learn to work your beat 
And fuck with you in the ways that you fuck with me
And underline all y'all downfalls for ya
Catch you fuckin' up and bring the pound down on ya
Infect your neighbborhood with this drug called hate
Ish out your income and control y'all fate
Provide you motherfuckers with this shit that look cool
And price it outta range to keep your ass outta school
You don't work you don't eat you don't eat you don't sleep
And then I got your ass apon these motherfuckin' streets
Poising your own breed turning you from Jesus
Get you out your faith and hit your ass with diseases
And now you can't reproduce there goes your children
Don't worry about you dying slow I'm a get to killin'
And shot up your motherfuckin' dreams fromt he jump
And  hold you in the penitentiary like a punk
But you can't do shit unless a motherfucker tell ya
You ain't a motherfuckin' man niggayous a failure
You wonder why I hate cha and I paint this picture?
Cause the government is fucked up and I ain't that nigga
So you can point the fingers at the motherfuckin' press 
Cause they be feeding me with all the shit that I address
It ain't my motherfuckin' fault niggas ain't learnin'
We in too deep and ain't no returnin'

Willie D:
Willie D is my motherfuckin' name
Lettin' you hoes know is my motherfuckin' game
You got a problem with the way I drop my bloww 
Bring it to the G to the motherfuckin' E to the O
I'm a let you hoes know the deal 
You can't FUCK with Will, Face and Bill
I got niggas fully strapped with lots of nuts
And niggas in the back of ridah trucks 
Do I give a fuck about America? (FUCK NO!)
Call me a patriot bitch I'm a buck yo, ass
Right up your motherfuckin' shit creek
She got some negativity with Willie D
Well then let the bitch be

Scarface:
In the begining motherfuckers pack straps 
Puttin' they eyes on any motherfuckers back
You got out of line they hit your ass with the gat
Let you die where you lay and left your ass for the rats
Thats how it was and I can see it all again motherfuckers goin' crazy
Like they did when I was ten
I'm goin' through the same shit that my daddy went through when he was 22
Now who, the fuck to blame for the condition that we in 
Pursue the game or end up back up off my shit again
It's kind of easy how we make your choice
We go to ghetto tactic labratorites providing ? 
Well anyways that's how I seen it then 
But now I realize white collar criminals had to bring it in 
And now I go against my own kind
With the mentallity that these niggas been after me a long time
And if I'm caught up then I'm OUTTA HERE 
But if you caught up you outta here
And then you wonder what we learned while we've been trapped here
We figured out how to adapt here

Willie D:
Edgar Hoovar I wwish you wasn't dead
So I could put a bullet in your motherfuckin' head
Goddamn faggot motherfuckin' drag queen
I know you put the hit on Martin Luther King
And Fred Hampton, Malcom and the others
You red neck punk motherfucker
Bob Dole keep you motherfuckin' mouth shut
Before a nigga beat your old ass up
Jumpin' on the rap bandwagon ain't helpin' it
You need to be concerned about the motherfuckin' deficit
I'm the type of nigga throw a party when the flag burn 
I'm at the point of no return
