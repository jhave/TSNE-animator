Song:   I Need
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse]
Yo, 100 mill and a warm up to do 8 more
Zimmerman and her honor, hope from the 8th floor
Iâm not guilty your honor, I need this case solved
Tryna make a hit and get more commas than baseball
A beach house offshore to put my moms in it
Audemars offshore with my niggaâs arms in it
Some air play, not sure if you hear a bomb with it
In NY they think why, like nothing wrong with it
My set blessed, awards, fresh dress of course
Letâs dress, 2 door the SS
Yes yes, I run with the best ex
If I had a field leader sheâll be my next ex
All of yall to put the crown on me
Show the city Iâm king and they could count on me
Pour ace for some that had doubt on me
See the face of my son, I know he proud of me

[Chorus]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse]
To see my brothers and sisters richer than me
Never have to hustle a pitcher give it to me
Someday oneâs ice grillin, Iâm like nigga itâs me
Same nigga that was cocaine dealing in building 3
No more pain, insane slangs, we had a lot
A damn shame, we canât change, do that a lot
I need change, G5 plane and grab a yacht
The same chain, Hussein Range that Cali got
The same lane that baby flies Bacardi in
The same mansion Wayne a throw his party in
The world dancing, champagne, who started it?
I need answers, campaign, Iâm marketin
For man DC to be free
Gutter to be home, get rid of that PC
A gun will be 5 years and they still a go squeeze heat
Need yall to spray trains, Ramone and Big Street
Come on

[Chorus]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need

[Verse]
Better apartments, project floors with carpet
Stainless steel kitchens, marble lobbies to walk in
She a hotie Iâm talking, new Ferrari I parked it
All I need is peace, no more bodies in coffins
Blue skies done darken, ground startin to crack
With more water than dolphins, why they startin with crack?
Shit, why I started to trap?
All I needed was God and then I started to rap

[Chorus]
I need sunshine, I need angels, I need
Something good, yeah I need
Them blue skies, I need them old times, I need
Something good, yeah something
I need
