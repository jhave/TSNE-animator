[Chorus]
When the rudebwoy bustin at the buildin (Bone Bone)
Make sure your neck, and ya wrist sparklin (Bone Bone)
Down to your fingers them twinklin (Bone Bone)
When the lights flash everybody blinkin (Bone Bone, Bone Bone)
Just like that, never other season (Bone Bone)
Bust any style, don't need a reason (Bone Bone)
I say ya gwan every time, anywhere (Bone Bone)
Just keep the bar high, seen with me there (Bone Bone, Bone Bone)

[Krayzie Bone]
Now who was that nigga that came back +Ridin Dirty+, stylin murda
With a weapon up under my seat, you creep, indeed you'll meet the burner
Burn baby, burn burn burn, set 'em on fire
And I'm really not near any nigga but see it's whatever whatever, I'm wired
Feel the 12-gauge eruption! Playa hater dead now
No more discussion! Swimmin in his own red now
Empty out your pockets, if it's blingin nigga drop it
Is it pistols, means it's nonsense, that mean murda if I cock it
Mo' murda, mo' murda, redrum
Catch you niggaz slippin and I hit you with this lead, son
Split your fuckin wig and leave you drippin, make you bled some
I'm here to battle if you don't come with a weapon
A lyrical monster, my niggaz are comin to bomb ya
My niggaz'll critically calm ya; the bullets, they enter they calm ya
We steady be ready for drama, I'm willin to bet on my momma
Before we leave this bitch I bet ya show me 'nuff respect, yeah

[Chorus]

[Flesh-N-Bone]
Hauled off from the Hall of Fame
Thorn, that's when you know the real meanin of pain
I wish I could do this plain, but that's impossible 
when there's too many lame hoes runnin around, callin theyself hot
We sharpest as needles, they fake and fraudulent and out of pocket
They gotta stop it, when they got us in shit that not might beast to rock
When I pull out the heat seeker, cock it, rock it; how quickly you forgotten
Props to all of my hustlers holdin it down in them gutter
When them ghetto boys makin up like one of them headed {?}
We servin you niggaz the worst, pass the cup for the minimum
We send it, insert it into 'em, up in they ass like enema
Too many you niggaz act like hoes
It might be more proper to give his ass a douche
And bitch what you gonna do when the 5th Dog let loose?
Rough up the troops, what would you do if they came after you?
Got all my trues, all unified and new - right
Poke out your chest after Flesh, in seconds and you'll get checked
Before I diss ya, split ya, bet you'll show me 'nuff respect

[Chorus]

[Layzie Bone]
I step in this bitch and I got the whole team beamin gleamin
These bitches lookin like they can't believe what the fuck they seein
They jaws droppin and they can't comprehend the fuckin meanin
The realest bosses is back, no bitch, you ain't dreamin
We got 'em fiendin schemin, to get a piece of me and
These Thuggish Ruggish niggaz, that'll keep 'em smokin leanin
We keep it creepin and you know we do it after dark
We hit the heart, and then your temple, that's the mark
You'll leave departed, now why'd you want to start shit?
I monopolized the market, and branded Bone the largest
Fuck marchin nigga we chargin, bargin in, you know the drill
Anybody get in our path, you do the math, I shoot to kill
Feel, where I'm comin from? Bloody murder redrum
Hollow point that dumb-dumb, which one of you niggaz said somethin?
That's what I thought, you don't wanna get checked
I'll leave ya wet, so you better show 'nuff respect

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Crack money, it got me on ringin, ringin
Gotta get that paper, paper long as niggaz breathin
My niggaz and kids and I lock it down like Eden
Trees and roll it up in your tissue, let it seep in
Look at the scrilla, Cleveland Ave. and Livingston
When they blew up the buildin, I was wheelin and dealin
Lord willin, let's pillage the village
They say that Ruthless on fire, burn the fuckin ceilin (hahahaha)
We came in, man we hittin 'em back up, they not feelin him (why?)
They want a rider, kick out, roll up the chronic, chillin
You don't know Bizzy, you need to murder yourself
It's my diamonds and my appraisal, open up yo' nasal
Bone Thug, the label, now give it up to my table
Bitch, talkin shit, or give that bitch a Abel
Rude, what they wanna do? I give a fuck like Clark Gable
Gangsta fedora, now you can spark ya Garcia Vega nigga

[Chorus]

[Wish Bone]
Lord I tease 'em blingin, yup, that's how I'm leavin the buildin
Stay strapped on rap-pap-pap, won't none of you stop me from feedin my children
It's so serious, so so serious!
Bone's too dangerous, hard to deal with us
Put 'em on that chest, 'til the clip got nothin left
Pump-pump, your mad respects, got somethin for that vest
Pump-pump, been gettin these weapons since the 90's so we heated
Got anything from that 9 to that uzi
We come, we come, dumb, heated heavy hey!
Get some, you cross that Bone, believe we comin baby
In yo' direction, well bitch get ready to wreck somethin
Throwin no shots in the air; everything headed for head
That's how these Thugstas roll, just cross us, you'll find out fo' sho'
Get some, get some, better be ready to go
Look like my wrist on fire the way I'm lettin 'em go
So when I wash up in yo' shit you show me 'nuff respect, hey!
