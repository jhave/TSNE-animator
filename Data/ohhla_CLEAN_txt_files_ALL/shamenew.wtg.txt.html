Chorus: Serj Tankian
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger!
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo I'll fuck ya ass up!

[Serj Tankian]
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut!
S.O.A.D., live and uncut!
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, ya wanna get gun?  Shoot!
BLAOW!  How you like me now?  Don't fuck the style
Ruthless wild!
Do ya wanna getcha teeth knocked the FUCK out?
Wanna get on it like that, well then shout!
Lasers, amazers
Hit me with the major
The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor
Gunnin, hummin comin atcha
First I'm gonna getcha, once I gotcha, I gat-cha
You could never capture the eneman stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggaz resigning, now master
My style?  Never!  I put the fucking muck in the wild kid
Let's get together!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga (2X)

Chorus

[RZA]
Drunk like 20 white boys in the back of a pick up truck
With hockey pucks and skateboards on their way to Woodstock
Leave home the glock, and have a gun the size of a black hole
Two planets, don't get frantic
Throw your hands up in the hair, don't panic
Supreme Arm Leg Leg Arm Head, Wu-Tang Clan as tight as strong dread

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga (2X)

Chorus

[Serj Tankian]
Come wit that ol' loco
Style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker!  Play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire!  Smoke ya!
Crews be actin like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors! Come out and playiyay!"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my drawers
So I can get fzza-funky for yah
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang RAHH!
Here comes the Tiger verse Crane!
Ow, be like wild with my style
Punk!  You playing me, chump, you get DUMPED
WU!  Is comin THROUGH!  At a theatre near YOU!
And get funk like a SHOE!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga (2X)

Chorus

I'll fuck ya ass up (4x)
Bitch!

[RZA]
Fuck his ass up</pre>
