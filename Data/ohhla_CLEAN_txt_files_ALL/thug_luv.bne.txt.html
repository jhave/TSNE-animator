I know you niggas been waiting for this shit for a long time 
well here it is nigga here it is what you gone do with it

[Bizzy]
Well I must be close to the Armageddon lord you know 
That I won't fly that lesson you taught me to pull out my wesson you brought 
And am I stressing it softly get 'em up off me cause all
We wanted was harmony been bombing 'em yell up outta my ghetto
I want settle get on my level they can't 
Stop me or drop me nigga they got me fuck naw
Little Pac get schizophrenic and manage to damage all y'all
I'll talk about 'em and you don't really want it 
Cause they're cornered and I want 'em to jump up
I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down 
So quick to test bullet yes declare war
Roll and I'll blow when I get the gun for the murder mo' horror 
For what the did it all pause for the cause and I
Fin to pull a nine or pistol little nigga wit mine fuck dem niggas it's on
All y'all fall Bizzy gettin bitches test me bless the floor
In any attempt to arrest me stress me lord 
Looking at death with the last of my breath 
Follow follow my kids but don't sin in my steps
Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets
Deep in the leaves I'm alone nigga believe
That I can see it if needed an if you really want me in 
Well let it be and get the greens and be runnnin up over cleveland

[2Pac]
Hahaha what's poppin nigga 
put your motherfucking hand on your strap nigga 
Thug Luv nigga we can do this like punks
and punk it out or be like gangstas and slug it out 
pull your strap on me nigga and you better kill be thug life baby

I'll probably be punished for hard livin blind to the facts
Thugs is convicts in gods prison hand on the strap
Praying to father please forgive me police be rushing when they see me
I flaunted America's most wanted live on TV life
Pleasure and pain stuck in this game holler my name
We all gone die we bleed through similar veins 
You'se explain to me now don't panic when my gun burst
Heard the last jam nigga this ones worse
My nigga bone held the chrome till I came home
Thug Luv playas tell these bitch ass niggas bring it on
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening 
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing now
Who you believe in hit the weed and breathe it's a 
Cold ass the world them niggas kill you in your sleep 
Until they stop me bury murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse feel me

[Layzie]
Little thug from the land nigga never ran
Motherfuckers out to get me they don't understand 
It's the #1 nigga out with a nation of niggas
Down to put in some work do some dirt 
Fuckin round with the band Bone Thugs N Harmony 
Follow down the road we stroll to meet karma 
Everything I do it seem to cause drama 
Ready for the war like a knight in my armor bomb ya 
So quick to test us nigga wanna crash me eat dust 
For the love of the lust niggas bustin on us
Hit 'em up with he buck 12 gauge erupt it's the Art Of War
Putting niggas on the floor 
when I'm comin through the door bringin nothin but terror
Causing much to the nigga that dared us 
trying to put a twist in this thugsta 
era Paired up with a nigga like Pac 
and a nigga like me gotta stay high
Thug Luv till i die keep my prayer to the sky 
but I'm still in the hood smoke and fry
So I beg the lord to save us all escapers of misery 
Bless my niggas in penitentiaries soldiers of the century

[Krayzie]
Here to get it told my niggas to get the hell down
Down with the dirt and we don't fuck around 
Buck a couple of rounds and if you're passing through then hit the ground 
And don't get caught up in the crossfire nigga
Artillery thick and you don't want to get to fuckin with this
I'm straight devil devil not a punk and pretend
I reload buck a little more flee the scene 
'fore the po-po even know what you lookin for
They don't know a motherfucker with a leatherface hey
Man she said I ran this way said I ran that way 
You hoes'll never know because I got away yeah
A criminal mind a nigga on the level sometimes 
so get high and analyze your  crime
Directly organized with results you'll be surprised

[Wish]
Oh nigga can you feel the vibe we can ride playa hating niggas you gots to die
It's over wit Bone better leave it alone Mo Thug I'm cracking fuckin domes
Still in the hood where the thugs play fuckin wit nothin but thugs man
Ain't taking no shorts or no losses we crackin them domes around my way
Give it to 'em on another level nigga 
get a shovel you can dig a hole bitches is dead
Infrared to the head you can beg but still gone bleed bloody red
Fuck with mine will be see in the moonlight 
cause we out ridin looking for you 
Better run for cover nigga duck we about to bust
Straight got the Infrared put it on his forehead make some moves
Send flowers straight to his home 
put a card in the motherfucker send it to his mama
Tell her he was dead wrong dead wrong gone now he long gone
