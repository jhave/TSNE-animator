(Chorus)
No matter where I go 
I'm lettin' people know 
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say 
You gotta' release the chains 
I think it's time I set my spirit free

(Verse 1) 
No matter where I go 
I'm lettin' people know 
That the pace is never stalling 
Even if the sky is falling 
I'll never be afraid 
As long as I keep my faith 
Even if I am still crawling 
Won't be mad 'cause some are balling 
But man without the trust, without the loyalty
When you watch your dog  just starving 
Don't get mad when they start barkin' 
Here's a suggestion man 
Why don't we just wash our hands 
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures 
I think it's time I'm my own master. 

(Chorus)
No matter where I go 
I'm lettin' people know 
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say 
You gotta' release the chains 
I think it's time I set my spirit free

(Verse 2)
Long ago I told my homie 
Some people are so damn phony
Sure as the wind blows
They'll try to take your dough
On and on man they just keep comin' 
'Til I'm dead man I'm never runnin' 
Fear I just don't know 
If it's your time you gotta' go 
But what about the trust what about the loyalty
When the have no respect for you 
It's fuck 'em or call your lawyer 
Here's a suggestion man 
Why don't' we just wash our hands 
'Cause I'm peepin' other pastures 
I think it's time I'm my own master.

(Chorus)
No matter where I go 
I'm lettin' people know 
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say 
You gotta' release the chains 
I think it's time I set my spirit free

(Bridge)
Here's to my family 
Here's to the ones I really love 
Here's to the inmates 
And that's who made Death Row #1
Here's to the foundation 
And that's where, where it started from 
Here's to real freedom
They tell me makin' music's fun 
When you got no shackles on your feet

(Chorus)
No matter where I go 
I'm lettin' people know 
No matter where you go the grass is always green
No matter what you say 
You gotta' release the chains 
I think it's time I set my spirit free</pre>
