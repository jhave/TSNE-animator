Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Life in slow motion
And I'm swimming in the ocean when I'm next to you
If I'm not with you then I'm texting you
Cause I miss you
It's like sparks when I kiss you
Girl, what's the issue?
I'm fighting again
In the studio, I'm writing again
I make it rain cause lightning again
A video doin lightin again
Jeez... breaking up, I was writin' again
Get in trouble, always lyin again
Boy I don't really know where the ground is
And I don't really know what a noun is
Cause I don't go to school and I'm hanging with some fools
Keys, I been dealin at the movies
I never really truly met you
I'm Romeo, you be my Juliet, boo
You look so good in that dress that you are
And look so cute in these glasses
You said I look good in that vest that I wore
Tell me when you get out of your classes cause
Seeing you around and on my first tell me that you go to calabashes
Hi and I stare up in your eyes
Shit I don't know why I stere longer than your lashes
I think I could write a couple songs
Cause this steppin straight out of a movie
I could get lost in the music
And baby please don't lose me

Bring, bring the thunder
And the loud, loud rain (please, please don't lose me)
We all rose asunder
'Neath the proud, proud veins (please, please don't lose me)

Of traits that bleed the gunmen
Of our pumping, earthly hearts (please, please don't lose me)
When our joys in plunder
Feel our shining teeth
Bet our hold on happiness (please, please don't lose me)

Girl hold me when you can
Cause this love is not as strong as it was
Cause you makin the fuss over nothing
And you know my single through matroska
I remember you would blush
Now you still using your brush
Just because we keeping this on the hush
Girl it's no reason to rush
Just figured it, you did it
You know that's how we said it
Even put me in the clinic, I admit it
And the buzz with me with me keep taking these turns
Have to be concerned, sure admit it you be trippin
Don't understand why you keep changing your plans
Are exhaust but you ain't rocking no stance
Put on my hand, you still don't wanna dance
And you not playin my jams
While I put my foot up on break
Girl we made mistakes, we should probly take a break
All the songs I make are just only for your sake
You stay playin your Drake, I don't think I'll take this no more
You bore me
Wake up in the morning
And I need a new story
Sorry... round a clock date and I show up tardy
And I'm hardly uh same kid from last October
Misfits soldier, got a bit of older
Got a little colder
For the better, whatever
People say I'm clever
True, I help with your endeavours
Hope we're not together just so we can feel these pleasure
And my heart you couldn't sever and I hope you know I love you forever

Bring, bring the thunder
And the loud, loud rain (please, please don't lose me)
We all rose asunder
'Neath the proud, proud veins (please, please don't lose me)

Of traits that bleed the gunmen
Of our pumping, earthly hearts (please, please don't lose me)
When our joys in plunder
Feel our shining teeth
Bet our hold on happiness (please, please don't lose me)

Please, please don't lose me
Please, please don't lose me</pre>
