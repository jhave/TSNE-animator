[Main Flo]
I had to stay minal, when DEA stopped my gray rental
Incidental, my girl home watchin Jay Leno
Prophecize, I pulled the wise
Wit frame eyes for disguise, talkin like them white guys
Shallow demeanor, karma was the main schemer
What could be greener, when all I thought about was Beemers
Then came the questioning
Arrestin me was steppin rare
Askin permission so he could say he kept it fair
Fake mustaches and hundred yard dashes
Through lake molasses because my government's so facist
Don't choose to ass-kiss dolo spots
I did the massacus on all areas, harassless
Don't wanna do enough confront a cew
That night I got two, went to sleep, woke up wit guns drew
No time for cryin cowards
Too late for fire power
Karma convinced me to leave him at his dying hour

[Chorus] 2x
Now leading back to that night
Reality strikes
Them unknown faces are the casualty types

[Donte]
When you watch yo' nigga rise and disguise
You despise cuz I built an enterprise
While you still livin lies
And I'm all you wanna be, but that's all you gonna be
Get your long path and yo' ass from in front of me
Niggas thought you had my back and you was stealin out my pack
When other niggas try to tell me "I wasn't even feelin that"
That's my ace, that nigga got keys to my place
And he know about the cash, stashed G's in the safe
Wait, no time to waste when best friends player-hate
Relocate, can't sleep, now I gotta stay awake
And take a still break, cuz I be dealin wit this ill fate
When niggas be fake, infiltrate and try to and steal weight

"The way I vex, will cause an insane karma" [Del] 2x

[Main Flo]
All up on the humble
Fuckin wit fake niggas that know I bubble
Precise juggle, cuz life is my type of struggle
Seven-fifty IL's, and tales of fly females
Who caught in these sales wit live details
Shades by Cartier, and big links that hardly play
It could be Auste, let's do this in a large way
I wanna see the Amazon basing
To set out to gather my thoughts into a calm basement

[Donte]
Man ain't nuttin change, niggas don't know what they facin
Already steady pacin, they seeds to be replacements
We ain't the felon type  
Or into sellin white
Cuz everything money bring, children of the malonites
I'm Bob's song, provin Ja live, not gone
To pay a devil on a loan, got to rob yo' own
No love wit no peace, gave life to the beast
As the defecit increase, Exodus outta Greece
This note is legal tender, depths connect, render
Evil spender, people mentors resurrect to evil vendor now

Chorus 2x
