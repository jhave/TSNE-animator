Pancake Lil man, Lil Tray &amp; Jay dogg

Kids live a long life, live a strong life, 
Not the wrong life, let em live they own life

Pancho loc &amp; my homeboy Nollan
Big blue from the rear block
You keep it real wit a nigga since the pop loc, you bought me soda pop
My nigga cartoon, Lil Noock &amp; Pete Both from the north
We meet in 7th grade on the B-Ball court
Just like the homie Demon Loc
Damn too many of my homies got smoked
Before I lost 2Pac I lost my Grand Pa

Not Reverend Harris too
Dear God, tell me what our church gone do

If you think that's bad, well that ain't all
I gotta give a couple of shouts out to my doggz
Eazy E
Roger Troutman &amp; The Notorious, B.I.G.
My Big Homeboy Mooch you know I love your moms to death
In Heaven she rest
H.D. - Mary was your pride &amp; Joy
&amp; Warren G ya'll my Mutha Phukkkin homeboyz
He lost Ola Mae the same way
See I be lookin at yall, &amp; wantin to touch my momma everyday
I don't know what I'm goin through but I'm there for you
See on some real shit homie I care for you
Rough times, Rough Rhymes, Heart-ache
Man I ease the pane with a glass of bacarda
But how could I, &amp; why should I
Cause on the real folks it's hard to say good-bye (good-bye)

Chorus [Kokane &amp; (Snoop Dogg)
Life Goes on (Life, Life, Life)

Remember tha G'z that were, here now there gone (Life, Life, Life)
Life goes on (Life, Life, Life) Ooh

Life Goes on (Life, Remember)
Remember tha G'z that were, here now there gone (Life)</pre>
