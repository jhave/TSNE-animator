[Ras Kass]

(yea, yea YEAH)
What, you don't want it, niggas liver than Teen Summit
The Wild Pitch, America's Most drunk and blunted
Stick to fishes, black widows kick this vicious
Hot shit bitch, Wild Pitch

[Jah Skillz]

I'm the, funkalistic, rapper choke an instant
Got mixed wit, Malibu rums and Mistic
I'm a whole lot on it, yea just a smidget
Just cuz I live by the beach like ?Gidget?
You must think I'm small time like that biz midget
Add three piece smart mouth like bitches
And you got me, Jah Killa jet ski ills
Take me to the edge like poppin pills
Straight up, no chase, hold up unless I'm bein followed
Never swallow anything unless it's from a bottle
And that's the whole truth, and nothin but the truth so help me God
By the powers invested upon my 5 Footaz squad
You ain't ready, oh cuz you dress like psychadelli
You the GMC like Chevy, I put a levy on yo cash flow
Just a little something to let yo ass know
Who to give 2 kind to when you pass go

Chorus [Xzibit]

You dealin wit alumni criteria
The one's that throwin Wild Pitches in ya area
Strikin you out, sending you back to the dugout
We goin up to your microphones pullin the plug out
Superior, alumni criteria, we the MCs that you make you feel inferior
Throwin Wild Pitches, fuckin your riches and your bitches
Rasassination, Jah Skillz, and Xzibit

[Ras Kass]

I ejaculate  on blind justice wit the jury's se quested
And escape, run in a nigga's face like Hannibal Lector
The aqua-mati, my pen is penitentiary
Potenially plain paid for protocall pacific pro perfect cap pealer
Performing skull circumsitions, when I position the prism
Permiscuis wit other people's pussy ?pawn? wit the playa like Big Pun
Poisonous poet, I Master "p" like UHHHHHHH!!!
Skillz ?cotted? enabled
Herb you just and ingrown hair in the world of tweezers
We can dance before I crack MC's like Gator in jungle fever
Got them speakin in number like SoundScan
Severed the ears off your soundman, black Israelite
Like four-hundred and forty-four thousand
Niggas talk like dog, we'll walk like cat
I'm Ozzy Osbourne bitin the head off of rats
When they started bustin, fuck the Russian
We playin West Indian Roulette, ?some of mine? blind get wet
&gt;From New Jack to Vet I can modem
Comes off like three adam's apples in the inner scrotum
My rhyme ?, clearin my sinus, bitch slime on your Iceberg
And let the virus cross appliance

Chorus

[Xzibit]

Give birth to earth to planet, we harder than granite
And concrete, man made could never compete, complete down to the core
Weighing in tons, hotter than lava, God, Javi, Jahovah, Allah heavenly Father
Nuns to bank robbers, wealth beyond the dollar
Here to school the scholar, make new born babies
No live for no bitch or lady, they try to play me
We flowin like the Mississsippi to the River Euphrates
One-hundred and eighty times two, one complete rotation
Fit any situation for a small donation, live on location
Third planet from the sun
Travel 24 hours you spend a lifetime to run
Witness the slave shot he bolted to a gat and a gun
&gt;From Hitler, Musolini, to Attila the Hun
Imagine existence wit no fear, tears never shed here
One day for me could last a thousand years
The first element baby, one two....
