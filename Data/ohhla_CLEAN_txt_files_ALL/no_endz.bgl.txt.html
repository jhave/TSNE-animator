Verse One:

Let me get to the point real quick
When ya pockets are thick 
mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
all the ho's go sweat you like a movie star
to get in ya pockets 
thats what the girls wanna do
but if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
no matter how strong your rap
you only nock boots when you got loot
you on the map
cause if you broke youll get a wack slut
if you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
with fresh gear,long hair and a cute face
and if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in
then ya start loosin all ya bucks
soon your brothers a joke a not a rut?
then she takes off and brakes off
ya ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings OK
but when you broke you get no play

Chorus:

If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
And if you dont got money you wont skoop a honey
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass
And if you dont got loot you wont be knockin no boots

Verse Two:

Girls of the 90's aint nuthin but crooks
Its all about whats in ya pockets not how ya look
that's why you cant talk to just any whore 
leavin brothers for the next man cause he's got a penny more
they want a drug dealer not a scholar
some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar
and if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be ya best friends
yeah, as long as you collect endz
you think shes all yours 
but as soon as your dough go your ho go
now you solo
but when you was makin papers sucker jumped ho's
you bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
and you was takin em to the movies every weekend
now that you dead broke the girls not speakin
cause nowadays girls want you to crook
the only thing they can get from Big L is a big....
Cause when you on top everythings OK
But when you broke you gets no play

Chorus 2X

Verse Three:

I tell it how it is cause im a goldfigga
and I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger
it aint even funny
some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money
I'm lookin nuthin like ya poppa
I wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
they wanna know why im so fly
a girl ask me for a ring and i put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this

Chorus 2X

Outro:

It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm livin swell yall
I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all
(If you dont got endz)
Girls be frontin
(If you dont got endz)
They aint givin up nuthin
(If you dont got endz)
all the girls they ignore you
(If you dont got endz)
they act like they never saw you
(If you dont got endz).............</pre>
