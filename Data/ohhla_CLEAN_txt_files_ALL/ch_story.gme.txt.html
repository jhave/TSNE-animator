Uncle chucky
Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please

Alright
You kids get to bed ill get the story book

Heeeeereeeee weeee go

Slam the Impala door and want do ya see
Some niggaz hangin on the fence lookin at me
I had phat red laces in my Addidas
Big chain around my neck like Mar-di Gras
So I stepped up to them, "Is there a problem here?"
One nigga lifts his shirt then yells out "yeah"
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like "nahh"
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four-five with the kung-fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the store
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
"What did you do?"
"I shot"
"Are you crazy fool?"
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well I'll be damned
It was 7:15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my Rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And Impala passes, its my homeboy Clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, orignal inside
With no key in the ignition
&gt; "Where'd you get this Clyde?"
Nevermind, I'm out, it's a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then Clyde yells out, "you stupid bastard!"
So I'm runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggaz with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in Long Beach
Cause in California the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his Barklys
I ain't seen these since '92
I'm feelin like a "Bad Boy" without the shiny suit
Hear the cops come, shit, so I dash behind a Honda
Look who's here, my baby momma's friend Ronda
In the car kissin on this dope deala Chris
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked into the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
"sorry", jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
Its chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let Chris free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run, "need a ride nephew?"
Hell yeah big Snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
This another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to the house, pulled out my key
Opened the door, Its my girl playin Biz Markie
