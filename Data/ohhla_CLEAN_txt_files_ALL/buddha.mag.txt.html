Got da, ha ha, he he, hay
I got more women that Willy Wonka got choco-late
My pocket gets fatter than Jacob on twenty Ladders
All that matters is my rhyme style gets fatter
As the, jam, goes
Three years I waited, my rhyme style got constipated
It finally came in, F'd around and got debated
Glad I made it, out of the ghetto
My rhyme style is heavy, it comes out smooth, and kind of subtle
Whaaat??
