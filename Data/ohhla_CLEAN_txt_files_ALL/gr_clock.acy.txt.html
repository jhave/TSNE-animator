Excuse me, does anyone have the time?
No!!!

[Aceyalone]

If you knew what makes me tick
It'll probably make you sick
Lay my days of my life in front of you 
and I'll let you take your pick
Come on
Pull back the curtain but make sure that you are certain
That it will be worth the energy that you end up exerting
Now walk past the doorway step in the foyer
Don't you bother knocking
I'm a grandfather clockin' everything you do
I'm seeing through you faultiness
So sprinkle me but not with saltiness
The ghetto taught me this
I fought for this, I fight for this, I spend my life for this
And if you put your brain to work it ain't hard to decipher this
Counting down the days boy closer to your doom
Time keeper for the Reaper, the family heirloom
Like staring at my grandfather clock inside my room
It'll never miss a tick-tock, it strikes everyday a noon
Every hour on the hour, it'll sing a tune
Every half hour ot'll croon and yell out at the moon
You can't escape the master time, no one is immune
The hands of time will grab you when the moments opportune

No one is immune
When the moments opportune

Carved from a tree trunk bark
What a wonderful work of art
Well I usually wear my sundial
but it don't work when it's dark 
(don't work when it's dark)
No electric parts spark as mechanical as he is
He'll kindly say just wind me and then show me where the key is
Then I go about my day and I flow about the way
He never has nothing to say, he just sits there on display
I seen one in the cafe, one inside the cabaret
Timekeeper for the Reaper, what a pretty price to pay

Chorus

So don't you bother knockin' at, I'm a Grandfather clokin'
Everything you do, I'm seeing through your masquerade
At midnight you will hear the serenade and don't you be afraid
It's like clock work orange lemonade with the bottomless glass
When it's time for that ass!!
Tick-tock
My Grandfather clock goes
Tick-tock 3X
The pendulum is swinging and it just don't ever stop
Tick-tock
My Grandfather clock goes
Tick-tock 2X
My Grandfather clock

I used to have this coo-coo clock 
that would bother my Grandfather clock
Never gave it no rest so I flew over the top of the nest
And then at my request I ask him to resign
He was never on time, one hour behind
At ten, he stuck at nine
But he did not fuck with mine cause I murdered that machine
If you ever beat the clock you know exactly what I mean 
(exactly what I mean)
I hold my Grandfather clock in high esteem
My alarm clock screams cause he knows how long it takes me
But my Grandfather clock leans over and he shakes me
And they both race against time to see who will be 
the first to wake me
But when I became awoke my alarm clock was broke
And my Grandfather clock was staring right down my throat
And he leaned a little bit closer and he told and I quote:
"If you ever race against me,  you will surely come up short," 
He said, "I'm better than your Timex, your Rolex or your Swatch
Your Fossil, Casio, Quartz, your diamond studded watch,"
He said, "I control how long you stay alive
I'ma tap you on you shoulder at eleven fifty-five"
When the time arrives and then and only then
you'll have your five minutes of funk
I said my final salutations as I stepped amongst the monks
Then he took me exactly where I stodd like he should
And I tried to reason with him and I tried knocking on wood 
But he said
