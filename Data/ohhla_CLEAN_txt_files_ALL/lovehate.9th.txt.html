[Intro: 9th Prince]
That's what it is, a love and hate thing
That's the way life is, you know
Don't get caught up in the emotions

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I hate the police
I hate rappers sounding all R&amp;B, I hate fake MC's
Aiyo, I hate commercial beats, I hate bitches with gold teeth
I hate cars that don't do 160
I hate bitches that's ugly, acting like they pretty
I hate fat bitches in low-rider jeans
I hate so-called smart niggas with weak ass scheames
I hate the D.A., I hate the judge
And all my real niggas know, we don't budge
I hate chicks that don't suck dick, but want a nigga to go down
And lick her fucking clit
I hate the jury, that said I was guilty
I hate that song "Get Silly", I hate Bill O'Reilly
I hate bitches who say they don't fuck on the first night
I know niggas hate that I'm about to blow like Dolomite
Or dynamite, keep hating, right

[Chorus: 9th Prince]
Aiyo, I love this, I hate that
I guess that's the way 9th is, black, up and down
Left and right, back and front
Grey Goose and a blunt, blunt, blunt

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, I love Alicia Keys keeping it real with R&amp;B
I love old school hip hop, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, EPMD
I love New York City, we the flyest, and staying jiggy
I love chicks with fat asses, and to call her titties
I love what ODB did at the Grammy's, that's my family
I love when niggas can't stand me
I love when strippers lapdance on me for free, with no panties
I love Mercedes, Bentley's and Lamborgini's
I love fucking bitches in the backseat, window tinted

[Chorus]</pre>
