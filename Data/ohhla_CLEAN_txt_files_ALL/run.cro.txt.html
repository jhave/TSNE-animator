I'm an Outlaw, 5-0 is who I'm rivals with
So I'm out y'all, like they quit
Quicker than a slug that a rifle spit
A thug quicker than Michael bit
Run, Gestapo's comin' up fast so I gotta dash

One of the homies didn't run and they shot his ass
He paralyzed now and can't move his bottom half
Standin' still is the silly plan

Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you getting' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!

That next felony nigga, it's like three zip

When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! Motherfucker...

Damn, these motherfuckers are on my ass man
I gotta make it back to motherfuckin' Long Beach Boulevard, fuck</pre>
