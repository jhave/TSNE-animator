[Intro]
Man just hit me on my Sidekick man, f'real man
Hit me on the T-Mail man
Soulja Boy tell 'em man
You can hit me up on this, this D-Wade right here man
I'm in this mode right now, it's really quite good man
While I'm ridin on the street
And I just flipped this phone on you one time
Just, flip it on you, the Sidekick
YO, YO, YO~!

[Verse One]
Talkin to lil' shorty up inside the club (up inside the club)
Said a couple words and she gave me a hug (she gave me a hug)
Pulled out the Sidekick, 3 is on deck (deck)
So much ice hangin off my neck (neck)
Back to the topic so I flipped the phone (so I flipped the phone)
Stacks on deck, don't get me wrong (don't get me wrong)
Told her this the new white D-Wade
with the suede, six hundred how much I paid for my

[Chorus]
On my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick
On my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my

[Verse Two]
Lookin so fresh as my neck is bling (as my neck is bling)
While I'm textin these girls on my Sidekick 3
Some call it 2-way, some call it Sidekick
All I know is I'm gon' put it down with my kit (bet)
All white t-shirt with the phone to match (with the phone to match)
And when I flip it real quick it make your girls look at it
I ain't gotta say nothin, but man I'm on
Six-hundred fifty dollars just to talk on my phone

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
You can hit me up on my 2-way (my 2-way)
My Sidekick 3 that's the same thang (that's the same thang)
If you got the phone then you ballin (...no you ain't)
Flipped out that junk, started callin (bet)
It's your folk Soulja Boy and you already know
I got stacks on deck when I walk through the do'
Man I can't believe that I'm rappin 'bout a phone
But what you won't believe is I wrote this song

[Chorus]

[Outro]
OHH! It's a new generation baby, a new thang
A new 2K7, 2K11
It's new things goin on, it's new technology (WOW~!)
T-E-K-nology
If you don't know you need to get with it
The Sidekick 3 is on deck, when I flip it it flip and it flop
And all that, you need to get down with it
It's called T-Mail baby, hit me up
