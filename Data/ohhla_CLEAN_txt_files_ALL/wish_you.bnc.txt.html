[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here
How I wish you were here

[CIXX PAC]
Too many deaths in the family, everybody around me
They droppin like flies and is makin' me crazy
Another year, another one passed
Mourn a brother seem you locked up and dead in that bodybag
But now he gone to a better place
But then we won't never be the same if you ain't standin' face to face
Everybody shed a tear when they go down
But loc as you reminiscin' you know they still around
So drop your head to the church song
And for that one that can you take it for them, gotta stay strong
Some callin' a miracle, some callin' a blessing
Call it what you want but the homie still left me
And now we're going to ?? of bud
Don't go them Gates in wait so that it mean they show you love
I reminisce so I shed a tear
Shouts out to Tiny Half Dead wishing you was here

[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
How I wish you were here (I wish you were here)

[GREEN EYES]
Now I'm back up in the hood on the tuesday
I gots to say Rest In Peace to Pumpkin and A-Bay
Blue Dukie, Radio and Slap, ?? y'all got guts
And my Relative Chance A-K-A O.G. Peanut
Ricky One, ?? Mean and Low Koolay I got love
From Green Eyes West Side Inglewood Family Gangsta Bloods
Now like Redrum said all dogs go to heaven
And that's on the 4 A-Block 9-Deuce to 7-7
West up Young Leak, Slow Mo, Smurph and Frankie
B-Loc, Taco, Havoc and the homegirl Goldie
Killa A-Baby, Lil' J and Lil' Bangin'
And Dogg and all my homies from the Family Gang
And I can't forget about the 10 and the 4 Mafia Riders
Lil' Hawk, Dock, Nutty, Bams and Spider
B-Blood in the 'Wood, Damus stick together
Y.G. Green Eyes Inglewood forever

[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
How I wish you were here (I wish you were here)

[LIL' LANIAK]
It's much love to the M.I.P
Slap, Ride, Jackie B
Lil' Rock, Stacey
Pint and Rampage, everybody was strapped
Now my loved one is gone and he ain't never comin' back
It's a known fact I gotta act to fool ?? strain
All that pain West Side M Gang
Lil' Hawk and S-P, Y.G. B-Riders
Big Bazzarro and Red, out of the slugs to side you
Mafias In Peace

[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
How I wish you were here (I wish you were here)

[BIG FREEZE]
Memories of many homies left dead in the streets
Of casualties, all my homies caught without they heat
Fatalities left my young partner dead in the casket
The first shout pop, drop my loc when they blasted
Then I'm right out to these days I still hearse
So when I reminisce on Tiny Half
I put it in work
And living on the memory of the dead trick
And I'll be scopin' like a shark shooter with the 30 ?? 6
Hennessy keeps my mind kinda glossy
I choke one of that indo smoke
Man, I miss my loc
In lovin' memory of Tiny Half
My homie Rock T
My young player partner Thai Tsu
Death for death I love y'all Cuz
Big Freeze and I'm out

[YOUNG MALCOLM]
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
How I wish you were here (I wish you were here)

[SCARFACE &amp; G-BONE]
Dynasty Dave, Atlantic Drive won't forgive a bold brother
Oak and Ride, Mark and Mil, Monte Long gettin' busy but 'nother
Devil Warren Cuz D.I.P.
Now the Atlantic Drive In Peace for the Compton A.D.C.
To my homies Rest In Peace I need to send a little shout out
To let you I know that locs I still thought about
?? homie left from Gangsta Bone and B.G. 'Face
I wish you was here I shed tears till this very day

[LIL' HAWK]
Back Down Mafia Lane
It's the YGB Little Hawk to representin' CMG
To the day that I die like my homies did
Like we promised too
Ever since we was kids
I'ma ride for this
I will die for this
I gotta tear on my eyes cause I even cry for this
Ride, slide thru the West Side
Thinkin' to myself will I live or will I die?
Cause this gangbangin' drama have to be taken for no joke and
I'm hopin' that you hear me Blood you hear-hear to memory
It's the bhico, chico, a Inglewood's brazy
You can't fade this and bless this while I made this
It's the B
The couple of S-H-I to the T
It's the YG Little Hawkster and my dogg S.P. Woop Woop!
