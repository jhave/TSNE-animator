Hear ye, hear ye, from far and near
The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because...

<hmm...yeah...i take="" there...oh="" you=""> (x4)

Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say, <hah>
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo...

<hmm...yeah...i take="" there...oh="" you=""> (x4)

What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But!  on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
<is there="" wic="">
Are you sick?  
And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and...

<hmm...yeah...i take="" there...oh="" you=""> (x3)

Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
And we don't even need Scotty to beam us up
Because...

<hmm...yeah...i take="" there...oh="" you=""> (x4)

<big daddy="" oh...hmm=""> (x9)
