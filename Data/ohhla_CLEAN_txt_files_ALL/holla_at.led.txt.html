[Cool &amp; Dre]
This is...This is
This is...AND HE GOES BY THE NAME OF

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah you got the right one, It's Weezy fuckin baby
And if your woman lookin, I'll let the woman taste me
Okay now I'm with Khaled, we whylin in Miami
We got a bunch of bitches, we pile 'em in the phantom
They follow us to Mansion but I don't mean the club
I'm talking bout my crib, mama I'm trying to fuck
It's Cash Money Baby, It's Young Money Biatch
Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick
Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch
Lil' nigga, big money, big gun for lil' shit
Nigga I ain't Will Smith, nah, I ain't a Fresh Prince
Nigga I'm a young king, nigga I'm a Bun B
Yup, I go hard, ask my broad
Miss Stevie Wonder, she ain't lookin at y'all (She can't see)
The rest goes without me having to say
I say, go, go, go, go (DJ)

[Chorus: Paul Wall]
Holla at me, what it do, what it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me baby)
I'm a pimp, I'll show her how I live
Take her back then I put it in her wrist (Holla at me baby)
I'm a monster, I do it real big
You ain't never seen rocks like this (Holla at me baby)
You can see me from a far I'm the shit
Scream at me what it do, what it is (What It Do)

[Paul Wall]
It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse club rocker
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuce, pourin up the goose vodka
Lone star beast straight up out the H
Sure stoppin all the hate, sippin on the ski taste
I got the I-N-S on my tail, immigration still harass
Cause they see me in a foreign ridin on imported glass
Gettin cash is my number one task
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class
I'm a grit boy lookin for an ass like Ketoya
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy
My boy Toy I E got to sleep
And we got to see and who got the freaks?
Beat it up like an ass whipping
The album dropped and there's been a lot of ass kissing
But I ain't trippin, I'm trill
That's why I'm posted with Khaled cause he the real
One hundred baby like the bill, holla at me baby

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Nah homie, you done got it fucked up
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope)
We sent Campbell in cause he got goggles on
And he pushin somethin foreign as fuck
Now all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast
And the chopper come out of the stash
Yeah money ain't jewels motherfucker you lose
I'll make you do the fuckin Sean Comb dance (Follow me now)
Who wanna come test the king
Have your baby mama bless the team
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that
She a motherfuckin sex machine, Holla at me baby

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Stuntin in a magnum ridin with my hat low
Forty-five magnum, barrel full of air holes
Dade County, represent, Dopeboy ever since
Know that I'ma veteran, million dollar residence
Rick Ross, big chips, AK's, flip clips
Offset rims on a rear six inch lips
Started on the benches, rose through the trenches
Now I'm the shit bitch, go and check your senses
Known for the benz's, Chrome on the bentleys
Smokin on the mentleys, Dade county, big cheese
Flip soft, whip that, Rick Ross rip that
Khaled go hard dawg, talk to 'em Paul Wall

[Chorus]

[Pitbull]
Aiyyo
It's Mr. 3-0-5 A.K.A.
Mr. Snort yay, spit rocks, made in Dade
I owe my future to
Last name Campbell, first name Luther
The "gun"-shine state where they'll shoot ya
The bottom, the crib, what they do, what it is
Bust a clip, flip a brick, hey buddy where's the lick?
That's all we talk about, well welcome to the south
We in, get our bread then we out, no doubt
Palas and Caprices
These boys dirty, they'll fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces
Ahora loca mueva la carera, abre la boca y muere la marera

[Chorus]</pre>
