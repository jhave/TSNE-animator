[Intro]
Pump up the peculiar
While I yell unique
Aaaaah, let me show you right here
Heeeeeeey, Aaaahaaaaahaaa
Ooooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I'm well on my way
I'm almost everything
And this is my day
You make me want to say

[Hook]
I'm freeee! Look at me!
Behold everything I'm allowed to see
Freeee,! Come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

[Verse]
The shapeless, formless, heart is enormous
Bore this, I've worn this, no never what the norm is
Come hear this, it's fearless
Contrast, colour, prisms, so warmin'
Listen and love it

[Hook #2]
I'm freeee! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Freeee! come and see
Na, na, na, na, na na na

[Verse]
What you waitin' on?
I won't ask your, passion, smilin', laughin'
Yieldin', feelin', helpin', healin'
Introduce your neighbour to your saviour

[Hook #3]
I'm freeee! Look at me!
Freedom in hi-fidelity
Freeee!
Na, na, na, na, na na na</pre>
