[Cuban Link]
Twin, we've been best friends
Ever since we were little kids
So I sit and remenisce
On all the things we ever did
I remember
All the stupid shit I can't forget
Hope God forgive us for our sins 
and give you the strength  to live
Far from sensitive
But I'm shedding tears right now
Cause I'm watching you fight  for your life
And I can't help out
Meanwhile, the doctor's shocking your chest,
Checking for breath
I was with you from the stretcher
To the hospital bed
Not believing it yet
Everybody sad and depressed
Counting your blesings, praying and praying
Hoping for the best
Waitin in pec
Your wife duke shaking from stress
Breaking  in tears and fear 
Cause dog, she love you till death
Next thing you know, the doctor comes out
Just shaking his head
Nothing was said
But I betted in his face full of sweat
You were dead
Just all I saw instead was blood shot red
And I felt a  chill throughout my body
That I'll never forget
God Bless You

[Chorus 2X: Tony Sunshine]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget
(Unas flores para los muertos)

[Cuban Link]
In my sleep I hear you speaking to me
And feel you reaching to me
Wish I could see you 
Though I know you with me spritually
Physically, right here besides me
Is where I need you to be
Keeping me company
And take over this whole industry
Memories, of when we used to be 
Too deep in the streets
If there was beef
We had each others backs naturally
If there was need for me to grab the heat
You'd grab it from me
And blast off with no remorse
Just as long as its me
Young indeed
We sat and chat
On the block puffing trees
Guzzeling Hennesey
Playing knucles til one of us bleed
You used to eat Rocks
And read encyclopedias to me
You was a geneous
Even though you had no college degree
We were homies
But you will always be a brother to me
So close
We always gave each other kiss on the cheek
Big P, your legacy will always live on the street
And best believe
I'm a be there for your wife and 3 seeds
Rest In Peace.

[Chorus]

[Cuban Link]
Yeah,This is dedicated to the ones who never made it
I hated the fact you faded away
You were the greatest
So I say this prayer to pay my respects
I'll never forget you cause you special
I'll catch you in my heart
May God bless you
Rest in peace to my peoples
Who passed away (passed away)
Best believe I'ma keep you alive
Always (always)
Till the day we meet again
Face to face with a grin
In hell or heaven 
You my twin to the end
And I'ma miss you

[Chorus]</pre>
