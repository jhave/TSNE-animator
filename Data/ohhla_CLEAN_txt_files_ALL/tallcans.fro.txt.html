Ahhhhhhhhhhh shit! shit! shit!
Now I'm walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe, 
get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Afroman likes tall cans

Now I'm a afroholic, call me Afroman
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
My homies pop the forty of some St. I's
Now that mother uh! staggerin from side to side
We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
My thirst is quenched but my cravin won't extinguish
I need some forty ounce mother uh! Old English
Put the top in my mouth put the bottom to the ceilin
Drink it down down until I get that crazy feelin
Now just walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe, 
get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus]

See these girls be actin all bad and rude
Always gotta bad attitude
See I just wanna dance, why can't you get the picture
Act like a brother wanna move in with cha
I gots no fame, I gots no wealth
So I whined up dancin by my God damn self
But I pay my money, just like you
And baby I'ma do what I came to do
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
Just to make yo gold diggin attitude switch
So I'm walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe, 
get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus]

I stepped into this party full of Mexicans
I didn't realize I was the only black man
One hand on my bottle, the other on my peter
I barked like a dog and started freakin senoritas
I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup
She kept on steppin back so I kept on steppin up
This vaco strolled up, put his gun to my head
I knew if I moved I was officially dead
That had to be his woman, I know it doggonit
That ain't the first time that I got confronted
{say something in Spanish} get the fuck outta here
I said I'm gone mother fucker, now gimme my beer
Cause I'm just walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Run outta doe, slap the hoe, 
get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chrous]

HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO
HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO HO
Walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
Yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Outta doe, slap the hoe, 
get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus]

Well I'm a afroholic, call me Afroman
Love to sag my khakis with a tall can
My homie pop the forty of some St. I's
Now that knucklehead staggerin from side to side
We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood
We look real bad but we feel so good
My thirst is quenched but my cravin won't extinguish
I need some forty ounce mother fucking Old English
Put the top in my mouth put the bottom to the ceilin
Drink it diggy diggy down till I get that crazy feelin
I'm just walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Outta doe, here we go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus]

Now these women be actin all bad and rude
Always gotta bad attitude
You see I just wanna dance, why can't you get the picture
Act like a brother wanna move in with cha
I gots no fame, I gots no wealth
So I whined up dancin by my God damn self
But I pay my money, just like you
And baby I'ma do what I came to do
You see I can't wait around till I get rich
Just to make yo gold diggin attitude switch
So I'm walkin down the street with some chicken and a forty
I'm yellin at these hoochies and I'm lookin for a party
Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo'
Outta doe, here we go back to that liquor sto'

[Chorus - speeds up at end]</pre>
