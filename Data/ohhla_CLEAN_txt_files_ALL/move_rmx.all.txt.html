ah shit...woo!

[J Mega]
oh I'm baggin you the fastest
the cash is flashed
and I throw the passes
and when it come to my G
that shit splashes like water
get you caught up in my rap mix
while the bubbles sparklin in your glasses
the true slayer love I'm bought to get you ?
to top it off I'm smoothed out from the canibus
the way I handle this is far from the amatuers
the decision unanimous I gots to have you
shoot mine at you Mega large, the natural
sipin tangeray with pineapple with no hassle
I wanna feel you, to be blunt and actual
I know my vibe is grabbin you, I got you laughin too
yeah that's the cue, you know what's next?
so what you want to do?  my lingual got you singin frisky
so why you comin with me?

[chorus: Greg Valentine]
  it ain't a thing for you to swing 
  in my ride and loose the scene
  do this thing you look so fine
  I've just got to make you mine
  now I don't know what you gonna do
  but I'm bout ready to move on you
  I'm bout ready to move on you

[Greg Valentine]
yo like everything essential
to me, my queen oriental
when I first got with you, it twisted my whole mental
your body's so firm and gentle, that's your number one credential
you're like a banging instrumental
i'll bite your nipple so simple and tender one touch and you'll surrender
serve me skins like a bartender
cutie I need that feedback you're givin me
I live for your love I'm here to make the quick delivery, honeycup
I might lick the filing out the honeybun
'n spark it, put my sexual chocolate on the market
one stroke is sure to phase ya and simply amaze ya and daze ya from freaky fantasia
and i'll be knocking the boots all night so you can know what good love feels like
good love good love I got a love that will stand against time
no doubt, cause on a scale from one to nine, baby, you're a dime

[chorus: Greg Valentine]
  it ain't a thing for you to swing 
  in my ride and lose the scene 
  do this thing you look so fine
  I've just got to make you mine
  now I don't know what you gonna do
  but I'm bout ready to move on you
  I'm bout ready to move on you

[J Mega]
I'm not here to sham you I'm diggin your style
you're strictly green trees and bamboo
glits from lit candles, something quite exotic
flauntin your body now I wanna be up inside it
cause it's all about it, teddys, cherries and chocolate
and you a hot chick, when we fuckin on some fly shit
once I knock it, I bring that ass out tha closet
when I deposit, this live dick, you the prophet
can't stop it, I clocked it
I know you freaky, I feel you deeply
call'n over sneaky, smellin' peachy
if done discreetly, you can meet me
rendezvous weekly
dissing your man and come and sleep with me
and you can creep with me in the back seat
of my jeep with me, Mega, I'll make it good for ya, cutie, what, what, what...

[Greg Valentine]
love, I'll pour the champagne all over your body
I want you by me, Valentine's who I be, gettin you hots my hobby
so try me, you could describe me as a playa with class
who knows how to work dat ass
cause yo, I love it when you take charge, so honey ride me
put me under submission and just tie me up
but when I reup, you can bet
I leave that pussy drippin wet
but I ain't finished yet
you dressed in fishnet, body glistenin with sweat
I guarantee you won't regret the very day we met
I got you set, to bust into a latha of lust from bodies bangin
it's just the two of us
and a gallon of Bacardi
invite ya girlfriends ova so we can have a party
get freaky and ménage à trois
we can do this in the car tonight
girl you fuckin with a star tonight

[chorus: Greg Valentine]
  it ain't a thing for you to swing 
  in my ride and lose the scene 
  do this thing you look so fine
  I've just got to make you mine
  now I don't know what you gonna do
  but I'm bout ready to move on you
  tonight I'd like to groove with you
  tonight I'd like to groove with you
  I'm bout ready to move on you

yeah, that's how we put it down, all city
all city, baby, east new york to west side
all over the world
for the ladies</pre>
