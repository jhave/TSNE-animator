Song:   Stunt Hard
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is
(Stunt hard)

[Drake]
I tell her
I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, "Who is he?"
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door, focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better then your idol?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully let them see
What they say that I'm gon' be
And if not our whole future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet then to be
On the stand jeopardizing every inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane pick a lane. That's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve
Without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos wit hater niggas and crop them
I am not them. I photoshop them, out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm about
Yeah
The Chris Paul
Of this fall
Sittin' this tall
I float high
Goodbye
I will miss y'all

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is
(Stunt hard)

[Lil Wayne]
If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled
I'm a young rebel
And I got a babyface
I need a young Pebbles
I need a stuntdouble
Yeah!
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles
Yeah!
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes
Yeah!
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O
Yeah!
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious
Yeah!
I'm on the cup of that tilt
And if you hatin' on me
I'll say fuck you like Wilt
Yeah!
Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace
Yeah!
Talkin' big big shit
I am rude
I take food
From a kid picnic
Nigga
Yeah!
And we can bang like bumper cars
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars
Haha

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is
(Stunt hard)

[Nut Da Kid]
I stunt hard. I stunt harder
Boy they call me Jackie Chan in New Orleans
I ball hard. So I'm a ball hogger
And I go hard and I dunk like Vince Carter
I hustle harder
I live in the Carter
I think forward
All I see is tommorow
I need meat
I'll turn your shop into a horror
So if you trying to see more
Better feed me
I'm back on my grizzy like Izzy Efeger
Don't he look like a black grizzly in that black fur?
And the Feds will never get me
Like a backwards
Password
Black spur
Go some like Pacman, cats first
Vanilla Ice got 'em hangin over the banister
Ask her
Am I their man
Her answer
Is yessir
Shit
I'm tourin' state to state
I played the RTA
'Bout a quarter a day
Now tell them bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
I did it all on my own
Turned a chair to a throne
I'm a king in this world
(Stunt hard)
I put my whole city on
To some things that they never would've known
If I didn't
(Stunt hard)
And every night is a premiere
If I ever dissapear
Best believe I'm comin' back
(Stunt hard)
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again
On that same shit again
All I ever do is
(Stunt hard)</pre>
