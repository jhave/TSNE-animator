[Lil Wayne]
yeahhh!!

[Verse 1]
I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her i'm the one she should be wit
She's popular wit all the guys
Only thing in my eyes
I can see her in my life
She woulda had the world if she were mine
But see she had other plans
I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends
Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all..

[Hook]
She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cuz she didnt think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

[Verse 2]
They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend, every year
She can't keep a man who's tame
When they can hardly remember her name, (haaa!)
She did everything she could
Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone
Askin herself, where did she go wrong?
She didn't realize
She chased the type of guys
Who don't believe in ties
Tryin to apologize
Never forget the day
She left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all..

[Hook]
She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cuz she didnt think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

[Lil Wayne- Ad-libs]
Yeahh!!
Yeah...uh
Uh
Whew!

[Hook]
She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cuz she didnt think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around
