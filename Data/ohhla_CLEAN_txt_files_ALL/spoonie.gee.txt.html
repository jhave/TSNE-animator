[ VERSE 1 ]
Now girls call me lover, sometimes the rhyme sayer
I could be president, but I'll settle for mayor
With money in my pocket, girls at my side
Sit back and relax while we cruise in my ride
Not alone when I'm home, even when I'm asleep
If you've never been, girl, please come, cause I'm deep
Never broke one promise, won't break your heart
If you want me, baby, tell me when, so you can start
With Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

Yes, girl
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now you can give me your number and the place you live
If you're feelin down, baby, uplift I'll give
No frontin, no schemin, only doin the do
And if you play hard to get, you won't get got, it's true
I know Thomas's promises, so tell me your name
You're not sayin, cause you're playin, this is your last game
With Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

I am
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

[ VERSE 3 ]
Can't stop the feelin once I hit my feet
If I order, young lady, want it nice and sweet
Not sour, I'll devour, and it won't last long
Like a weight that's too heavy, so I gotta be strong
She'll be cheating, then weeding her clothes at the door
With the note that I wrote: 'I don't want you no more'
So don't turn around, baby, go straight ahead
Stop cryin, cause you're lyin, what you're sayin is dead
It's Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

I am
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

Spoonie Gee

(Come get it, baby)
(Gonna make a million dollars)
(Don't stop now, honey, get down)

I am Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee...

(Get down)

I am
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee

[ VERSE 4 ]
So don't ever cross me in no kind of way
And if you come to my house you see a bed to slay
I'm not tryin to be cute, but I admit you're fine
And I can see you and me walkin down the line
Say 'I' and don't lie, say 'do' as well
And if you don't decide, only time will tell
I'm not tryin to run your life, only give an advice
Soon to be you and me, well, it would be nice

Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee

Spoonie Gee

I am
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
Spoonie Gee
