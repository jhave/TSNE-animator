[Intro/Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I just wanna rock you, all night long, oh oh oh oh! (I wanna rock you)
I just wanna rock you, all night long, oh oh oh oh!

[Verse 1: Eve]
Yo! Need you to understand me daddy I ain't your average
Baby girl doin it all I'm well established
I ain't tryin to lead you on just wanna ask
If you might wanna give me your name explain your status
You know I see you in time and time you seem available
Don't mean shit, I know these bitches wanna settle you
Gotta say you on my short list of few
Them other dudes is ok but I'm feelin you
Want you in the best way what you 'gon do about it?
Why don't you just test me you won't want to do without it
Yo I'm comin at you hard bein a thug
And I ain't givin up till I get that gangsta love, uh huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Eve]
I know you seen me this night that night, always my shit tight
Hair done, outfit crazy, skirts fit just right
Wife-beater with a bangin tan
Walk in demandin all eyes baby here I am
Ain't a shame in my frame and I know your watchin
Puttin on a show for you pop and I ain't stoppin
Lot of action in your corner yeah you gonna do
Only thing to make it better though is me with you
And I know you feelin that regardless of your frontin
And I heard through the streets it was me you wantin
Let me find out you shy or somethin
But I know your not, so stop the games and approach is you real or not?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Eve]
Yo! Uh! Ok! Numbers exchange, now it's in place
Shouldn't have took you so long in the first place
I'm just playin cutie, yeah give me a call
No it's cool you ain't got to see me to my car
See I'm a big girl, but you'll find out
Stop for me while I drop top and ride out
Wheels spinnin wanna know what shorty all about
But it's cool I'm proven in these words that's comin out my mouth

[Alicia Keys]
It's that gangsta lovin (Gangsta) that's just got me buggin (Buggin)
It's that gangsta lovin (Gangsta gangsta) that just got me buggin
(Oh ah!)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
I wanna rock you baby, I wanna hold you baby
Won't you be my baby? I wanna be your lady
I wanna rock you baby, I wanna hold you baby
Won't you be my baby? I wanna be your lady
Baby let me rock with you (Gangsta gangsta)
You know I wanna rock with you (Gangsta gangsta)
Baby let me rock with you (E-V-E)
You know I wanna rock with you (Alicia Keys, gonna rock you)
Baby let me rock with you
You know I wanna rock with you (It's gangsta gangsta)
Baby let me rock with you (Gangsta gangsta)
You know I wanna rock with you (Gangsta gangsta love)
Ooooh, yeah, you know I wanna rock with you
Baby let me rock with you</pre>
