"S1 got the heat!"

[Adam Levine]
My, yeah, yeah, mm

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
But there's no place to go-ohh-ohh
No place to go-ohh-ohh
And all the confusion, it's an illusion
Like a movie, I got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, hey

[50 Cent]
Yeah, '03 I went from back filthy to filthy rich
Man they emotions change so I could never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggaz get on, they turned around and spit
right in my face so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
Cause I'm not writin anymore, they not makin hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter, entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver, what's it to ya?
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my +Recovery+, my comeback kid

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin shed sharpenin my machete
Sippin on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready
to wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spa-GET-EVEN!
Think you fuckin meatballs keep on just for-getting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker it's only the be-ginning
He's buggin again, he's straight thuggin, fuck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal cords out and have them bitches plugged in the
motherfuckin wall with 3,000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end, dump them then plug them motherfuckers in each
one of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fuckin see
That'll teach you to go voicin your cocksuckin opinion to me!
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, FUCK letting up
You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah it's happening again
And I'm thinkin about the same, motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch BUT 50!
Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go
Swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody KNOWS!
I'm trapped so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right into this bubble, uh-oh guess it's bubble wrap
It's like a vicious cycle, my life is in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn out like it did
Feels like I'm goin +Psycho+ again, and I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would've never made "Recovery" kid
Cause I'm runnin in circles with

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I haven't been this fuckin confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it +3 a.m.+ in the mornin like Shady
+Psycho+ killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire, liar liar
Tryin to say this ain't classic get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic, pussy now pick a casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic, it's sad it's
never gonna end, now we #1 again
with that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift, God-given
like the air in the lungs of e'ry fuckin thing livin

[Chorus]</pre>
