Song:   Great Times Are Coming
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope you're ready
I see them coming around
I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope your ready
I see them coming around

So let's celebrate the good times
Celebrate the good times
Celebrate the good times
I just want to have myself a good time

Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise

I'm ready for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time

I'mma rock out hell yea hell hell
Get the party poppin'
Keep it rockin 'up in here
I be in the party with my hands in the air
I go out and party like I just don't care
Put your drinks up let's make a toast up in here
We gon' do it big in the most up in here
I just want to chill with sexy mamas up in here
Don't want no drama up in here
Let's get ready yea yeah

I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope you're ready
I see them coming around
I hope you're ready
Great times are coming
I hope your ready
I see them coming around

Lets celebrate the good times
Celebrate the good times
Celebrate the good times
I just want to have myself a good time

Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise
Make some noise

I'm ready for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time
I'm living for the good time, good time, good time

Everybody in the place to be
Make some noise....</pre>
