Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire

He rocks a big blue ? cable, a ping pong table for a ring
He's mentally unstable, to him murder it ain't no thing
He'll do you dirty style, he's holding dirty vile
He's out pumping on the corner, trying to stay warm and keep it cool like Miles
He keeps it fundamental
He's got the jeans and the bubblegoose on
There's murder on his mental
He's got the deuce deuce in his palm
And y'all know the fable, how Cain did Abel
Ever since the beginning, the world keeps spinning just like a turntable

Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la la la

When it's selling out back, likes to pump crack
To the fiends that be getting high
He keeps a hand on the pump, he's ready to dump
On any chump that would even try
He got a finger on the trigger, he ain't scared to pull it
Head full of liquor, boy you might catch a bullet
The hoes in the stable and drugs on the table
Everybody's sittin' round watchin' cops on the cable
Dressed like a slob, keeps his hair braided
He's never been robbed, he's only been raided
He's never known joy, the boy is so jaded
He's never been loved, he's only been hated
His soul's on ice, his heart is stone
Just another dead king rotting on his throne
With a pain that would cut you down to the bone
You're born alone, boy, you die alone

Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire

Two pieces of drama, the hammer's bout to fall
Two pieces of drama, there's gunplay in the hall
Make peace with your momma, the consequence is dire
Two pieces of drama, boy you know not to play with fire</pre>
