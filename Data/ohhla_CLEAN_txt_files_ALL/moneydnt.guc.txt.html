[Intro]
We gon' do it like this y'all, we gon' do it like that y'all
We gon' do it like this y'all, we gon' do it like that y'all

[Gucci Mane - over Intro]
It's your man Laflare
Frank Nitti on the trank

[Chorus One]
All the money don't matter to me (to me)
And all the ice don't matter to me (to me)
Your girlfriends don't matter to me (to me)
And your nigga don't matter to me (ayy)
Cause I don't mean to flatter you
but you the baddest chick I ever seen (you the bbadest chick I ever seen)
Come play on Gucci team
Every good King needs a Queen (needs a Queen)
The way you walk is, so sexy; the way you talk is, so sexy
The way you move is, so sexy; everything about you girl
(Everything about you girl)

[Chorus Two]
My eyes deceiving me - she wants to be with me
She wants to sleep with me - Gucci needs two or three
I keep you icy (so icy) I have you super fresh (so fresh)
I know you like me; you like the way I dress

[Gucci Mane]
Baby in love with me, I'm in like with her
Gave me some head, I spent one night with her
Keep a college girl past her curfew
Say she like me and she like her too
Get a bitch, suck a dick, what she gon' do?
Point at the house had to put it on you
Tell your girlfriend and your best friend too
You can bring the whole dorm, they can have some fun too

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Gucci Mane]
A pretty young thang in some apple bottom jeans
Gold tooth man for the Gucci Mane team
Say she like the way my gold grill gleam
And my chain hang low down to my ding-a-ling
Got a bad yellow thang down at the AU
Kinda heard she was thorough but the shit ain't true
I give the bitch the world but she don't know what to do
Parasuco outfits, icy fresh hairdos

[Chorus One]

[Torica]
We hit the Louis shop
Cause all we do is shop
Shut down the parkin lot
When we jumped out the truck!
Jeans and a halter top
They askin what's my name
Money don't matter
Torica and Gucci Mane

[Gucci Mane]
I'ma watch you through the hood on my 26's
Buy you a bracelet real expensive
Gucci only holla at the baddest bitches
Love the way a boss bitch handle her business
Gucci Mane, Laflare, in a Chevy fo'-do'
Fly down the street with my second screen hoe
Gotta move the blow but it's on the D-low
That's what they made the trains and the Greyhounds fo'

[Chorus One]</pre>
