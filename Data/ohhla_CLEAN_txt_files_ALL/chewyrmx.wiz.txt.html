Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeahhh!
That's exactly what I tell these hoes
[? ] type a brotha
Fly head to toe (WOO!)
I gotta lot of swag
Need a professional
And get this doggy bag
Just I'm head to go

Yeah I rappin
All the hoes wanna sing to me
Do a couple things to me
Make her bring the team to me (Team to me)
I don't wanna fuck (Nope!)
It might seem rude (It might)
A little attitude
Probably gotta mean chew (Wow!)
You a bad bitch
With a couple bad friends
I could let you rock the mic
She could do the ad libs (Do the ad libs)
They say I'm aggin
Nah home, I'm gettin paid (Get money!)
Shine while I'm young
Balls in the shade (Shade)
So ya best, best hop your ass in the ling (Ling)
Fix your doobie up, (Up!)
And start to chew me up (Up!)
You wanna screw me, what? (What?)
Fuck your old man (Man)
Gettin top notch, with no hangers (Nah!)

Two!
Shawty, whatchu doin tonight?
Doin tonight?
Doin tonight?
I'm all up here cause you lookin right
You lookin right
You lookin right
Keep sayin that chu wouldn't
But I know that chu might
I know that chu might
I know that chu might
See I'm tryin to get it chewy tonight
Tonight
A good night

And that's exactly what I tell the bitch, (Beetch!)
Ain't got the time to easy your mind
I'm on some other shit (Sheett!)
Know what you're fuckin with? (What?)
A young star, baby!
Ever met a nigga like me? (Nope!)
Not at all, baby (Yeahhh!)
A coach player
I could show you how to ball, baby (Baby)
And live today
Cause I ain't worried about tomorrow, baby (Nah!)
You heard my song, (Like my songs?)
You seen my face around, (Round)
So now it's you and me
So take this good weed and break it down (Break it down)
Spot boppers
Shawty talkin bout skating now (Now)
And given brains
Let me know just what she thinkin bout (Wow!)
Burning trees
Courtesy of my Jamaican pal (Pal)
Gettin all this money
With all these honeys I could make em pout (Make em pout)
Now I could make you smile, (Smile)
Or I can make you moan (Moan)
Turn you into my number one fan if I take you home (Take you home)
Want me to break you off? (Break ya off?)
I'm thinking more about the money, (Money!)
The money's what I'm thinking about (Thinkin bout)

Hey
Shawty, whatchu doin tonight?
Doin tonight?
Doin tonight?
I'm all up here cause you lookin right
You lookin right
You lookin right
Keep sayin that chu wouldn't
But I know that chu might
I know that chu might
I know that chu might
See I'm tryin to get it chewy tonight
Tonight
Good night
