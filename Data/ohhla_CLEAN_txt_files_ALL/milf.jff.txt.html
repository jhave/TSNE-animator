[Hook]
She left the kids at home
Now shes all at the Club
Backing it up on me
Showing your boy some love
But what I didn't say
that chick about thirty five
but she get low low low
Like she bout twenty five

Man shes a Milf A Milf
All of my boys want to hit it
That Girls a Milf A Milf
Cant wait till I get with her
Oh she a Milf
Shes a Milf (aye, aye)
Shes a Milf shes a Milf
(aye) shes a Milf

[Verse 1]
Now the kids at home and you came here partying
Trying to get stretched out no accordions
mama you thirty think its really Worthy 
To cause a whole scene for this audience
James Blunt said your beautiful
I I I think I'm just new to you
Tight jeans show your apple bottoms
Don't wear that if the style less suiting you
Your fine as Naomi Campbell
Still young we can make this scandal
A bit clear if we fix this angel
I'll Beat it up like I took a sample
Early Early words
you appeal as a early bird
I'm not use to these early terms
straighten you out like a early perm

[Verse 2]
Your a mom A mom I would like too
Pu-ah Pu-ah Pu-ah pump up your volume
I'm a X factor please miss Malcolm
You could suck me all dry no vac-um
U enjoy all this night life
And you sure not the type that I might wife
But for your age I keep the right pipe
Guess I gotcha all covered like a highlight
We Sync real good cause I'm young
Treat your back like a bongo Drum
Boom boom pow black eye peas
That's the sound with a guy like me
Your so inn, mature and attractive
I might do you  twice like a adlibb
Hit once drop by on the back end
Dive all on your bed like I crashed in

[Bridge]
M to the I
L to the F
Where my Milfs at
Throw your hands in the Air for me
If your a sexy Mama
Throw your hands up
If your a Sexy Mama
Put your hands up</pre>
