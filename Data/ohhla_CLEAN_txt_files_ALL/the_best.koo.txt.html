[Kool Keith]
Yeah
American and European, national champion
Kool Keith, you know who I am
The master man, Willie Biggs, big status
Droppin nine-six and seven, big status
Skill.. lotto winners

I taught New York City, the five boroughs how to rap
You can take that back, and pull them thongs our your rectum crack
I'm +Poppa Large+, big daddy, big penis in a Caddy
Retro petrol, I run that whole metro-politan area,
burnin ya, the style is scarin ya
You don't know, and half of y'all brothers can't flow
I'm Texas Swift, down South, they call me Frankie Joe
Keep pushin rigs, Mack trucks, drop off your girl's wigs
I'm strictly business, no gimmicks, a rhymin expert
No common style, or wack logo, cheap hip-hop shirt
You best to be prepared, paperclips, on your mouth
I rock Virginia, tag Atlanta, 95 South
Then hit Miami, let the girls feel my stiff jammy
I'm national kid, girls like the way I dress

Chorus: Kool Keith (repeat 2X)

I'm still the best, I'm still the best, East to West
Joe Kingpin, big stack, money Willie Biggs

[Kool Keith]
Superfly get back, your whole group is +Freddie's Dead+
Rap style pee stain, like yellow spots on your bed
I'm Jay Gloom, on the strets, still walkin doo doo
You can't stop me, step off, now let your girl jock me
I ride a bus and tail just like a Kawasaki
motorcycles with big gloves, I'm here to damage ya
Political style flop, your child play is amateur
Yo take that word, I rip your anus, youse a herb
I get in rectum, zoom focus on your whole room
Wear green capes and walk in clubs like I'm Dr. Dooom
Handblock double switch monkey style, flying horsemen
Crab leg, walk on top of rappers, then I cross men
I be the Silver Surfer, glidin with a fly leather
Wig, gold chains, my glasses fog in the rainy weather
We do this like Brutus, I make you say, "Who dis?"
The man on the mic's right, cover your styles tonight
I do my duty destruct, take skin off your booty
Masquerade man is ill, Keith spinnin reel to reel
	Who play the number tonight?  I put six on a five
	Shoulda combinated, go ahead baby

Chorus 2X

	Big Willie, Big Willie
	Big Willie-heyyyeah-heyyy
	Big Willie, Big Willie
	Big Willie heiyyyyyy

[Kool Keith]
You're not competition, no joke, I know your kinfolks
That sloppy Gotti style just a bowl of Wheat Oats
No matter how mean or point blank hard you look
I cover my eye, retarded bugged like I'm Captain Hook
Like Vincent Price, I'm nice, I bake and coke you twice
Your crew is rat turd, your parakeet flow is bird
At my night show lick my pubic hair, tell me word
I'm basic nasty, with tight moves, smart like Lassie
Classical winner bass, pumpin while your sound is thinner
I kick back, with drawers off, invite your girl to dinner
Get sexy raw, the champagne pours even more
No forcefield, I rhyme erotic, feel myself on tour
I'm so delicate, countin cash, too intelligent
	Yeah, I bought the dream book
	Gon' play what I got to play tomorrow
	Do this right, yeah

Chorus 2X

	Best, East to West
	Best, East to West, Big Willliehaeyyy
	Best, East to West
	Best, East to West, hooo hoo ho hoooo
	Best, East to West
	Best, East to West, heyyyy heyy, heyyy heyy, heyyy heyyaheahhh</pre>
