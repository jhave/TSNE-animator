(Greg Nice)
I gotta funky funky rhyme with a funky style
I gotta funky funky rhyme with a funky funky style
I gotta funky rhyme... wit a funky funky style
I gotta funky rhyme... wit a funky funky style

Pete's rickety rocket was my favorite cartoon
After marriage the honeymoon
I'll be damn gag me with a spoon
Who loves Popeye, Alice the goon
Ladies let your body flow
Send a chill up your spine like an eskimo
Here's a backstage pass to a funky show
Come give me a kiss under the missle toe
Greg Nice, my lifes like a fairy tale
Orca, was a great big whale
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
You won't tell, I won't tell
Clientele I must excel
Took a little test, I passed then failed
Breaks... HUH, no need to hit'em
Skins, ya got 'em - I wanna get wit 'em!

(Chorus)
Nice &amp; Smooth is funky
Also hip-hop junkies
All we wanna do...
Is Unh Unh and you...

Nice &amp; Smooth is funky
Also hip-hop junkies
All we wanna do...
Is Unh Unh, oh yeah

(Smooth B)
Yo, I gotta funky funky rhyme wit a funky funky style
Funky rhyme wit a funky funky style
Funky funky rhyme wit a funky funky style
I gotta funky rhyme wit a funky funky style

Got outta my about eight
And then I called Greg Nice cause it wasn't too late
To get some skins and come around the block
Cause man, my tip is harder than a rock
He said bet, so I let
Greg Nice call this girl named Annazette
Annazette, the teacher's pet
You sure shes gonna come on this set
He said Smooth B don't you fret
My twive is on his way yo, quite as kept
The tall slim, fly kid with dope steps
Yep, coming with a box of hats
Yo Greg Nice is that girl all that
He said Smooth B the skins is fat
I don't beg cause cause I'm not at begonia
I dress warm so that I won't catch pneumonia
My rhymes are stronger than ammonia
I'm a diamond, you're a cubic zirconia (repeats &amp; fades away)

(Chorus) x5
Nice &amp; Smooth is funky
Also hip-hop junkies
All we wanna do...
Is Unh Unh and you...</pre>
