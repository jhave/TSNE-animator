[Tyga: Verse 1]
Fuck that, fuck shit pay me
Rumors come and go, so I stay in a room presidential lately
Top of the roof, if a nigga start hating
Talk that shit, I aim for debating
Man I swear the game got so Clay Aiken
Bought a new crib, your bitch says it's spacious, Hagh
Ride to the motha fucken money (yeah)
Man I swear this shit about nothing (yeah)
Why you niggaz ballin on a budget
Boy don't get close, I press that button mothafucka
Leave a nigga roughed up, David Ruffin, Hagh
Niggaz washed up, start scrubbing
Nigga get you covered in some clovers
You're an unlucky, mothafucka
Don't be fuckin wit a young nigga
That's T-Many, one fuckin problem
Really monsters need a doctor
I'm the sickest nigga bout it
No deciding, just a silence
On the sizzle, P90
Kill yourself like you're in college
It's finals; cocky
Bitch don't fight it (uhh)
Viam turn to violence (uhh)
Cash money party, guess you broke niggaz ain't invited
Got a bad bitch riding
She dumb but she get knowledge
I ain't come to be vibing but my personality vibrant
I'm in love wit nobody, white bitches they hotties
Hop up off my crotch, I'm the shit, need a potty
She lucky she with me
Unlike them other niggaz, I got it
T la-di-da-di, welcome to my house party

[Chorus 2X: Tyga]
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up
Fuck nigga, get yo bands up
We getting money, we turnt up

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Yellow bitch and I got this
It's that black market, I'm shopping (uhh)
Last Kings and we bossing
Well I'm the first queen there's no option (uhh)
I heard they hating, I don't give a fuck
Tell 'em to fuck and suck on my cunt
Bitch get some dick cus you doing too much
I'm getting mine and enough ain't enough
Getting richer
Money perfect picture
Oh no, I ain't messing at the studio with your ninja
Top the name, I diss her
Kill your bitch, you gon' miss her
Bring that body shop and now watch that coffin fit her
Funeral home, bring you to the zone
Get you and your crew, or just you alone
I don't give a fuck, I don't take no breaks
Body your ho put her in her place
Now I'm out (uhh)
Don't try it at your house
Young gold Asian, and they know what I'm 'bout, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga]</pre>
