[Blueprint] Yeah yeah...

[Chorus 4X: Blueprint]
Drugs (drugs) sex (sex)
Alcohol (alcohol) rock-n-roll (rock-n-roll)

[Blueprint]
Uhh, he never had a drink 'til he was 21 (alcohol)
He said he didn't need it just to have fun (alcohol)
Graduated from school and started his career (alcohol)
Started poppin up at happy hour havin beers (alcohol)
The first few months it felt great (alcohol)
He was a casual drinker, it was an escape (alcohol)
He passed out a couple times but it was nothin major (alcohol)
Started keepin alcohol in his refrigerator (alcohol)
Sometimes he couldn't wake up the next day (alcohol)
Sometimes he walked into work late (alcohol)
But none of those things seemed to bother him (alcohol)
But he was slippin on the work that was assigned to him (alcohol)
But on the flipside he felt more confident (alcohol)
Because he finally had the nerve to talk to chicks (alcohol)
He felt like his life was really gettin better (alcohol)
The next day he found his termination letter, it was the..

[Chorus]

(Drugs, sex...)

[Blueprint]
Uh-huh... she never had sex 'til she was 21 (sex)
She felt like it wasn't right without love (sex)
In church, they always called it a sin (sex)
They told her, to stay away from young men (sex)
She learned love, from the books she would read (sex)
And from the soap operas she would watch on TV (sex)
But deep inside, she wanted the same thing (sex)
But they said it wasn't right without a wedding ring (sex)
But her father never practiced what he preached (sex)
He used to creep into her room when she was sleep (sex)
And touch her in ways you don't touch a kid (sex)
Made her promise she would never tell what he did (sex)
And as much as she didn't wanna touch him (sex)
It was the first time she ever felt wanted (sex)
Until this day, she never quite recovered (sex)
So when she has sex now it's with a woman!

[Chorus]
