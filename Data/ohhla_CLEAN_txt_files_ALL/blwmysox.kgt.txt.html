(Suck my dick)

Yeah
Check it out y'all
I see Tha Alkaholiks just stepped in the house
In the middle of vocals
Check this out
Bobcat's in the house
Big Mac's in the house
And all the bitches in -
Check - wait
Speakin of bitches, you know
Check this shit out

[ VERSE 1 ]
Hoes don't know, man, hoes don't know
All they have to do is blow my socks off and go
And ain't no need to kick it, cause we're not goin out
No movies, no grub, no pancake house
I thought you knew the deal, I thought you knew who I was
I spring for the budge, so you can get a buzz
If you're a real cutie we can hop to the snooty
And I slap that and tap that and wax that booty
Just ask all your friends, they'll tell you the proof
Give your sole to the lord and hand me the boots
Cause I can make em scream, I can make em holler
Don't ask me for no change, cause I won't give a dollar
Cause bitches be trippin when you ain't got the ends
You ain't got the Benz, well, you ain't got the skins
So I don't play the games, cause these hoes been tossed
Straight out, you little hooker, just blow my socks off

(Gobblin up nuts, sort of like a humming bird)  --&gt; Ice Cube
(Suck my dick)
(Suck my dick)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Blow it, baby, blow it, then lick them nuts
Boy, you drive me nuts, socks fly when you suck
My ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-lingy, long like a slinky
Let me reach around and tease your nipple with my pinky
Tramp, don't front, I know you're out there skeezin
Kam said you do it like 'every single weekend'
Walkin round the club straight lookin for a trick
But Tee'll never slip, cause I never trick my dick
Hoes try to flip sayin that I look tacky
Even though I'm dipped in a fresh pair of khakis
And got the nerve to say I'm bony and I'm phoney
Just because I won't take your ugly ass around my homies
Cause I know you wanna fuck the whole crew
First Starvin and Bobcat, Wavey and Pooh
So I don't play the games, cause these hoes been tossed
Straight out, you little biatch, just blow my socks off

(Gobblin up nuts, sort of like a humming bird)  --&gt; Ice Cube
(Suck my dick)
(Suck my dick)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Like I said in the first verse, I can make em holler
And King Tee won't turn down nothin but the collar
Not lookin for a lover, just a good dick sucker
Jimmy'll rise when I hear the lips pucker
Suckin and smackin, gaggin and slurpin
Grab you by the head, cause your tongue keep workin
A bitch'll stand up and say that she don't give head
That bitch'll suck your dick like she was bein cum-fed
So (blow me, blow me) even though you don't know me
(Show me, show me) and then show my homie
And I don't play the games, cause these hoes been tossed
Straight out, you little hooker, just blow my socks off

(Gobblin up nuts, sort of like a humming bird)  --&gt; Ice Cube
(Suck my dick)
(Suck my dick)

Yeah
Straight out to all them Compton hoes
Ya know what I'm sayin
Bobcat's on the funky track
Tha Alkaholiks in the house
And I'm out
