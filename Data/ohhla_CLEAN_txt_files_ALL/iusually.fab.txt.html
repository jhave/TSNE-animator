[Intro]
Uh uh uh
Yeah yeah yeah haha

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I beep my horn and they come to the car
Damn right, they come to a stall
That's right, it come with the car
Now tell your boss, you cant come in tomorr
My dro come by the jar
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?
Nah nigga I ain't come here to spar
These hallow tips will come where you are
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers
Two steppin and movin my shoulders
Now the money's rollin in
We got bottles lined up like bowlin pins
Mami, you standin with a slouch
Starin at me, while I'm standin on the couch
Come and get in the blue flames
Have a sip of this blue shit and lets rock!

[Chorus]
Now you know I don't usually do this
But you lookin good tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon smoke tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon drink tonight
And you know I don't usually do this
But you gon fuck tonight

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Now.. Who's hot? Who's not?
I can take the few shots you've got
I can burn a few knots you've got
I can blow the few spots you've got
But, I chill, I will
Get it to poppin whenever I feel
I still shut it down
And I white and yellow stud it down
Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round
Take the birdies and putt it down
Like Tiger Woods did it, but I'm hood with it
You've never seen a thug look as good with it
And I promise that
Fuck with me, you better move where 'sama's at
You see I'm in here with the white ones on
Tryin to get fucked up 'for the lights come on (let's go)

[Chorus]</pre>
