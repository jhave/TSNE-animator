[Juice] (B-Girl?)
Uh J-U
(B-girl in the house)
Hey this goes out to all my writers in the house tonight...aight
(You ladies too)
Hey ya'll keep it tight
(Keep writin')
Keep learnin' how to right
(That's right)
Can't stop us...one nation..uh!

[Verse 1]
First I was born in America
Made in a factory
I been cloned and there's a million others comin' after me
And once I'm put in the hands of the right person
My ink gets incrested on property to cursin'
Since birth I was capped and sealed inside a package
And business people tend to use me more than even rappers
Now I'm at your local drug store Office Depot
Waitin' to get barred or stole by all my people
As soon as I'm purchased I begin to get excited
Simple scripture intricate I help my own to write it
My makers they found a thousand ways to improve me
And once I'm in your paper its hard to remove me
I come in every color scheme that's in the rainbow
But black is most used that's just how the game goes
I'm at my best when my owner is obsessed with fame
Skinny or fat I'm all that and can you guess my name?

[Juice]
Hey yo this is for my writers my real graffiti writers
Pump ya' fist in the air throw up ya' lighters
We all got a little B-boy livin' inside us
So this is for my real graffiti writers

[B-Girl?]
This for my writers my real graffiti writers
Pump ya' fist in the air throw up ya' lighters
We all got a little B-girl livin' inside us
So this is for my writers, my writers, my writers

[Verse 2]
And all ya'll wanna know why I'm so tough you ask
Cuz' I'm permanent and sharp enough to cut through glass
I'm sharp enough to cut the blunt you use to puff indo
I'm the reason you can barely see out your bus window
Whether you peace in the East or fresh in the West
Go to school and you can see my influence on ya' desk
At most schools I'm barred for being hardcore
But your art teacher uses me to cut his cardboard
Markers and pens they cool but isn't for me
Cuz' when I do my thing it's a whole different story
Spray paint and markers yeah they all the way live
But when they get removed only what's scribed will survive
Cops catch you with me and you'll get the same heat
And I help my owners rep it from clubs to train seats
I wont tell you I'm a stencil I'll let you pencil it in
Cuz' that glass is all I'm ever really interested in

[Juice]
Hey yo this is for my writers my real graffiti writers
Pump ya'll fist in the air throw up ya' lighters
We all got a little B-boy livin' inside us
So this is for my real graffiti writers (Yo)

[B-Girl?]
This for my writers my real graffiti writers
Pump ya' fist in the air throw up ya' lighters
We all got a little B-girl livin' inside us
So this is for my writers, my writers, my writers

[Verse 3]
Hey yo last but not least I'm like a gun in ya' hand
I spit venom all day and I come in a can
I'm hip hop to the bone like the rhymes and the beats
And I'm always under pressure 'til the time of release
I leave in bloody where I'm aiming to
Have him raining blue-green or red
I spit heat twice and plus I'm flammable
For hip hoppers I'm what's sprayed most next to the lead
For the gangsters I'm how they show respect for they dead
I'm sold in over six million forty five places
In the hood I'm always used to immortalize faces
I'm culture pride from backpacks to nap-sacks
And when I'm done right all the work I do is that phat
So whether you the best or you gonna be the tightest
This is for my writers my real graffiti writers
Just hold ya' hand steady and whatever the day
Shake me up a couple times and then I'm ready to spray

[Juice]
Hey yo this is for my writers my real graffiti writers
Pump ya'll fist in the air throw up ya' lighters
We all got a little B-boy livin' inside us
So this is for my real graffiti writers (Yo)

[B-Girl?]
