Hey there little mama
Why don't you come and take a ride with me
Around the tooooo-own
On the low, we could be going dooo-own baby
Hey there little mama
Why don't you come and take a ride with me
We could smoke us a poooo-ound
Hit the Telly, and can and gon cloooo-own baby

[Z-Ro]
Well uh excuse me miss, I don't wanna take up your time
And this ain't none of that kitty game, with the same old pick up line
I'ma get straight to the point, you are as lovely as a rose
Though I'm not into one night stands, I'm eager to see you out your clothes
Please don't take it the wrong way, I'm just spectating
But I won't lie, and say I'm not thinking about sex making
It was on my mind real strong, but I don't wanna rush
We can remain friends, for a real long time
By then I'd know, if I've been dealing with a strong mind
Either business brain, the drugged up and gone mind
But that's irrelevant, I'm speaking for the present baby
Tell your girls you gon holla, jump in my Intrepid baby
Unless they wanna come, and kick it with my homies
If not, me and you could kick it and leave em all lonely
I got a lot of women on my phone, trying to lay with me
But just for tonight, I want yourself to come and stay with me

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Papa was a rolling stone, and he still rolling
I guess that's why, I leave a lot of pussy holes swollen
I must of got it from my dad, this macking in me
Plus all the ladies, love this big dick I'm packing with me
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hit and run, anytime
You make time for me, then you can come and sit and give me some
Trying to handcuff me, you moving too quick
Not trying to be seen in public with you, at the movies and shit
Chances are you got a man, he gon be mad if he see you
So let's keep our thing undercover, so nobody know what we do
Long as we do it like that, we can do it long
Make it a while since we did it last, so we do it strong
It's in my blood, to be as straight up as I can be
And straight up I can see you in my jacuzzi, chilling with me
Though I got a lot of women on my phone, trying to lay with me
Just for tonight, I want yourself to come and stay with me

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I feel my cell phone vibrate, I wonder who could it be
Another bad ass yellow bone, talking dirty to me
She say she ready for me, to come and make my round
Telling me how she gon do me, I'm ready to break right now
As soon as I got in my ride, 'fore I made it out the driveway
The twins hit my celly, said that they were coming my way
Double the pleasure double the fun, I can't miss that
A menage with the Asian persuasion, I had to hit that
Making money all day long, is what I love
But I'm trying to give up a minute or two, so you can fuck a thug
And I won't waste your time, not a minute man
Laying pipe with long jevity, always I'll be in it man
And once I reach my conclusion, that ain't the end
I'm just giving you a breather, baby go on and catch a wind
Maybe that's the reason, all these women wanna lay with me
I'll show you if you want me to, just spend the night and play with me
