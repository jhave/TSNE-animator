Daisy, oh you're so shapely
Open your eyes up, if you wise up you could be a lady
Yeah, yeah

[ VERSE 1 ]
Let's take this from the top
I wanna talk about a girl who's been around the block
She seems like a sweet chick, she's a beatnik
Or so I heard from other cats that she sleeps with
She'll hold a conversation light as a twig
With a song and dance about likin to live
And before you know it she slipped out of the party
To paint the town with another Goodtime Charlie
She likes diamonds and cashmere
But she'll settle for a dinner and cab fare
Back in school she was a bad Betty
Who had to go steady with Chad, Derrick and Eddy
Now she's graduated to a home-wrecker
Who never regrets, so save the lecture
You're stylish and cavalier
But sweetie, you need to take a look in the mirror

Daisy, oh you're so shapely
Open your eyes up, if you wise up you could be a lady
Yeah, yeah
She's danger and you can't save her
So call the reverend, why in heaven can't you be a lady?
Yeah yeah

Let's take this from the top
Let's take this from the top

[ VERSE 2 ]
She seems straight off a billboard
With the looks girls kill for
But she swings like Happy Gilmore
I know one cat claimin in love
While she runs around and drags his name in the mud
Impersonating the good girl like charades
Sold your soul, she's as cold as the Ice Capade
You'll be in a dump feelin stabbed in the back
While she's puffin on a cigarette havin a laugh
Buddy, you barked up the wrong tree
So sing a new song and keep it on key
And don't let the freak crawl back on your love seat
Say, "Don't touch me, please move your butt cheek"
She's a tramp, you can ask Ol' Blue Eyes
Or Prince, who said act your age not your shoe size
Girls, if you don't wanna be lonely
Well, show a little class quick fast, so you won't be

Daisy, oh you're so shapely
Open your eyes up, if you wise up you could be a lady
Yeah, yeah
She's danger and you can't save her
So call the reverend, why in heaven can't you be a lady?
Yeah yeah

Let's take this from the top
Let's take this from the top

Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen

That's right Daisy, you better do right
