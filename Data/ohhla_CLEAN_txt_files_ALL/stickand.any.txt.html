Mop up the floor with that bullshit
Cause I'ma stick and move
I'ma stick and move anybody
Do anything to get what I need
To take care of me and mine

[Verse 1]
Stick and move, outta the way
Duck ya head, time to pray
I'm lookin' for anyone who ever doubted
See me in the streets if ya wanna talk about it
These days I got nothin' but time
So I'm gonna use it all to chase down what's mine
Actin' crazy when you know you soft
And the only thing hard is that shit you talk
You ever seen a redskin get tipsy
Then take it to the old school 1850's
Arrow stuck in the back of ya neck
Just because ya mama raised you to disrespect
New game means whole new rules
And I guarantee y'all that I will not lose
I guess I'm gonna take ya back to my roots
Warriors stand up and let's get these fools

[Hook]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, don't let no one get ya

[Verse 2]
Ha ha! That's what I'm talkin' about
Stick and move like a heavyweight knockin' you out
What you thinkin' about, when you runnin' your mouth
Tellin' people that you know me like you live in my house
Things like that, I won't take
I'ma grown ass man, ya best get that straight
All I do is roll state to state
So I can look into the eyes of those who relate
So if you comin' with me then let's go
We gonna make it more hype than the night befo'
Just a bit more out of control
So learn to live a little and watch your life grow
Don't mean to steer you wrong
But when you're livin' in the ghetto, life don't seem long
Stick and move, move and stick
Cause second chances don't come that quick

[Hook]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, don't let no one get ya

[Syn]
Come stick and move with me
Right through the industry
Come stick and move with me
Stick and move
Stick and move

[Verse 3]
Let's say this was a game of tag
Will ya hide and go get whatever made ya mad?
I see you, can you see me?
Even though I stick and move through the industry
Skip back, play it again
We should all represent our race
Open your eyes, cause what you want
Is staring you right in your face

[Hook]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up, pack it up
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, left to right
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, don't let no one get ya</pre>
