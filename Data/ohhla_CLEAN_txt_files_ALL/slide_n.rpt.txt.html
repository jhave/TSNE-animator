[Intro/Chorus One: repeat 2X]
Slide in, slide out, that's how a real gangsta move
You can tell by the way I'm smooth (I'm smooth)
But at the same time actin a fool (actin a fool)

[Verse One]
I'm a West coast rider, California rider
I'll put that on my riders, I'ma keep it rider
And keep it low key, to smash on these motherfuckers
'fore they smash me, I'm a California rider

[Verse Two]
I'm a West coast rider, California rider
An Eastside, L.A., South Central rider
Inglewood rider, spit it how I live it
I'm a rider and if I ain't got it I gotta get it
Don't make me act a fool (fool)
Kick back lil' homey "B" cool, or "C" cool
Yeah, it's however you wanna take it
I'ma rider my nigga you must got me mistaken
with them other niggaz over there, Daz you a rider?
Nigga you scared, a bitch in disguise
with a fade and a beard, Kustapo Pentagon riders
Plus we authentic over here
We don't gotta blast, to kill each other off
We can go hands nigga I'll show you who the boss
I'm a West coast rider, California rider
An Eastside, L.A., South Central rider
Inglewood rider, spit it how I live it
I'm a rider and if I ain't got it I gotta get it

[Chorus Two]
Slide in, slide out, that's how a real gangsta move
Tanktop, corduroy, house shoes (house shoes)
I'm a gangster that just can't lose, yeah
Slide in, slide out, that's how a real gangsta move
Tanktop, corduroy, house shoes (house shoes)
I'm a gangster in my gangster shoes, nigga
Slide in, slide out, that's how a real gangsta move..

[Verse Three]
I cain't get enough of the block
I cain't get enough cause I'm stuck on the block
I'ma Y.A. ride 'til I'm dead on the block
Entourage 'til I'm gone watchin me until I drop
Got a pocket full of stones, walkin up and down the block
See the cops at the corner, real niggaz never stop
I see death around the corner so I'm hangin on the block
When I'm gone to the coroner they'll leave me on the block
I was wrong, got a problem, you can see me on the block
That's home, Thunderdome, you can meet me at the spot
Probably catch you at the club sippin Henny on the rocks
Catch you walkin out the club knock your ass out the box
I'm a gangster nigga

[Chorus One]

[Verse Four]
I'ma gang-sta ride (that's right)
And gang-sta glide (and glide)
I'm gang-sta-fied, I live a gang-sta life
G to T, that's all I know
And blowin on dicks, is all she know
She a ho, and baby give me head on the spot
She a sucka for a nigga hardhead from the block
Dear God, don't let a young nigga die broke
I hold my pistol with pride with every 9 I toke
It's a tear I done shed
Another black male on the stairs laid dead
What more could I do?
Move up, nigga ain't no rules in the hood
Too many drugs used in the hood
We all young black and abused in the hood
15 years old, they got him doin life
No sense to keep cruisin I'ma keep cryin
The judge got a grudge, the D.A. lyin
You gotta give him mercy, Lord let him breathe
Good or bad seed he a seed in the soil
Hold your head soldier I'm right here for you
And that go for all my homeboys - yuh!

[Chorus Three/Outro]
Slide, slide, roll 'n ride
Front 'n back, side to side
Pimpin baby side to side
So many come to where riders ride
Slide, slide, roll 'n ride
Front 'n back, side to side
Pimpin baby side to side
Keep it hood, riders ride
Slide, slide, roll 'n ride
Front 'n back, side to side
Pimpin baby side to side
Death Row how them riders ride

[Verse Five - fading out]
Yeah, they don't wanna see the Y.A. ride
They don't wanna see cellmates rise
They don't wanna see the Pentagon rise
They don't wanna see the entourage ride
They don't wanna see Death Row ride
They don't wanna see..</pre>
