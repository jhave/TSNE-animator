This feels good right here, uh
I'm just happy to be here... I mean
I gotta take a moment to thank those that made a difference
Whether small or big, damn
Where should I start though?

Uhh, first and foremost I gotta give praise
To the Lord above and His almighty ways
Blessin me with the gift to lift spirits
And evoke emotions through these words, every time you hear it
I got the lyrics and flow, I'm capable so
when I blow, just know this one's for April and Joe
Me and my little sister, we grateful, you know?
Wish I could see you more Avah at the rate that you grow
My favorite uncle Franky, for openin your door
When I ain't have a place to stay, I crashed on your floor
Taught me the basic survival tools
Auntie Cathy, every summer kept me in vacation bible school
Mr. Diskin, for more than passin grades
And my fourth grade teacher Mr. Scott who passed away (R.I.P.)
Peep how I met Kamel, corner on the street
We goin to the top, let's do it for Shawna and Jaleek
In the beginnin, no one was on Jin's side folks
Bar and Amaury, whoa Bundy, that's an inside joke
Before bullshit friendships, synthetic for cream
Chilled with my Wall Click - Bryan, Cedric and Jean
So when I moved to N.Y., chose to invest in a few
One love to Patricia Ben and the rest of the crew
To be loved is a privilege, that's what I was told
A gem from my man L.S. more precious than gold
Infamous Joe, lacin my tat so sick
Fong, Young Mac and Ken down at Ho Yips
To Dee, Waah, Chivon and the rest of the Dean's
for believin in a young man, obsessed with a dream
Allowin me to write "History," create my own chapter
All original Ryders and the generation after
The Double-R staff, my thanks worth a million
And the whole 30th floor, at the Universal buildin
You could never walk in my shoes, or stand in my boots
Know how I came up, I'll never abandon my roots
Yeah, C-Rayz, Poison Pen for sharin the stage
Shouts to Stronghold, Tone and the rest of the Plague
Ask Big Zoo, we ten steps ahead of ya
Vice versas, eye to eye, E-O-Dub regulars
My man J-Pure, for bringin the heat right
And the rest of the poets, chillin under street lights (whattup)
Just keep the beats tight, shouts to the record spinners
Enuff, Felli Fel, and all The Heavy Hitters (sup now)
Kubichi, K-Sly hold me down in L.A.
Might catch me flickin it up, with Von in the Bay
Then it's off to the "Wake Up Show" with Tech and Sway
Or Big Nat and Foot, out in V-A (uhh)
It's damn near tradition, to kick a freestyle
anytime I'm with Eddie Francis out in C-Town
Can't forget, Home Team, as high as I'll be
Supa Cindy, Big Lip, and DJ Irie
The club and mixtape DJ's that break records
Cause thanks to them (uh-huh) we've heard some great records
Shouts out to the Technitions, they get props
Feel free to holla, anytime you need drops (holla at ya boy)
Bob Collina, the only one to call
Anytime ya boy Jin got a run-in with the law
Bert Padell, a.k.a. Big Babe Ruth
got the Brinks truck outside, let's get paid loot
6-4-6-6, the trips back and forth
from the studio to the crib, I'm never slackin off
How 'bout Will, Spivey and of course Killa Kai
Boondo, Randy, Feron, just a few of my
close associates, that I love to see
School me to the game, like Joe Box and Brother E
Razor and Mario for all them times we rock shows
To the rest of 176, tato
Holla-Front.com, go register today
Peter, John, Rock, Lisa, Landy and J
Keepin it fresh, Ellis at the barbershop
Coast to coast lifestyles, reppin the "R" a lot
My man Kartoon, bringin the fresh sound
Cookie and Matt, O.G.'s holdin the West down
And of course Swizz, Watts, Carl, Climax
Far East Movement, they got what ya minds lacks
T-Dot, Montreal where I keep mass appeal
Ramiro, Baby Yu, R.G. and Neal
It pays to keep it real, even more to be sincere
Thanks to BET for jump-startin my career
As for "106," who they askin about?
Free and A.J., can't wait to see y'all back on the couch
And MTV, for givin "Advanced Warnings"
John Singleton, plus the chance at performin
The Source, XXL, Rolling Stone, Vibe
The truth, the lies, the layout, and rides
For every write-up, forever in context (uh-huh)
King Magazine, Elle Girl and Complex
To all the producers for providin the beats
Shouts to Neo, Tuneheadz, Devine and Elite
J.R., Wyclef, Kanye - can I rep
This is real hip-hop, be damned if I let
y'all tell me otherwise, cause we so live
This one's for, 9-5-4 and 3-oh-5
All the way to 7-1-8, and 2-1-2
And if you ever show love, this one's for you
But I gotta say thanks, even those that hated
Cause, cause - y'all kept me motivated, uhh

[Outro: Jin]
Whooo! You see
A lot of times people don't appreciate the love and support
that they get, from they family and friends
Haters and those that love them too, but not me
See, I never take none of that for granted
So I knew I had to take a moment at least
To let y'all know how I felt about it, c'mon
   (I gotta thank, God; I wanna thank, y'all) {*4X*}
Uh-huh, each and every one of y'all, it's only right
Cause without y'all, there is no me
Oh and Chach I ain't forget about you
I know when you mixin this down, you gon' do a real good job on it
I know I probably forgot a ton of people but
Don't think that, you don't count or you ain't important
It's just that, it's a lot goin on right now
I got my L lit, little bit of Hennessy left in my cup
And I don't really drink like that, heh
I love y'all, "The Rest is History" baby

   (I gotta thank, God; I wanna thank, y'all) {*4X*}</pre>
