Y'all no nothing about the pimp game,
I wanna thank Rick James for letting me do this song
Thank you very much

Who are you?(who are you?)
Girl who do you belong to?
My point of view is
Girl I think you're hot!

If we halt
What words will I describe
There's no dictionary book
To explain how you look
Because I think you're hot!

(Chorus)
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Cold Blooded!
Girl I think you're hot!
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Cold Blooded!

Who are you?
Girl what's your name and number?
Is it true?
Girl you think I'm hot!
If we tried
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn't trade me for another!
Cause I think you're so!

(Chorus)

Sweetheart baby,
Touch me girl where I want to me touched
Don't ever complain, gotcha in a cobra clutch
Love me tender, love me sweet
I wanna bust this nut in a superfreak
Oh you're a superfreak, fuck me anywhere
Great skin never do a do or dare
I wanna undress you, hold your loosie tight
And i won't cum all night!

(Chorus til fade)</pre>
