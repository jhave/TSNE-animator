[Flavor Flav]
Yooooooooooooooooooooo!
That's what I got everybody up in the Bronx sayin
(Get the fuck outta here)
Everybody up in the Bronx is sayin yooooooooooooooooooooo!
That's Flav shit nigga

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
They call me Flavor, Flavoristic majestic Flavor
Don't you know that I'm the Flavor that you gave-ah
I'm in the life that you live when you..
Ahh do it again {*laughing*}

[Flavor Flav]
Now they call me Flavor
I'm in the shot that you shoot when you swishin
I'm in your dip and your dive when you dippin
I'm the aroma in your motherfuckin kitchen (Now that shit's hot!)
Now they call me Flavor
I'm in your mouth when you wake up in the mornin (DAMN!)
I'm the stink on your breath when you yawnin (WHAT!)
I'm in the milk in the cows of the corn an'
Flavor Flav is the Flav, a mack
Flavor Flav will never stick you in your back
Flavor Flav is on the reel to reel
Flavor Flav is in what you feel, BOYEEE!
Now they call me Flavor
Flav will never stick you in your back
Flavor Flav is on the reel to reel, oh noooo!
Aiyyo {?} I don't know what the fuck I'm sayin

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav]
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!
Get up get up get up and get down
Rock to the beat of a funky sound
Beat so sweet won't never go sour
Day by day every minute of the hour
The mornin hard eggs and tell me what's new
Got nuttin else to do but drink brew
Tryin to feel the flow, gettin so low
Standin there drinkin a quart of Old Gold
That's right, that's the way we gonna do it
And that's the way we gonna get through it
That's why I put my mind to it
And that's the way we gonna get through it {*laughing*}
South Freeport, break down
That's, where my families frown
After dark, Centennial Park
Go to Jones Beach, get on the back of a shark

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav - over Chorus]
GET IT NOW! WHAT?! HUH!
But I ain't playin, you know what I mean?
Ohhh shit, one more time

[Flavor Flav]
If you really want it put I can put a nigga's light out
On the strength but I don't go that length
Cause, Flavor Flav don't live on that tip G
But don't get sleep on me
I get lurky boy
When you eat a beef jerky boy
Suey sauce and soy boy
I did it to 'em with Roy boy, whaaaaaaaaat?

[Chorus]

[Flavor Flav - over Chorus]
C'mon, WHAT! Daaamn
C'mon, the rap Superman, CHAAAAAAAAAAARGE
YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH

[Flavor Flav]
Bring that beat back (hehehehe)
Bring that beat back (brrrrrrrr)
Bring that beat back {*snickering*}
Bring that beat back
Do you know what I ain't got time to waste on this shit all night
Fuck that, fuck that you know cause I got other shit to do
We gone!</pre>
