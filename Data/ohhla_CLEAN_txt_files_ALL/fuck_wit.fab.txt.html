[Intro: Neo Da Matrix]
We fuck with that Street Fam
I fuck with that Street Fam, fuck fuck with that Street Fam
I fuck with that Street Fam, fuck fuck with that Street Fam
Fuck fuck with that Street Fam, fuck fuck with that Street Fam
I fuck with that Street Fam, we fuck with that Street Fam {*3X*}
Fuck fuck with that Street Fam, fuck fuck with that Street Fam

[DJ Drama over Intro]
Shout my nigga Shaq, Nick Rudo
Shout my nigga Rich Rock! Killer Kev
My nigga Top, whattup Mike?
Shout my nigga Eastwood (fuck wit'cha boy)
My nigga Loco (it's 'Loso) my nigga Ross
(Dramatic nigga!!) {"Dramatic, Dramatic..."}

[Fabolous]
I tell it like it is, motherfuck how it was
The shit a coward does won't fuck up my sour buzz
I break 'em off, shake 'em off, that's just how I does
I'm clean so I lean like the Pisa tower does
I'm on my fa-da-da-da fly shit
Look all you want nigga don't try shit
Back from the future, on some Party McFly shit
The doors go up, and lord knows I shit
on these lame niggaz, on these punk bitches
You don't wanna see me reachin where that trunk switch is
We in the club with the black and white skunk riches
I'm matchin head to toe, down to my dunk stitches
I make them hoes throw it up like drunk bitches
If not, "Walk it Out" like Unk bitches (bitches)
Two-step your ass on
You missed the knock, oppurtunity done passed on

[Chorus 2X: Neo Da Matrix]
I fuck with that Street Fam, we fuck with that Street Fam {*3X*}
Fuck fuck with that Street Fam, fuck fuck with that Street Fam

[Fabolous]
You wanna hate us, take a number and get in line
These niggaz start throwin shade when you gettin shine
And I'm gettin mine, like southern Cal
Too hot to touch, just came out the oven style
Ask my momma, I came out the oven wild
My flow is city slick, slow it down Southern style
(Yesss~!) Two fingers up, two fingers down
If ya like your chick nigga don't bring her 'round
(Okay okay okay okay) The Bob Barker king in town
If +The Price Is Right+ yeah I'ma bring it down
(Okay okay okay okay) Baby come on down - wait!
Let me tell the driver come on 'round - hate
where they do dat? Everywhere we be at baby
Brooklyn, New York, now you know where we at baby
Come and fuck with us, nigga we love to bang
Fa-da-da-da boys, a.k.a. the Sutter Gang

[Chorus]

[DJ Drama]
