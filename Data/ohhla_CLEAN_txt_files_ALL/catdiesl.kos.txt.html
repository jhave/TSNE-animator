Hey...
Recognize!
I got a new name; get up on this (Repeat 8x)
I got...
I was sad, I was sad, I was sad
Until I heard her guitar...
Shinning like the stars
From outside an opera bar
On the east side
The way she played it made me feel like I was back home..
Her eyes are like two suns shining down on this desert I roam..
Tell him, tell him
That is why I...
I can't take this feeling in my heart anymore
Time for me to step and make my way through the door
If by chance I see you on this road once again
I can guarantee you that I will not pretend 
Okay, so what's new is it really the old pursuit
I met home girl on the corner of Broad view
And Queen, and she was that, power to hypnotize
Strumming on the guitar and telling me no lies
Behind the dark skin, was a soul of Isis
Priceless, Aquarius Pisces I was a fish
And she was the water, heavenly daughter
With southern twang claiming to be from Georgia
But I couldn't believe she had to be from galaxies
Far beyond and Kevin was so fond
Of the shape of her hands
I studied the lines in her face
Wondering if she knew what's the secret of human race is
Face it
I drop the Megatron Bomb
Thanks to Terry and Jackie I just stay calm
I got my heart broke one shot gun, blaow!
But that's okay; I got a new name now
I got a new name; get up on this (Repeat 8x)
Yo!
Dance to the (Repeat 8x)
I can't take this feeling in my heart anymore
Time for me to step and make my way through the door
If by chance I see you on this road once again
I can guarantee you that I will not pretend </pre>
