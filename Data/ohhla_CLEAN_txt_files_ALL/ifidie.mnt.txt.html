Flesh-n-Bone:
Flesh-n-Bone,Montell,Monifah,
something for my people.
[I was on my knees last night and I said]
Now,I'm gonna lay me down[down,down...] to sleep
I pray to the lord and to Heaven:go bless my soul to keep
and if I should die before I wake up,wake up,wake up
hope that He saved a place in Heaven so I pray everyday for the soul that He
take up,take up

Montell Jordan:
Oh,you never heard these words before[no]
And I know you've never seen this side of me,I'm quite sure
But livin my life with you here is givin me tears of joy
And I never wanna leave you baby
So if by chance I go
I want you to know

If I die tonight,it would be alright
Cause I finally found what most I've been searching for my whole damn life
If I die tonight,it would be OK
Cause being with you is like being in Heaven anyway

Monifah
Ooh,I never thought I'd feel this way for you
And I never thought I'd meet a man that made me wanna say "I do"
You changed my whole life forever and ever,oh yeah
So if God should call,here's what you do:
know he's got my soul in Heaven,but my heart's with you

If I die tonight,it would be alright
Cause I finally found what most I've been searching for my whole damn life
If I die tonight,it would be OK
Cause being with you is like being in Heaven anyway

Now,I'm gonna lay me down[down,down...] to sleep
I pray to the lord and to Heaven:go bless my soul to keep
and if I should die before I wake up,wake up,wake up
hope that He saved a place in Heaven so I pray everyday for the soul that He
take up,take up

Now I lay me down to sleep,I pray the lord my soul to keep
and if I should die before I wake,I pray the lord my soul to take

If I die tonight,it would be alright
Cause I finally found what most I've been searching for my whole damn life
If I die tonight,it would be OK
Cause being with you is like being in Heaven anyway
