Bread and water...
This what it come down to
Yeah!

I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl
Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches
Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good
as long as all these records keep sellin'
Niggas time cut so these snitches keep tellin'
Y'all know it ain't right
And I ain't bending for these hoes
Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows?
Man, these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home
So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay
Half-bit like they rich broke, niggas swisha sweet
So I sit, in a lac and just smoke, stayin' down in the street
Vernon Dixon Georgetown in the hills
The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill
The delta and the coast, the queens is what I boast
But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most
Damn, the kids is what a nigga love most
Fuck, so trill..

[Chorus 2x: David Banner]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)

[David Banner]
I remember when the Twin Towers fell
Did the boys in the G know, and just didn't tell?
I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots
Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad
Or a bird in the Bush
Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push
Y'all don't try to praise God now
He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk
Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me
I'ma G, and the world is goIn' feel me
Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight 
from the middle of Mississippi, so P-Boy keep pushin'
We some big one, life would street, man, we all on a mission

[Chorus 2x: David Banner]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)

[David Banner]
This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms
If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms
And come and getcha, send me a kite
And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name
I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick
Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit
I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches
I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood
Mayne, I made some bullshit, but it's good
And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest
I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest

[Chorus 2x: David Banner]
I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)
It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill'
And scream to the lord it's so trill (So trill)</pre>
