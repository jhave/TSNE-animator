[Lil Wayne]
Woooo!!
Music up please
One, two, three...

Born and raised in the USA
By way of New Orleans where the killers stay
Okay... {*echoes*} uhh, uhh, alright, yeah
Born and raised in the USA
Where the government's watchin what you do and say
Hey heyyy, alriiiight
Well I'ma tell you this story of mine, a nigga with glory
Yeah I come from piss poor, and now I live in six story houses
Now how's this? Ha!
Listenin to my own voice in my black Rolls Royce
Get the girls of my choice to take off their shorts and blouses
I take off my trousers, yeah!
And you don't know nothin about this
I'm a dope boy with a guitar

[Chorus: Shanell] + (Lil Wayne)
Hey daddy can you let me
Ride with the band in the back seat
Ridin with the dope boy (I'm, I'm a dope boy with a guitar)
Tell them if they're lookin for me
I'm on the road to the next city, ridin with the dope boy

[Lil Wayne]
Dope boy with a guitar...
Born and raised in the USA
By way of New Orleans where the killers stay
But that's okay, yeahhh, that's alright, yes!
I'm loved and praised in the USA.
My ancestors were slaves in the USA
But not todayyyyy, it's alright {*echoes*}
Yeah, c'mon!
Ohhhhhhhh I'ma, dope boy with a guitar

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Bridge!! Born and raised in the USA
Where my president is B-L-A-C-K {*repeat 3X*}
I was born and raised in the USA
And all I wanna do is play
So turn me up {*repeat 4X*}

{*guitar licks to end*}</pre>
