Shit
I've been a thug my whole motherfucking life
Struggling
Doing what the fuck I've got to do to survive
Bottom line
Thugline

You see me on T.V. but you don't really know me
Don't know the story of the warrior
And how I survived in this game
Nigga never had shit
Had to work to get it
Or I had to steal it
Most of the time I was hungry
That's why I did it
I ain't bullshittin, seventeen
I'm leavin the house, I need my own
Nigga done tried to be grown
And fucked around
Now I'm homeless on the streets
With my niggas I learned 
About every drug
The heroine, the weed, the speed, the crack, the sherm
But we was broke and we couldn't afford it
But niggas was schemin and plottin on shit
Oh yes you know this
I come from a long line of thugs
Us strugglers hustle what we can rustle up
It might not have been too much
But we always got just enough, our hard times 
Kept niggas together through all the windy weather
And nigga whenever you need somebody to roll
I'm goin to be there, you know me
A nigga stayed thug devoted in the streets 
When I didn't have a place to sleep or shit to eat
My family goin through some pains
They struggle but they make out
My people off their hinges
And it was against our religion as a witness
So you know I really can't comprehend it
My mother and father told me: 
don't mess with drugs and why you smokin?
I was right or wrong? 
Can't understand it
If the purpose was to have a nigga struggle 
I don't think they should have had me, had me
Think they never should of had me
As I drop to my knees can't you see I ain't happy?

I hope it won't be long, I hope it won't be long
Before I end this song, I wanna end this song
I hope it won't be long, it won't be long
I need to end this song, this sad song
I hope it won't be long, I hope it won't be long
Before I end this song, I need to end this song
I hope it won't be long, it won't be long
I need to end this song, sad song</pre>
