[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Shoutout to my competition
These shots to my opposition
This shit real, my block we winning
This shit real, my block we in it
Bricksquad K, I tweet the shit
The label say don't leak the shit
Lawyer money got the shit
I catch a opp, I beat the shit
Bricksquad K, I tweet the shit
The label say don't leak the shit
Lawyer money got the shit
I catch a opp, I beat the shit
Catch Lil Jay, I heat his face
My lil niggas a meet with them
Lil Duck he can't duck this clip
WUGAWORLD K cause they fuck with them
30 shots we the murda block
Got choppa shells for a lot of opps
Off parole I'm on a lot of shots
No Fredo bitch I'm in a lot of cuts
I do hits when I'm sober
Tryna drop 30 or Motor
Tell Reese money to roll up
Even my judge know I'm poled up
Niggas reppin' sides with the police
Can't catch a nigga then we on his OG
Bitch I been the nigga since '03
Free Five, free Law, RIP Odee
OTF 3hunnit go &amp; tell them fuck niggas get money [2x]

[Chorus]
Shoutout to my competition
These shots to my opposition
This shit real my block we winning
This shit real my block we in it
These shots to my Opps,
These shots to my Opps [4x]

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Shoutout to my competition
I mean there's no competition
Look up man I know we winning
Haters mad cause they ain't in it
We tote 30's, we love sinning
Fucked all these hoes, man we hit plenty
Don't talk about money cause I done made plenty
Now shoutout to my competition
You say you on that, you better have that with you
Shooters on deck that a kill that issue
Acting like you with it that's the quickest way to get you
$1500 on a belt like it ain't a big issue
Same niggas in the same hood
Got real niggas with me, plus we official
And we shooting shit and we ain't tryna miss you
This a message to the Opps, miss me with the dissing
Fucked his bitch now he sneak dissing
Pull up with the windows tinted
So the haters can't really see who in it
300

[Chorus]</pre>
