Pico-Union (x2)
  
Aint no love (x4)  
  
Were missing in action living in a time when its in fashion 
To be gun flashing, blasting thats why we aint lasting 
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing 
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing 
In my rumbo you hear that Latin Lingo 
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin sickos 
With four nickels nobody walks around single 
Get caught slipping theyll pull your card from a window 
Its that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos 
Steal their Spanish grease making them shed a tear like Willie Bobo 
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco 
A cocos out there stealing cause theyre fiending for perico 
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack 
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back 
Thats why I strap its my defense against those 
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes? 
Shit is survival of fittest testing whos biggest and realest on the street 
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers 
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us 
Hard times in the city where no love is with us 
  
Aint no love 
Aint no love 
In the city (x2)
  
Aint no love (x4) 
In the city (x4) 
  
Aint no love
