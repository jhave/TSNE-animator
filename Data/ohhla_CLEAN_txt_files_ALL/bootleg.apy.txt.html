[Intro]
"There's too much bootleggin' goin' on y'all."
Too much bootleggin' goin' on.
"Bootleggin' goin' on right now."

[Verse One]
Phony Fendi's and fake Gucci's
New Alicia Key's CDs and $5 DVDs
Coach bags with a 'G' instead of a 'C'
Shades say Versace but are made real sloppy
Please
I don't know where the fuck you got that
But that shit is wack, better take that back
Uh oh
No receipt when you buy it in the streets
So look who got beat
Look who got beat
Yep
I copped a bootleg copy of Ray
And half of the movie had somebody's head in the way
And I couldn't hear a damn thing that the actor would say
Cause somebody kept coughing till the credits displayed
Bought some Jordan's from Japan, paid close to a grand
I showed it to my man he said, "Ap, you know it's a scam
The price was costly, honestly I think you should toss these
Look like the Jordan logo got cerebral palsy."

[Chorus]
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that CD?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that DVD?
Yo, where'd you get those kicks?
Where'd you get those flicks?
Where'd you get that hat?
Where'd you get that?
That shit is bootleg as a motherfucker

[Verse Two]
Yo, up and down, up and down the block
Got a blanket spread on the ground with movies in stock
Make a little cash now when the customer's flock
And whoop whoop, here come the cops now check out the plot
Pull the corners of the blanket together to form a sack
Throw it right over your back
No lookin' back
Bootleggers gonna get a lot of doe this year
So they should be right back once the coast is clear
Even got the fake Air Force 1's they try to sell
And trust me, I've seen 'em
You really can't tell
But I would never cop 'em if it wasn't legit
As far as Nike's, that's like my religion and shit
Got the B to the O to the O to the T
To the L to the E to the G CD
Probably got downloaded from some MP3s
Bootlegs motherfucks, just as cheap as can be

[Chorus]
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that CD?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that DVD?
Yo, where'd you get those kicks?
Where'd you get those flicks?
Where'd you get that hat?
Where'd you get that?
That shit is bootleg as a motherfucker

[Verse Three]
My girl loves shoppin' so we go to get it poppin'
And I'm droppin' all this money on this bootleggers stockin'
Fake fashion and they laughin' cause I'm sighin' as she's buyin'
Little diamond studded stupid stuff, she loves cause it's shinin'
And I'm dyin' from the heat
People line up in the street
Wanna be rappers are walkin' around rhymin' to the beat
Tryin' to sell me CDs, please, like I need that
30 tracks of wack raps over beats you jacked?
A bunch of bootleg, bootleg, after the green
Bootleg, bootleg, shirts and jeans
Bootleg, bootleg, products and movies
Bootleg, bootleg, Prada and Louis
That's a real 50 Cent shirt? I think that you're lyin'
Cause then why would it say, "Get Rich Or Try Dyin'"?
Watch 'em cause them CDs and DVDs could be B-O-O-T-L-E-Gs

[Chorus]
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that CD?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that?
Where'd you get that DVD?
Yo, where'd you get those kicks?
Where'd you get those flicks?
Where'd you get that hat?
Where'd you get that?
That shit is bootleg as a motherfucker

"To much bootleggin'
To much bootleggin' is goin' on
To much bootleggin'
To much bootleggin' is goin' on"</pre>
