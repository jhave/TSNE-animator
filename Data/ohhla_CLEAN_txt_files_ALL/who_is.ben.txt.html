[Benzino talking softly]
Niggas wanna try and live my life and
Bitches wanna try and run my life and (As we proceed!)
Haters wanna try and take my life and (ha, Benzino)
God...

[Hook]
Niggas wanna try and live my life and
Bitches wanna try and run my life and
Haters wanna try and take my life and
God! Do you really want my life then?

[Benzino]
Dot hit me with the track, Diddy keep it gangsta
When in the city, crime scene, no answer
Who's Benzino? Who the fuck's Benzino?
Matta-fact, get'cha facts straight (Say whaaat?!)
Nino Brown without the high fate
O-Dog without the O, Nigga you don't know?
Sonny Coleon, Godfather get loose
Bulletproof, made it through the toll booth
I don't know if you niggas want the whole truth
Stay strapped even in the vocal booth
Rob report, page 3-5-7
Ray hang 'em high, details at eleven

[Hook] 2x

[Benzino]
Do you really wanna hold spots down, home town Bost-town
Victim of 'stance, we dance with four pound
Spit thug sound, y'all know how thugs sound
Can't touch clowns, slow slugs down
O.G.'s raised me, baby G's praise me
Since I'm a G, rep 3 'til I'm swazy
Y'all cats fugazi, my shit's crazy
Niggas can't faze me (You can't take) what God gave me
Game stayed on top of - Fame played a part of
Change, made a lot of - Flame in the hearts of
Men I'm a Made one - Friends, I don't need none
Play it by the rules, took some, left some
Once was behind bars, now I'm a All Star
I'm florid idol, takin all titles
Whole family 'spect it, whole fam connected
Fuck off the hook, my shit's disconnected

[Benzino softly speaking Hook]

[P. Diddy over Benzino]
Oh, see this is the shit I'm talkin 'bout
'Stead of a nigga doin him, he tryna do me
and stop me from doin me, feel me?

[Benzino]
Stress got me smokin blunts like they're cigarettes
Don't forget, nickel nine leave you soakin wet
Negotiate deals via cellphone
Do shows outta town, bring dollars home
Spread love throughout my hood, my hood love me
Lemme give you some advice, don't never trust me
You gonna pay the price if you ever fuck me
It's like rollin dice, if you try an' duck me
Who's Benzino? Know the whole world know
People always scared of shit that they don't know
Dispite the facts, still here, of course
Fuck "Five Mics" motherfucker, I'm The Source

[Hook] 3x

[Benzino talking (P. Diddy)]
Yeah, now what, (what) now what'chu sayin now (Yea)
Huh? You don't really wanna
How you feelin about this now?
Huh, Huh? (As we proceed!)
What'chu got to say about this? Huh?
You got somethin to say, about everything else
What'chu got to say about this right here? (What'chu got to say?)
Huh? You can't say shit about this!
Huh? You just gotta keep your fuckin mouth shut!!

[P. Diddy talking]
You need to stop doin me, and do you - you feel me?
It's a simple thought, haha
Sometimes you have your mind so preoccupied on a motherfucker,
you can't even wake your ass up
You too busy dreamin about me!
You motherfucker! I don't even know why I'm talkin to your punk-
Ya, ahhh, it's some fuckin sissy shit even talkin about this, ahh!</pre>
