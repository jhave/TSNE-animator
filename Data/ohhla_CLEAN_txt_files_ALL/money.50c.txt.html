[Intro: 50 Cent]
I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit
I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Startin to feel like there's nothin left to talk about but the, money, money
Bill collectors keep comin when a nigga fucked up, to get money, money
Nigga I don't give a fuck 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on the money, MONEY (money) MONEY!
Look, I don't wan' talk 'bout these hoes
Let's talk about money, MONEY (money) MONEY!

[50 Cent]
In high school I had coke and dope money
I blew, now I'm sittin on Bugatti boat money
I'm eatin, I get money, nigga I shit money
It smell like Benjamins, it boosts my adrenaline
Go 'head fuck around, I got marksmen hit money
You fuckin with that EBT welfare WIC money
Who wan' catch a fade? Fuck that~! Catch a blade
Catch a case, bail bond, I'm out the next day
Got that gold +Hammer+, gold +2 Legit+ proper money
Talkin 'bout private jet, heliport chopper money
And a nigga still ridin with the chopper on me
I don't trick, e'ry now and then I toss her money
Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
I'll kill if I have to, don't force me homie
I get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
I hate when niggaz act like bitches cause it costs me money
What the fuck!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm in London blowin pounds, Japan blowin yen
It's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
My stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
Nowadays I'm just happy things are goin my way
I'm straight, some say I got more than I need
Mucho dinero out in México, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got Brinks truck money
Euros, grams{?}, you wan' borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggaz like "Damn!"
Bitch I got more +francs+ than a hot dog man
Get married, pay for one bitch, I'll buy her bar food
Kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit I do
Whassup?

[Chorus]
