[Hook: Z-Ro]
I'm a street nigga, from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet nigga
Ery'time I get drove, they bring out the white sheets nigga
Ain't nothing, weak around here
Fuck over me, if you wanna go to sleep around here
I'm a street nigga, from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet nigga
I'll blow your ass away, if you reach nigga
Y'all, don't want none
My nigga Mr. Marcelo, repping that 'Nolia he ain't never been no hoe

[Mr. Marcelo]
I'm Young 'Celo, ghetto real smooth criminal
Five foot six from the bricks, bitch I been a fool
Been a jacker been a hustler, been a soldier
And ain't shit changed, you could catch me in the 'Nolia
Snow for the low, you can get it for the retail
Anything I can't move, I re-cook and re-sell
G'eah, I keep my mind on my grind
And my nine in my waist, in case I see a funny sign
You know, cause my eyes stay open
For you niggaz who be scoping, when I'm floating through the city
Young 'Celo, puffing on sticky
Sipping on Henny, nigga toting one-fitty
Come get with me, bitch nigga I dare ya
Homie you're pure pussy, bitch nigga I smell ya
My pistol ain't with me, lil' homie it's on me
On me in the waist, for you lil' boys trying to harm me
Before I'm caught slipping, Lord catch me with that tommy
I'm in the streets nigga, real deep nigga

[Hook]

[Mr. Marcelo]
Yeah I ride black, ice even round my neck
Black 4-5, black talons up in that
Walk that talk that, spit that kick that
Real shit trill shit, whenever Brick in this bitch
My hood niggaz, say the rap game missed me
But I beef and make it pop, and lose weight like Missy
I jack niggaz for mine, so I get it dirt cheap
Showing move like T.I., this did in a week
You can bullshit with rap, if you want to mo'fuckers
I ain't no rapper, homie I'm just a hustler
When Hurricane Katrina came, blew my hood down
I packed up stacked up, and took it to H-Town
Now I get my hustle on, cup full of drank
You don't think that pistol on me, homie think what you think
But if I reach for my piece, somebody gon be laying in the street
And I guaruntee, it won't be me
