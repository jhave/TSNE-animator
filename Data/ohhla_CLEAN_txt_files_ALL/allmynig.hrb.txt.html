[Chorus]
All my niggas on point

[Verse 1]
Ball my niggas, seem like I lost all my niggas
RIP Lil Roc, Vito, Fazo can't believe yall gone my nigga
And its real fucked up how it's good one day next day go wrong my nigga
But I gotta stay strong my nigga
So I wrote this song my nigga
Remember all them nights we was out in that field, had to tote that chrome my nigga
Then it all went wrong, What the fuck Kobe why you couldn't get a ride home my nigga
Why yo name in this song my nigga
But don't trip cuz it's on my nigga
Put it on my soul you ain't gon' be the only one with a headstone my nigga
I lost alot of my niggas
So you get dropped for my niggas
We got Glocks with hair triggas
Split a nigga wig when I tap the hair trigga
Hollows in the scene now the top of his head missing
Catch me in the field, gotta move with the steel
Till the day I get killed or the coppas come get me
Only 17, but them choppas hold 50
Yea them choppas hold 50
We'll turn a nigga block to yo city
Seem like I'm the man
I be shopping, bitches saying "Lil Herb you on the top of yo city"
And I love my niggas
And all my niggas love me
So you will get killed for my niggas
And they'll kill a nigga for me!

[Chorus]
All my niggas on point
All my niggas gon' shoot
All my niggas got money
Ain't none of my niggas with you
Ima put all my niggas on
RIP all my niggas dawg
All my niggas 150
Ain't none of my niggas gon' fold

All my niggas [x2]
For all my niggas
I love all my niggas
All my niggas [x3]
Ball my niggas
