[Future talking]
Whaddup grandma like
told you I had to do it
I'm just scared for you baby

[Chorus]
I go through hell so walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 1]
I got some money but it's all dirty
I gotten a pocket during the chain worthy
And I done took my heart through so many surgeries,
Last night was woke around 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep you sleeping with the burden,
These niggaz play for keep the streets
They really dirty,
You have to practice what you
Preach gone take the courage,
You pain runnin hella deep don't get discouraged,
You in the belly of beast
Don't get worried,
You know these niggaz play for keeps you still working,
You gotta pack miami heat they always lurkin',
You can't think about the guilt so many curses

[Chorus]
I go through hell so walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 2]
When you in the game playing file,
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou,
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town,
Get two bad bitches and hit greyhound,
I had to cut the couch down,
They tried to burn the cross down,
They even tried to bring god down
We shootin for the stars now,
We live above the ground,
Go from town to town,
Ridin round the city,
They treat you like Diddy,
With all these crimes shooter committed, they must be winning
It's only the beginning,
And we ain't even finish, I came from the highway
Right where the lighty city,
This ain't the ending

[Chorus]
I go through hell so walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise</pre>
