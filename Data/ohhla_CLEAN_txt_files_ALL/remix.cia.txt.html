[Verse 2 - Ciara]
You may look at me and think that I'm
Just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin for:
Sexy, independent, down to spend it type that's gettin his dough
I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Maybe cuz I talk about it
Lookin for the goodies
Keep on lookin cuz they stay in the jar
Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh Oh-oh

[Verse 3 - Ciara]
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not goin home wit you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm sexy, independent
I aint wit it so you already know
I'm not bein too dramatic, that's the way I gotta have it
You think your slike, tryna hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not bein too dramatic, its just how I gotta have it

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - T.I.]
You way too hot to keep ya goodies on lock
Call me the locksmith, I got the key to that box
I wanna see you next to me in that drop
Us chillin in Tahiti no shoes, no socks
Maybe in Jamaica poppin bottles on the Yacht
Then dock it in Miami grand hustle don't stop
Give it to me cuz you wanna, I aint workin for it
You can keep ya nigga look at me(look at me)
You think I'm hurting for it?

[Verse 5 - Ciara]
You're insuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's tryna get on top
No you can't call me layta
And I dont want your numba
I'm not changin stories, just respect the play I'm callin

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
