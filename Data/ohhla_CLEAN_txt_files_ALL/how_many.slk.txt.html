[Silkk and Master P talking]
How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas down to die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas down to die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
I said, How many niggas down to die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas down to die with me

[Master P]
I'm too young to get my Z's on
get my cheese on while I'm here bang a bitch
and get my B's on tattoo weed and hennesy
scream NO LIMIT to the enemy tryin' get my skrilla
that's why they label, tag me a young nigga drug dealer
And the FED's steady watchin' but a nigga makin' money
so the tank ain't stoppin' 

How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me

[C-Murder]
P dawg pass me them let's get 'em 
I ride for your homey Tru niggas ain't bullshittin' 
respect my tattoos I pay my dues 
remember '89 when I made a nigga sing the blues
I was born and raised for this gangsta shit
C-Murder be known for keepin' an extra clip
my Pops say look 'em in the eye before I kill 'em
P crank the Lac up and let's get 'em

How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me

[Mystikal]
Nigga whenever you need me I'm already there
its gettin' done hangin' out the window

You ride for me I'm a ride for you its only fair
here I go fuck them niggas I don't care
where they at what they tryin' do how many 
we got shit to live for you weak bitch die skinny
without a penet my clique strong like Ol' Remme
unfriendly in business the wheel still spinnin'
ready to bury you bitches from begining to endin'
I'm telling you to be chillin' you bitch if you

How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me

[Mia X]
Niggas high let Mia mama ready to ride 
TRU for life I live kill and die
for the camoflauged soliders leave your stiffs in safes
baddest bitch motherfucker I gave birth to a tank
I ain't gonna just testify and lie for ya'll niggas
I hit the judge and everybody with some choppers and slitters
fuck 'em forget 'em hold the gasoline she lit 'em
ain't gonna ever have to ask did she get 'em
that's all TRU won't you won't do let it be known
guerilla warfare niggas fullblown come on
I'm with you niggas like the heart in me 
My love goes farther than them hennesy 
Whose got the car keys

How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me

[Silkk the Shocker]
Now would you go to war for me (man you know I would)
Now would you kill for me (shit you know I would)
Now would you ride for me (no doubt you know I would)
Now would you die for me (why you ask me you know I could)
I wonder who will ride for me probably be true 'em
never knew 'em but even though I was cool with 'em 
at times his silly ways grew on me and see I don't 
know but time like moving slow and I'm TRU I'm 
gonna take my vest off and hit it's bout time to go 
and see they got me ridin' with top dollar and challers
niggas bout to get fuckin' smothered for crazy motherfuckers
riders, homies, and brothers for my TRU niggas I'm gonna
get my swerve on my serve on you wan't me come get me
you heard the soul I had a visual moment too tryin' to 
save 'em and a nigga still die but I'm gonna kill the
motherfucker who said I'm not TRU and nigga still live
All the world catch a slug nigga catch a slug in the mud 
see I'm a TRU thug and this is TRU love nigga what to 
my real niggas blastin' toes and I'm gonna empty clip 'til
I can't blast no mo' 

How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas down to  die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
How many niggas wanna ride with me
How many niggas wanna die with me
I said, How many niggas wanna ride with me
