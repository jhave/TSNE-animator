[Ceschi]
Love her to death, or hate her to death
He could wait, she'll end up dead
Dead as stuck days, dead as can be
Dead dumb, dead silent, DEAD ASLEEP
Could learn to get, DEAD ASLEEP {*3X*}
Dead in your arms, or did I kill
Dead as my heart, with no more will
Under the ground, is where I sing
Under my skin, your deadly rings
No more love, I'm so DEAD ASLEEP
Could learn to get, DEAD ASLEEP {*4X*}
Dead.. dead.. dead..</pre>
