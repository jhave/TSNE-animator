(Sample)
Starting fresh, building slow, take my time cause now...I know
(AZ) This that kush right here...this that sour...its serious...

[Verse 1]
I'm reinvented weed scented
Coup exceeding the speed limit smoke easing through the roof
Few regrets breathe through the youth
I'm a seasoned vet I need no excuse baby
Still rubble flights on that Delta shuttle
Patron's in me so the shots is doubled no envy
A few pennies polished persona
Jews defend me it wasn't me honest your honor
I'm a loose cannon though the truth is
I'm used to handling standing tall strong like wall paneling
All from Maryland spreaded my chips
to them stores on Madison my fetish for chicks but umm

(Chorus)
Starting fresh, building slow, take my time cause now...I know
(AZ laughing in background)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, its rap now and I still ask how
Still got the vibe guess I got to be live
Gear so illy gotta stay fly
Appear so willy hunnies got to say hi
But wave by cause I'm gone in the wind
Errol Flynn blue Pradas pearl Benz few dollars girlfriend you holla
My focus on never so often you could catch me with some loafers on
I'm livin its all vision cautious decisions
from the cost to the Porsche with the ribbons
My ambitions embedded deep down in my soul
I don't fold I'm forever like diamonds and gold a smoke's scroll(?)
Bottles and buckles of ice I'm on the mic and ya'll thought little Weezy was nice
Get a load of a lyricist duckin his mows(?)
Street influences doin this since 12 years old but oh...

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
So I'm back ya'll 
Back from black ball
Back with the mask off
Could rap my ass off
Past paused(?) then ducked the task force
Tough as the asphalt
Stuffed the cash vault its my fault
Cause I seen it coming I guess I couldn't see me running still stunning
Name still the same in humming since a younging 
Been feeding through illegal funding call it cunning
Done with my days of dumming I'm grown up
Calisthenics in the gym on the daily I'm toned up
And ya'll cowards gon respect my work my word 
I'm worldwide with a thirst unheard yes sir...

(Chorus til end and fades)</pre>
