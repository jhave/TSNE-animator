[Chorus]
Oh, party... talkin' 'bout a party
Nothin' but a party... talkin' 'bout a party
All my party (people), in the party
Talkin 'bout a party... how you like to party?

[KK]
I like the parties that you hear about, and you wanna touch
The party where you play our shit - speaker busts
And ain't no rushin' the hoes man, they there to be chose
From entertainers, ballplayers - my niggaz are pro
Head to toe, girl you lookin' good to me
Can I get some of your time without payin' a fee?
(I'm 'bout the benjamins) Nah, you just a rat 'bout that cheese
With that root of all evil disease
I'm never on my knees simpin' to ya (nah nah baby)
But you could be my private dancer, and let me do ya
Let your man school you on the facts
Then crack them backs to KK when I lay down pipe out yo' back right
Now anything goes, gettin' swept off your toes by 2nd II None
Gettin' the job done on the one (one)
Now is that real to you?  (It's real to me baby)
That's cool, now can we start a little party baby?

[Chorus]
Oh, party... talkin' 'bout a party
Nothin' but a party... talkin' 'bout a party
All my party (people), in the party
Nothin' but a party... how you like to party?

[Gangsta D]
Don't stop - just let your coochie pop
When you sweat it out baby meet me at the Marriott
I'll leave the shower runnin', I'm hopin' that you're comin'
Cause tonight me and you can be funnin'
I know you like the 'what', 'cause you get deep
Oh you's a daddys girl, but you're still a freak
Now I can see it in your eyes
You gon' let me work it and slip it between your thighs
Me stabbin' your pussy completin' the homicide
Why are those guys so freakin' fly?
Well you can be too if ya only try
Throw your hands up, let me see ya touch the sky
Tonight's the night
My nigga Hamm comin' through with a whole gang of brew
And his game on tight plus he rhymin' too
You can't beat that, Rob Bacon got the sack
And all you stragglaz - let me show you where the pussy at

[Chorus]
Oh, party... talkin' 'bout a party
Nothin' but a party... talkin' 'bout a party
All my party (people), in the party
Nothin' but a party... how you like to party?

[Playa Hamm]
To be a mack or not be a mack (ain't no question)
And if you needin' some business, we got more than suggestions
Me and my niggaz keepin' somethin' for you to do
So uh, respecognize when we rendezvous
Whether the party over here, the party over there
Rule number one is the game ain't fair
So don't be cryin' when you get caught lyin' bout your statements
And ain't nothin' tricky 'cause these tricks can't fade us, yeah
We be trippin' all around the globe
And all you needin' is your toothbrush baby (and your bathrobe)
You wanna get at me? you knowin' how I play
And make all mine payable to be parlay
We the type of players makin' Save-Em's sick
Spreadin' velveeta throughout my click
Now, everybody smoke ('cause the price like that)
And everybody freaks ('cause the ice like that)
See, if I ain't gettin' payed a plus four on the guest list
I ain't at the party and I ain't givin' a fuck 'cause I -
can't miss what I - never had
And I'll be way too busy doin' good to do bad
So all I'm wantin' with my meal (extra cheese)
And all I'm needin' with my nani (is extra strong needs)
So please, it be's a pleasure when it's business, you know
And it's all about the pleasure when the 'P' flow
Ya hear me?

[Chorus] - X 3
Oh, party... talkin' 'bout a party
Nothin' but a party... talkin' 'bout a party
All my party (people), in the party
Nothin' but a party... how you like to party?</pre>
