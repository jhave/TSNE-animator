(Hello) Yeah, is she home yet
(No, she's not home yet) Alright, thanks

Try to get you on the phone, but your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home, girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line, and ask you to be mine
But you're so hard to find, girl I'm sleeping alone

Baby girl, she makes the good motion
Make no mistake, she's deep as the ocean
Jake never sleeps in the heart of the city
And God'll never make another woman this pretty
And I can never guess why she even messed with me
Word to P. Diddy, I treated her shitty
I'm sick of cliche's like opposites attract
When they drop the drum track screaming 'baby come back'
Reality bites like pitbull fights
I jump out of bed and throw on my lights
Your clothes are all gone, and you aren't there
And your make-up drawer is empty
I found an old picture of you washing your hair
And now we ain't even friendly

Try to get you on the phone, but your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home, girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line, and ask you to be mine
But you're so hard to find, girl I'm sleeping alone

Ain't too many rims that bang like this shorty
She'll sip champagne, she'll come drink a forty
Got a smell that entice, dress kinda sporty
In public she's nice, in private she's naughty
I had every man's dream in the palm of my hand
And fucked it all up like the Taliban
She left town with my ring and wrecked all our plans
And I don't even care about hte fifty grand
Man to hell with the cash cause that ain't the point
We used to sit around and laugh after smoking the joint
We used to watch TV and eat chicken wings
We had tickle fights, we did the wild thing
Now I'm all alone up in my room, this house is feeling empty
We used to talk about being bride and groom, and now we ain't even friendly

Try to get you on the phone, but your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home, girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line, and ask you to be mine
But you're so hard to find, girl I'm sleeping alone

Mi corazon ain't coming home
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Turned off her phone, left me alone
The pain that cuts down to the bone
It can't be fixed, scars don't heal
None of these chicks out here are real
Some of these chicks got sex appeal
But their souls all come up empty
Put me in the mix girl, what's the deal
All I'm trying to be is friendly

Try to get you on the phone, but your mother always says you're gone
And you ain't coming home, girl I'm sleeping alone
Try to get you on the line, and ask you to be mine
But you're so hard to find, girl I'm sleeping alone</pre>
