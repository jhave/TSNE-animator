[Lecrae]
I'm blackin' out, on my last leg
takin' final breaths'
Overheard the doctor say I ain't gonna make it, final steps
In the zone half panickin' half feelin' gone
Hang on homie! My boys yellin tryna keep me goin
Little sister in the distance, I see her tears flowin
Where mommy at? She on the ground passed out cold
Aw man this is how it ends, death came quick
My God I'll do anythang just let me live
I wanna pray but I can't pray, I never really done it
I don't know if I should call Christ, Buddah or Mohammed
Gettin blunted earlier this evenin now seems wrong
and my brain is searchin hard for any scripture or song
I'm havin flashbacks, now I remember, it was December
I was standing on the corner pitchin rocks in the winter
Young dude ran up on me thought he was a winner
but he started tryna convince me all the ways I'm a sinner.

(Man, you never understood man
You've lied before right? You've stolen before right?
Man you've already broken two of the ten commandments man
That qualifies you as a law breaker, that's sin man
it offends the holy and perfect and righteous God man
that's sin, you need a savior because of the sin man
I'm just tryna break it down for you)

[Lecrae]
Havin a hard time breathin
But I ain't leavin until I know what I believe in
Wait maybe it was Ak on the block
who was tellin me Mohammed was the rock, nah, stop
(You know man, you know Mohammed was the truth
You know what I'm sayin? Islam is the way to go yo)
But ain't Mohammed die? Yeah, dawg and they buried him
that's scary then cause I don't know if Allah really carries men
Let's get back to Jesus, coughin and wheezin
This world's full of lies man, everything's misleading
They told me don't be scared to die but dawg that's ridiculous
cause I don't know what happens to me next in this predicament
It's sickenin, God give me answers
Give me clues, help me understand, who do I trust, what do I do?

(Okay we're losin him, we're losin him
He's dying fast
Nurse! Help me! I need help over here
Hurry up!)

Ah, oh man
I can't breathe
I'm dyin
Can't think
Wait, wait, Mohammed, Buddah, no, no, no, no, no, no, Jesus, Jesus
Okay, back to Christ, first he lived, then he died
Then that easter play I saw one time said he came back alive
And God so loved the world, what's the rest of that verse?
Think fast, I can't remember, help me nurse!
What's John 3:16 nurse? "For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son.."
Gave up his only son, okay yea that's right
So whoever believes in him wait.. who turned out the lights?
I'm dyin! I'm dead! No my eyes went closed
I can't feel my feet no mo and my sides is cold
God please I'm sorry for all the wrong that I've done
I know I been a terrible father and a horrible son
I see it now
I wish that I could change some things in my life
I really never took the blame for things
like lyin and stealin and hurtin and dealin
I'd quit it all if your willin and let me walk out this building
I wronged you I see dat I wanna give in
but I ain't really sure if you've forgivin my sins
Well this is it, no more discussion to do
I don't know much but I know I should be trustin in</pre>
