[Gonzoe] (talking)
Uh Uh, Dirty Dancing
Shake that shit, shake that shit
Uh, what what huh huh
Shake that shit, shake that shit

[Verse 1 - Gonzoe]
That's why you love me
I talk so freaky
And spit it good
I'm doin the best hoes from Harlem to Inglewood
Bounce it dirty dancin' understand fact
I want your fingers in your pussy with an arch in your back
Lay the own, right now it's on
Got my fingers in your stuff, yo we workin, it's on
We all stoned
Gettin fucked what's up
The fuck you got in your cup
Tell that bitch to bend over and throw you mother fuckin' hands up

Chorus
What! I see you titty shakin 
Ass movin left to right (shake the shit)
Hoes dirty dancin, give me some pussy tonight (shake the shit)
All night, break mines off (shake the shit)
Shake it till they come off
Dirty dancin, baby got booty interference (shake the shit)

I see you titty shakin 
Ass movin left to right (shake the shit)
Hoes dirty dancin, give me some pussy tonight (shake the shit)
All night, break mines off (shake the shit)
Shake it till they come off
Dirty dancin, baby got booty interference (shake the shit) so what?

[Verse 2 - Gonzoe]
When you see some smoke in the air, club jumpin
The rest of these hoes to get undressed so I can rub somethin
Baby the man at your house he mean nothin
Truly cuttin all of a sudden
We roll, let's go
Bitch don't slam my car door
To a caught the movie on and gave em twice the roll
It's like want somethin
Hit the liquor store
Cause I'm a playa
Girls stray from you and fuck nigga
Kill enough nigga
The bitch got stuffed nigga
I hit it and hit it
Till she says 'that's enough nigga'
Why? cause I'm a sly nigga
And my dick get bigger and bigger...

Chorus

Shake that shit x 8

[Verse 3 - Gonzoe]
How many of y'all wanna love me?
Rub me
Bump uglies
Get Gonzoe tatted up on your tummy
Your luscious lips
Juicy, fit perfect around my dick
Conflict movie till I'm mows your lips
Watch y'all eat clits
Relax roll the rest of my sacks
Ease rooms, get back in the mix
Menasha, Dominique, Eshantay
I'm fuckin em both
Have a total party

Chorus

Shake that shit x 8</pre>
