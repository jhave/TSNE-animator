[Verse One]
Back then if I was a Jew the life that I led would not be common
I would be in prayer shawls anticipatin' His comin'
Between 1 and 30 A.D. I'd be under the Romans
Thankin' Yaweh that I'm not a slave, Gentile, or woman
Now don't get it twisted a woman had to be honored
If you came from out of her womb you had to obey your momma
For the fact that she was a woman wasn't the problem
It's because she was forbidden to publicly read the Talmud
Plus only allowed to be either in the balcony-
Or on the floor divided to avoid problems
And forbade to pray out loud, when it came to religious life
For women it was grey outside, till Christ came in the picture
switched up some customs
Now these same women are providin' Jesus with substance
Leavin' Jewish men grieved, they ain't agree
Cause out of these women's means they ministered to their needs

[Verse Two]
Look at Jesus maneuva in spite of the culture
Taken ladies and shapin' em makin' em soldiers
Peep this type of behavior was taboo
Jesus seen with Joanna (Luke 8:13) would make Him a bad Jew
But Jesus called some of the grimiest women
Like prostitutes even some of the slimiest women
In hot pursuit, women are weak is not the truth
And just to prove this point ladies I got the proof
Wouldn't be a Timothy without Timothy's moms
Eunice speakin' to Tim in them spiritual psalms
The way women were treated then these are similar times
But yet the men of God recognize ya strength
Who were the first witnesses of the empty tomb
Who birth Jesus being a virgin Holy Spirit consumed
Who stood for God way back in them Exodus times
And wouldn't even let em kill they son (Exodus 1:16)

[Chorus]
Jesus did walk with women in a special way
This was odd for men in the first century
Look at God callin' women to the ministry
Jesus did walk with the ladies

[Verse Three]

Da TRUTH: Just think about this
You're real fit in Abercrombie and Fitch
And when you in the mall you thinkin' about how to catch fish
Imagine you in Von Dutch on a date
No lust in the place, dude got a crush cause how you hustle your faith
You ain't tryin' be tuck at the waist
Cause you spend more time in the presence of God than adjustin' your face
Listen let me cut to chase
And encourage the beauty of holiness you should just want to be chased

Flame: Ladies we know it's real and it gets hard sometimes
Especially with the pressure of being flawless now
You can't do enough crunches to be the perfect woman
God ain't lookin' for perfect size but a worshippin' woman
Ok you gain weight maybe had an abortion
Made a mistake had a divorce and
It still ain't over Jesus forgives this is the gospel
so don't let that stuff stop you</pre>
