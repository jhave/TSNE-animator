(Intro)
Yeah, oh yeah (2x)

[Verse 1]
Now from the words I view, ya'll people got me thinking
Why do I continue rhyming words while I'm speaking?
Why do I continue waking up every morning?
Why do I continue dissing rappers who are boring?
Got to many questions, thought with no answers
Way too many people saying put away the sampler
Why do people tell me I should pick up a guitar?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'm a mc not a rock star
How many people feel like this?
How many people wanna grip they head and feel a twist?
Trying to levitate, taking steps at a time
You can talk what you walk, no effect on my mind (Cause' I'm breaking necks)
No more making threats
People in this game claim to be natures best
Class taking bets, just for teaching y'all a lesson
But man, this ain't the time, I got one too many questions
For Real

[Chorus]
What's up, with all these questions?
I try to figure out, what I doubt, and keep on guessing
Do I trust destiny? (Whoa!)
Do that effectively
Is this like testing me?
But it won't, no it won't, get the best of me

[Verse 2]
When will I die? and how will I emerge?
When will I teach these mother fuckers not to doubt my words?
How can I keep myself together trying to survive?
How will I make through another day at 9 till 5?
I'm lost in this world, double-crossed in this world
Block everybody out; I'm pissed off at this world
Got 9 years of paying dues, and not a thing to show
Feel like throwing in the towel, call it quits and play it low
But I can't cause' I'm dedicated
I love this game, but at the same time I kind of hate it
Got me stressed and I can't figure if I'm going to make it
Got people telling me my records now anticipated, but I got questions
Like why did that peep give them beats away for free?
And how come I got greedy and started charging a fee?
How can we be happy when there's families' suffering?
And when will anyone from here win the Stanley cup again?

[Chorus]
What's up, with all these questions
I try to figure out, what I doubt, and keep on guessing
Do I trust destiny? (Whoa!)
Do that effectively
Is this like testing me?
But it won't, not it won't, get the best of me

[Verse 3]
Aiyyo, 20 years from now, and I rich or am I broke?
Am I digging dirt from ditch's trying to my c.d out?
Do I sit behind a desk working different office jobs?
Paying off a student loans instead of dropping jaws?
That life ain't for all, and that life ain't for me
I was born to drop tracks, spit on mics properly
In the future; buy property, 64 acres
My people and my squad will be my next-door neighbours. (Pshh)
That's got me wondering, imagination running wild, my days are numbering
Y'all don't understanding what I'm thinking, 25 I'm finished
Unless I'm offered full-time employment in this business
Yeah? So what's it coming to?
And what am I supposed to do?
Trying to stay alive, they make that shit it's classified
But I'm doing what I want, expressing every word
This is my life, I'm living it so fuck what you heard

[Chorus]
What's up, with all these questions
I try to figure out, what I doubt, and keep on guessing
Do I trust destiny? (Whoa!)
Do that effectively
Is this like testing me?
But it won't, not it won't, get the best of me</pre>
