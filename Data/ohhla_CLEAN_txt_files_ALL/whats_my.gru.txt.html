Song:   What's My Life Like?
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
They wanna take a look at how my life is
But do they really wanna know how my life is?
So deep up in this thing it's like a life bid
Feelin the pain of the world, that's how my life is

[Guru]
Fucked up circumstances~! With no means of advancement
Have them slingin them things, you won't have clean hands when
dirt gotta be done, you wanna live like a king should
Trigger like Eastwood, so now he eats good
Plus got goons at his command, he's runnin shit now
Say the word them niggaz'll be gunnin shit down
His life is like he grew up fast as hell
He was raised by the hood and learned to blast real well
Life is like pedal to the floor, pedallin the raw
Fuck around he'll bring the hot metal to your door
Got bitches galore, ghetto superstar shit
If you ain't truly gully, he ain't the type that you would spar with
Goes all out in warfare, beware
Got enough firepower to make the whole precinct scared
When it's all said and done, it's get the money and run
Time ain't really on your side when you live by the gun

[Chorus]

[Guru]
He wanted money for college, wanted to be his own man
Joined the service now he's fightin in Iraq reppin his homeland
Sees more destruction, than he imagined
Hears anything move, then he's bound to bust his cannon
What's it all about teamwork means survival
He's a soldier, a long way from senior prom in high school
Constant thoughts of the loved ones missed
Caught up right up in the midst of what might be the ugliest
No time for hesitation, no margin for error
He ain't goin to the club, no profilin in the mirror
He's rollin with a squadron makin every second count
Other choices may have sent him on a whole different route
But none of that matters now, he's ready to die for his country
Not a boy any more, no time to cry for his mommy
Just lost another comrade, in a barrage
Visions of home seem so close, and yet so far

[Chorus]

[Guru]
A hard workin man all his life bought a business in the hood
Makin money, showin love, and still livin in the hood
Had a house with a fence, two blocks from the PJ's
Never ever got involved, in any he say/she say
Mr. Community, father figure to many
Conservative ways and never dressin too trendy
Could have drove a big car instead a modest sedan
Likes his wife to wrap his sandwich with a lot of Saran
Doesn't understand hip-hop, but keeps an open mind
Says if there's somethin you wanna know then you better go and find
just what your life has got in store for you
Might be tellin you that there's a whole lot more for you
Takin his weekly jog down at the public park
He didn't seem to notice, four thugs in the dark
They mugged him and slugged him now the neighborhood mourns
That night in the same hospital four babies were born

[Chorus]</pre>
