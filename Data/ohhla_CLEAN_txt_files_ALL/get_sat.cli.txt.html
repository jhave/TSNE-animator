Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied
FEEL THE NOISE!!
Get.. get.. FEEL THE NOISE!!
Mad Messiah, G.C.
 
[Verse One]
The party is about to start
And when it comes to rap, you got to have a lot of heart
Because the music is jumping, pumping too
We got funk and it's just for you
Coming out with something can't be denied
Coming out with something get satisfied
 
[Hook #1]
Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied
Got to get satisfied, never deny it
Come on, raise your hands
Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied

Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied
Get, get, get, get it
Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied
 
[Verse Two]
Hey ladies, now it's your turn
The music is jumping, you got to burn
Fellows don't you get jealous
Cause you got to raise your hands and jump for us
Now the music is jumping, pumping too
Huh, we got sounds headed just for you
Coming out with something can't be denied
Coming out with something get satisfied
Y'all get it?

Yo whore, you need a man? "NO!"
The one you got ain't shit "SO!"
You need a man? "NO!"

Listen pretty mamma, I got something to say
Gonna be brief ain't gonna be all day
Can we make love? "NO, WE CAN'T"

[Hook #3]
Shake that body, now work that body
Pump that body, shake it, shake it

Now baba, I'm what time it is
Do the boy get you off or is it none of my biz
No, it ain't

COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!!
COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!! COME ON!!

[Verse Five]
Well, you look real pretty and look real cute
I'm in need of something that you'll never suit
Bit it don't make a difference any difference to me
Cause I'm gonna party and dance, you see?
Now the doors are open, you got to come in
I'm gonna be your first prize and you got to win
Come and get satisfied, you never denied
Come on, raise your hands, make some noise!
