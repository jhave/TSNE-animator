[DMX]
	He's still right here shorty, told you I got you 
	Like the way I scooped you when them faggot niggaz shot you? 
	I'ma hold you down, and I mean that, for real
But everytime you beef with a nigga, I end up havin to kill 
	It ain't like that, and hey, forget about them two kids 
	Bout to get a deal, and it's as nice as you is
Oh you think?!
	Nah, I'm just playin, whassup? 
	Got some new bitches, I know you tryin to fuck
Not really 
	What?  I ain't your man no more?
	Just because a nigga, don't need a hand no more? 
	You know how we do, if one goes soft
	We all take the pussy and go up in her raw
It's like now, where you goin, I ain't tryin to take it 
Fuckin with a nigga like you, I won't make it 
	It'll be what it is
Yo, you in for the night?
I'm bout to take it to the crib 
	You get home aight?

Chorus: Marilyn Manson (repeat 2X)

The snake (snake), the rat (rat)
The cat and the dog 
How you gonna live 
when you're in the fog? 

[DMX] 
Yo..
I ain't fuckin with this nigga no more, word to my mother 
Fuck it, so you know I'm for sure, word to my brother 
It's like he's gotten worse than before, somehow I wonder
what type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under?
Then I get the call, yo! 
	X
	Police just killed your cousin, underneath the projects 
	Don't get vexed, niggaz'll pay, 'member I got you
	Told you I got you -- yo, I GOT YOU 
I'm in a catch twenty-two, but them niggaz got to pay 
But I know he gon' be askin for a favor one day 
But fuck it, I ain't got no choice in the matter 
Them faggots killed my peoples, and I wanna see em splattered!
	That's what I'm talkin bout, we ain't on no kid shit 
	And I'ma use the same gun that you killed them two kids with
	Is that hard to live with?
Nah 
	See, you still a playa
But what you want from me? 
	Ahh.. I'll tell you later

Chorus 

[DMX]
Shit is all over the news, bomb goes off in Central 
What the fuck have I gotten myself into? 
The mental, is like, "Get the fuck outta there!"
I'm out 
	Hey.. goin somewhere?
Nah 
	What the bag for?
Fuck it, what you want? 
	Can your nigga come inside, for a minute, and puff a blunt?
Here we go again
	After what I just gave you
	Wasn't actin like that, when you asked for that favor?
Yo, I ain't ask you for shit!!
	Oh yes you did
	When you really needed somethin, and you allowed me to give
	You sold me your soul when you didn't say no
	Just let a nigga go, and GIMME WHAT YOU OWE
	Fuck was you thinkin?  Ain't SHIT for free!
	Ain't a motherfucker you know, can defeat me
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned 
And with your help, I know, the Devil won't win 

[Marilyn Manson] 
	Kill kill kill.. kill kill kill..
Take you all on our way to hell
	Kill kill kill.. kill kill kill..
We're gon'.. do do it, do it well 
	Kill kill kill.. kill kill kill..
Take you all on our way to hell
	Kill kill kill.. kill kill kill..
We don't want to do it, we do it well
