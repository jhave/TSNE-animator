[Diz Gibran] + (BJ The Chicago Kid)
(Harmonizing)
Shit feels good
(Truly yours... harmonizing)
What's happenin'
Yours truly (truly yours)
It's Dizzy (truly yours)

[Diz Gibran]
Ey, since the moment I came in
My name's been synonymous with greatness
People stare at me like I'm climbing from a spaceship
Lots cities seen me pal around with basics
Speeding through the metro when all the towns adjacent
Stay neutral, nah I never did the game big
Still in all I'm a product of the same shit
Cali High was that guy I stay dipped
Snagged the baddest bitch in school but I came quick
Just a youngin' I was always into something
Plus the girls got the giggles from the slightest mention of him
Cause once you meet him you quickly begin to love him
And once you leave him all you can remember was him
Trips to Florida to kick it with my cousins
And see my grandparents probably entering discussion
On why I didn't finish school and won't go back
I tell them everything's cool, just know that

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
In this letter of love I sign my name under "Truly Yours"
(Truly yours)
And even though we're worlds apart, still in my heart
And that's truly yours (truly yours)

[Diz Gibran]
Years past, can't remember the details
Just a lot of hash and a digital weed scale
Counting cash that we get from the retail
And gettin' ass from promiscuous females
But that didn't last long, it just wasn't in us
Knew some fetch in the game, but we was just beginners
And there goes another year, look, summer winter
Spring, aw shit man I ain't fuckin' witcha
I'mma get a job with some benefits
Maybe hit the gym, go and get a membership
Or maybe not, but I'mma go and do some different shit
That's when I got in the booth and started ripping shit
Started living the life that I was meant to live
Dizzy, where is he, well I'm off on a different trip
Get a grip, nigga, please don't get bitter
I'm just getting things straight, I'mma get witcha

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
In this letter of love I sign my name under "Truly Yours"
(Truly yours)
And even though we're worlds apart, still in my heart
And that's truly yours (truly yours)

[Diz Gibran]
Ey, when Jay said it's time to put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
I took heed, full speed, my life's on a roll, time has told what I'm gonna be
Mom and Pop passed it on to me smooth as Sean Connery
No boss I move with autonomy, the truth nigga
Honestly soon you will line to me probably quicker than most niggas think
Yeah cheers grab a glass, nigga, get a drink
I'm on the brink, all I need is a push
On my way to the castles, peace to the crooks
And nah fam, it ain't easy as it looks
I made a million songs that ain't complete without the hook
I listen to the Gs and I read it out of books
And learned there's no way to be king without the rooks
And what it took is much more than you'll see
In every form this is me yours truly

[Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
In this letter of love I sign my name under "Truly Yours"
(Truly yours)
And even though we're worlds apart, still in my heart
And that's truly yours (truly yours)

No matter where I go
You're still in my heart
No matter what I see
No matter what I see
You're in my heart, you and me
Let me tell you what, oh baby
You gotta know the truth
My heart is still with you, oh baby
Oh darling, oh baby

In this letter of love I sign my name under "Truly Yours"
(Truly yours)
And even though we're worlds apart, still in my heart
And that's truly yours (truly yours)</pre>
