Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Stupid ass student
True I got truants in Spanish
Beats by Inglish rap chanish
Fluent, can't fly got flew in I'm foolin'
Adidas influence Nike I do's it
Coolin' with Mikey, lowkey I rock
Mags on my bike, Tay like he chuck
Hockey I puck
Rockie I fresh
Saki, my cup like Rocky "Wassup"
Ohh he got two weeks ten with the foolie
Doobie sawbuck
School be too huff
Caleb my nigga, Fresco my nigga
Gon head send it up
SaveMula too tough

[Chorus: x4]
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Wavy so wavy
Trendin' I'm trendy
Bending these pennies mommy done gave me
Business so savvy
Savey no spendy
Drifty so empty
City so windy
Master champ Chancelor, TrapMan the Chance or
Vance the bag handler, Bagger Vance
Pants is baggy, Vans rancid
Band of bad bandits
Abandoned bandanas banned from band practice
Sentence so gavel
Wordplay so scrabble
Chance to split atoms slit Adams apples
Adamant chano rat a tat vandals
Had to have at em' as an example

[Chorus: x4]
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money</pre>
