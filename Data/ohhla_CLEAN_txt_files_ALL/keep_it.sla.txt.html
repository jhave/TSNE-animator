[Intro]
"What's in my mind"
"What's in my mind"
{"You are now listening to araabMUZIK"}
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind"
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind"

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm like royalty around y'all
Down to fall with niggaz I feel are as loyal as me
Which is probably why loyalty is my downfall
Nobody's perfect, I'm first to admit, I know I'm flawed
Especially with the chicks that I used to be with that I don't call
I got an on-off switch that drives 'em up a wall
Wasn't my intention, just my attention
span for they kind, sometime it's high, sometime it's low
I switch into a magician when it's her time to go
Mekka-lekka-ha mekka-hani-ho
Keep drama low, I ain't Clyde, she ain't Bonnie, no
She rode a roller coaster ride with a junkie
Cheatin on his wife, stuck in the moment, now it's his time to grow
I used to wear rhinestones, sometimes I vibe wrong
I'm just bein honest
I'm the kind that can probably get addicted to anything if I'm constantly around it
But I believe in karma, so when bad things happen to me
and my career it was easy for me to stomach
Especially in a industry where they teach you to dumb it
down for the public, I just keep it 100

[Interlude]
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind"
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind"

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, which makes me royalty around gods
The more you grow into you the more you mature
And you know your crew is gon' downsize, that's when it's beautiful
What I'm ridin with 50 shooters for, I got to pray
Marshall made a nigga nigga-rich
That's rich enough to go muscle up but not rich enough to get out the way
Most dangerous position I could be in
Richer than niggaz thinkin but not as rich as them niggaz think
Shady got these industry niggaz on some fiend shit
They use me to try to get to him/hem, like a seamstress
I tell a nigga quick to e-mail Paul
And quit actin like a female dog
Other than that shoutout my nigga Khaled, you the homie my nigga
If it was up to me you know bro would be on it my nigga
You turned that Ross verse around for me in like a day
While I'm blowin Big Sean phone up for a verse, feelin like
instead of doin this busy body shit with my family, I might as well try for 'Ye
Don't mind me, I'm just keepin it 100

[Outro]
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind and turning with the tiiiiide"
"What's in my mind"
"What's in my mind"
"What's in my mind"
"Riding on the wind"</pre>
