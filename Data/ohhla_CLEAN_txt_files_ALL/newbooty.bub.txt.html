I found you, Ms. New Booty
Get it together then bring it back to me
Hit the player's club for bout a month or two
Put a cat on it then see what it do

Girl I don't need you, but you need me
Take it off, let it flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell storie, I let 'em tell they self
And you ain't gotta sell sex, girl it sell itself
Like nuttin' else, yeah I'm a country boy
But that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Ain't life grand, live it up Betty
Here go the whisper song, baby this is us, ready
Put it on me, enthusiastically
Whatever it is that you do, you do it admirably
And I ain't choose it, that thang chose me
It's Bubba K and Ying Yang all the way in this thang, go

Quarter to twelve and we just came in
Bubba gon' make it spark with the Ying Yang Twins
Sippin' on petrome *sipping noises*
Shorty in a thong, wom, wom, wom
As we get jiggling, motherfuckin' wiggling
Keep that thang shakin' like she frost bitch shivering
Ass be delivering all type of flashes
Cashes got these ho's shaking like molasses
Sssh *whispering* let me whisper in your ear
Get yourself together go and buy some new gear
Do something with your hair then hit the club
Shakin' ass at the fellas, goin' show some love
But that wasn't in just a minute ago
I guarantee you will make all the dough
So go and do your thang baby work what you got
And get what you want, make that money, don't let it make you

[Ying Yang Twins]
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere

Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere

Hi there, how are things
I once was a best man, now it seems
That ever since I had the pleasure of gettin' you together
Your chest is just whatever, I found the buried treasure
Yes ma'am, here's the plan
Meet me over yonder, okay, don't play
I'll bring the whoop whoop, you bring your cook book
And I'm a fix that stuff up, everything is just good

[Ying Yang Twins]
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere
