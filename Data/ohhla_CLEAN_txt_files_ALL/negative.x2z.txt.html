King Tee:
Now let me introduce whose first
The nigga that's been down 
with the set since birth
Whatever it was worth
I checked in on the norm
Since a juvenile callin' 
Shots in the dorm
Moms said you better get right
Or shake the spot
I chose to break and be a rollin' stone
Like pop
Stashin' the rocks by the gats
With the Gs
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze!
I don't fight the feelin'
Gotta hustle with a passion
Comin' cross state to put you down 
With some action
In actuallity I keeps it  real in the streets
Remininsin' younger days
Over gangsa ass beats
And I,
Hit the weed
Til myeye balls bleed
While my life is corrupted
By lust and greed
Serve you anything from cocaine 
Up to speed
I came with the drank
So here's five on the weed

Xzibit:
See kids don't belong
Up in grown folks buisness
The Likwit niggas rollin' through with a thickness
Sickness bear witness
Like tequlla without a chaser 
It burns going down 
Niggas guarenteed to drown
Legendary sound
From the west coast underground
The mighty King Tee
And Mr. X to the Z, see
Never underestimate the power 
Of the X man
Dismantle your plans
Or just catch you with a back hand
Xzbit bring it to you live 
With the know how
Cool in a gang
And ain't about to change
My lifestyle
Catchin' bodies in this uphill battle
But Xzibit unravel
Have smoke will travel
I bust Teflon rhymes
Into the crowd, bitch
You anin't Steve Rif
So stop trying to get Loud
You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision
Xzibit still winnin' 
Unanimous decisions

King Tee:
It's going down 
Once again everybody lay down
Run your money and the jewels
To the front without a sound
The infamous supreme King Tee
Glad to meet ya
Derranged in the mothafuckin' brain
Through ya speaka and hey
I walk around the hood lookin' looped
Strapped like a mothafuckin'
Desert strom troop
Niggas be like "King Tila
How you get that Benz?"
By sending birds to Oklahoma City
To my friends
I slang my gangsta funk
Through the night
Sometimes I fight
Like I'm the ghost of Eric Wright
Compton is where I dwell
It's like hell
Slangin' the shit that got the smokers 
In a spell
And all my homies live lives
Like crooks
Rich and infamous
Hoes wanna look but get shook
Cause we don't trust you hoes
You'll have a nigga fucked up 
With a bullet through his clothes
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live
Positively nothings positive
Negativity positively how we live

Xzibit:
Ladies and gentlemen
Undivided attention
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson
It's the...
Most dangerous things next to grizzles
Unsolved mysteries
Xzibit hit you penetentary style
Quick sharp and straight to the neck
I'm heavy on your chest
I'm all up in your life
Like stress
The coast that resides to your left
Whre niggas perpitrate
And catch a fate worse than death
And like Cyanide I'm hard to detect
Got more desighns and stragiht lines
Than an architect
King Tee chapter four
Verse seven reads
Xzibit shall come and break down humanity
Niggas lose ther're sanity 
Trying to handle me
Dysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family
