[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, yo 'Te man
Let me, let me, let me put you onto somethin man, yaknahmsayin?
I'm tired of the-these girls, yaknahmsayin?
They tryna play a nigga for the herb, yaknahmsayin?
Then they find out you emcee
And they wanna be all up in your videos and shit, yaknahmsayin?
I know this one chick, let me tell you, let me tell you what I told her

We need to sit down, me and you have a chit-chat
Let's talk about friends and define that
Let's talk about us, never mind that
Let's talk about trust, where your mind at?
So you lookin for a man, won't find that
Had a good thing here, let's rewind facts
Believe me I know all about them other cats
How they all played the game just to get to you
Spittin all in my ear, which you liked, who
Tickled your fancy, who you would invite to
Be yours, I penned verses, quote verses
With purpose, so nervous
I wrote urges, I spoke shy, you spoke lie
We spoke by, up until this year
When I saw you, you saw me, we walked on by
Till you found out I emcee, now you on it like...

[Hook: Phonte] + {Girl's voice}
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Y-y-y-y-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
{Why you all up in face like...
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Y-y-y-y-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo...}

[Phonte]
Yeah, yeah, OK, alright
Y'all know them niggas that I'm talkin bout
The ones that y'all be seein at the coffee house
Soon as they get the mic I start walkin out
And swear that they skill the most talked about
It's time to bring the emcees on
I'm sick of niggas looking bitch trying to read poems
Then try to battle me with sandals and capris on - come on dog
I'm bout to get hyped with this, shed some light to this
So-called black righteousness
Even though y'all niggas might not cuss like me
End of the night, y'all just tryna fuck like me
So what's the reason for the hatin? - Niggas with dreads
Callin they self Gods with white girls named Caitlin
And I'm cool with interracial datin
But I ain't about to hear no fuckin speeches cause I wanna have some bacon
I rock and swerve - that's why I can't fuck with coffee houses man
Get off my goddamn nerves
And deep down y'all know that I'm right
Man, shit, I'm bout to kick some Trick Daddy next poetry night like...
"My black queen, don't know nan nigga"

[Hook 2: Phonte]
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Niggas wanna come in face
Mad cause I'm makin moves and they runnin their place
And my face like...
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Yo-yo, yo, y-y-y-y-yo, yo
Niggas wanna come in my face
Fuck that tofu, I need a pork chop on my plate
Like this nigga...
