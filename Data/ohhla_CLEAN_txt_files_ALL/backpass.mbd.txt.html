[Prodigy]
It seems like, ever since a nigga became multi
Every women on planet Earth got their eyes
On the kid; they all wanna touch
On a nigga skin, they love me so much
They all got P on they brain
And at the show they do anything to get backstage
Just so they can hug 50, and kiss on Banks
After we all get a turn, the broads said, "Thanks."
Shit, just last month a nigga wasn't shit
Now I finger pop dimes, with diamonds on my fists
Niggaz bringing me they girl like, "You can have my bitch
Just help me get down with the G-unit!"
Man, little groupies  they make me sick
You ain't getting in the after party unless you're a chick
And bitch, you ain't getting in the hotel  unless we grip
And you're gonna look fine, plus suck a mean dick (woah)

[Hook: Prodigy]
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl  I know I seen your face before
Turn around  yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass
(repeat)

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Shorty what's up?  You know you wanna roll with a nigga
I'm trying to fuck  if you decide to go with a nigga
I'll tear it up  in the tele you'll be loving a nigga
I'll work that, work that  yeah, I'll work that, work that

[Havoc]
It's funny how a bitch'll make her way backstage
Harder than the politician on the campaigne
No games baby girl, gotta do the damn thing
Let me see you back it up till you pull a hamstring
Face fuck, girl go for broke
So hard, leave stretch marks up in her throat
Then Havoc on the floor
I don't need to get her number  she'll be at the next show
Half-ass dress, smelling like sex
Dried up nutt on her neck
They don't call us the master of the tour (?) for nothing
We destroy good girls; send them home with pussy soft from fucking
Catch 'em in the morning and somebody White-T'd
And that's the kind of bitch that you call wifey
She'll do it anywhere from the tele to the tour bus
Here's the hot line bitch, call us

[Hook: Prodigy]
Shorty, hit me high then hit me low
You get around girl  I know I seen your face before
Turn around  yeah I know, I recognize that ass
You was at the last show with your backstage pass
