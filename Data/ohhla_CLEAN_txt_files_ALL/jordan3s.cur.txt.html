I got keys comin from overseas
Ignition foreign exchange lane switchin
Talk the same shit I said different
That's the difference
Them niggas pussy footin

I got keys comin from overseas
Ignition foreign exchange lane switchin
Talk the same shit I said different
That's the difference
Them niggas pussy footin

I got keys comin from overseas
Ignition foreign exchange lane switchin
Talk the same shit I said different
That's the difference
Them niggas pussy footin
They ain't pimpin
Them bitches just looking and choosin when they see a winner
Smart decision
Could've been with throwback Jack
Still ridin spinners
Flyer than Delta
I can help ya
Get your weight up
Like the spotter raisin the bar and the plates up
Writin my raps by my trap bitch indicator
Ass too round and fat to be a fake one
I'm makin adjustments in preparations
While my program directors in my city
Are havin a sleep over in the station
Pluck my ashes
Refuse to ass kiss
Slow mo in a fast whip
No socks my Stan Smith's
Summer time in the Winter
I'm fine my nigga
Homeboy just livin
Yea
Comin at you live
Fly, wicked
So we can only kick it if you high
Bitches
Like they seen it before they recognize
I keep it G to a T
That is I
License my flyness
Drop jewels from the sky
That's my crib
Where I live
Walk with these
Jordan 3's
You'll be aight slick
Peel off like a New Era sticker
Out that bitch like a newborn my nigga</pre>
