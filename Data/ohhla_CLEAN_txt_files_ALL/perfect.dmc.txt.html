[DMC]	Everyone out there ready?
[Run]	It goes a one, two, three, and..

[Run]
Perfection to D, is quite essential
He has to live up, to his potential

[DMC]
I work real hard all day and night
I get to it and do it cause I want it right
I got bass, (tone), I use, (y'know)
And then I rock (the funky) rhyme (on) the (microphone)
I got a funky fresh (car) with the funky fresh (bar)
I'm a funky fresh (star) and I'm up to (par)
My name is D.M.(C!) down with Run and (Jay)
Is everything copacetic y'all?  (Kind of A-O-K)

[both]
PERFECTION	(yo yo yo, what we talkin bout, what we talkin bout)
PERFECTION	(most definitely)

[DMC]
I got prescription glasses and my eyes are correct
Two times every year I go to have them checked
Per-fection's my selection, and I will select
And if it's not (per-fect) I will perfect

[both]
PERFECTION..	(what we got?)
PERFECTION

[Run]
.. who me?  You want me?
I got a, credit (card) made out of (gold)
I get (pass) in a (class) and the story's told
I got D.M.(C.), I got JM(J)
I got Jeff (he's def) and Runny Ray
I got a dog (a cat) a mouse (a rat)
A fly (he won't die) and a little gnat
My name is DJ (Run) and he's Darryl (Mack)
Run-(D.M.C.), right AND EXACT

[both]
PERFECTION
PERFECTION..	(c'mon let's get em, tell em D)

[DMC]
I won't fail, I won't flop
Stall or stutter yes I won't stop
It takes hard work, to be like this
(You should know) cause I'm a perfectionist

[both]

PERFECTION..	(yo DJ Run what is it?)
PERFECTION..	(perfectly speaking)
