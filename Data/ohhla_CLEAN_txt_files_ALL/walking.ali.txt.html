[Intro]
Go ahead and wager that you never listen to another song of mine
I can't say I blame you either
'Cause if you made records you ain't gonna catch me listening to that shit
But if you do I just want you to know, I didn't make this to hurt you
God knows, you done hurt enough
Just... I don't know, try to make some real shit, you know

[Verse 1]
Bye, you ain't never gonna see me again
If I can help it, little fellow take it easy
Fresh out of forced tears, kisses and hugs
You about to lose the company of misery loves
Ain't never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms, instead you infected me
I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then it's time for you to scram
P.S., you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin'
It was never enough, your heart set on suffering
I admit that I was weak in the beginnin'
I wanted someone to need me instead of a friendship
I didn't think I deserved a true partner
So I transferred the arrangement I had with my mama

[Bridge]
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam, will get it through your head
I don't love you, I don't think I ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd stayed for the kids

[Chorus] X 2
There's nothin'more for us to say
Got my mind made up, I'm walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday

[Verse 2]
Round and round and round we used to go
I never fucked you right, I made enough bread, I know
From such a bastard, and mistreated you so
And how was it you loosing your mind to see me go?
Truth be told, I held you together
For all them years, and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick, twisted and vindictive, with your windows dim
Baby, you're not wicked hard bull fish, you must shiver
How you threaten to kill the most precious
Gift that you'll ever be blessed with?
Unless you're twisted, demented and depressed and shit
And alone 'cause you faithfully slayed your friendships

[Bridge]
Since you never listen to a word I ever said
Maybe seeing this door slam, will get it through your head
You don't love me, I don't think you ever did
And if you hadn't tried to kill me, I'd stayed for the kids

[Chorus] X 2
There's nothin'more for us to say
Got my mind made up, I'm walking away
Sometimes we just outgrow the role that we play
Hope you find a happy ending to you story someday</pre>
