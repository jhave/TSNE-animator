[Intro/Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Round and round we go {*2X*}
Round and round we gooooooo
Round and round we go
Round and round

[Nate Dogg]
What goes up {*echoes*} must come down
What goes round {*echoes*} comes back around
Stronger lover {*echoes*} it can not be found
Why do we {*echoes*} keep on goin round and round and round

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
In and out {*echoes*}
Girl I love the way you sex me without doubt
The way you scream and shout~! {*echoes*}
Almost makes me explode just thinkin about it
The way you call my name {*echoes*}
Can easily make me forget all my woes
So I won't complain {*echoes*}
I'll be careful not to step on nobody's toes

[Chorus] w/ a few ad libs

[Nate Dogg] + (unnamed female harmonizer)
Round and round makin me dizzy
And we can be how we used to be
We used to talk but we hardly speak
I wanna stay but you're pushing me
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund
Round, and, rouuuuuuuuund
Round and round and round, round and rouuuuund

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
