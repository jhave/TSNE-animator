   Verse 1
   
   Yeah....yeah.....
   Mmmmm....Mm!
   Alright, here we go...
   
   I'm thinkin' real hard about some money I can hold
   But everybody I know is deep in the hole
   A steady payin' job is too hard for me to hold
   I call around for work but they puttin' me on hold
   But in my hand a shiny .45 is what I hold
   I make a mayonnaise sandwich out of some whole-
   Wheat, I'm feelin' weak, I can't hold
   I gotta rob somebody tonight and take the whole
   Bank roll, some cash I gotta hold
   At the bottom of my shoe is a little bitty hole
   That's it, my mental sanity I can't hold
   I'm walkin' to the store with this pistol that I hold...
   
   Verse 2
   
   Yeah....yeah.....
   
   Half of me is sayin' maintain and uphold
   Suddenly I bump into some asshole
   He's cursin' me out, but this pistol that I hold
   Took control, and in his head I put a hole
   Ahhh man, now I'm lookin' around the whole
   Area, the gun is still hot that I hold
   I'm buggin' out, and I don't know how much longer I can hold
   I feel myself sinkin' deeper in the hole
   So in my victim's pants I rip a little hole
   And felt for the wallet, and took the whole
   Bill-fold, forty bucks is what I hold
   Suddenly I hear, "Freeze! Police! Hold!"
   
   Verse 3
   
   Yeah....mmmmm.....
   Come on!
   Yeah....wooh!
   Come on...
   
   In the penitentiary I see a whole
   Bunch of blacks and Hispanics that they hold
   In my cell I cry like hell, my head I hold
   One day somebody ax if my shoes they could hold
   I told this guy, "Listen! My shoe's got a hole
   But what's up with that shiny sharp knife that you hold?"
   He lunged forth, the first thing that I thought of was to hold
   The arm with the knife so that he couldn't put a hole
   In me, but then I put him in a chokehold
   Took the knife and in his neck I put a hole
   Suddenly all the C.O's come to me and it's me they hold
   Beat my ass and I spend two weeks in the hole
   I'm ready to bug out, my sanity I can't hold
   My needs and wants messed up my life on a whole.
   
   Damn. Just wasn't satisfied with life.
   
   Yeah....uh!
   Yeah....
   Check!
   
   The moral to the story is...your addiction to your needs and your
   wants is what causes problems in your life. Make sure you got whatcha
   need. Put at a safe distance all the things that you want. It's wants
   that get you into trouble.
   
   This is the balance of life...the balance to life on a whole.
