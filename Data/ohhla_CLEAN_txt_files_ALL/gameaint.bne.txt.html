[Intro: Bizzy]
(I'm just tryin to survive) Yeah, uhh, yeah
(I'm just tryin to survive) Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone
(I'm just tryin to survive) Wish'n Bone, Flesh-N-Bone
That lil' motherfuckin nigga (I'm just tryin to survive)
You know it's Bizzy Bone, hahahaha

[Flesh-N-Bone]
We've been doin this time, on the grind they down up north
Pull up yo' britches, you bitches been caught
Said they got somethin, some shit, you fucked up when you thought about it
You dealin with niggaz that's built to last
Stay fully equipped like trucks you can't afford
This shit's when they land, brought the whole clan
with a gift they can't understand; catch it
Cause you came in second, sure you niggaz been feelin it all day
Cause you niggaz been stealin the whole time
You sippin on it like the finest wine
I said, I'm just tryin to survive and that's my motto until I wake up again
On the real fool, mark my eyes God, who the most high, shakin 'em up again

[Layzie Bone]
So fly when I lean to the side, hit 'em with the rhythm, make 'em go bye-bye
Cadillac, roam your envy eyes, never seen nothin like the Uni-5
Climb high, strive, right? Remember that Enterprise
Nigga these niggaz right here get live, surprise, surprise
Been there, done done that
Been through the best and I've been through the worst
Made my money on the first of the month
Slang and I bang and I pop the trunk
I go up against all the powers that be
Original Thugs that done mastered the streets
Ain't no competition, who faster than these G's
now that the 5th Dog is free?

[Chorus: Bone Thugs]
The world ain't ready (I'm just tryin to survive) the game ain't ready
These niggaz ain't ready cause these lyrics heated heavy (we the unified 5)
The world ain't ready, the game ain't ready
These niggaz ain't ready cause these lyrics heated heavy
The world ain't ready (I'm just tryin to survive)
The game ain't ready (pardon me if I'm live)
These niggaz ain't ready cause these lyrics heated heavy (we the unified 5)
The world ain't ready, the game ain't ready
These niggaz ain't ready cause these lyrics heated heavy

[Krayzie Bone]
Y'all niggaz better get up off of my nuts
We comin with the rhythm, the flow they can't touch
Whenever they're ready to go, they get cut
Rappin at the same time, slang that stuff, stuff
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, Flesh
Perfection connection, one mo' time resurrection
Finna hit 'em so real that it ain't, no, half steppin

[Wish Bone]
Walk a little, get 'em when I hit 'em I get rid of 'em
Watch your tone and keep your volume to a mininum
Boy, watch yourself, grown man
Don't fool yourself, good hands, think fast
They done let the 5th loose, what you wanna do?
Militant streets, drop in your boots, ooh
Put it up and lose, this, is what we do
And I can feel the rain comin, all in the streets
Washin all the stains from me, so so bloody

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
I'm just tryin to survive, put 'em up, I'ma get my 9
Fly to the mainframe, same thang, Chain Gang
Wanna bang-bang, get down for my thang
Then change it back to size, higher when I realize
Tired of all the lies, surprise, traveled down the sides
Word to the wise, take a dip into the pie
Flip it with the pie, welcome to the eye
Kick it to the mind, back to the ride to the sky, Akon +I Tried+
Remember that die-die-die, little fly-by-night
Out of my mind and out of yo' sights
Survivor, now who's the rider, rider?

[Chorus]

[Outro: Bizzy]
I'm just tryin to survive...
I'm just tryin to survive...</pre>
