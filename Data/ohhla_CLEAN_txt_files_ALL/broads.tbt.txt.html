[Manny]
See these  broads, I like'em and shit
Wish I could, give all these hoes a picturemy dick
See I  like'em and psyche'em, then I get in the win
I might just need you and leave you at a quarter past 10 but
I ain't gon' lie, yo' pussy was good
But your mouth is better so I wish you would
Workin' your way down to the Diz-nick, uh huh
It feels so good when you do the liz-nick
You got doin' push-ups and I'm takin' ginseng
LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE! In the middle of the ring
you got my  dick hard like a '57 Chevy
Rocked up, ya cocked up, cause I'm ready
To go up in ya, let that other nigga send ya
Cards and shit while you suckin' my dick
I like you a little bit more than I'm diggin' my shirt
Ya little pretty ass dick suckin' expert, BEEYOCH

[Chorus]
See i love these broads, but I toss'em up quick
Every trick that I get, they get flipped through the clique 2x

[Baby]
These broads, nigga, I wsh that I could love'em all
These broads, nigga, I wsh that I could fuck'em all
These broads, I let these hoes just drive my car
But these hoes know one thing that I'm a superstar
These hoes get out of line, I'ma show'em I'ma hog
And now that I'm rich, I show these hoes they ain't shit
And every hoe I fuck with, I make suck my dick
It ain't no secret, I know these hoes bout my money, shit
But i tell a hoe quick, that she ain't shit
My main hoe player, I don't make her suck my dick
I might just get loose and wanna kiss my bitch
But not that I got a daughter, I'm supposed to be lighter on a bitch
But I'm gon' be hard on these hoes for life, shit
I'ma true U-P-T player for life, shit
But I'ma say it again, I don't love no bitches
I bout my money, nigga and fuckin' these bitches

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Now I had been here for 25 years
I understand one thing, that life is a bitch
I done lost my maw and my paw, my brother and my sister all up in one year
I understand one thing, I gotta ball 'til I fall
And show these hoes that money ain't no thing, dawg
See, I tell a bitch that she ain't shit
And at the same time ask that hoe to suck my dick
See, I don't take money and mix with no bitch
Cause one thing, these hoes would lose they mind and get lost quick
It ain't no secret, I make these hoes think I'll pay their shit
But I keep it real and pay my nigga shit
I say fuck a hoe and make these hoes back up
I keep it real and fuck with niggas who'll act up
And kick in yo' front door, yo' hoe told my nigga where your dope
Now you stuck out like a hoe
And my niggas, done hit a lick from yo' bitch
And all you hoes mad cause we done hit yo' shit

[Chorus 2x and talk til end]
