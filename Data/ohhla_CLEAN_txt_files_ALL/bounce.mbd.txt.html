[Havoc]
Yeah
Another banger
 
You can feel me if you don't, you don't
I'll feed you to the dogs like a bitch I boned
My only concern is for the cash I gross
A nigga more deadly up against the ropes
Problem dead on tacking tours to throats
Eyes, ears open you can try to get close
Approach me then
Get on the floor soldier like you owe me ten
Spread it, never say it
Actions speak louder than words
Get bodied because you doubted the word
Never fucked your bird, stop askin her
It's not that serious, keep backin up
She'll get curious, and delirious
Send that bitch home on her period
To stop Havoc got to kill me bro
These niggaz listening but don't hear me bro
 
[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo, what's the deal, deal
Play that shit I can feel, feel
Right now it's about to get real, real
Never leave home without that steel, steel
(2X)
 
[Prodigy]
Yeah, just bounce
Bounce, Bounce
Let's go, let's do it, let's get it correct
Let's ball, let's burn, let's all get bent
Let's party and celebrate success
Let's not ruin my fun, my gun will spit
Nigga find you a woman you can definitely rip
Ladies find you a man, go ahead get you some dick
What you thought? you a big girl, I'm a big boy
So let's not play these games, let's get to the point
Bitch get off me, I switch plans on you
There's plenty more bunnies for me
These niggaz got problems? I'll straighten that promptly
I'll be all over them niggaz so fast, they're so pussy
Go ahead push me to tear you up
Try me, blind me, force my guns
You ain't built for war, you built to bounce
So we gonna ride on you niggaz until the sun burn out
 
Chorus (2X)
 
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
