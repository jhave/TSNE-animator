we might want to take you higher than..
you might want to take it higher take it
we just want to take it higher than..
you might want to take it higher... take it
we just want to take you higher than..
you might want to take it higher take it

(K-OS)
Love do we really know the meaning, cause we always fuss and fight
and the mind is so deceiving, when the heart cant stead you right
So I wrote this song to tell you, that I cant stand alone in the fire
forget the lies they sell you, Only you can take me high

Love without a second... Far to close to mention
Love without a second... Far to close to mention

(K-OS)
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above
You can take this higher.... than I can
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above
You can take this higher.... than I can

(K-OS)
Theres no need keeping it seperated.
Just show me we moving together now
Ain't no need keeping it seperated.
Just show me we moving together 

(K-OS)
yo   yo 
You really got me going, you took me for a ride
Funny how you got two faces, Dr. Jeckle, Mr. Hyde
I try to swallow my pride but then I choke
people thinking this is just a joke
Never really got the verses I wrote
Its just a rap song thats all, people do not care
Do it for money and power and rolleys in the air
But you know who be returning so people dont fear
I got to take it high and disappear
I got to do it

You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above
You can take this higher.... than I can
You can take this higher ....And be all the stars above
You can take this higher.... than I can

Theres no need keeping it seperated
Just show me we moving together now
Ain't no need keeping it seperated
Just show me we moving together

You say you say you say you flying
and it feel so good
(repeated to the end of the song)</pre>
