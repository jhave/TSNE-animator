Who put this shit together

I done done it all from jackin' and slangin' nigga trust that
Stealin' cars snortin' dope gettin' bust at
Never goin' ta school all kinda bull-shit
They callin' my moma in I got her lookin' unfit
But look it aint Cint fault I turned out this way
Its my fault she told me right from wrong everyday
When my daddy got killed I think thats when I went a stray
Mark Nell L.T. and me made niggas lay on they face
We was about that gunplay and on the grind
We was on a paper chase we wanted ta shine
Gotta get it how you live where the fuck I'm from
Gotta keep it on the real where the fuck I'm from
Growin' up in the streets best believe its dangerous
They lock us up but the jail aint changin' us
You'll make it how i live if you don't mind dyin'
Growin' up in my shoes best believe was hard times nigga

(Chorus) 2x
Hard times got a nigga in all black
I'm goin' jack for that silver pack where its at
Hard times got the B.G. drove nigga
Hard times got me duckin' them white folks nigga

Its a hard time comin' up where I'm from like a twister spinnin'
Don't get caught in it
Its drastic drama its everyday life whoa
Jackin' is a way of livin 'if you aint on the right road
I move fast my people say I need ta slow down
Close ya nose or ya gonna go down
I'm beefin' with different sets I'm duckin' them white folks
Playin' my hoes close
They tied up like a rope
I'm slangin' tryin' ta make a million and chill
Buy a ten story buildin' and a football field
Diamonds round my neck and wrist plenty golds in my grill
Niggas gone get holes in they head if they don't keep it real
My mama cryin' cuz she think I'ma get my head bust
But I tell her growin' up with no daddy is rough
Welfare aint enough
And I wanna shine
So I'm goin get mine nigga and get out these hard times whoa

(Chorus) 2x

Me and my niggas buyin' cars don't give a fuck what its costin'
Neighborhood superstar Hot Boy$ bout flossin'
Crossin any of us get that put in a coffin
You don't hear we loss a shoot-out very often
We ballin' 
Shot callin'
Walkin' to the top
And when we get there believe we closin' shop
I'm lettin' my law down makin' Gs nigga
I done been through them hard times I'm makin' chesse nigga
Me and Fresh can hook up and make a hit with ease nigga
Fade me the B.G. pretty please nigga
I'm a six figure
Money go-getter
Drivin' expedition
Bet a bitch quick and put another hoe in her position
Riches is what I'm chasin' everyday nigga
Killin' bustas bringin that bitch in my way nigga
Tryin' ta shine Ca$h Money on the grind nigga
Stackin' gingles cuz we done been through hard times nigga peep me

(Chorus) - repeat to end</pre>
