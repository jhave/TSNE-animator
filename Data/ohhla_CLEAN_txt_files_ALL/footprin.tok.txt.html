Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Craigy T]
One set of footprints inna di sand and yuh a grumble and a screw
a seh it shoulda be two remember one thing mi youth
a Father God have the plan so when you see one set of footprints
a God carry you

[verse 1 (Flexx)]
Hurry up and come back was the last thing she said to her son
the day his life was taken she did not know
he wouldn't come back he died from the bullet
of a gun and now her little boy is gone

[Alex]
She said help me, Lord help me
and she looked up to the sky and she heard a voice reply

[Chorus]
When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you
[repeat]

[verse 2 (Flexx)]
Another baby left homeless
abandoned when he was two so the street side kids at the shopping mall
was the family he knew it's not easy being homeless sometimes you have to do
what you have to do and he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through

[Alex]
He said help me, Lord help me
and then he looked up to the sky and he heard a voice reply

[Chorus]

[verse 3 (Bay-C)]
It was early sunday morning mi get up a watch the news
then mi hear seh last night a seaview

when she tell mi jah jah know ti mash mi up naah tell nuh lie
but yuh know seh man a thuggist so yuh naah go see me cry
everyday and everynight she still a ask the father why
her brother had to die she heard a voice reply

[Chorus]</pre>
