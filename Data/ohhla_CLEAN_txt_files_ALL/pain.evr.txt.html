Somewhere between the lies and truths, borderlines get shady
Somewhere between the yes's and no's you can find the maybe
Somewhere between the highs and lows you can spot the middle
Somewhere betweens the questions and clues you can solve the riddle

Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away
And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason
And summertime you still smell like my favorite season

And it feels like pain, it's just like pain
Love is like pain, some people like pain

Somewhere between the mountain and sea, a river is flowing
Somewhere between the Earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing
Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing
Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing

Somewhere along the road you might wanna hitch a ride
Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride
Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling
Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing

And it feels like pain, it's just like pain
Love is like pain, some people like pain

Put your nails in my hand, pain
Fill my eyes up with sand, pain
Papercuts on my tongue, pain
We're right now where we begun, pain

Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered
Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered
Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered
Someday soon I know my former becomes latter

And it feels like pain, it's just like pain
Love is like pain, some people like pain</pre>
