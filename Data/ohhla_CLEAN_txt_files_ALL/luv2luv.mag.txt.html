[Timbaland]
Dance with me... whaaat?
Dance with me... say what, say what? 
Tango with me... say what, say what? (repeat 2X)
Dance with me... say what, say what? (repeat 2X)
Tango with me... say what, say what?
Haha, bring it in

Ooooh, I love what you got on
A tight see-through dress with some green and pink thongs
Word is bond, can I pick you up in my eight-five-oh
Or do you want to pick me up, in your black limo
Here goes, an even-ing that's memorable
A year ago you didn't like me cause I had no dough
Whoa, a black man on a mission, wishin
that your crazy ass would listen, hear bout what you been missin
I know you wanna do it, I know you wanna ride it, my pony
Get on me, bone me, act like you own me
Then I gotta feel your crazy ass out homie, what?

Chorus: Playa

Oooohhh, luv 2 luv ya, baby (repeat 4X)

[Timbaland (talking over chorus)]
I love you baby, I love you baby what?
I still love you, say what say what?
Uhh, I love you baby, uh uh uh uh I love you baby
What?  I love you baby
Tell me how much you love me

[Shaunte]
Tim, come over here and take my address
I undress in a black neglige like Faye Dunaway
Run your fingers through my hair and squeeze my nipples
Love the way you're talkin in my ear like that baby tickles
Later for uptown, no time to go downtown
I'm wild, since you see Club Clit, now take a look around
Dive in, my Billy Ocean, crazy drunk now
Quick to respond, when I cum just keep it there now
move over please, cause you're drivin me nuts
You went past my sugar-wall straight to my guts
I came you cum, you still do amaze me
One of the reasons why, I luv 2 luv ya baby

Chorus

[Timbaland (talking over chorus)]
Ahh, I love you baby love you baby
Ahh, uhh, I love you baby love you baby
Say what say what?  I love you baby love you baby
Ha ha, Playa, sing

[Playa]
I love how you express yourself
Sho' nuff you can work that body
I know you can work that body
You go about it oh so well
Sho' nuff you can work that body
I know you can work that body (JD, JD, what?)
Girl I love it when you're next to me, come down
Wanna make sure that you know that (ha ha, ha ha ha!)
You're the best thing that I've received
And I wanna make sure that you know that (love you baby, love you baby)

Chorus 2X

[Timbaland (talking over chorus)]
Ahh, I love you, we all love you, ha ha
Whoo, aah, say what, say what say what, say what?
Say what?  Say what say what?
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, that's how we do it
Right now, me and you in your nightgown
We doin this one time
For your sexy mind, all the ladies
All the ladies, all the ladies, I love you ladies

Ha, sing it to me
Ahhh, say what, say what say what, say what?
One time, one time, I'm out
