[ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
12 noon in the hood, Hennessy on the rocks, that is my potion
Bitches singin that sad love song like Billy Ocean
But to them hoochie hoodrats (I) give em no leeway
So now I'm peelin out hittin switches on a freeway
Leanin to the side (right) bouncin when I hit a dip
Slowin down so my CD won't skip
When trip I'm pullin up on all-gold D's
The orange bud is sticky, crack a forty with the O.G.'s
And it was cool until they put me up on the scoop:
"Yo Loc, I saw your main bitch in a coupe
Whooptie-whoop and they were goin to the mo-mo"
So I'm thinkin: Oh no, it's time to roll to the pad and get my .44
No hoe is worth another case, get out my face
As I bring it to the table like grace
Bitch, and I want nothin else to do with you
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
Not givin a damn about a punk bitch, it's all about the sex, man
Cause if the Loc take a fizzall you're goin to the next man
Prraw, prraw, prraw, that's how my toolie sound
When I pullin off on her
Cause I don't want her
You know what I'm sayin?
I wasn't born with that bitch
And I ain't gon die with that bitch
And I tell that bitch to split quick
And prraw sounds I make out the pipes on my muthafuckin 64
But let me get back on this bitch, though
My O.G.'s raised me to never ever let them hoes plays me
I pray that you save me, they pushin up daisies
Cause if I caught you in bed with Ted and Fred
That still wouldn't make me put no strap to my head
Bullet Loc stayin tall, though, through it all, though
Some of y'all ain't good for nothin but a bootie call, though
Yo, so I'm off in the wind and stayin true
Speed on, hurry up and get gone because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
There's a pijama party goin down...
Fool, you should know that I'm with that
The baddest hoes in the world want the Bullet Loc to hit that
I'm on the prowl, I'll be the one gettin my stroke on
I never hesitates to get my loc on
Ugh, get my smoke on ,but you know that's only right, though
The po-po wanna know why my eyes low
But I got a surprise, though
Pedal to the flo', that's how I peel out
Drink won't spill out, chill out and let my crop sprout
I'm out it's on ( ? ) takin it easy
Bitch, don't try to hide when you see me
Your game is wack, so stay the fuck back
I drop you off at the bus stop to give that horse his tail back
You been dismissed, dissed like snotty tissue
Get outta here, disappear bitch, but I won't miss you
And they all know what a real gee'll do with you
Straight give the boot to that ass because I'm through with you

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

Bitch, I'm through with you
It's too late to act right
( ? )
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on a bitch
Cause your game ain't tight

(Prraw prraw prraw, that's how my toolie sound)
When I'm pullin off on those bitches
Cause your game ain't tight</pre>
