[Intro/Chorus - Phonte]
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete

[Verse 1 - Phonte]
We was in the club
That's where I saw you
It was my nigga Pete
He was a tall dude
Wanted to get your number
So I could call you
Coming to missy's aunt's
Oh Pete don't fall dude

[Chorus]
Just make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete

[Verse 2 - Phonte]
Pete my singer don't know how to sing
Just make me hot
Pete I ain't got no hook
Just make me hot
Pete I don't know how to write sixteen bars
Just make me hot
Pete, oh just make me hot

[Chorus]
Just make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete
Make me hot Pete
Hold me down Pete</pre>
