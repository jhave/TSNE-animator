[Verse 1: W.C.]
Dub is the rider, and you're just a hostage
So whenever you see me cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin for this, niggaz been hatin on this
You know why? - because so many are relatin to this
Jealous, started the feelings intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin the music, I keep the music like pumpin
Cause Dub ain't in here for nothin, I got the killer starts jumpin
Yo, you know the color, Dub's in black
Always down, to make noise, and attack
So you better get back, unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin with fear, but it's with fear that you're screamin
You're wakin up on a sweat, cause Dub is givin bad dreams and
Yo, I'm not schemin, I'm just kickin the facts
That's how it is when The Connect Gang starts to jack
So brothers, that wanna scrap with me
Cause I'm all blew down with my Khakis Crease
Especially beggin to write some lyrics with me
I just snatched your girl with this platinum heat
Cause when it comes to Dub there's no comparison
And if you tried to see me, it's quite embarassin
But I understand cause you're mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump, you're too nervous to go

[Hook: DJ Crazy Toones]
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider is back and he is about to attack -----&gt; W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider  -----&gt; W.C.
Give us a freestyle here 
Alright, man   -----&gt; W.C.

[Verse 2: W.C.]
I can tell, that you're afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd, and they had to invite me
Because you're sweat as a puddle, but there's a puddle of sweat
I'ma threat, so wrap a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that calls Acne
It's ridiculous thinkin that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Til your A G-A-B that's known as a blow
I'm makin a point, but it's a point that I'm makin
I'm never kiddin or fakin like Race, I got them shakin
Scared to speak with a tongue when they're chosen
The sound of my voice in your ear when you're frozen
This is a battle to the death, so why I bother?!
You can't see the G in the blue God father
Givin a pain, but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin and tearin while I'm makin a livin
With the hype of the 9 millimeter
And a group Old Dees with the team of speakers
Now that, so others gettin bow "what's happenin?"
I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go
Come on

[Hook: DJ Crazy Toones]
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The shadiest is back, nigga, hide your sack -----&gt; W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
Let bust a freestyle here  -----&gt; W.C. 
Alright, man   

[Verse 3: W.C.]
The + Do not Disturb + sign is on deck
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
Givin the victim the verdict, so for the verdict a victim
Slammin my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell them they're guilty, and beep out the playlist
And get a new track from Dre so I can play with
Percussion; pumpin it loud when I bang
You wanna roll with Dub, you let your fly gang
It ain't a rule in my book you have to go by loc'
When it comes to cheatin you should know 
I keep fear in the hearts so they'll stay heart full of fear
Cause what you keep in your ear is somethin funky as real
The hump was incredible, for you Dub; he was shady
And all the West Side connected with niggaz got respect 
The soldier with my top rankin
Pushin dope material, motherfuck gankin "fuck them"
So play like the airplane, it just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause I'ma threat
As of now, I'ma break out the show "Of this show?"
That you'se a bitch motherfucker and too nervous to go
Come on

[Hook: DJ Crazy Toones]
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider is back, to still ball of Yak -----&gt; W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Shadiest is back, nigga, hide you sack -----&gt; W.C.
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
Let bust a freestyle here  -----&gt; W.C. 
Alright, man 
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me 
The Rider is back, fools best to 'yak -----&gt; W.C.

[W.C.]
For sure, Loc' I'm back for more
Puttin down worldwide
This is for all you motherfuckers
W.C. in this bitch connectin more real bangs
Aiy yo DJ Crazy Toones, I'm out this motherfucker

[DJ Crazy Toones]
Alright, man

[Outro: W.C.]
Bandana swingin
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me!</pre>
