Look, it's been a long time, I shouldn'ta left you
But now I came back to step through
Think of how many weak dudes you heard boo
Time's up, sorry I let you
listen to them, you see I'm back with a gem
And you knowin that I'ma always keep it hot 'til the end
And again and again, that's how we

[Estelle]
Make the world go round
Round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay, AY! Just feel my presence
Better than ever, back with a vengeance
Ah hey, slide on baby just ride on
I give ya, e'rything people rely on
My nigga, the heat that meat gets fried on
Still'll, drop shit to murder the club
Call it a killa, stand up with my back on the wall
and let her throw her ass, that's what a thug do
Put it down, rep how we rep, niggaz know we ball
If you ain't know we bought out the club too
Baby girl get it - let's swing it 
right back to the crib then I hit it, she love the way I spit it
Huh! See when I come they love how I'm movin it
They worship the kid and the way I'm really doin it
Shit, make baby girl moist
I'm steppin in the club, valet the Rolls Royce

[Chorus: Estelle]
Filthy talkin, bottle poppin
Disco rockin, park, go party
I feel life, money and Cashmere
These things, make the world go round
Round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh-ahh
Go round, round, ah-ah-ah-ah go round

[Busta Rhymes]
Now what the hell are you lookin for?
Watch how a nigga bring the ceilin to the floor
See the way I do and get a little raw now
Break somethin, see the way we kickin in the door now
When I come see a Range and a Porsche now
Do what I say, women to the floor now
More is what I'm comin to get
World tours now, nigga charter the jet
Got, women sweatin and they ready and they willin I
Come to the telly and they steady doin the diddy bop
Hit you with it, sh-sh-sh-sh-shorty gettin really hot
Pretty with it, the way a bitch can make the city stop
Whyle all night, mami know the routine
Style so right  and I'm creatin a new scene
Bass seem to make mami come and put it on ya
while I give it to ya cause you know I'm back to DO IT for ya!

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
And away we go  off to the next spot
First 5 is a little club kinda hot
First on the scene, see the blunt fire spark
Snatch shorty, take her to the corner where it's dark
Now, shorty breathin all heavy, hands all on me
Then she turn around and try to put her ass on me
I ain't payin no mind
'til I seen her crew waitin on the Soul Train line
Now, shorty workin hard tryin to get with me
Wanna take me to the bathroom tryin to give me quickie
But  I ain't trickin on 'em like my name Tricky
When they smell my cologne they wanna try to give me hickie
Like kissin and huggin and suckin on my wrist full of diamonds
Move slow, I'll tuck your little chick in my pocket
Type of shit I do all day
Like the last broad to the show stay, okay?

[Chorus]</pre>
