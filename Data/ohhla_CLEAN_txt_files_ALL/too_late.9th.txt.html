Da da da dum dum it's too late
Da da da dum dum it's too late

[Verse One]
A lot of artificial niggas gettin' mad it
Phonte and 9th got the raw uncut, with no preservatives or additives
So many words describe how we manage it
Beautiful, glorious, fuck it, you pick an adjective
Some of you beat makin' niggas sound funny to me
When y'all be in the club comin' to me
Playin' them garbage ass tracks but it's nothin' to me
Cause me and 9th come together so wonderfully
What a relief
I'm sick of these youngins with beef
We comin' with the live shit, really somethin' to see
Two hip hop enthusiasts, crate diggin' analysts
Break beat choppin'
Turn table protagonists
Waitin'
To crush wack MCs when I see one
With junior college skills, tryin' to hit a D1
Niggas kill me with superfluous schemes
But y'all ain't fuckin' with the merchant of dreams
It's like this and we doin' it
And we doin' it
And we doin' it
And we doin' it yo

[Chorus]
Da da da dum dum it's too late
We got the crown, y'all can't take it back
You wanna battle?
It's too late for that
Da da da dum dum it's too late
Yo, about to watch this paper stack
You wanna freestyle?
It's too late for that
Da da da dum dum it's too late
We got the crown, y'all can't take it back
You wanna battle?
Hell naw, it's too late for that
Da da da dum dum it's too late
Yo, about to watch this paper stack
You wanna freestyle?
It's too late for that

[Verse Two]
Ayo, let me stop and say this
Phonte drop the greatest rhymes to ever sit atop the play list
Got barbers tellin' me that I can not be faded
But y'all niggas fakin' jacks like Rob Elatiss
Just stop
You're not the greatest
Got a B Team style
Can't fuck with a nigga from the A List
Quick to tell niggas on the mic to back off of it
And earned an ill rep because of it
You need a hit? Let me order it
I got a masters in freestyle
And a hook singin' back at Laurett
Cause I never back down
Y'all niggas be so wack I hear your engineers laughin' in the background
Bawlin'
Like, "Why the fuck them niggas say that?
Fuck this session, where's 9th and Phonte at?"
Niggas kill me with superfluous schemes
But y'all ain't fuckin' with the merchant of dreams
It's like this and we gettin' it

[Chorus]
We got the crown, y'all can't take it back
You wanna battle?
It's too late for that
Da da da dum dum it's too late
Da da da dum dum it's too late

[Outro] [Phonte talking]
Cause you get an F- for your poor performance</pre>
