Song:   If I Gotta Go
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

[Chorus]
If I gotta go (yeah, woo!)
Can anybody tell me where? (ohh!)
And if I gotta go (if I gotta go)
Does anybody even care? (ohh!)

[Joe Budden]
L-look, look
We gon' party like it's 1-9-9-9
Somethin triggers makin my mind design crime when at times my mind's fine
Inclinded to find dimes, resigned from primetime
I need my stars to align when signs say they benign
Tell whoever cares if a stray happens to hit me
I need to take all the money I made with me
If I'm heaven-bound I'll put a hole in every turncoat
If hellbound I'm poppin shit through the inferno
My jargon is, I'm a arsonist
Since 11 when I found out what arson is
Look at me fully styled in that foreign whip
I get a high from it, I love that Johnny Carson shit
I got a fascination for the aggravation
Shoot 'em or {?}, I love the fabrication
Waitin on a antedote, but I lack the patience
On a second thought, I got my own vaccination

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Emanny]
All I ever dream's alone
That makes me wanna run and charge
Ohhhhhh...
All I ever dream's alone
That makes me wanna run and charge
Ohhhhhh...

[Joe Budden]
Underdig this
Problem is I'm smarter than e'rybody
But too numb to show it; they too dumb to know it (nigga!)
Eventually my A's turned into D's
Eventually my O's made its way to E
I'm tense, I'm not at ease, there's niggaz with degrees
that ain't never made it hot nor turned up the degrees
There's niggaz with credentials, accolades, paperwork (but)
But couldn't figure out how to make they paper work
Me, I fight to stay alive, e'ry day is work
Especially when they say it's six million ways to murk (here's one)
I wish the whole world was more like me
More likely to see through the eyes that I see
Or be tired like I be, let's hide our ID's
There's holes in my arms, untied this IV
At times, wish the world would comprehend like I do
Know it sound like I don't wanna mend, but I'd like to

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Forewarnin nigga, ya heard?
L-look look look look; I wonder what's behind the clouds
Flew all over the world, still I couldn't find out
Maybe I'm normal and e'rybody else isn't
Apron on over the stove in hell's kitchen
Uh, nails bitten, uh, failed livin
Another derailed mission for a nigga jail smitten
Enough to get the pound - if I don't like the shit around me
Maybe I should change the shit that I'm around
How that sound? Uhh

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
