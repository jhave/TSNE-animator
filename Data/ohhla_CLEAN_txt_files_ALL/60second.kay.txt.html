[Intro: Kay Slay]
G-Force (what's up Slay?)
I need you to make a hit for me (talk to me)
Four suspects (who?)
Busta Rhymes, Layzie Bone (who else?)
Twista, Jaz-O (I got ya)
There they go, take the shot!
Take the shot! DAMN!

[Busta Rhymes]
When I come and I hop and I skip and I rhyme and I dumb and I drop and I spit and I shine
Ay-ay-ay nigga what you really wanna do? You ain't knowin that I'm comin to take what's mine
Every time I come to hit you with a little bit of killa better know that you can never see me little nigga
While I'm at the TOP I will never STOP when a nigga POP, see the way I run it, and leave a nigga bitter
Y'all know when I do my thing and I bang, bidi-boom with a bomb and a BING!
Everybody know that when it comes to the shit I gotta spit motherfucker better crown me KING!
With a passion and a lot of action, see the way ya grab 'em, HOW YOU DO IT!
Then they wanna ask him how a nigga smash 'em, see the way ya have 'em, DRAG 'EM TO IT!
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-HEY! Now they gotta know what a nigga do all day
Count bread make a nigga wanna bounce heads when I drop heat in these streets, okay?
You shitty with a {?} gimmick, and I hope a lot of niggaz live near a clinic
It don't really matter who you wanna ask about me, cause I be the fiercest with it
While I'm givin you the final chapter with a lot of laughter, see the way I capture
Everybody probably tellin you the same shit you don't really wanna come after!
Now I suggest you listen whenever you hear that the beat up in the buildin
Trust me, this is not the place for you to bring yo' children

[Layzie Bone]
The B-O-N-E we got plenty of flows; from Cleveland, Ohio we rollin on vogues
They told me this record was only for pros, so Layzie gon' get in V.I.P. I suppose
Foes slammin them Cadillac do's, my story they caught has never been told
Sit back while I'm tellin this thuggish we blaze, forever I'm young and'll never get old
Poppin a bottle of Rosé when I rolls, for the aroma just follow your nose
We thug on the corner from night 'til the sun up, you run up get done up, I'll let it explode
Blow only where gangstas roll, so
Homie we smash around and we crash collide, whoever don't wanna be foes, oh
O.G. status, still got money up under the mattress
Nigga come get it I'll stick like cactus, money so tall those niggaz need ladders
Try to come close but they never could match us so catch us, we the masters
Y'all already know how we do it on the clearly, never compare we livin on stretchers
Willin to bet ya, when I twist and bust, nigga come through with Twist and Bust
Nigga been famous they know to aim it, they spittin my languange, "Adrenaline Rush"
Feminine niggaz that been on a rush, back to the dust we winnin the clutch
Just slipped through to spit some real thug shit!

[Twista]
Now I be the coldest on the island, country or on the peninsula - hit them with the venom and then I'ma 
disintegrate 'em or fade 'em, fuck 'em cause I hate 'em, I'm hot if you not check the temperature
Mayday one Kay Slay, drop the bomb on them when they put me on the track and I'ma
show 'em who was out when I make 'em go and commit suicide dressed like a Phantom or
Do and I'm about to get dinner I'm about to open the do' cause I'm dope with the flow
Never know how flow was the 'dro, I'ma eat a bitch up and I hope for some mo'
So long is the poem, I'm never a hoe, you can go check the portfolio
Kay Slay 'em just after fuck at you and then I'ma stick 'em, you know we can go
I'm cold so go get your coat, this be the season for niggaz that's sneezin and snoozin
and if you keep testin me you gon' be catchin a beatin and bruisin - what's up?
Look at the mojo and look at the swag, and look at all the vernacular
Things I be doin cause I'ma stay infamous so they be callin me Dracula
Oops I mean Blackula when I'm attackin ya, pullin up on them up in the new Acura
Or new pre-Camaro or new super Lego with the Pinot Grigio seats
I see when you niggaz be hatin, so the next time when you see me don't speak
Now you know not to send me no beat - cause I'ma kill it and murder anybody
that'll wanna get it where they wanna get up in it cause I be the realest, I'm a menace all the way up to the finish
Make an enemy diminish when I get up in the battle even if it gotta be on the block
2010 hip-hop, the shit don't stop

[Layzie Bone]

[Jaz-O]
What can it be? Rappers and thuggin on beats, none of 'em keepin it street
Look at the calves, all of them wanna be bulls, none of 'em ready for beef
What about me? Been through the pain, sorted the lames, keep it the same
Skillful syllables kill, my rhymin technique is impeccable still
Anybody ever wanna run up will get done up in a hurry, got a flurry I'ma hunt 'em for the come up
With a bang you better run from the one until you permanently feel it, I will live it, idiots gettin it 
"The Originator," gotta keep it greater keep the fader for the haters, nigga real for real
The all-time thriller, ready rockin the death of it definite, on it cookin and cheffin it (ooh!)
Takin over the world, made of with your girl, motherfucker recognize the nigga Hugh Heff'in it
Doin what you never did at double time, triple shot president, ain't nobody better in the residence
Through the crops, it ain't stop, over the top, bringin the soul makin it pop
Got a old school banger make you do the wop, got a Louisville slugger make you diddy-bop
Ever incredible gotta keep it way ahead of you, screamin at my niggaz in the clink doin federal
No trip, no travesty, I call the lick now I'm up like anti-gravity
Spit words from the brain like charity, if hip-hop was a broad she'd marry me
Gotta keep it gutter, gotta get the bread, gotta get the butter, make it hot, you can toast word to mother
