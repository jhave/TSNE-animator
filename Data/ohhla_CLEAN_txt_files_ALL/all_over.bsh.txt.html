[Baby Bash]
How them dame pieces pop that trunk
How them dame pieces pop that trunk
Hun

How them dame pieces pop that trunk
How them dame pieces pop that trunk
Hun

Chorus:
[Baby Bash] Just like a fly on shit, she all over me
            When I rise my whip, she all over me
            Like white on right, she all over me
            Your boy's nothin' nice, she all over me
[Natalie]   Just like a hand in a glove, he's all over me
            When he step in the club, he's all over me
            Girl, just look at his eyes, he's all over me
            I got him lovin' these thighs, he's all over me

[Baby Bash {*slowed down*}]
The million dollar Mexican is at it again
The million dollar Mexican is at it again
The million dollar Mexican is at it again
The million dollar Mexican is
Uh

[Verse 1: Baby Bash {Baby Bash *slowed down*}]
Hit the door, lookin' like extra dipped
Me and my partners, yeah, we gon' sip
On that big crown and Courvorsier
And don't give a damn what it's costin' me
The million dollar Mexican is mackin' the most
You wanna roll with me, hit the gas and go
Baby look good like a bag of dro
You one fly thang, now swang it low
She got more loose once she got on drank
She put some grey goose inside a tank
{Chi-chi's flying everywhere
I'm tucked in the cut like a big ol' player}

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Baby Bash]
She loves it when I come through, poppin' the slang
The million dollar Mexican is at it again
She want me to take her to the top of the game
Cause she keep it on track like she ridin' the train
Heels and half tops, to watchin' her ass drop
The crowd, they can't stop, they lovin' the lollipop
Ugh
Off top, she locked and sewed up
Got the club spotlight, til your boy showed up
Ugh

Pre-Verse: Baby Bash
That's, how, I, flow
She, drink, I, choke
I, got, she, needs
In my, pocket, like, trees

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Mickael
She starts to touch on my body
Oui, sa femme, elle est vraiment sexi
Come beat me up with that body
Oui, sa femme, elle est vraiment sexi

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Rich Rap]
Come chill with me like Henn' on ice
If she love me, hit it once, then I'm hittin' it twice
I'm the guy for the job and
Now I'm hired
Call your boyfriend up and tell him he's fired
I ain't gon' lie, I'm diggin' the way you
Move that body to the music I play you
Your husband hates that you been knowin' me
But I say, "Damn, that girl's all over me"
Yeah

Repeat Chorus</pre>
