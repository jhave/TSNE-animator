Song:   Judgement Day
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

First.. there was the collapse of civilization
Anarchy, genocide, starvation
Then.. when it seemed like shit couldn't get any more fucked up
We got The Plague
The Living Death
Closing his icy grip around the whole planet
Then the rumors started
The last hardcore MC's.. were working on a cure
.. that would END the pestilence.. why?
I like the death
I *LIKE* the misery
I LIKE THIS WORLD!!!!!

Space, The Final Frontier
These are the voy-voy-voyages of the Starship TICAL

As I walk in the shadow of death
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
Your host this evening for H-O-T
N-I-X, you get splashed with the Tec
Nobody go, til the God say so
You got a second or mo', to run for the do'
Before I blow back off the map, contact
You didn't know Stat' could get down like that
Who want them test rocket launcher, YES
Mr. Meth, hold the fort, most def'
Kids is dead wrong, song's too long
Get swung on, can't we all get along?
See my pinkie, see my thumb
See that kid with the pump shot gun?
Bust your gums, leave your whole shit numb
Mmmm now what's this?  Smell like fish
Mr. Big Mouth, the gat be trout
You need to douche out your style no doubt
Johnny struck through the Shaolin slum
PRUM PRUM PRUM on my Shaolin drum
Niggaz don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playin over here, PLAYA
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper callin, Judgement Day
(10) Ten let the countdown begin 
(9) I was born in the mind
(8) Take the head of a snake
(7) Behold Armaggedeon
(6) Ain't no love for the rich
(5) Only strong will survive
(4) Cause we live by the sword
(3) Plus sixty degrees
(2) For the black and the blue
(1) For the sun.. step into millenium
The name of this one is Judgement Day
No more BS, can't come out and play
Don't blame me, blame society
Type of chemistry for a live MC
Hands in the air like you just don't care
You all get a share, there's a party over here
Year two-thousand, keep bouncin
T-Minus, thirty seconds and countin
New York's finest, still wildin, Shaolin
At the full moon howlin
Get Til It's Gone, killa bee kills
Only time will reveal like the words in the song
Cause love's what I feel for my crew, bust steel
Niggaz don't got to pay my bills
P.L.O. pack the slingshot flow
Plant the seed, let the garden grow
And stick that rhyme where the sun don't shine
Darts pierce your heart like a Valentine
Tis my Tale From the Crypt that's sick
Bloodbath, body baths and shit
U-F-C fightin championships
G.I. Joe's with the Kung-Fu Grip
Now you don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playin over here, PLAYA
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper callin, Judgement Day
C'mon.. I said c'mon..

Behold Armaggedeon
Ain't no love for the rich
Only strong will survive
Cause we live by the sword
Plus sixty degrees
For the black and the blue
