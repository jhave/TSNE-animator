Smokin that Cali thang.
Huh, nigga little fucked up in this bitch.
I'm uh, trying to see what's happenin with these hoes.
I got my girl Pinky and lil' slim in here.
Shit, Craig B, all of Beats By The Pound
Mo. B nigga with this track, KL.
Nigga Bad Azz in this bitch.
Goodie Mob, all them niggas.
Khujo, Gipp, all of them nigga.
I'm doing this shit here, we ride this bitch here.
I want to see them hoes ride nigga.
Pokey in this here nigga what's happenin?
Huh?

Chorus
I luv it when them hoes ride
I luv it when them niggas say never die, never die
I luv it when them hoes ride
I luv it when them niggas say never die, never die
I luv it when them hoes ride
I luv it when them niggas say never die, never die
I luv it them hoes ride
I luv it when them niggas say what, what

Pistol packing, car jacking, nigga fuck rappin
Get your ass caught up here in an avragated kidnappin
Slapping hoes, I suppose
You like the way I walk with this limp
Call me Third Ward Daddy Pimp
&gt;From that big bad southern region
Bitch I ain't leaving till I see them hoes shake a little sumthing
I luv it when them niggas say bitch you gotta kill me right here
I ain't running, fuck talkin, you bout that playin

Chorus

Club crowded, niggas pushin, hoe I'm trippin
Bitch I'm facin eleven months on the weed charted fuck it like the trees
Puttin tricks up on they knees, shake em off like some fleas
Throw up in the keys, white gansta on the more, ask em hoes
They love the way they twist, bitch you know my clique
N-O L-I-M-I-T, fuckin tricks, makin money
With the Rollie with the gold teeth, meet me in the back
Smoke a quarter sack, now I'm screamin "where the killas at"</pre>
