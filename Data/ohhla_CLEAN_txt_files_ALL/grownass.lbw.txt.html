Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
See that's why I see it nigga
You talkin bout he put his first record out in 2000
I don't give a fuck about his first record coming out in 2000
He was fuckin it up before that
Man, we just tell the nigga he was ready to go
We put him on a couple of songs when Bad probably had him on some bullshit ass songs
He was goin hard in the motherfucker
So you can't go from a child star into manhood and still be a star
And still maintain your status and still be able to you know, do your thing

[Verse 1]
25 I'm a grown ass man
Rocking a grown man watch, counting these grown man bands yeah
I got a daughter, life getting harder
Louie sandal so light feel like I'm walking on water
I don't fuck with girls my age
My hoes ain't on Facebook or Myspace
Find em up in the club, so sophisticated
Buju little waste, whack far from basic
Let's face it, yellow diamonds in my bracelet
It's the rubber boy, not Slim Magazine
I mean these boys out here trying to talk green
I don't think these guys really wanna talk money that mean

[Chorus: x2]
I'm a grown ass man, grown ass man
Niggaz acting like they know who the fuck I am
People sayin I've changed but that comes with age
Guess this explains why I act this way

I'm a..

[Verse 2]
Been all around the world
See you busy watchin me while I'm schemin on your girl
Been on tour with Snoop DogG in the gold coast
Half a fifty and I've already done the most
Why you fighting in here? Playin niggaz I swear
Don't you see all these bad bitches up in here?
See I roll my own blunts, I don't need no help
And I work for Sean Mars see I pay myself
I grew up, you should do the same
I guess that's why so many people say that I've changed
Well I run my own shit, plus my paper's legit
So the IRS don't be all in my shit

[Chorus: x2]
I'm a grown ass man, grown ass man
Niggaz acting like they know who the fuck I am
People sayin I've changed but that comes with age
Guess this explains why I act this way

[Verse 3]
I got my own crib, dow in South Beach
I'm court side, I'm so close you think I'm playing for the Heat
See I'm a mellow type of dude, no rims on the coupe
I can fit 30 thou when it's time for a soup
You gotta dress up sometimes
It feel good just to get fly
You boys better pay attention, not to mention
This grown man business holla at me

[Chorus: x2]
I'm a grown ass man, grown ass man
Niggaz acting like they know who the fuck I am
People sayin I've changed but that comes with age
Guess this explains why I act this way

I'm a...</pre>
