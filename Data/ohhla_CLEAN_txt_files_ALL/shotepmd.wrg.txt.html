[Intro/Chorus: DJ K LA Boss scratching Quotes below]
Don't get too close because you might get shot ----&gt; Erick Sermon
Don't get too close because you might get shot ----&gt; Erick Sermon
I shot the sheriff  ------&gt; Rita Marley
Don't get too close because you might get shot ----&gt; Erick Sermon

[Warren G]
I had to shoot the sheriff, it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
For all the many murders; L.A. is a war field
We keep doing war shields
Streets keep souls, young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it, they'll put you in a twist
And there ain't nobody like my down ass homie
And the police always trying to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools; they do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs and cells to stuff you in

[Warren G]
They're trying to stick me with some shit that I did not do
You know who; the boys in blue
There they go with their assumptions, slavery's over 
Let us have something, why you wanna pull me over?
Cause I'm bumping? - I just made a new song
My profession is music, your profession is protection with gats
Then use it on him, when he's trying to take my life away
I'm just trying to live my life today
So I keep away from fools; they do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs and cells to stuff you in

[Warren G]
I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputy, I didn't have to
Cause in this game, they always trying to blast you
And leave it to the cops, to find out who did the murder
They harass the wrong clan, and arrest the wrong man
The homie day-dog got drapped, but that's okay
Cause I'ma work for life, so he can see another day
A homie is a homie, a fake is a snitch
Straight game from the Pen', from the homie Jay
So I keep away from fools; they do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs and cells to stuff you in
