[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see (my struggle, my pain)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (made me who I am)
there's no other place that I would rather be (Benzino)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (Troy Bell)
This life chose me (c'mon Troy, let's go)

[Intro - Benzino (Troy Bell)]
Yeah
This one's for the world, my people *my people)
You think you know me *uh uh*, you have no idea who I am
This is my story, it's not about the magazine
About my baggy jeans, my braids, or my jewelry
The Money, Nah
This is why I didn't choose this life (yeah yeah)
This life chose me

[Verse 1 - Benzino]
It wasn't long ago when it all began
Standing in the graveyard while they buried my man
That's when I first understood how this game is played
Either kill a nigga quick, or you might get get played
Scene never was that big, the hood was even smaller
Grew up in the projects, then we moved to four corners
Pops went to prison, I knew about the system
Every sunday morning me and moms paid a visit
He was heavy in the streets, maybe mafia connected
All I'm gonna say he was very well respected
They called me Ray Dog, yeah that's Tito's son
I met a lot of great men for many years to come
I'm getting money on my block all night
Running with a bunch of niggas born to fight
Boston was the first on the east to really bang out
Niggaz run these streets while they automatics rang out

[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me
there's no other place that I would rather be (that's right)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (I didn't choose this man)
(yeah)

[Verse 2 - Benzino]
Now fuckin' with these niggaz on the other side of town
The All Mighty forms, we the hardest click around
Jewelry was heavy, niggaz rolled thirty thick
Artillery was heavy, jake steady on my dick
And I'm squeezin all types of guns *whatever*
Mom's is cryin but that's the life I loves
And that's the life I love, street life, real thug niggaz making rap music
I met Dave at the radio, he cool
Started The Source mag, always had to be in school
One piece of paper, then it grew into a book
But I had my own paper cause my block wasn't looked
I caught a couple of bids, I'm fightin' court cases
It was news at eleven, or in the news papers
Investigation federal, I knew it from the start
Either jealousy, or envy, tore my crew apart

[Hook - Troy Bell (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me
there's no other place that I would rather be
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
(here we go)

[Verse 3 - Benzino]
If money's is the root of all evil, then burn it
Or get up off your ass, motherfucker, and earn it
I moved to New York, it was time to make it happen
Dave is my dog, and yeah Zno still rapping
I walked through the valley of death with no fear
I'm holdin' Dave down till a niggaz outta here
I breathe for my niggaz deceased, holdin' in
Exhale all the anger that I'm holding within
Too many people in my life never comming back
Never where you from, it's only where you standin' at
I got a few good niggaz, a box of ammunition
That's all I really need for me to carry out a mission
If Eminem wanna squash beef, tell him call me *where you at*
Meet him anywhere, he can bring his whole army
The day will soon come when the world recognize
Zno is the realest since Pac been alive
Motherfucker!

[Hook - Troy Bell, (Benzino)]
Look into my eyes and you will see (yeah, it's about the struggle man)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (yeah it's about my people man)
there's no other place that I would rather be (you wanna know me huh)
(don't judge me, there's only one that can judge man, you need to know me man)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me
(don't judge me, there's only one that can judge man, you need to know me man)
Look into my eyes and you will see (I didn't choose this life, this life was bestowed upon me)
My life, my pains, and the pains that made me (ha, you can't walk in my shoes yo)
there's no other place that I would rather be (ugh, yeah they're my niggaz, and I'm still here man)
I didn't choose this life, this life chose me (yeah I'm still here, and I'm going nowhere)

[Outro - Benzino]
Uh huh uh huh, yeah
Yeah Troy
You did it on this one nigga, believe that
Yeah, The Arch Nemesis
In a hood near you
