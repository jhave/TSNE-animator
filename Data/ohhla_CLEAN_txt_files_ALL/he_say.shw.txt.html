[A.G.]
He say, she say, brothers be yapping
Running they mouths and don't even know what happened
Just for conversation you run your lip
And now my man's got problems, so now he's got to flip
His girl is heated, and she's leaving too
Because you ran your mouth, what you said wasn't even true
See my man's name is Victor
His brother Mike is boning Shante, that's Eric's sister
Mike had a girl, but Shante knew
But on the downlow a little rendevous
One day upstairs the two were chilling
His girl popped up, yep yep, she started illing
Mike said that's Victor's undercover lover
So victor caught on and had to cover for his brother
Walked Shante home, and said so long
But somebody saw the two and thought they had something going on
It got around like a hula hoop
And you made it your business, Victor's girl knew the scoop
Know she's beefing, flipping and crying
Didn't believe when he said that they were lying
It's over, the relationship is done
Victor was a loyal brother if I ever knew one
You say he's wrong, but that's not a fact
See if you don't know the story then you shouldn't say jack
Well it's over anyway, huh
And Victor is the victim of he say, she say

("He say, she say, I heard it throught the grapevine" - Greg Nice) (repeat 4x)

Losing a girl is one thing, but there's another side
Of he say she say, a lot of brothers died
All the gossip don't belong in the streets
&gt;From another brother talking now you got major beef
Two kids had a beef, one was your man
They went out like troopers, and they went out with their hands
Your man took a loss, but he left it at that
But you made it your business to say he was coming back
The other kid wouldn't have it
So he ran to his car, yeah he packed the automatic
And you knew he wasn't joking
So you called up your man, "Yo yo, we gotta smoke em"
Came downstairs with the nine and the vest
Little did you know he didn't aim for the chest
Caught him in the head, now your man is dead
Rest in peace chief, cause of something that you said
Tell it to his family on his funeral day
And your man is a victim of he say, she say

("He say, she say, I heard it throught the grapevine" - Greg Nice) (repeat 4x)

Somebody told my man that the Giant is dead
He went out like a trooper and took two to the head
Somebody said to me that I'm not A.G.
Because the Giant is dark-skinned and 6'3"
Somebody told Show that A.G. can't flow
That witch is crazy, because you know I'm good to go
(Ayo I heard Showbiz is making money off the crack)
He doesn't have to Jack, because he's making fat tracks
You don't even know and that's upsetting me
And I won't be a victim, so don't put me in Jeopardy
The ones who yapped this goes out
Always putting other words in other people's mouth
I'm a end it on this note, okay?
Don't let em make you a victim of he say, she say
