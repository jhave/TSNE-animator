I said tell me what's really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening
gon for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm bout my paper like a muthfucking scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife your bitch is as hot as ice
every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got 'em right) Yeah I got 'em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ's got my credit cards and a lot of ones
yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite
someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight
call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollar's to the perfect height
work something twirk something basis
she just tryna make it so she right here gettin naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her
but I could never love her cause to her I'm just a rapper
and soon she'll have met another
that's why me and lil jazz bout to spaz can you keep up
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
and Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj
I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
and girl I'm fucking serious I'm with it if you with it
cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
and Life aint a rehearsal the camera's always rollin'
so come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin'
cause it's on...

[Chorus - Drake]
Yeah girl it's on
you know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone
and you just tell me what you down for
anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
but you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope you miss me a little when your gone

[Lil Wayne]
Oooh shit, motherfucker God Damn
kicking bitches out the Condo like pam
getting money everyday I'ma ground hog
bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off
erghhhh, that's nasty
yes I am Weezy but I aint asthmatic
James Bond cologne, hunny I put on
make 'em run and tell there friends like a marathon
voice baritone haters carry on
beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
to women I condone better write me when I'm gone
no I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
uhh, I'm a love machine
and I won't work for nobody but you
it's only me and her because the Bugatti coupe
its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop
I aint lying I shoot
you don't need signs for proof
turn you to a vegetable like you lining soup
and when I'm in the booth, shit the lion is loose
man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone till November
fuck it I aint trippin, I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
I'mma say it if the rules aint bent don't bend 'em
real nigga talking
shut the fuck up hoe
gotta do it one time for Haiti, wattup zoe
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do'
Cause that's where I bring it
soo wu if you bang it, motherfucker
