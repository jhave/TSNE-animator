[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah {*coughs*}
Kendrick Lamar, uh

Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm a thinker, not a drinker, but still I Hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like when novocaine stabs
in your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crip and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur'an can save
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister, his older cousin, he honored him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
To Johnny, he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his +wings+ like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "the hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
with blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
The power of banging, he was walking from... {*gunshots*}
Little Johnny

[Outro: Malcolm X] + (Kendrick Lamar)
"I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
 when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
 and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
 And then at that point you'll have a situation
 where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
 and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
 And this type of thinking also will bring an end
 to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
 And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
 No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
 It's something that the black man has to bring an end to"</pre>
