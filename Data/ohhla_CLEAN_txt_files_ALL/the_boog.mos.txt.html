[Mos Def]
Bismillah ir Rhman ir Raheem
{In The Name Of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate}

What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
What it is, what it is, what it is
What it is
See me, want me, give me, trust me
Feed me, fuck me, love me, touch me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your famous nightmare
Close your eyes and ill be right there
While...Open...All...Over...A-gain
See me, touch me, give me, want me
Feed me, fuck me, trust me, love me
This whole world is cold and ugly
What we are is low and lovely
I am the most beautiful boogie man
The most beautiful boogie man
Let me be your famous nightmare
Close your eyes and ill be right there
While...Open...All...Over...A-gain...Ag-ain
