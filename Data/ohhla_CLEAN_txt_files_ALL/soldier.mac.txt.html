[Chorus 4]
Hoes twerk somethin! Niggas show your soldier rags! X 4

[Mac]
They probably told you I'm a soldier and I'm from uptown
I know you heard about the way I sling the iron when I come 
around
That's Mac, that's the nigga, boy them hoes be actin
Want me to be your baby daddy since you heard I was rappin
But that coochie ain't nothin but meat on the bone
You gotta twerk it up and serve it up and leave it alone
And when you done pass it to me, or pass it to P
And let a real nigga hit em with some Ghetto D

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 4]

[Master P]
I'ma hog on these streets so I live my life fast
I'm that nigga from the South, told them hoes Bounce They Ass
Don't play no games, unless you wanna get popped
I'm a No Limit soldier so the Party Don't Stop             
So represent your hood if you're Bout It Bout It
A nigga went world wide, still rowdy rowdy
And them hoes don't like that, say what
But I'm a third ward nigga and I don't give a fuck
So pass me them thangs, Let's Get Em
Your baby mama want the Hook Up so I hit em
I'm in a 600 Benz, Mac in a 4 point 6
Left them hoes at the hook up sayin "Throw that bitch!"
Now the party's buck wild and we don't care
Pass the Hennesey and Weed, that's How Ya Do Dat There

[Chorus 1 - 4]</pre>
