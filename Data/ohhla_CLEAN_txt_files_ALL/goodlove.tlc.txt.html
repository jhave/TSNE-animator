Everytime I get to see you
I get this feelin'
It's so fuzzy inside
And as soon as I walk away from you
I'm still tasting your kiss
Saving it in my mind

It's not everyday I find
A guy that makes me smile all the time
Not the way that you do
All the guys I thought I used to love
Compared to you they don't match up
They got nothing on you

[Chorus]
I think I found a good good good love
The kind that will put it on you
The kind that you wanna hold on to
I think I found a good good good love
We can be lovers and friends too
And they'll do anything for you
A good love

Baby you got somethin' special
That has me thinking of settling down
You're the one my mama told me
Would sooner or later finally come around

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

You bring me joy
And you bring me much pleasure
I could never see myself leaving you ever
Your soft touch is good and it can't get no better
You have got my mind so caught up
I'm drunk off of your good love

[Chorus]
