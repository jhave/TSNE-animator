[Intro]
Yo. Dear hip hop. (Statik Selektah) Don't take this shit too seriously y'all
Yeah, shit got me stressed out man. I know y'all stressed out too
All y'all sick and tired of this bullshit man.
"His eyes said pray for me
 I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully" - Jay-Z 'D'Evils'

[Verse One]
I'm writing this with ether in the lungs 
And a burner to the brain 
So forgive me if the words come across a bit strange 
This a suicide note, last words to the game 
Nas was right, shit got to change 
Unless we said B.I.G. died in vain 
And Pac died in vain 
Been too high on rims to see the writin' on the train 
How can Lupe complain?
When his Fiasco, at a rap show to honor rap greats is too blame 
From rap music dying in a box, sales dying on the charts 
The art's missin', it's heart beat stopped 
Master P sold us out
Talkin' 'bout I should stop saying "nigga"
Fuck that! They brought this nigga out
This is freedom of speech nigga
The arson's in the house
Burn your white house down with Bush twins on the couch
I ain't come here to +Crank dat+ Joc or +Walk It Out+
Either I'm blind, or hip hop is dyin' in the south
And I love Face, Bun B, Cass and Goodie Mob
But I miss +Scenario+, +Make 'Em Pay+ and +How To Rob+
New York is too blame
Where I'm from, we look to New york for what's poppin'
Now New York's droppin'
And I'm talking everything
No more classic shit
No more +Shook Ones+ to blast in the whip
Com, +I Used To Love H.E.R.+ too, now I'm like fuck this bitch
Rap's old, new Grey Hairs shit
If this is what makes Mims Hot
And this is why I'm not
Put a bullet in my brain, bury me with 2pac 
Put a needle in my vein
So I could ride next to Kurt Cobain
Physical will die but the soul will remain
Raps wack too many fake Eminems
Too many white boys, dye there hair blond and try to rhyme like him 
Everybody wanna pick up the pen 
Try to get in the booth 
No motivation, you killing the youth 
Bill O'Reily don't respect Jay-Z in no suit
You still a coon in they eyes 
I hope you soon realize 
Hip hop's aging and I'm at it's side 
Tryin' to aid through the ride
Fuck this man

[Outro]
Don't get too offended y'all. Step your game up</pre>
