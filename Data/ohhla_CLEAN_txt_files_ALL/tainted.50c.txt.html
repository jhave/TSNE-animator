[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent - singing]
She said she love it, she like my muuuu-sic
She like that I'm thuggin, she loves G-Unit

[50 Cent]
What? Uh-huh; she feelin the kid
Baby girl you can push me, pull me, scratch me, screw me
Holla my name out while we fuckin on top
You can ride like a rodeo, oh you freaky and I know so
I'm with it if you like it in your butt
She's a working girl
Get on top and let me see you work it girl
Don't stop - get it, get it
You can ride 'til you're satisfied
Thought of your lovin in my brain make me sing in the rain
(Peep what she said)

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
She like my music... G-Unit!
WOO~! Yeah... G-Unit {NON-STOP}

[Tony Yayo]
Man anything goes when it comes to hoes
Ma your feet look good, let me suck on them toes
And if your body smell right, let me lick all them holes
I bust a nut in your face and wipe my dick on your clothes
Baby - spark the blunt and light the incense
Now it's time to freak off with my project princess
Y'all groupies wanna talk, and send fanmail
Cause y'all see me in The Source and the XXL (ha ha ha~!)

[50 Cent - singing]
Everybody wants to be real
Still they wanna hide how they feel
Nigga you're supposed to be real
When niggaz find out that you're tellin
Nigga you gonna get yo' cap peeled
Cause they get it, and now you know you gon' it
Truuuuuuuuuuuue, I know true thugs are hard to find
Just let me find you, f'real
I'll put a hole in yo' ass with the blue steel
Keep yo' punk-ass from tellin - HA HA!
Oooooh nigga you, tell on me
And you'll diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeee-hiiiiiiiigh

You heard me nigga?
I said you, tell on me
And you'll diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeee-hiiiiiiigh
I got somethin for you nigga
I'll put my hood on it, fo' sho'
Ha ha, G-G-G-Unit {*echoes*}</pre>
