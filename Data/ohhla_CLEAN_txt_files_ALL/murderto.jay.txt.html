[Intro: Jay-Z]
Uhh, bloody murder
Bloody murder, bloody murder
Murder murder murder
Bloody murder, murder murder murder
Bloody murder, murder murder

[Kanye West]
The paper read murder, black on black murder
The paper read murder, black on black murder

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, this is to the memory of Danroy Henry
There was too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All black e'rything, nigga you know my fresh code
I'm out here fightin for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggaz watchin the throne, very happy to be
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital, where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Lookin at the news like damn I was just with him after school
No shop class but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day" type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin his avenue
It's time for us to stop and re-define black power
Forty-one souls, murdered in fifty hours
The paper read murder, black on black murder
The paper read murder, black on black murder again
Murder again

[Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his momma cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face, about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war goin on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
Three-hundred-fourteen soldiers died in Iraq
Five-hundred-nine died in Chicago

[Jay-Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Uhh, real niggaz just multiply
On December 21 I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebratin my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
You gon end up pullin down niggaz that look just like you
What up Blood? Uhh, what up Cuz?
Uhh it's all black, uhh, I love us

[Kanye West]
The paper read murder
Black on black murder again
Black on black murder again
Black on black murder again

[Jay-Z]
It's a celebration of black excellence
Black tie, black Maybachs, uhh, yeah
Uhh black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the President, I'm present
I dress... in Dries
and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shhsh-shhsh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my black card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
What's up to Will? Shoutout to O
That ain't enough, we gon' need a million mo'
+Kick in the Door+, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go

[Kanye West]
Yeah it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From paroles to whole G's, sold ki's, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events, like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for black guys?
The system's workin effectively, that's why~!
I'll be a real man, and take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ain't nothin on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothin new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been savin me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours</pre>
