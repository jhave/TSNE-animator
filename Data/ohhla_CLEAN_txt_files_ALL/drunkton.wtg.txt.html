[Intro: kung-fu movie samples]
I don't give a damn!
I'll kill anyone in my way

[Killa Sin]
Homicide city shit {*2X*}
Yeah yeah, homicide, yo
You see the neck lit, fist glisten, chain drippin, lane shiftin
Riding dirty dirty, got that thang, know I stay grippin
Facin life with it or without it bitch it's same difference
Lames drippin if it's day or night, I'ma bang with it
Situation's sickenin niggaz broke, and they cain't fix it
Dough is all I know so if you slip it, then I cain't miss it
Ain't mention Sin and broke niggaz, in the same sentence
Got the game twisted, mayne listen, say pimpin
what you pushin? Product pumpin like a piston hardly gettin by
Or probably gettin high off what you pitchin, while we sittin fly
Tryin to keep it simplified, movin like we Semper Fi
My niggaz is born to ride, y'all niggaz get sent to die
All you do is mention I, general exemplify
Sin City been gritty, ten city enterprise
About to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind
to improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high
You don't want the semi flyin nine at your Hemi fine
All you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time
Mad cause my ones up, and scared cause my guns bust
God's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumb fucks
Sin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps
Hit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks
Dodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug thugs out
The bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch
Glock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust
Rug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush
Dead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us
Your back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us
Stack +Bread+ like +Wonder+ from the winter 'til the summer come
Upgrade to made, that's when the Benzs and the Hummers come
I ain't want no Hummer stunt, ask how I stack well like Maxwell
Nigga tryin do a little some'n some'n</pre>
