[Intro: Killah Priest]
Dreddy Kruger.... yeah Maccabeez
Do that nigga... feel me...
Timbuktu... Killah Priest a/k/a Michael
Priesthood, Maccabeez, Hell Razah

[Killah Priest]
Yo, clothes, the wife, the hoes, the ice
The flow that's tight, see, I choose this life
Then I sold the rights, back to the owner's price
The crows and fight, to the coldest night, feel the cobras bite
I'm wrapped in sheets, where Arabs meet
Starving, see a bowl of rice, I reach down and grab it
Come up with a hand full of maggots
Mixed with bitter herbs, I chewed it, spewed it
Out my mouth came the living word
For every nigga that heard, may I observe and do
Just imagine if I was you
I fight, firy dragons and bears or two
I arm wrestle the devil over five boroughs
Wore a crown of thorns, and you wonder why I'm gone
Hello... yo, a warm gun in my palms, on a passover night
My niggas see the same vision, we grip our gats kinda tight
One dog says a sign, one of my other dogs says it's just a state of mind
That's when I gain my mind, only play with my kind
Maccabeez, dashikis and gats and beeds
We on some other shit, the Ghetto Government
Protect the ark of the covenant, yo
We on some other shit, fuck you fucking republicans

[Chorus: Hot Flames]
Allow us to talk to you, walk you through
A strong life through a warrior's view
And I'm supposed to have remorse for who? This is the source of New York
What we talk, of course, it's true

[Timbo King]
While ya'll was looking at Johnny Carson
I was looking at Sonny Carson, a black rebel, yeah I daredevil
When words fail, music speaks, seven days without prayer makes one week
The naked truth versus the well dressed lie
The best mirror is my mother's eyes
I can't shake hands with a clinched fist
Speech is silver, silence is golden
How could I break bread when it's molded?
Time is money, Timb, figure it out

[Chorus]

[Hot Flames]
This is my destiny, this rap game is a part of my genes
So it's the ingredient in my recipe
Until the heavens speak, my level rise where yours peak
Take over the game in a strong week
This song speaks to the death, give sight to the blind
I'm heaven bound, I'm excited with crime
Use words a hyphen a time, before that, use birds
And transport dimes in little small packs
I hate fake rappers, love true raps
Priest brought me here to make noise like two gats
I'm try'nna survive, but I feel like my feets crazy glued to the ground
How can I rise? How can I cry with no heart like the lion on Oz
Since thirteen, I was firing nines
I tried to talk with the force of glocks, but it feel like
I'm try'nna walk through a door that's locked
Stressed out, but ofcourse I'm hot
Cuz I rode through the hard times and made it out of the hard knocks

[Chorus to fade]</pre>
