[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
I might make it look easy, that's just the way I be pimpin
Makin my money, that's just the way I be pimpin
They wouldn't leave me, that's just the way I be pimpin
You might not believe me, that's just the way I be pimpin

[Dr. Dre]
I'm livin a motion picture, me and my niggaz
In sixteen bars we'll make the big screen ours
What is this? Everybody's jiggy now, is the hustle that good
in everybody's city now, or do they act good?
I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep
And when I snore it sounds like I'm sayin, "Where's my money?"
I ain't playin, I'm out there like, "Where's my honeys?"
You gotta be a pimp to understand just how I'm layin
Fuck a Lex bubble; I'm rich, and after this
I'ma be rich all over again, except double
See you ain't so hard; if you ain't burnin rubber
in somethin with numbers after the dot, you ain't no star
Me and my whole crew, done either shot a nigga or been shot
And if you check us out, ain't no scars
Hint  steppin to me is suicide
And that basically means that you could die, true superfly

[Chorus]

[Dr. Dre]
My life's in the fast lane, that's when I knew I had game
Class came, I had hoes but didn't know they last name
In school, when you niggaz was tradin clothes
Me and my niggaz was tradin hoes like what they fadin fo'
Carry my books you hoe, I had 'em slavin yo
I get skulled then I played the hoe like, "Way to go"
Patrollin the halls holdin a black mac-11
Under the black leather, platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties and show up, with Gold Gotti
Handsome, and some, I'm the one you ran from
Cause you could only be the man in the shit that I was banned from
Make this shit seem easy, fiends need me
Make the most conceited chick in this bitch seem sleazy
Pleased at what I'm doin
And to all y'all pimp niggaz, pimp on, and I'll see y'all at the reunion

[Chorus]</pre>
