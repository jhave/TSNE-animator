Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Well that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it
	This is how we move it
Aiyyo Doogie how we move it
	This is how we move it

Well it's time to kick the flavor with the you-know-who
Stud Doogie, Alamo, and the one Grand Pu'
Check out the ringle, hit the spot that'll tingle
Make the hons wanna jingle, I stay crisp like a Pringle
Check how we set off, last stop's where we get off
You know it's flavor, three shots lick the glock off
BUCK BUCK BUCK, you know how it go
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, and Alamo
	So what's the 411?
Loungin black
Hilfiger knapsack with a 40 in the back
So hon shake the goodies don't front on the puddy
With the rubber and the hoodie I peck the hole like Woody
Show no shame, with everything to gain
Honies always singin, how can I ease the pain?
When they think I'm comin back but that's game
This is the real, how I wheel and deal
First round draft pick like big Shaquille O'Neal
Shit's so dope that I might catch a steal
Stud Doogie, Alamo, spin the wheel

Cause that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
Well that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it
	This is how we move it
Aiyyo Doogie how we move it
	This is how we move it

I'm with this rich girl named Dawn, hit the skins on the lawn
Ron Stud had her sister in the crib playin Twister
They lived in Poughkeepsie, moms was a gypsy
Pops was in the crib but he was upstairs tipsy
Know I got soul, baby jump upon a pole
Janet Jackson took a ride, she's no longer _In Control_
The bedroom worked, not a bone jerker
Good like Black and Decker knockin skins from here to Mecca
Like one two three, or A-B-C
Or Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti
Honey called me brilly, I told her she was silly
Cut my ex-girl off cause she worked my last frilly
The new skin shower, micraphone goer
Girls follow me like animals did Noah
From Tracy, to Pattie, Linda down to Tina
Everytime I see some skins then pop goes the weener
Puba, the devil roaster, I keep a tool in my holster
Mess with me and I'll be on a wanted poster

Cause that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
Well that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it
	This is how we move it
You know the deal huh, spin the wheel

Yeah, check it
It's time to switch it up so I'll breeze back to the rest
Put on some Polo gear and a baggy pair of Guess
Put on my baseball cap, refill my knapsack
This ain't Poltergeist, but I'm back!
You know the M.O. on Doogie Alamo
Cuts so sharp make like Shaft and get an afro
Better yet you can take it down low
Al's my man but that perm gotta go gotta go
So all you copycat rhymers swine'n'dinin on the riblets
Get downtown, see my mic on exhibit
No need to worry, cause I'll be there in a hurry
Yo hon I'll smack it out like Darryl Strawberry
Keep your head spinnin, cause I only heard of winnin
Played the game before so I can go the extra inning
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, Alamo here to prove it
This is how we move it

Cause that's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it
	This is how we move it
That's how we move it baby
	This is how we move it
Aiyyo Doogie how we move it
	This is how we move it</pre>
