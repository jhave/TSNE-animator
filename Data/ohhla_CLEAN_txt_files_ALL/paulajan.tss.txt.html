      Bitch! That's a trademark

I was at my house not doing anything
Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said "Hello?"
The bitch spoke up and said "What's up ho?"
I said, "Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick"
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said "Janet" I said "Oh"
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her "Call me" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her "Bitch let's go"
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver "Take me straight home"
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said "I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch"
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos
Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants
But to me, they're just two more tramps
With some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit

Short Dog's in the motherfucking house and I ain't even tripping, bitch
