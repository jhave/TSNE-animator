[Intro]
Gone, gone, gone..

[Verse 1]
I seen it coming
Yeah, I seen it coming
You do everything for these niggas
They treat you like you did nothing
But fuck that, because all of this came from nothing
Now when I pull up, I ain't on top of my nig
I'm stuntin. Smoking something
Playing my newest shit, and you know its bumpin
You ain't used to it, you gon grow accustomed
Niggas hate me cause they got no progression
All the realest niggas, they know and trust em
And plus, your money's slow as fuck
I bet soon as I roll one up
That they gon know it's us
Before I pass it, hit it twice and I hold it
Trying to get my money to the point where I can't fold it

[Hook]
Going away...

[Verse 2]
I made it happen, I made it happen
And niggas got mad at me cause I did this shit all for rapping
Hear what they saying
They need no luck because I macked it
And now I got my own gang, nigga
I'm the captain
You know me player, ballin nigga and stackin
All the same with a passion
All cause I'm bringing racks in
Remember when all those niggas was passed em?
But now they still call me the main attraction
Some niggas want the power, I want respect
Some niggas want the fame, I want the check
I'm in Dubai wake up I'm in Tibet
Them niggas had it, man, it's sort of sad they...
