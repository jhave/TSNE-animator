Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see your homegirl tryna sway you
How you figure I would play you
Would you look at that
The same one that caught her nigga with some freak
All in her sheets left for a week
What she do, double back
Now I know we far from perfect
But I feel like this is perfect, do you disagree with that
If not than holla back
Hey and tell ya girl you'll call her back

My best friend say, she sick of me, crying on the phone
Telling how man dogging me
My best friend say, dont tell her nothing bout me
Cause she aint showing me no sympathy
My best say, if she was me, she woulda let ya go
Home a long time ago
My best friend say
My best friend say
I'll be there, I'll still be there for you

Anytime we meet
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

Anytime we meet
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you

Now, now, now, know we be arguing
But aint you riding with me
We breaking up we making up
Like Dwayne Wade, and Whitney
You throw things, you broke things
Use both hands and hit me
And right when you call the law
I'll tell my boy to come get me
Then you, than you start listening
To friends, and then it, gets tricky
They try to tell you leave, but this love is real sticky
So you ignore the hickys, the pics of chicks and they vicky's
That they sent me, is that real love
You're the only one that I will love
Damn, damn

My Best friends say
I could stay with her
At her house, no doubt anytime I like
My best friends say
Don't let you in my life, cause you don't do for me
And you don't act right
My best friends say
If she was me, she'll let you go along time ago
My best friends say, my best friends say

I'll still be there for you
Anytime we meet
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you

Anytime we meet
You can lean on me
Come on, come on
I'll be there for you

Girl I can see it in your eyes
How you feeling , let me know whats on your mind
We've been together for a long long time
Hey, girl I can see it in your eyes
I know to you it feel like I'm never around
Round, round, round
But if you leave, who else gon hold me down
Hey, hey, hey, hey</pre>
