*Beat changes after each verse

[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm always late, always on my way
Ain't enough hours in the day to be Dre
Cause in the bay, things move fast
Stop to catch a breath, you might get past
And that's yo ass, cause I'ma do it movin'
At 12 o' clock I'm supposed to meet Rubin
But I forgot, Ubin gotta wait
Cause I can't be late for me court date
For goodness sake I'm like what the fuck
I'm noddin' out, I'm sleep standin' up
If I don't go sit my black ass down
I'ma fuck around and, fall down
What the feezy who tryin' to call now
Oh I forgot, I'm supposed to be at the mall now
I got in-sto', if they knew what they was in fo'
24 hours in a day I need ten mo'

Had to make sure it was cool baby, the call from up top
Is it, is it cool?

[Verse 2]
I'm a federal hoe nigga do shit that's unavailable
Do it cutthoatish, unnoticed, untrailable
My bitch gon' make sure the funds are available
I'm a hot commidity, big business, I'm sellable
Infuckincredible, ineditble
I'm married to the game so that makes unweddable
No wedding, no romantic setting
I matress on the floor, no fancy bedding
Get it straight from the gate so you know where this thang is heading
Colder as the snow on the mountains of Redding
Everythang she wanna do, I'm not letting
Work a race horse til her hair start shedding
I'm not regretting, the dirt I've done
A nigga wanna wet me I'ma squirt my gun
I need weed that's gon' hurt my lung
And chick with jaw that'll make me squirt my cum

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry to hear your situation has been worsening
Oh I can't complain, me myself personally
Tramp traffic is at all time high
I'm still stuntastic like I've been all my life
And how about wife, she's been hittin' me dog
I think she's considering gettin' me dog
She no longer cherish your marriage cause you financially embarrassed
Man I can take the bitch and go get mo' chips than Harris
No day off like Farris, service is volunteer
By choice not force, it won't be no problems here
Man withgaurd she finna do somethin' slick
If she ain't ridin' mine she gon' be ridin' somebody else dick
Cause she tired of ya, done made a lie of ya
Pass her to a pimp, let me show you how I does her
I'ma get it out of her, every penny, every dolla
It's rent money, yanadadaholla

[Verse 4]
You lames missed it, got twisted like a pretzel
I'm a slick nigga cunning, gunning, running from the metro
I get so quick do it movin' bitch I'm federal
Respect it, connected get the stuff from the esa Pedro
I'm a pimp you, but you wouldn't know I dress retro
Breathe life in a hoe lung, get her sprung she can't let go
Should've bet mo', scary nigga I'm winner
Eat a nigga for dinner, game strong as paint thinner
If I can't sinner, than pimpin', I don't need her
All I need is one mic, my money, and my heater
I steal clientele, short stop like Derek Jeter
I'm ill for my mail will hop out the two-seater
My mouth is too heated, I'm outlawed in a few states
I come through in somethin' ooh, cleaner than you with new plates
Y'all niggaz is fruit cakes, same sex marriages
I'm cutthoat with cutthettes, strapped with daringers

[Verse 5]
Yep, you right, nigga how you know
Man pimpin' had to let that bitch go
She a dyme, tryin' to steal my shine
Told that bitch take a number, get yo ass back in line
You wastin' my muthafuckin' time
I'm the biggest thang since Sprite put lemon with lime
Have you lost yo muthafuckin' mind
You must don't know, bitch I'm the kind

[Verse 6]
(Man it's cold)
It's cold as the Swiss Alps
People get on me, than homie I switch routes
Mac Dre stay cussin' a bitch out
Quarterbackin', like Dan Thoutes or Tim Crouch
I'm stuntin', watchin' my scritch scrotch
Pourin' some Cris, potna I'm pimped out
I'm colder than a blizzard in Alaska
Or Mt. Shasta, In a mask a blast ya
My car faster, I strike past ya
12 Volt posi, cam and flowmasters
Keep it to yo'self potna, who asked ya
I teach the game, a preach but no pastor
I'm cold</pre>
