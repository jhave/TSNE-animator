Ah, this song is for all them bitches out there
That think a nigga really supposed to pay they way through life
You know, like that "Scrub" shit
It's also dedicated to that chicken head bitch that wrote the lyrics
  
As we proceed, to give you what you need
Gettin down to my beats, as we bring the heat
  
[Hook]
Make it bounce, bounce, drop it, pop it, on the side
Make it bounce, bounce, grab it, slap it, on the side
  
[DJ Quik]
This is dedicated to a bad hoe
From you don't recognize? I'ma let chu know
Always DJ Q-U-I-K
You in my room now, do what I say
Get your ass up out of that chair
Peel them clothes off layer by layer
Article by Article, till I say no
Leavin you over exposed like the (whooo?)
There is sex in the champagne room
Me and my homies gonna run a damn train soon
Foursome goin down, Oh my gosh
Y'all get posh I'll just watch
Talk about the hoes, well I didn't wanna do it
But now I gotta put y'all back into it
Your nothin' meaningful(No)
What you screamin' fo?(hm?)
Really as if you didn't know
  
Chorus:

The Sexuality is(You know the trouble I get you in)
The reason you got the kids(They got a whole lotta jokers too)
There's somethin' else that you do
(You know, when you put that little twist on it)
That make the niggas wanna fuck you
  
[DJ Quik]
You say you need a side job, make an extra knot(Money)
Clubbin at the jet strip horny niggas stop(Funny)
Pop~n~stop~n~drop it like it's hot
Get burned then you gotta go in and get a shot
Lookin' for a husband and lickin on your tity
Fuckin' each and every other nigga in the city
How the hell you think your boyfriend gon take it
You hear a fast song, Get up and get naked
Selling you a nice drink while you eat it up
Negotiate with you for a minute then beat it up
Underground laws the rules still apply
Mackin' is an art reserved for the fly
She don't know why you tryin' to harm her(Dumb)
Lookin' for a dick in shinin' armor
Yellin, save me! save me! with a dick on your breath
Bitch either get dropped or get left
  
Chorus:

The Sexuality is(You know the way you keep grinding on niggas)
The reason you got the kids(And you bound to have a couple of 'em)
There's somethin' else that you do(You know when you pop that thang)
That make the niggas wanna fuck you(And the girls do to)
  
Hook 3x
  
[DJ Quik]
Oh with out a doubt she lives to cum
I'ma be mad if she gives you some?
Dude you could have this trashy bitch
Put a down payment on her make me rich
Thank you for helping me to change my mind
You're not my equal hoe, fuck yo' kind
Can't get mad if the bus don't come
I'ma just bail cus I trust no one
cause everything that come up out your mouth is a lie
You spend a lot of time with your stomach to the sky
Lookin for a nut wit a nut comin' out a nut
Gotta nutty broke nigga sprung with her sorry butt
Bitch, you just been warn
Another Suga Free has just been born
And I bet you couldn't keep your pussy ol' shut
With a pair of grippliers
Bitch you tired
  
Chorus:

The Sexuality is(You know when you take yourself out there)
The reason you got the kids(And you bound to have a couple of 'em)
There's somethin' else that you do
(You know when you put it up for sale)
That make the niggas wanna fuck you
(Talk about buy one and get one free)
The Sexuality is(You aint nuttin but a Goddamn ride)
The reason you got the kids(And you look like you rent it often)
There's somethin' else that you do
(Oh your mama need her ass whooped)
That make the niggas wanna fuck you
(Don't sing it though, she's just as bad, ol' tryflin' bitch)</pre>
