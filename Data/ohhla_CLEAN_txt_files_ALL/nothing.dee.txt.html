[singing]
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this
I never felt, quite, like this
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this
I never felt, quite, like this
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Uh uhh

[singing]
Incomplete when, you're, away
You turn my, nights, into days
You show me, the, light uh-huh
Gotta, have, you, right away
I never felt, quite, like this
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this
I never felt, quite, like this

Feels good! Ohhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhh

[singing]
You, breathe, life, in-to meeeEeEeEeEe
Fo' life in, I'm, in, too deep
I'm, ad-dic-ted, uh-huh
Something tells, me, you're the one (YEAH!)
I never felt, quite, like this
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this
I never felt, quite, like this
All I need in, my, life is
There, is, no-thing like this
I never felt, quite, like this</pre>
