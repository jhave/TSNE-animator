THIS...IS...MY...LIFE

[Chorus]
(Right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)

[Verse 1]
Made me a leader before I was ready to lead
Took away my hunger, but didn't give me greed
Made me successful, when I just wanted to be heard
Give me the light, cause all I need is the word
Give me a life, that I'm responsible for
I'll give him what's right, cause I'm responsible for him
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with him
Facing a fight, I be right there with him
Ready for Heaven, cause I done been through the Hell
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell
See God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'
The bravery of a man's mind is slavery
Is makin me the man I was made to be
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon get it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I wake up frustrated dog, I'm hurtin' inside
Think about the brothers that put in, work and then died
A certain have tried, a certain have cried 
When it didn't go right, you hit me like
You see things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God cause he, see's the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because he knows what's goin on inside me, he tried me
Knew where my heart was at
Knew what I was thinkin
Knew when I was down and out, left there mistaken
Knew when to pick me up, cause it got too hard
Knew when I was gonna scream out "Please God!"
And you already knew that you would be there for me
That's why I bring you together to give you the glory

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everyday of life is a new chapter
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture
The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for hiself but
What he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for (?)
What you give, you shall recieve tenfold
And I, put that on my soul
And, put that on my life
And, everything I own 
And, everything I know
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everwhere I been, I was for a reason
Walk through the desert, ended up freezin
Start there, end up where?
And now they know...whatever which way they go

[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go
They know they gonna owe
They soul to the road they choose
It don't matter if you win or loose
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues</pre>
