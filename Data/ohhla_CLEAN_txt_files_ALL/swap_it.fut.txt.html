Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Said I'll swap it out
I'm swapping everything out here brand new

I swapped out my true religions
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out it old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a portal beacon
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet how
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better carots

I went psycho with dat sprite
I went a drug addict with dat sprite
I Got hoes dat like to dike
But to tell you the truth they fly like kites
I got bad bitches who write
Went to space and took a flight
Yeah I'm fly but ain't no kite
Cause they're too short for my life
I'm on Pluto
You on Earth
I had burberry at first
Now it's Pluto on my shirt
I don't go crazy
I'll go berserk
Had to maro hard top
Pull da rari with da vert
I'm the king in my hood
Aye da globe is my turf
See me rocking diamonds
You know the diamond's very bright
Had to swap out the mid
Then we start sellin white
I was true religion saggin
Now dem robins on me nice
Paid the cash in, cash now
All I do is swipe

I swapped out my true religions
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out it old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a portal beacon
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better caarots

I swapped my Louis scarf for Alexandra Macqueen
I just brought a sprite and it's no longer clean
Was a true religion kid that I designed for my jeans
Hey I run ATL
Man I feel like a king
I'm red bottom walking when I walk on the fly
Rosalina popped a pill
Now I'm no longer tired
Marijuana in my system
You can see it on my eye
I've got a pocket full of hundred man
I feel like plies
I was old school shopping
Na da rari what matters
I once trip off light
Now I'm in Pluto forever
Yellow Stone, White Stone
Stepping up on my bezel
I vvs the face
Took out canary yellows

I swapped out my true religion
Put on my robin jeans
I swapped out dat clean sprite
Mixed it with codeine
I swapped out dat old school
Pulled up in dat new thing
I swapped out a portal beacon
And now I'm talking Japanese
I swapped out my hood fame
Now I got global status
Swapped out that ratchet hoe
Cause my bitch the baddest
Swapped out the recipe
Make my pockets fatter
Swapped out dem vv ones
Now I got better carots</pre>
