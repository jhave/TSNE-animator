Z-Ro, Heavy Rotation, yeah

[Z-Ro]
I've been running the streets 24 years (look at me)
I made it but I'm wanted most of my peers (look at me)
I keep a heater in case I run across my beef (look at me)
And I'm so full it hurt my mouth when I speak (look at me)
I'm rapping but I'm still working the corner (look at me)
Hustling everyday selling work and marijuana (look at me)
I keep a vest on, I keep my chest on (look at me)
With a real groupie when pull out a press on (look at me)
I might dress prepped up but I still do crime (look at me)
I'm a geurilla can't you tell it when I rhyme (look at me)
I don't need no soda, straight out the paint bottle
And I don't care if you don't like it cause I ain't your role model

[Chorus - 2x]
Tell me where your hood and I'ma tell you where mine
But don't be beefing when you come around a g on his grind
Smoking nothing but pine, need no drama on my mind
Pump your breaks, bet not disrespect the stop sign 

[Z-Ro]
I'm out that Mo City where they don't bar none (look at me)
I never leave the pad without packing a gun (look at me)
I don't be set tripping any one of y'all can get it (look at me)
I'ma take you out if you interrupt the flow of digits (look at me)
I produce hits but radio won't play my song (look at me)
I keep a record cause all that hating made me strong (look at me)
I must confess that I be looking for trouble (look at me)
When I make a million I'll be looking to double (look at me)
Nothing but pen pimping and smoking that pine (look at me)
I'm like the law cause all these boys gone mind (look at me)
I don't need no soda, straight out the paint bottle
And I don't care if you don't like it cause I ain't your role model

[Chorus - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I'm addicted to putting my hands on cash (look at me)
I'm that little sodier that don't need a soldier rag (look at me)
It's self explanatory to escallade to jag (look at me)
I started off with hardens off in sperate bags (look at me)
Now I'm on top of the world and ain't no falling (look at me)
Got to tell them back back somebody keep on calling 
All in, with six screens in my load
R.I.P. to F-A-T P-A-T Southside for sho (look at me)
I'ma navigate this big ride body lac (look at me)
I'm ghetto fabulous, I got hooks, beats and sacks (look at me)
I don't need no soda, straight out the paint bottle
And I don't care if you don't like it cause I ain't your role model

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
