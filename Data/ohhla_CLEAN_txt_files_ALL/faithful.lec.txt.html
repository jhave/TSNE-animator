[Lecrae]
Right now I wanna say how much you've changed my ways
when I look back on yesterday
It's been a long journey, for the lessons I'm still learning
but I can't forget the difference you made
I could have been sleeping in my grave
but you reached down from heaven and made a way
it's so amazing how you changed my faith
and all I can say is...

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You're faithful, to me
even when I've made mistakes you've always kept me I'm
grateful to thee cause you kept me in perfect peace
and it's more than I could ask for

[Lecrae]
The world makes promises that it can't really keep
it'll always let you down
It's only temporary, only preliminary
but your love, it reaches all bounds
I could have been sleeping in my grave
but you reached down from heaven and made a way
it's so amazing how you changed my faith
and all I can say is...

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lecrae]
I don't know why, You've been so faithful to me
and so I'll just trust, that you'll lead me in the right way...

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
Faithful, cause you've been so faithful
cause you've been so faithful, cause you've been so faithful
Faithful to forgive me
faithful to keep me in all my ways all of my days
Faithful, faithful, faithful, oh...</pre>
