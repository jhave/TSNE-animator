I'm the I in the alphabet illin' on track
I'm the t in too coo chillen like that
I'm the gravey on your mash potatoes think that you beat
Like you piggy bank with penny's when you broke on the streets
I'm that class in school you always go to
Like your favorite character when you watch cartoon
I'm that cat in the third grade talking to babes
I'm that last little day that you here to save
Know tell me what you saw you don't never wanna miss 
I'm that rap that you spit when you talking to chicks
I'm your favorite little snack after takin' a nap
The qualifed eight year old with the dangerous raps

Chorus
 
(Both)
We the s up in serious real with this
We the knuckles pointin' out when you ball your fist
We the crackles on bricks that be hurtin you feet
We the Lil' Soldiers doin' it down with Master P
We the Para from the Paradice put on the map
We the best that ever done it hot boys on wax
We the A on you paper when you getting that grade
We the uuff in that tank when they hitten the bay
We the speed when you gotta catch the ice cream truck
We that block that you live on always ruff
We the key for the handcuffs breakin the lock
Wearin tanks on our necks cause we can't be stopped

Chorus

(Freequan)
I'm the rope in the gym you wanna climb up on
I'm the rhyme you always singin now you call me the bomb
I'm the F in the place all up in you face
I'm the chimble in bass equalizin your tape
I'm the c.d. in the store that you bout' to go get
Like a real low price for a nice outfit
Like the X-Mas eve night see open you eyes
Like a juicy cheeseburger with fresh out fries
I'm the lunch ticket card with now unto guard
The youngest rippen mikes now holdin it down 
Like a nice piece of candy when you go out of town
We the punches in the round with Beats By the Pound
I'm the Lil' Soldier blackin' on every song
I'm the one in the twist in my hair bird born
I'm the swing in the park when you come with you pops
I'm Freequan the Bomb my whole album is hot

Chorus

(Ikeim)
