Yeah
Tu-turn me up a little bit in the headphones
Just a lil bit so I can hear myself
Yeah... Okay
It's Wiz Khalifa man
Mr spacely
Teach you niggas how to fly the fuck out you know
I told em it's gone be a big year
It's a lot of shit on my plate
This what you want
Okay or okaay haha
Yeah
Taylor gang or fuckin kill yourself man
That's how we get down
Uh ya

So far so good
Cause I been doing things that you wish ya'll could
Hoppin outta planes
The kush numbs problems in my brain
And rosee bottles for the pain
The lines that I ink make rappers get kinda nervous
People telling me to sink when I'm trying to surface
Groupies all up in my face like they got a purpose
Cause we ain't gotta pour drink bring bottle service
Orange juice and some more flutes
Let a friend sky dive man I need more shoots
I'm live wire you a cord loose
No charge I go so hard
Hookin up a table on a promo tour
Say I live a dream but I'm just on my job
And can't quit cause the first class flights get addictive
Try and get a ticket

Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud

Ain't comfortable but got my feet up
It's hard to hear you when you thirty thousand feet up
Claims since I got my cheese up
I been walking round chest out like some D cups
Ole g puff say you got it locked and we found out it's the key stuck
Used to fuckin with that cheap stuff
I show you rosee bottles of that cleeko
Than we drink till we fall
And when you wake up and realize what you did
It'll be me that you call
But I'll be on a plane
And even though we had fun
Shit I don't know your name

Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin at this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud</pre>
