Now go to Africa again, watch dis!

Chorus: repeat 4X

[SX] Black Star Line [LJ] It's the Black Star Line
[LJ] Everybody come aboard [SX] And free your mind

[Sadat X]
It's the Black Star Line that's leavin at nine
Here's a paid ticket so you can free your mind
Playgrounds is filled with visions of steel
Grab the black babies IT'S TIME TO BUILD

[Lord Jamar]
See we got a mental ship somethin like Noah's Ark
Spark your brain cell now let's set sail
(with no avail) we flowin on a positive trip
All Nubians is welcome, male and female

[Sadat X]
I, wouldn't resort, to askin for a passport
Love vibes rule so your black face is cool

[Lord Jamar]
Cool, but not frozen, a trip for the chosen few..

[Red Foxx] ** best guess **
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin to Africa, one more time (3X)
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin to Africa, one more time, TRUE!
Let me tell you bout Marcus Garvey
Born in Jamaica, God left him in country
He go to America to make black people free
He walk around low and just try make money
Him buy up some ship and just start for we
America or Africa and live irie
We hav some man where wan gonna be
Young nasty and just licky licky
Some love Marcus Garvey, the place of peace
Or peace around it, and dem sparkle up him say
I just light up, make the first hungry
Writer no block it but just run follow me
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin to Africa, one more time
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
BRAND NUBIAN!!  Tell dem one more time

[Sadat X]
As we look to the stars, they take ours
Yeah we got fly cars but you can live in four wheels?
We need new approaches, old style is null and void
Makes me paranoid, to think
that we own the whole ocean yet we can't even drink

[Lord Jamar]
You couldn't swim the nine thousand so we got you a means
of transportation, for the Nubian nation
Marcus Garvey had the idea back in the days
Doin for self, keepin the wealth
I gotta add on and create
though the devil thinks it's not the latest fashion
Navigatin lost, somethin like a ship's captain

Chorus

[Red Foxx] ** best guess **
When I'm ova, arms will be raised for the tom-toms
Push up ya arm they call ya proud to be black (2X)
Call me proud to be black, cause I'm not tryin to fuck
When I'm proud to be black, I'm not some young eedyot (2X)
Be gone!  I want no dem I want no dem-dem dem-dem dem-dem
Never know they wickedness they haffa come to an end
Don't take a no fey word for de white boy dem
Awayaa TELL ME - all you get in de end
Awayaa TELL ME - all you get isa dem
Awayaa TELL ME - all you get more den dey spend
C'mon, tell de world black man entertainer
Rock dem one and rock entertained
Tell the Red Foxx style dem a get
When I'm ova, arms will be raised for the tom-toms
Push up ya arm they call ya proud to be black (2X)
