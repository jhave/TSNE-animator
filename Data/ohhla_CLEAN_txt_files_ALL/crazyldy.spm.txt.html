(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Everything would be okay
If you wasn't crazy
Why you trying to fade me
Just be a lady
 
No when we first met everything was really going cool
I had to catch myself cause I was digging you
At first it seemed, that you were the only one for me
But oh no, your crazy
Now I.m the type of nigga that just likes to keep it real
I likes to keep my mind focused on the real
Instead of you, trying to help me make my dreams come true
You start a mess, between me and my whole crew
 
(Hook)
Now what type of lady are you supposed to be
I think its best if you stay the hell away from me
Now what type of lady are you supposed to be
I think its best if you stay the fuck away from me
 
(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Everything would be okay
If you wasn't crazy
Why you trying to fade me
Just be a lady
 
Ya know I can't be nobody but me that Russell Lee
What make you think you can come around and change me
Your breaking rules, showing up to my house without a call
Your doing dumbshit and you know that ain't gonna work it out
Ya know you ain't even right, ya damn sure ain't lady like
Ya screamin and scratching started fussing trying to start a fight
You really need to be gone, and leave me the hell alone
You actin like a lil girl how the fuck you say your grown
Playin on my phone won't say nothing but I know its you
What will it take for you to understand that we are through
(Phone ring twice)
 
Hello? Hello?&amp; Bitch!
 
(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Everything would be okay
If you wasn't crazy
Why you trying to fade me
Just be a lady
 
If only you were a lady and stopped actin so damn shady
You would be the luckiest women if didn't try to fade me
But you do, so the consequences is all on you
So don't get mad when you see me walking with another boo
I gotta go, you had your chance with me but there.s no more
Look at you looking pitiful crying lying on the floor
I wish there was another way that you can change my mind
You say that your sorry but some kind of way I think your lying
Everything would be okay
If yooooouuu was a lady
Everything would be okay
If yooooouuu wasn't crazy
 
(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Everything would be okay
If you wasn't crazy
Why you trying to fade me
Just be a lady
 
Just be a lady
(Repeat 4x)
 
(Chorus: repeat 2X)
Everything would be okay
If you wasn't crazy
Why you trying to fade me
Just be a lady
 
Just be a lady (echo)</pre>
