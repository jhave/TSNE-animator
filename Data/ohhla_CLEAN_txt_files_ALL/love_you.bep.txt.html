[will.i.am]
What, would you do?
If I walked, up, to you?
And I, told you, how I feel
about you now?
And what, would you say
If I, took your breath away
And I, loved you everyday
the way I do now?

[Chorus One]
[w] Would you let me love you let me you long time? {*4X*}
[F] Boy I'll let you love me let you love me long time {*4X*}

[will.i.am]
What, would it take?
If we can, up and runaway
We can, throw our problems away
and get out of town
And how, do you feel?
