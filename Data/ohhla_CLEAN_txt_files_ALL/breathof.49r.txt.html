Y'all polluting this big rap ocean
Fill drums like poison dump them off and have them floating
And now it's leaking and now it's seeping
Into the radio mix every weekend
But when it comes to technique freaking
They got the game distorted like some levels that are peaking
Reaching for things that are out of your grasp
I'm pouring lyrics like the liquor poring out of your flask
I might have to find a couple companies
For signing silly rappers who think that they can fuck with me
This is rap alternative
A break from the suckers rapping like they still learning it

Jas Mace

Who got the hot flow like volcanoes
Straight from the top 49ers got the knock
Will the biting ever stop, let a hungry man eat
Why you rapping over other peoples beats on your new release
22 tracks and 90% is wack
The rest is okay, shit I want my money back
And you wonder why they download songs
Because like Velcro they are tired of being ripped off
I want quality beats, quality rhymes
No more oregano flow, quality dimes
Yeah, it's time to switch the gears
Take off your mask little homie it's a breath of fresh air

Hook (2xs)

We're coming with a breath of fresh air
Fresh rhymes with the fresh ideas
Do another show in some new fresh gear
Have them like yes yeah, to this here

Jas Mace

Aw man we done it again
It's a breath of fresh air for those sick of the trends
Got my mind going in circles feel my plight
It's like the Indi500 can't do nothing right
Everything on the radio's sounding the same
Tough guys in these videos are corny and lame
Sometimes I think y'all sweet too concerned with dudes
The 49ers gonna take you to another altitude yeah
Above the smog, above the clouds
It's a bird's eye view to see the dumb shit we do
When the cash gets flashed y'all don't know how to act
Scared to rap from the heart because y'all was phony from the start check it

You need to trade the mic for some Playdo
Before you're lying in some spit like Ramo
We stay connected like the ends of halo
They can't rap but just act good like J-lo
All these dudes is really getting me wild
Skills busted like 2/3rds of Destiny's Child
But then again they only started last week
Flowing in computers on retarded ass beats
That they jacked from the kid shopping beats trying to come up
Swearing that they're cool as Fonzarelli with they're thumbs up
But when we run up, it's like the National Debt
49 the international threat

Hook (2xs)

We're coming with a breath of fresh air
Fresh rhymes with the fresh ideas
Do another show in some new fresh gear
Have them like yes yeah, to this here</pre>
