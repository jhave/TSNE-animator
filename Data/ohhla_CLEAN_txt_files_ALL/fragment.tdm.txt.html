[Intro: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
What up, G, what up G? Why you knockin' on the door?
No, you can't come in, heh, you can't come here
Yeah, the key don't work no more, yeeh
You fucking around, yeah you smarter than me
You smarter than me, hee-hee

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
I don't know, who now, how do it feels since you
No longer have connections, with me, you dumb in
Hungry and found this, you must be, your plan is vaulted
You don't wanna play a game, it only works when you young and beautiful
Now you should know - how neither of these herbs gassin' you
That would have you boosting clothes
Left you hanging, dry and stupid though
So know it's your turn, to play what you give for
Your brain's looping slow, you stupid hoe
Yeah, you should know, but the foolish don't
You don't get too close, cause you know the truth will show
Runner ability, see, is something I went through before

[Interlude: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
Yeah, yeah... I seen this movie before, it's weak
The plotline is very thin
Yeah, it lacks substance, very predictible
I give it a thumbs down, I give it a thumbs down

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
See, I studied psychology since a young'n
So I spot every move, you make
I may not see it clearly through all the street talk
You got beef, walk, yeah I love you, but not like that
You try to stop my act, with your high for looting, childhood retribution
It won't rest til you get, your licks in
Vixen Victoria's Secret stories, you keep within
Your witch's brew, for due -- you
Fancy as a, not too shroud, denial you choose
But your eyes on the glue, to your inner most
And, when I'm host to your bizarre sideshow, then expose for you

[Interlude: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
Yeah, cause remember the wicked witch
When she looked in the mirror, and then the mirror just shattered and shit
Cause she was so ugly and shit... but ugly in the inside though
See you don't dig me, when I'm saying that
You gotta feel me, when I say, that that's the wicked witch

[Del tha Funky Homosapien]
You seem lost so why would you try deviating
From what would seem to be, the clear choice to making
Such a situation, such as this, now wake up
I play possible with you, but you gotta do what I say
But you gutter babe, through and through, you ain't have enough yet
Pushing pussy for product, having a good time is what you call it
All of it, washed away the mourns of an alcoholic
Now you out for my wallet, and give me a hard time too
Just to show me a thing or two, about, how low the low be
Well don't get cold feet, when you discover I hold heat
To melt that cold heart, that's so weak

[Outro: Del tha Funky Homosapien]
You know... it ain't nothing but a thang
See, um, if you start, um, doing something stupid around here
I'mma come out there and I will beat a bitch ass
I will beat a bitch down to the ground
And, I might have to get some paper though
Cuz, since you out here already fucking other shit
Youknowhatimean, but, you ain't nothing though really
That's you though, you know?</pre>
