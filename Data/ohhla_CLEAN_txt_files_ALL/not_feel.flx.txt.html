Oh, yeah, yeah

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

You know how I'm living
Playa's never been my style
This time you're not forgiven so
Don't try to change my mind

I know you want me
And I know you want me bad
I know you're thinkin' of me
It's my turn not to care
And that's why

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

Let go, no flippin' out, my love
I need someone to hold me near
I need a man, don't try to buy my love
I need someone to be right here
Ah, no, no, no

I know you want me
And I know you want me bad
I know you're thinking of me
It's my turn not to care
So I

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

I'm not feeling you
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway
No matter what you say
I'm leaving anyway

Hey baby, yeah I'm alright, how you feeling?
Come inside, yeah, come in, close the door behind you
Yeah, I know, I'm home a little early from work today
Yeah, you miss me baby?
Yeah? I missed you too
I missed you so much I followed you today
Ah huh, yo son, yo son, don't raise up son, chill
Sit down son I'm talking to you
But I'm saying though
Don't deny it, I saw you
I saw you with your alcoholic secretary
The one with the bad feet
Walking, holding her hand
Playing yourself as usual
And you know you are known for playing yourself
Instead of holding her hand
You shoulda been putting some lotion on them crusty feet she got
But anyway, I ain't gonna stress that
It's all good
You know your man Big Mike?
Yeah, the first round draft pig, Big Mike
I know you know him as Mike
But I call him Big Mike
Yeah, why you got your mouth open, boo, close your mouth
Cuz see, he's feeling me
And I am not feeling you</pre>
