Typed by: Tha Masta

[Chorus: L.E.O.]
Let it be that real, nigga, gotta kill a nigga
To feel some figures (I could just kil a nigga)
Let it be that real, nigga, see me on some jail pictures
Cuz he got a tail on niggaz (I could just kil a nigga)
Let it be that real, nigga, over a sale, nigga
End my bail, nigga? (I could just kil a nigga)
Let it be that real, nigga, cuz I'm a chill nigga
Thought I'm a lil' nigga? (I could just kil a nigga)

[L.E.O.]
Nigga's really that real nigga, nigga get killed over drug sales
My right hand murdered and drugged over a drug sale
Can't understand that there's enough sales
And they felt someone was young and ain't put in no work
So that young dumb nigga just put him in dirt
I had to find that young dunn, and I done get him on worth
Fifth to his shirt, six in his clothes, the fifth in his throat
Lit him up close, adios, blowing smoke out the pistol
For my nigga O to let you know that I miss you
It won't bring you back, but to know that he with you
Victory similar to that, revenge is just mental
Ya men's is official, the men that he finished eat pistols swift with duke
The lion is who, I'm from where rottenist dude
This dude gon' fire his iron, niggaz get hired to shoot
Regardless to who is the guy behind us, two
Dead bodies was lying like nobody supplying the truth

[Chorus]

[Haxaw]
Why front? I'm on the block with my niggaz all day
We smoke that hydro, tell 'em 5-0's, eat shit and die slow
I bleed street, one deep, holding my heat
Blow you coward-ass niggaz off of ya feet
No shenanigans, I yolked 'em, big toast to splatter men
Get yaself punched in the face, for what you blabbering
Huh, L.E.O., let 'em know, it ain't a pro-b-a-lem
To get that real, I'm gon' embarrass 'em
Hax come, you little rats run
Dome get clapping 'em, I'm built for action
Let the Mac rrrrrrrung, hit ya back, son
You don't want the real, that nigga Hax real, you don't want the deal
Eat the pork and squeal, I stalk and kill
Hand a nigga his heart to feel for he lean out
And lean his team out, my peoples gotta eat, what it be 'bout?
Tell 'em little g's they could re-route
Or get rolled over, man, this show's over, the saying...

[Chorus]

[L.E.O.]
Let it be that real, nigga
It's really that real, for real, nigga?
We'll put shells on them frail niggaz, I shelve niggaz
Kneal, nigga, twelve niggaz, I could just wail on niggaz
Raise hell on niggaz for that dead prez
Spread lead power to that tenth power
Lllllllead showers, cowards dead, bed hours, respect ours
Y'all got fat while we starved in the streets
From here, nothing goes down unless it involves P.C.
Nigga's back soaked in the park, I want P.C.
No rap sales, no crack sales, unless it involves me
Ya shifts is up, I just clocked in
Locked in, first thing first, let Far Rock in
I'm a hop, skip and a jump from bricks in the trunk
One pot from boiling, whipping it up
One plate, two scrapes from rocks to shake
Two stops from opening shop, a few blocks away
A few shots your way...
