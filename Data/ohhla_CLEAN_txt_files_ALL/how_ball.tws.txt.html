(Hook 1)
Let me show you how to ball (how to ball)
let me show you how to sack this dirty money out of raw (out of raw)
let me show you that these bitches out here always can be bought (can be bought)
let me show you how to ball (ball)
let me show you that yo real niggas gone be there when you call (huh)
 
(Liffy Stokes)
It's the L-i-double-f-y so gone and let's die
killer from the westside you don't want to test I
smokin' on that best buy feelin superfly ridin' high throughout the chi
duckin' them guys on the rise watchin' dvd's on my car tv's
makin' bitches freeze stop and do a 360 degrees
while i'm in the breeze my mind's at ease smokin' on trees
contemplatin' monopolies through these rapid keys
it's all for the skeeze so bitch please I need a V-12
and a gang of dro and island walkin' on seashells
and if's all well in my life givin' up thanks everynight
but my strength and my will to still fight
in this fucked up world
fucked up steady callin earl
let me show you how to kill all that shit get to be a pearl
and live yo life to the fullest caught out in the hata bullest wit a
pocket full of g's cuz of yo nigga had to pull it get deez
 
(Hook 1)
 
(Hook 2)
Let me show you how to ball (how to ball)
let me show you how to come up with that passion for the law (for the law)
let me show you that these niggas out here ain't ready for war (for the war)
let me show you how to ball (ball)
let me show you how yo real niggas gone ball till they fall (huh)
 
(Todd Nitty)
All my gangsta's ridin wit me (let's get it on)
let's show em how we make this money (till the early mornin)
smokin pounds skeezin o-z (Southside)
Legit ballin family (mobsta for life)
representin' with them niggas that be hustlin' on the block
when the spot be gettin hot and then we duckin and dodgin' cops
thugs love that nigga Nitty cause they see the life I live
I been hustlin for a mil way before a record deal
so I know how it is to struggle
let me show you how to ball
how to stack yo paper tall and let no broad be yo downfall
pimp mo hood rats now legit stallions
pocket full of thousands legit ballin medallions
bitch I'm a hustla St. Ides guzzla
speedknot mobsta mister fuck a officer
go getter's and gangsta's out here on the grind
you got one life to live so make yo metal bling and shine
 
(Hook 1 &amp; Hook 2)
 
(Twista)
All the thugs in the world let me hear you holla out I got that raw
all the killas and the ballaz if you wit let me hear holla back wit a fuck the law
all the niggas and the bitches in the club
let me see you throw yo nines up to the ceilin'
all the stick-em niggas in the party
catch them muthafuckers up as soon as they leave the buildin'
if you ready and willin then uh set you down 
with the mob and let me see you throw a knuckle up
have you hustle up if you comin betta buckle up
cause I ride like what the fuck?
now what the fuck is up
rollin on rims we bout to die
22's with enough clean smokin' much green
while the ho's watch a fuck scene on the tv's with a touch screen
run a three for twenty-five's on a two for fifteen's
on a eight dollar hollas the mob figgas make a lot of dolla's
pay for the repo can't take my Impala pop da colla
but in the club they sho gone hate us
all the ho's don't play us
while we sportin' froze on gators
with a dye half-broke like the ozone layers
tell me where the dj
where the dro where the drank
gotta get be ?yappy ho's pappy? happy
cuz i'm off that dank
on the path of destruction i'm hustlin'
while I gots to get that bank
never bogus at all
pacs and techs in the hall
gettin' money with my dogs
and I'm never actin' petty with the fedi if ya ready let me...
