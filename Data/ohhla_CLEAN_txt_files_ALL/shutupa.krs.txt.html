Yeah, whassup?
Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!
Look at this place!
Why was I chosen to pick up the race?
And carry the flame, the torch, the name?
Millenium games, it's all the same
Sinners repent, many for fear
End of the year, everyone cheers
Only a few hear my voice in they ears
Everyone else well they really don't care
But what if I told you I could read the future
and in the future, they the losers
We the winners, cause they the sinners
Well it's all mathematics, can I eat my dinner
and think (think) why was I made to link
between them and the universe; battle, who the first?
I don't really care, cause I'm really not here
I'm showin you skill, but you still sayin "Where?"

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!
Every race, walkin around with they head up in space
They cannot see that we all really one
In any battle I already won
Thank the creator, it's already done
KRS-One?  Leavin 'em stunned
Dunn duh-duh dunn dunn done it again
Me and Will and my brother named Ken, now let me tell you
The bass in your face, the highs in your eyes
will make you real-IZE
If you down with the Temple of Hip-Hop, you not no average GUY, or girl
C'mon take a critical look in my world
See the metaphysical books that I twirl and twist
Forces the ventriloquist
I'm just a dummy gettin money at this name Kris

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!
KRS-One, Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Look, I be chillin readin a book
While the hip-hop nation repeats my hooks
All I wanna see is y'all healthy and wealthy
Yeah we already did it, really what can they tell me
About the pimps and the hoes, players and the clothes
You gets no money if you got no flow, no skill
C'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?
Build, c'mon y'all it's time to build
If you got no skill, how you gon' build?

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface!  Negative ass..
We bring the light!

North Carolina - they got me
Florida - they got me
Texas - yeah they rock me
In New York City they got me
L.A. - ha hah, they got me
Canada - Up North they rock me
D.C. - Atlanta, they got me
Ha hah - none of y'all can't stop me

Whassamatta you? (You) Why you lookin so sad (so sad)
KRS is back (he's back!) But you don't look so glad
Ahh shutupayouface! ..
Give it to 'em..</pre>
