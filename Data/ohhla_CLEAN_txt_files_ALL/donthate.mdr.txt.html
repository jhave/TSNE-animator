Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up
Smurf cut it up

[Verse 1]
She's broke as a joke, I don't want yo bitch
I want some rope and a gumbo mix
I Mutombo hits, slap a bitch out the air
It ain't fair I'm a California bear
Grizzly Adams, in a Benz on Davins
Thizzin', savin', gone off that log cabin
Hocus, pocus, DJ Macadoscious
Watch me turn these blunts into roaches
I come with doses, while Smurf cut it up
Let's nut it up and make punk shut it up
I rub it up, smack it up and dick down it down
Bustin' styles, like clips and rounds
How you like me now, fool what it do
It's don't hate the player part two
How you like me now, fool what it do
It's don't hate the player part two

[Chorus]
If you hate the player, you hate the game
If you hate the player, you hate the game
If you hate the player, you hate the game
So if you hate the player, you hate the game

[Verse 2]
Man you been actin' kind of strange lately
Because yo bitch licked and ate me
You hate me, you hate the game
It's fuckin' shame, like what's his name
It's nothin mayne, you didn't need her
She's raw, she jawed me in her two-seater
A two-liter, in her mouth I busted
Shake the broad dog, she can't be trusted
She put mustard, on my hot dog
And paid a pimp, before she shook the spot
I'm top dog, don't hate it, every rims I skated
Was chrome plated, I made it
I'm successful, and you hate it, cause yo life is so stressful
Thangs get a little easier, you got cheesier, and more pleasier</pre>
