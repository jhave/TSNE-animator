[Intro]
I need err'body!
To put the lighters in the air!
Light it up!

[Chorus]
We bout to get

Puff, puff pass [x4]

[Verse]
Candy painted, 26's, my chevy clean
I crack my window, so I can air out that sticky green
Bangin' that ol' school, I'm in a ol' school
I blow my horn back, even tho I don't kno you
Coastin' smokin' wit the sun roof open
Me and spider loc'n
Hennessy and hydro, niggas know how I roll
That's why when ya see me on t.v. it look like my eyes close
Let's go

[Chorus]
We bout to get
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'thang

[Verse]
Crumple up the kush, let's paint this picture purple
And shawty watch out how you be hittin' that, that shit'll hurt you
We gotta puff, puff pass, the blunt must last
I put in my half, so don't touch my grass
The weed man love me, he don't never charge me
I shot the sheriff, like the legend Bob Marley
Lighters in the air, I brought enough to share
I gotta question for ya, who the tightest up in here

[Chorus]
We bout to get
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'thang

[Verse]
Now okay if god made pot, and man made beer
Then who the fuck you people trustin' up in here
See I smoke one when I wake up, I smoke to go to sleep
All the true weed smokers, they gotta smoke before they eat
Just stay focused, and we gon smoke this
Yea we got pounds, but we still hit the roaches
Put it in the air, remember that I brought enough to share
I gotta question for ya, who the tightest up in here

[Chorus]
We bout to get
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'thang

[Bridge]
It's on (it's on) (it's on) (it's on) (it's on) (it's on)
Gimme that kush man
Woah oh oh (woah oh oh) (woah oh oh)
Hey! give me that fiy-a (fiy-aaa) (fiy-aaaaaa)
Hey! gimme that woah
Gimme (gimme) (gimme) (gimme) (gimme)
Burnnin' (burnnin') (burnnin')

[Chorus]
We bout to get
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
We gotten err'body
Puff, puff pass [x4]
