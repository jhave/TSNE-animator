-= Mac Dre talking=
Da U.S. Open [uh, hello, uh]
Let the games begin [hello, uh, hello]

[Mac Dre]
You white around the mouth
Your lips need car-mex
I'm steady jumpin' out more whips than Car Max
I'm rock star stooey wit the Louie guitar strap
Get weeded not conceded
Give a groupie a call back
I'm all that and a bag a chips dude
Got fists dude
Beat downs get issued
I'm rich dude
TV's and errythang
Diamond's shinin', danglin' from my heavy chain
Very plain, and I come dumb wit it
Your soft, hand it off, let a real nigga run wit it
I'm dumb fitted, shitted, P-O-L-O
Your chick's a flirt
She always tell me "hello"
She shake it like jello to see if I'm a look
She off the hook
And potna I'm a crook
I take your bitch if I want her
Cuss up on her
Bust nuts on her

[Chorus]: Mac Dre
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch [handcuff the bitch]
If you really love her [if you really love her]
Handcuff your bitch
Handcuff your bitch
Handcuff your bitch
If you love your bitch

[Mac Mall]
Shackles on the ankle of a fast ho, let her go
Baby boo boo fan of Macenroe at every show
Chasey want an autograph
I gave her dick to the throat
Signed it on her grill
"MAC THE MOST" in capitals
Internationally known
Crestside home grown
Game fed, hard head
Three C's, stoned dome
Let the games begin
Let the mackin' commence
Thizz is in the tilt
And we all ignorant
But later for you hater
Y'all make a good payer
Yo bitch is old news
I get it back when I had the gator
But now it's me and Macassi
Servin' it up savagely
Mac Magician specializin'
Keepin' hoes vanishin' POOF!

[Chorus]</pre>
