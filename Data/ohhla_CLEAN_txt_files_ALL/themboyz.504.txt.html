Watch them boyz, watch them boyz, y'all know them boyz?

(X-Con)
See that nigga with the slugs he got the gat
See that nigga in the black he got the sack
See don't fuck with them niggas when they on they shit
And don't fuck with them niggas in the No-Limit clique (ya heard)
See calio boys they don't give a fuck
But them 504 boyz they'll bust you up
When they doin' bad they'll rob your ass
Run from the taz then hustle and grab
The one thing my niggas, they don't stunt
But they'll fuck your bitch then smoke your blunts(ya heard)

(Chorus) x3

(Mac)
Man look who them niggas with their rag on and the gold teeth?
I know them boys know me
I know them boys heard of me
Probally wanna murder me
Probally got some niggas outside smokin' out my ride
But I hope they got they bullett proof vest on
Cause I be shootin' like a fiend shootin' hairon(heroin)
Oh where you from dog (where you from) oh is that right
Now get the fuck before I show you what this mack like
You niggas must be made of (?) 
Cause y'all just stumbled in the wrong hood trying to get your rap on
Tell the D.J. cut the lights on 
So we can take it outside and get our motherfucking fight on

(Chorus)

(Master-P)
They got me running through this dirty maze I feel a trap
Foot prints all through this dirty grave with a (?)
Coming (?) with two heaters stuck in my britches
You niggas keep on chasin I'm taking some of you with me
I don't wanna hurt nobody, tell me if it's the end
God forgive my sins cause I gots to make it in
Tried it playing with the good but my hood is raw
Head busters and wig spliters, it's all them so
Aint got time for the game no more hoes always in us
It's all about the fame now hoe, got you niggas jelous
All the old killers I ran with, let me show y'all the difference
Gotta watch them on the streets like I watch them other prisoners

(Chorus) x2</pre>
