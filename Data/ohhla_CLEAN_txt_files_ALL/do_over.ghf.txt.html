Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Raheem DeVaughn]
This is a story of a player from the Island
That lost his way, such a price to pay
To, kiss those girls and make them cry
Kiss those girls and make them cry
To love, to lose, to plead for a do over
A do over, give me a do over, I want a do over
It's that Radio Raheem and Ghostface Killah

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
If you know how much time tonight, I miss you like all the time
And if you don't wanna see me, fine
A good girl's hard to find, so maybe in due time
Can I get a do over? Can I get a do over?

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried, and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out, and we'll be the ones, sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world, innocent, two month old
Little girl, but what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo
It's like being kicked out the group and lost my crew
Throwing the baby up to someone I hardly knew
Nah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I wrote this right here, on the bus to Riker's
Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now
I'm sorry, please forgive me, the streets caught me
I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I, would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face
For sure, nine out of ten times
My accent's wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind, to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me, my rep on the streets like touching a son
You like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true

[Chorus]

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos, and all my clothes
She said, if my, apoligies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Hello baby, I'm sorry for everything that just been going on lately
You know, I've kinda been stressed out
I've been thinking about the things I did to you lately and
Not listening when you was telling me to chill
Now I wind up in here, it's like
You remember, listen boo, listen
The way you rub my face, the way you talk to me
The way you look at me, I know ain't no girl in the world gon' ever give me that
Like the way you gave it to me
So right now I'm pleading, and this is my word on everything
I'm on my knees, babe, just take me back, give me one chance
I'm asking for a do over...</pre>
