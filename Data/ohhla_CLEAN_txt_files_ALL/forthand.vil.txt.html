Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...
Just rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...

Don't make no sense
You ain't gotta grab the microphone to pay your rent
It's too many, so-called MC's rappin
Put your shit down, you can't make it happen
Continue, to do what you do
So my crew can bring out the cool in you and you
Don't front on the S my man
What you do is thank God for the dammmmmn
Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...

Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...
The S.V. clique, yeah we it
Turn around and say what? And to rhyme against
How dare when you front so nigga tell me what time it is
It's time to stop the whack rhymin and stop grabbin your penis
This is for the niggaz who get freaky with it
Cause it can get hectic, hectic
It get to the S.V. clique, rhymin's a fair connect
Soldier just move it, keep movin it
Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...

Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...
This is the moment that you all been waitin fo'
The S is the shit c'mon, y'know
This is for the whack niggaz who don't know
That my crew is definitely the solid rock
Don't make a, young nigga pull out a glock
Cause my glock is my microphone
I had to put it down sometimes, what a nigga gotta do
to convince the masses this is the dopest crew
So when you criticize, you better make sure
two thumbs is up, nigga what~?! I think you oughta
Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, see forth and back back back

Yeah rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...

Rock to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...

Rawwwwk to the rhythm, forth and back
Forth and back, forth and back back back...</pre>
