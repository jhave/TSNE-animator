	Don't lock me up

[ VERSE 1 ]
Well, I was kickin it on the corner somewhere out west
Lookin fly like I do because I am well dressed
When a cop stepped to me like a man possessed
And said, "Get ready to hear your rights because you're under arrest"
I told him, "Pardon me, Mr. Officer, but what's the charge?
Is it against the law to max out and live large?"
He told me, "Keep quiet, did you hear what I said?
You keep runnin your mouth, and I'ma bust your head"
So he slapped the cuffs on me behind my back
A couple of friends walked up and aksed me, "What's up, black?"
Well, I couldn't say a word, this is really a shock
Cause I was known as the good guy on the block
We rolled to the station in the black and white
Goin through stop signs and traffic lights
And I thought, this must be the good Lord's test
An innocent man found guilty, placed under arrest

	Don't lock me up  (3x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
When we got to the station we screeched to a halt
I said, "Whatever you think I did, my man, it ain't my fault"
I walked inside, feelin nervous and tense
When I was led downstairs for some pictures and prints
I posed from every angle, the pictures were taken
I tried to tell the cop about the mistake he was makin
But fingerprints were next, so I followed the plan
I took off my three-finger and I gave em my hand
I was real puzzled about the situation
No charge given, and no explanation
Subject to the law and its intimidation
Not to mention my own humiliation
The pieces didn't fit, it just didn't connect
Then I was told, "You're bein held as a rape suspect"
I was speechless, my head just fell to the chest
An innocent man found guilty, placed under arrest

	Don't lock me up  (3x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Sittin in a jail cell, what a crazy tale, hell
Seconds seem like hours and the minutes seem like days, well
I'm tryin to keep my wits about me, but
A man that doesn't have his dignity, will soon be a nut
Now I thought you're innocent until your guilt is proven
Locked behind bars, young man ain't movin
Like a newborn chick thrown out of the nest
An innocent man found guilty, placed under arrest

[ BREAK ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
So I sat in the cell, sayin, 'Why?' and 'How?'
And what would my mother say if she could see me now?
As a rape suspect, and how could it be?
Cause all the women that I slept with, wanted to sleep with me
Just then the door opened, someone else got done
To my surprise it was the brother KRS-One
He said they snatched him up from out of his crib
Pulled out the night stick and nearly busted a rib
We spoke for a minute, then our names were called
Suspects for a line-up against the wall
Where they singled out a brother who was wearin a hat
And it wasn't me or Kris, so I was happy with that
Then I thought for a second: these cops got nerve!
They got the suspect, but justice was not served
Cause they was lookin for a brother who was 5 ft. 3
Well, I'm 6 ft. 1, and Kris is taller than me
So I went to my lawyer, asked if I could sue
He said, "I'm sorry, Young, there ain't a damn thing you can do
And it's a shame what happened, it's really a sin
The guy's short and fat and you're tall and thin"
Now I couldn't help feelin like I just got jerked
And the problem is that's how the system works
Black people need justice, we continue the quest
An innocent man found guilty placed under arrrest</pre>
