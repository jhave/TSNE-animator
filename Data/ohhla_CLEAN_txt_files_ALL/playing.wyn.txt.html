So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining (shining, shining)
As you're drivin down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire!
(Heh!)
Momma always told me I was crazy
And my ho's say I'm amazing but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say no bitch I'm blazin
Like, what the fuck you expect I'm a motherfuckin Cajun
And I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doin time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out it's fine
Like wine, wait, watch
See I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch
I "'Kix" it, no cereal like a landing and I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
That's too explicit, but why you listenin
I smell smoke and somethins sizzlin
That's her pussy, so hey pussy, play wit pussy or play pussy
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire!
(Eh, heh)
They say you're nobody 'til somebody kills you
But where I'm from you're nobody til you kill somebody
And you know what they say
When you're great it's not murder it's assassinate
So assassinate me, bitch
Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checkin in the same hotel in the same suite bitch same balcony
Like assassinate me bitch
Swim to him, cheay
I don't rap, I film movies, with my rap
You can call me Mr. Directors chair
Yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut on to the next
Not the next scene, bitch the next check
Some say the X, makes the sex 'spect's
So play wit the pussy or play pussy
So you got so many diamonds (hey pussy, lay pussy)
You wear all the finest clothes (do or die say pussy and I say)
And your grill is shining (I say, lay pussy, lay pussy, lay pussy)
As you're drivin down the streets of gold (hey pussy)
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire! (hey pussy)
(Don't play pussy!)
(Get em!)
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Brave Heart bitch like the Times I'm medieval
Married to the game, divorced the Cathedral
Standin' on the corner selling porcelean to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow when I lead you
Straight to the needle
The bottles, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat you?
Remember when I went into the kitchen got the cleaver
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
You could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire!
