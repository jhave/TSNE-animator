Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
Jet lagged; Louis Vuitton bag
Under the icey they don't recognize me
So are, you following me?
Cause I +Stay Puft+ like the marshmallow man

[Tyga]
Oh my, must I been in a coma?
Cuban chicks lookin my way cause I'm so fly
Right now, should I approach him like
How was you uh, attacked like a cobra
Like some guys, but I ain't the type ma
I super thirst my girst, all hyped up (whassup now?
More words than you can think of
Feral, flashy, young and almost famed up
(T-Y) G-A the man yessir
Went from real price to please sir? (No charge) Thank you
Now that's me directing like all-star
Songs with similes making you smell like Armour
Cops, cards, me fake ID
Probably in the glove compart, I'm sorry
Underage, so you can't charge
But officer, no autograph y'all cause I'm

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I gotta supersize me (ha ha)
I gotta supersize me (I do, I do~!)
I gotta supersize me (what?)
Cause they don't recognize me (recognize me)
I gotta supersize me (I do)
I gotta supersize me (ha ha)
I gotta supersize me (uh)
Cause they don't recognize me (c'mon)

[Tyga]
Little baby steps, share harder than the next
If it goes by turns then I should be next
VT's rated X, MTV's first listen
Look under the chair - you put diamonds on your chest?
A Monopoly set? Skip Baltic Avenue
Gimme a house or a jet (no a house and a jet!)
Like Rhymefest, when I'm rhymin on the set
I need a brand new fit shoes, to have
But now, I'm lookin like more to the stars
When there's light fame they can see who you are
(See they love you now, they didn't love you before)
Well maybe right now, to them I'm so import-
-tant in the tint and the rims on the sport
Car, come along I got four
Underage, so you can't charge
But officer, no autograph y'all cause I'm

[Chorus]

[Interlude] w/ (different ad libs)

[Tyga]
AHHHHHH~! I guess they gon' recognize me now after this pink stuff
We got 'em goin to the club on this track, ha ha!
G.D.I.C., Young Money NT, Decaturs!
Big Evil, Corporation I see you
Tell I made it
Ha ha!
