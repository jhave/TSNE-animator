[Conejo]
Turn my mic up Bandit
Hell yeah
That's right, we're back
Just more motherfucking feria involved
Tattoo Ink, Conejo and Bugsy homie
That's the way it's going down
It's like this, what we got

[Conejo]
Quieren tinta, I got you fiending
Ese waiting till it drop, these punk bitches be scheming
Go to sleep em, fucking bullets recieve em
But no matter what you think ese the Ink will decieve em
Bang tough on these vatos, hit a twenty dollar sherm stick
Gone out my mind, this loquera's a trip
But I'm a raptor and that's a bird of prey
So you vatos better pray for a slight delay
Hit the yayo, I give the orders
Cuz we're the only dopers on the block and we're holding
Plenty iron, death blowing them kisses
Venom be the expert of disposal business
Doom sayer, I'ma put it into you player
And kick it so solteric, hydroponics and bitches
Tattoo Ink, that's Conejo and Bugsy
Tell your lady that we're here, it's the real that she wanted

[Bugsy]
Oh no, you didn't see us coming
Oh no, you vatos want nothing
Yeah you know the realest, come on
Ese gangster better leave it alone
Bugsy, Conejo, Bandit, Veneno
Tattoo Ink, Tattoo Ink
Oh no, you didn't see us coming
Oh no, you vatos want nothing
Yeah you know the realest, come on
Ese gangster better leave it alone
Bugsy, Conejo, Bandit, Veneno
Tattoo Ink, Tattoo Ink

...you're on the clock bitch and midnight is coming..
...most of these cons don't click..
...there's just filling space, doing time..
...it's the gangs that run this place..
...ey que chingues traies..
...what the fuck you let those putos disrespect you like that for ese..
...take it easy carnal..
...you're ranking it for the rest of the homeboys..
...you're on the clock bitch and midnight is coming..
...you're on the clock bitch and midnight is coming..

[Bandit]
