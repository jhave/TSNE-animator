[Verse 1]
Excuse me if I a little [fresh], but I like to watch you undress
I mean unzip that wok load and get you outta that stress
Now drop the drama to your ankles and lay bak as I stretch, across your landscape
Search for the signal for your landing strip
You're the radio controller driving me to chocolate bliss
You've got some gravitational pull on my rocket ship
Rocking as I enter your atmosphere and you grab me near
What happens hear, you wrapped around me like a forcefield
I make you feel the force, but ain't nothing forced, feels real
Feel like steel, don't it
Time stands still want it, to not stop 'til cops come knock knock
You let me travel your Bermuda Triangle
We get used to trying angles quite naturally, now have a breather
Then [come back], for just another round of close encounter contact
Synergize, energize it like that

[Hook]
Can't we just stay like this, wrapped up in chocolate bliss [3x]

[Verse 2]
As the show goes on, on the floor goes on
Crawl away, I pull you back as the flow goes strong
It's such a milky way, big bang theory, you don't hear me
It's so 5th dimensional, extra sensory sensual
So sensitive to the touch that it makes no sense to you
And can't nobody make music mo' betta, together
make rhythms up against the wall 'til they think we makin' beats
We play and press repeat, 'til we make them walls fall
Proclaiming who can claim it with such profane speech ya, the gatekeeper
I got the master key to that latch
And this ain't where my aim is
but it's so unmistakable and so uncommon in match
might place a young one in that
face expressions tighten as we're bracing for impact
And tell the world to get back, cause they ain't ready for us
And this is mine and it yours, so ain't no runnin' from it
My meteor and your earth, colliding as we comet
Together
