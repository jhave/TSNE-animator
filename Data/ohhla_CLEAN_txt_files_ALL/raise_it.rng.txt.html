[Swizz Beatz] 
Millenium time, millenium time 
Yo, Strings, Drag-On 
Swizz-Swizz-Swizz Beatz 
Yo, yo, yo (1-2-3-4) 

[Chorus One: Strings] 
Raise it up, in the front 
Raise it up, in the back 
Raise it up, on the side 
Raise it up, where you at? 
Raise it up, in the middle 
Raise it up, in the back 
Raise it up, raise it up 
Raise it up, raise it up 

[Chorus Two: Strings] 
Blaze it up, in the front 
Blaze it up, in the back 
Blaze it up, on the side 
Blaze it up, where you at? 
Blaze it up, in the middle 
Blaze it up, in the back 
Raise it up, raise it up 
Raise it up, raise it up 

[Strings] 
How many y'all real ones feelin this in yo' feet? 
How many y'all real ones bumpin Strings in yo' Jeeps? 
How many y'all real ones got beef? 
Packin heat, packin in yo' sleep 
Haters is hungry up in them streets 
How many y'all real ones got dough after ass? 
How many y'all real ones hustle and make it fast? 
How many y'all real ones got women with class? 
Bringin they own shit, makin they own cash 
How many y'all real ones is ready for combat? 
How many y'all real ones' lions was takin for tomcats? 
Contacts for contracts, that's where I'm at 
Lyin ass for cash for eternity, I'm stacked 
Ruff to the Ryde, never been what I'm about 
What the hell are y'all waitin for?   
My toque is fired up 
Make my pocket lump-lump, I give you the pump-pump 
Let me see you jump-jump, and shakin your rump-rump-rump 
Party over here, bump that over there 
Hands in the air, drinks e'rywhere 
And if wherever you from, please we don't care 
Long as you got that derriere 
Make that cash, make that dough 
Break that chick, pimp that yo 
Sisqo flow, uhh, Sisqo flow 
Throw yo' hands up, my soldiers puttin it down 
Where my ladies at, shake that thang all around 
I said throw yo' hands up, my soldiers puttin it down 
Where my ladies at, shake that thang all around 

[Chorus One] - 2X 

[Drag-On]   
(Flame On!!) 
All my people Ryde 'em Ruff like giddy-up 
Get a nigga, pick 'im up, stick 'im up 
Get the nine, hit 'im up, ambulance come pick 'im up 
All my people push weight 
Ain't nothin but a word to move the bird 
We fly them south for the winter 
Cook them up then push 'em out like dinner 
Now eat.. Drag-On get enough to feed the streets 
Like here's a key, take that 
Who him? Break that 
Y'all boys better make my kick-back 
With a pen in my hand y'all see gashes 
Bullets will land y'all see splashes 
When I send them loose beadies 
Brains on the walls like grafitis 
All my peoples is millionaires 
But in the hood, they still there 
When there's a cop, let's bail out, we bail there 
Come back to the hood and get killed there 
Get carried out, when I go to the hood 
Why them girls wanna marry me now, and follow me now? 
I just tell them to shut up.. 
All my people done Ryde the people 
Put they body where you can't see them 
Half of they body is stuffed tissue 
Other half got you peakin 
Drag got you peelin 
Double R got you leakin 
Swizz got your brain sodomized 
Ruff Ryde or Die 

[Chorus One] - 2X 

[Chorus Two] - till fade </pre>
