Song:   A.F.D. (Ass For Days)
Typed by: DETreceiver2g@aol.com

She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days,
She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days,
She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days,
She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days

[First Verse]
A.F.D., a jam that's hittin' for the streets
So flat ass is obsolete
And titties don't do it, even though they might be plump
I need a rump, the kind you can thump, so fuck her
And if it makes hits, this is much smoother
The wiggle, jiggle, jiggle, sex soother
I'm rollin' back, I'm tellin' ya now if you can't flaunt it
Take your ass home and work on it
But if you got butter on your biscuit then eat it
And, take it to my homies and feed 'em
Cuz it's so good when them bitches try to serve it
Grade A beef, and it shake like it's nervous
I see some beef, take one glass
Then it turn to a spoon, put the nuts in they pants
See it at the mall and gotta grab it
So call me a hoe, cuz like the bitch I gotta have it
A.F.D.

Chorus: repeat 2X

She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days,
A.F.D.,
She's gotta have ass for days, she's gotta have ass for days,
A.F.D.

[Second Verse]
She's gotta have it, plump, sweeter than a danish
One hundred percent, jiggle, jiggle jelly-like anus
I like it when it's wrapped, just for a smack
I love it when it's funky decorated with a gap
So gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I want that swole, word to Jimmy
Here's a little bit to think about Jack
Why, eat a pancake when you can have the whole stack?
I pick up, will call you when I get down
Don't you want it flat with a fat bumper too?
Well ain't that how you like it Mamacita?
With the boom-boom, dumpin' like Rosarita
With a place seein' ass, so do it
Remember, a serve from Domino is not the beauty but the potion
So, tap your heels like Dorothy or Doris
And listen to the theme of the chorus
A.F.D.

Chorus

[Third Verse]
I want to pump her you know?  It makes you want sex when you see it
Switch it, in the night, in a tight dress 
so grab Jimmy, I'm here to let you know
You think you drunk mile, the Jimmy starts to grow
Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
Sort of like drinkin', a forty ounce of liquor
I know you heard of Tales from the Crypt
Well, this is more better, tales from the hip
And this is not rated P-G
It's, rated triple X, and it comes in 3-D
With a bit of that soda like a treasure
But, if you strike gold then you know you'll find pleasure
Like I trunk full of body you can pounce, it's
Really like Zapp with more bounce to the ounce
So if you injured on the job then sue
You can't handle it?  Than give it to me
A.F.D.
