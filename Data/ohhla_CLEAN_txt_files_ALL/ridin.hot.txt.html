We ridin coming up out of the flames with the K firing (Ride, Ride) 
Hot Boys ridin our flames firing (Ride, Ride, Ride) 

[Juvenile]
I'm bout to make a move so you best to 86 
Cause I be coming through 
With shit that be seperating bricks 
You got a broken tool then you better get it fixed
And ain't no missin you cause I got too many clips 
Hey then then too many times I gotta straighten the cross 
Them niggaz was trying but I was breaking 'em off 
If you had it on your mind I was taking it off 
Either get up and whine or break to the north 
Look whoa there there go your cut you better catch it 
Your last minute is coming up you better strectch it 
Oh you got dope in the trunk almost forgot to check it 
Right after your head bust I expect to exit 
I'm a punch you when you're out and unlock it, I got this 
Grab a steering wheel column and pop it, we're shoppers 
I'm about to go and kill for they profit, my pockets 
Him, me, and that nigga bout to stop it 
why not bitch 

Chorus: 

Grab your strap saddle up nigga when you ride with me 
You ain't guaranteed to make it back when you ride with me 
And what I ride like a roller coaster 
When I ride with uptown soldiers 
Look here we ridin we ridin 
We coming up out the flames with the K firing 
We ridin We ridin 
We coming up out the flames with the K firing 

[B.G.)]
Me and my boy Lil' Wayne rolling 
Strapped up in black clothes ain't no ass-holing 
Up in the bubble lye black tints ducked off 
Head busting BG straight gotta play the game raw 
Now look here nigga better be gone 
Off the block cause mother fuckers be falling 
Cause Off top I'm gone get my mother fucking creep on 
Nigga get chopped like the leaf offf a tree holmes 
I'm a flee off the scene with my rees(reeboks) on 
Black thicker shirt and my GB's on 
Run with me ain't no way you could get your sleep on 
Cause when I come ooh ooh it's hot the heat's on 
I know you feel it nigga 
It's pure ruckus when I enter 
I sent a message letting you know I spin ya 
Been bro shooting 
50 plus behind air T retaliation is a must 
Hollows get bust brain get bust 
Anybody here here 
When I'm full of that shit 
And I'm on a mision to split it get split 
Peep me I play for keeps I kill em all 
No deciding 
I take no prisoners from em all when I'm ridin 

Chorus 

[Lil' Wayne]
Uh I come to leave a nigga smelly 
Full black better get ready with my M-elevy (Mack Eleven) 
Up in my 98 Chevy I swing corners 
Cut you up like w belly with that thing on ya 
Now it be me (uh huh) 
and I be Wayne (uh huh) 
This little clique like a chain to your brain (uh huh) 
I shoot first for my talking 
Rougher than a carpet 
Heard about Hot Boys erase your name up off the market 
And nigga break a swell fly 
Camouflage up out of the sky 
What if I buy you die 
Look I spin corn! ers like a daily routine 
The bad choppers told a nigga I be 17 
I got a 10 shot glock 
Inched back then I pull it 
I'm coming round your spot with a sack full of bullets 
I be twisting round your block in all black nigga 
Full of that style don't move I day act nigga 
Find where you at and then I ch-chop nigga 
I'm on a duck plan with about 50 shots nigga 
Now whoa what saying to Shite 
My 9 be about that 
Watch it (crack) crack and I'm riding 

[Turk]
Ride around with the 2 shooter 
Ain't gone help ya 
Playing round with the 50 shooter 
Scalp you like a scalper 
10 percent gone help ya 
90 percent gone fail ya 
Vests can't protect what I bring best 
Believe it's gone fail ya 
4 deep in a Navigator on a creep 
Windows tinted black on black in leather seats 
Hot Boys with hot girls ready for beef 
Red dot plot 32 shot bodies in heat 
Desert Eagle with hollows 
You got nothing but egos 
Putting hands to niggaz that's at Evil Kanieval 
Playa haters like shit, get assed out 
With no doubt blood blood rush out like a water spout 
LD niggaz best believe they be ridin with me 
Shot L tuck best believe he be ridin with me 
With them guerillas should have left the meat where it was 
But no he wants to spark the shit up
