All the way from Athens, the A-T-L shawty

[Bubba Sparxxx]
Uhh, Sleepy Brown
Uhh, Bubba Sparxxx
We gon' keep doin it baby
Whether you like it or not.. uhh

[Chorus: Sleepy Brown] + (Bubba)
Ain't a damn thang pretty
From dirt roads to the city, uhh
(You might catch me drunk in the pub)
(Or either crunk in the club)
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT
Don't matter where I hang
People love my twang, uhh
(Call us country or Southerners mayn)
(We gon' keep doin our thang)
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT

[Sleepy Brown]
Rollin up +So Fresh, So Clean+
Wood grain, big screen TV's
Uhh, I got the bump-bump in my trunk now
Uhh, I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to funk
Now all the ladies seem to like my style
Guess I'll be here for a while, mmm
To see who wants to come and be with me
I'll take you back to the flat so I can show you where it's at, c'mon
Ohh, wee - look at me
Movin 'cross the floor so easily
Oh, my, can't deny
This funk starts high in the sky
I'm 'bout to get my groove on
Uhh, I'm 'bout to bust a move on 'em
Uhh, there's no-thing you can do for 'em
Uhh, cause I'm checkin the spot if you really like it or not

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I know you hate it, I'ma say it to you anyway
I'm 'bout to throw them 24's on that Escalade
Still I got the Mickey T's on the Chevrolet
Z-7-1, the mere sight'll take your breath away
It's today but I'm still on it like it's yesterday
Throw me the ball, this the game that I was bred to play
And pass the cooler with this stewardess named Desireé
You ain't no concern, I'ma wait and see what Heaven say
I got a brother by the name of Snicky Ricky Wade
He said - Bubba, real careers ain't quicky quickly made
My other brother by the name of Patrick "Sleepy" Brown
Said that our +Noize+ is the type that you should keep around
They led me through the forest, took me to the wizard Ray
He told me that tomorrow won't be what it is today
I said, "Damn, that's just what my brother Tim would say"
I'm back at home, just how long have I been away?

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm the type that you might see with Petey Pablo
Chasin fielder's dream with corn and three Diablos
And I'll be blessed to death if I see tomorrow
But I'ma live to get my son a lead that he can follow
I might can't flip a brick but bet that I can move a pound
And if you call yourself the king, well then there's two in town
Regardless where you from, what you do, or who you found
You best to get to practice early for the shoot-around
Cause Bubba don't play, do them thangs you won't say
Be damned if I even pull my {dick} out and don't spray
Daddy told me just to do them thangs he never did
Breakin broads, get money, live your life and treasure it
And that's the least that I can do, for the man who
raised me up and through his faults helped me understand you
And now I'm certified, New South pioneer
Born and raised down here, best believe I'm dyin here

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
For all my rebels ridin dump truck, heavy Chevy's, Cadillacs
Hot rods, no seats, in the back
Browning, thirties-thirties, in the rack
Guaranteed, leave your land, where you at?
Dump truck, heavy Chevy's, Cadillacs
Hot rods, no seats, in the back
Browning, thirties-thirties, in the rack
Guaranteed, leave your land, where you at?
Sump truck, heavy Chevy's, Cadillacs
Hot rods, no seats, in the back
Browning, thirties-thirties, in the rack
Guaranteed, leave your land, where you at?

Bubba Sparxxx! (YEAH)
Organized Noize (YEAH) Beat Club
Timbo (YEAH) the whole New South
Real down South Georgia boy
Real country white boy, real HARD
Get it together, a new beginning.. </pre>
