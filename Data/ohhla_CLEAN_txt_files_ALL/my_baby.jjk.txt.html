[Kayne West]
You see I go by the name of Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
I'm with my home girl
Who need to hook me up with some of her home girls
Yeah, Janet Jackson
We back, baby

[Janet Jackson]
Don't matter what they say baby
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
'Cause you're so ooh

So many said we'd (never)
Never know love like this (but)
They never felt your kiss (felt your kiss)
And how good your touch could be (so)
Many a days I face the pressure to walk away (way)
From what the people say (people say)

[B-Section]
Baby(baby) these butterflies they never lie
Been thru so much pain before (and)
Baby (baby) - I had to try
'Cause you're not like most guys
And I ain't ashamed to say that you're my

[Hook]
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
They just don't know my baby
And how I feel about you
Baby (baby)
Don't matter what they say baby (baby)
I won't let go my baby
And how I feel about you

When you look in my eyes
I wish you could read my mind (and)
And know how I feel inside (feel inside)
And hear what they say about you
Just because they can't see (see)
You're more than enough for me (why)
Why can't they just let us be (can't they just let be)
And leave us alone

[Kanye West]
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say I'm sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin' to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin' to stabe two like Jack the Tripper
My nigger Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he
And I'm a big tipper I don't need to be trippin'
This my first Rolex it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean I'm into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured

[Hook]

[Janet Jackson]
Don't matter what they say baby
They just don't know my baby
Don't matter what they say baby
I won't let go, my baby

But y'all don't know a thing about my
My baby (baby) My baby (baby)
There's more to his love than what y'all see
And it don't describe what he is to me</pre>
