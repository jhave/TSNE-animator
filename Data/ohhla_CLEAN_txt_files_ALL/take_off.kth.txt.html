[Kool Keith] New Nancy Des Rose
[Nancy Rose] Keith you gon' hold this track down for me?
I'm goin upstairs to change, I gotta get on stage
Aight?  I'll be back later

[Kool Keith]
My commodes are larger
I call rappers to look at the feces
800 pounds, my pet tiger feed
You whack niggaz a bowl of doo-doo
Anything you play my pee will stain
Yellow spots from the pilgrims cause pain
George Westinghouse started to like that beam on the mouse
Imagine a apartment in Riverdale
with 5 Belve' bottles with defecation on the couch
Soiled clothes in the hampers
Warned everybody, including your hype men
Global maximum urine, piss on the core of the city
Leavin New York police department with Pampers
With KF's chicken baby, my uncle's Colonel Sanders
Watch the mixtape, niggaz don't even know yet
Pressin up homosexuals that ain't even pro yet
I vomit on most rappers gettin off a private jet
Australian orangu' tango
A key to dog Asian that's my private pet
Tighten up in Jersey kid writin some ol' cow shit
while you watchin the Nets
Your top performance is low to me
Your chihuahua, that's your apex
I respect the Taco Bell dog better than you
Cause he's cleverer than you

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
Shorty, just take off your clothes
Take them off (I wanna take it off)
Shorty, take off your clothes
Take them off (I wanna take it off)

[Nancy Des Rose]
Palm trees, blue seas, ships to outfits
I dip right into some jumpin mix
Twist and flip it over to the other side
The people say, "Oh la, chu la"
I'm hot to trot, Hollywood can't stop what I got
Like special stew in a pot, a remix recipe
Go back to your shop, inspect your beats
I'm recreating the streets, hits that fit
You gotta go home to take that Prozac
Cause your shit is whack, you lack the act
I come with what attacks, don't counter contracts
I stay packed with fly tracks
Flavors everywhere, I dare you to try and fly with me
Full speed ahead, you got no deal
I'm the real, down Melrose on a shopping spree
Something for me, usually some fly shit
Made just for me on an island in the highlands
You can't reach me, you can't teach me
I'm way out in the Pacific, Atlantic, the Red Sea
It's all just a breeze
A real, a meal, I heal, open all the seals

[Chorus]

[uncredited rapper]
Yo... yo, yo, yo
Let me take you there, UHH, UHH
C'mon, bash the club, we don't care
Strippers lapdance, shakin they tail, it's a crazy night
We take 'em out like every night
Let's go, that's how we do, back to the city
Crack backs real fast in the quickie
I know you like that, G-strings come off
with your black tights, we can go nuts
Slap that ass... UHH
We can get drunk, smack that ass
Those high boots
Full length fishnet black body suits
A sexy tan (yeah)
I'm a big fan, big fan baby
Chicks love me, call me a big man
A freak by nature, don't be a hater
Drink it up right out of the alligators
Yo, we in the elevator
Gettin naked, Bonaventure
They can see us, baby don't fake it

[Chorus]</pre>
