Song:   They Suck
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I used to cop and shoot, used it like a prostitute
Stuck the evidence in my blood, nothing to prosecute
Shaking the magazine around like a tambourine
Looking for a sheet of LSD and eating Dramamine
Nodding so much I'm nauseous
Behind 500 horses probably turning shit upside down like inverted crosses
Pull out your tit and feed me
Needy like a newborn
We could switch places, keep my shoes warm

They suck your dick, even though they really hate you
They suck your dick, even though they really hate you

You could copy me, make a million on mockery
They drilled my third eye out during my lobotomy
She want's to suck it now
Plunge her filled with butter, brown
Fuck the circus what a clown
Your anarchy is watered down
Her eyes are bigger than her mouth, I let my cock spar
From the back of cop cars, doing drugs with pop stars
Poolside, high on coke, DMT [?], everything is slow motion
I closed my brain and kept my eyes open

They suck your dick, even though they really hate you
They suck your dick, even though they really hate you
(so true, so true)

I'm being honest dear, I don't have a problem here
I wanna go on a killing spree, I'm looking for a volunteer
Feeling kinda hostile, I just wanna preach the gospel
And if I bleed to death it'll be right out of my fucking nostrils
I'm only here to help you discover the real you
Fuck some of your bitches and give you music to kill to
At the very least smoke it up fuck the police
I got poison on my ciggies on 116th

They suck your dick, even though they really hate you
They suck your dick, even though they really hate you</pre>
