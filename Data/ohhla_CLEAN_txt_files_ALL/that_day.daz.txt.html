[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..
Yeah, it feels good to be DPG don't it?... yeah
Doin' this independent shit everyday, all day, ya know?
Ain't stoppin' for no motherfuckin' body
Who gives a fuck about y'all major ass labels
Suck a dick!

[Daz Dillinger]
I think they sick of me, but get rid of me - suck this dick on me
And dream about all the guns you wanna click with me
Yo this Tha Gang, we fired up like one of them thangs
And hella smokin', niggaz scared to smell the smoke, I don't care
I drink a little Moet, I feel so wet - maintainin', barely maintainin'
And think about it ain't nothin', I wanna change
And just think about it ain't nothin', what a thang
But just thank God for my life, thank him again
Cause I coulda been robbed for my life, if it coulda been
Yeah, it never was meant to be right?
A lot of these raps that I write, suck it simply
It's just a repitition of history
And some look at it like it's an unsolved mystery
I see it clear, there's a reason I'm here
If this is it this is the shit and take a hit and take a trip

[Chorus]
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Huh, I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Yeah, I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)

[Daz Dillinger]
With this life of mine, with only God by my side 'til I die
Gettin' high, wastin' time, livin' blind by the light
Gettin' by - the best way I can in this time
And it hurts to know my life ain't really mine
So I get loaded, it hurts to be sober
Drink 'til I'm slumped over, prayin' to Jehovah
Wishin' on a Nova
Then hope the dope can cope me when I'm thinkin' about my stress and -
There's nothin' against the dope when you're thinkin' about your stress and -
Yes indeed, and it hurts when it don't work to take the pain away
Then smile and scream a smoke and deal with all the pain today
Say what? - just a smile and scream a smoke to deal with all the pain today, c'mon

[Chorus]
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Huh, I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Yeah, I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)

[Daz Dillinger]
I pray to God to help me out
The game'll get me unexpectedly
Tryin' to make this money (what?!) This nigga disrespectin' me
I'll take the game out of bounds, then put the game back in check
No doubt, you can't get paid for doubt with no respect
I've seen the worst ride, I've seen the best fall down
It's unpredictable, who gon' ball now?
Today you'll probably - be the one to add the dollars
But nigga - you'll probably be broke tomorrow, ask me can you borrow
Have a understanding, we livin' here together
So you can play your part and we gon' work on somethin' better
So you can play your part and we gon' work on somethin' better
And when you do that it's Dogg Pound forever (nigga)

[Chorus]
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Huh, I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA
(Yeah, I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)

[Outro]
Yeah, now you got the key to boss 'em up on
(I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
Straight gemeni, you know what I'm sayin'?
(I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)
Motherfucker, we don't give a fuck about y'all
(Huh, I Live Every Day Like I Could Die That Day)
Yeah, straight hog on they bitch ass
(Yeah, I don't give a fuck, I'm just stuck in my way)
Straight up..</pre>
