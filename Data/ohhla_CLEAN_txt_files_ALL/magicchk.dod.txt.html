(R. Kelly, talking)
Oh! Ladies it's ya boyfriend, Kels
Do or Die, I told y'all
We lookin' for them magic chicks
The ones that can make that thing do magic tricks
We see ya in the clubs
Everywhere, around the world
Let's go

(Hook, R. Kelly)
Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick
And get off in her good
And lick that magic stick
So put your hands up high
If you're a magic chick
Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks
Wooo!

(Verse 1, N.A.R.D)
What the business? Let me holla at ya shawty
I wanna get up wit'cha blubber, and know yo name
I could spit it like I spit it, but I gotta be Chuch! (Chuch, chuch)
When I tip off and blow yo brain
I could get'cha numb, like raw cocaine
When I'm grinnin' and I'm rubbin' ya thighs, man
Can't explain how ya got me risin'
Sip a little pimp and let her get a little hypnotized
Recognize, wit' the pretty eyes, seven forty-five
When we bendin' in the raw like this
First seat, box Lexus'es
Drop down, like that's the shit
You can tell me what you really wanna tell me
In the back seat, you can lick and blow
Affiliated wit' the niggas in the cut
Tell 'em voodoo, that's what's up

(Hook, R. Kelly)
Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick
And get off in her good
And lick that magic stick
So put your hands up high
If you're a magic chick
Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks
Wooo!

(Verse 2, Belo)
Uh, all the fellas say Belo preach
And I'ma tell you what it is when the money drop
I could send to the block, or the crib
To the car, or the mall, either or
I'm finna send a pop
Did you wanna bend a corner
You like I'm hot?
She gon' recognize a pimp
Gon' get up!
Do or Die and Twi-ista
All about the fetti man
One nigga
Anyway you see me puffin' on herb
Got the Bentley sittin' on the curb
Happy people bumpin' R. Kels
Legion, so we throwin' up L's
And you can tell by the rocks n' fiends
Glocks n' things, our clique sick
Lil' ma only doin' what she doin'
Like Dave Chapelle, "I'm rich bitch!"

(Hook, R. Kelly)
Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick
And get off in her good
And lick that magic stick
So put your hands up high
If you're a magic chick
Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks
Wooo!

(Verse 3, R. Kelly)
I'm, too cool in a GT coupe
In the mid-night blue
With the magic chrome
I'm up in the club like Michael, the poor bitch
Got my game face on
Finna take this party home
Deep into the early morn'
Tryin'a make these hits
The motherfuckas
But motherfucka's won't leave me alone
Come here girl, let me holla at'cha
Throw a few of them hundreds at'cha
Slidin' down that pole like, wow
Ohh, child, gots ta hit'cha
Up in the mall, on the lo-lo girl
Lookin' for one of them solo girls
She gotta be one of them rodeo chicks
When she ride the magic stick
I just wanna be yo homie
Lover, friend, in the club to the pony
You should be famous babe
The way you "Put It On Me"
Poor radio stations around the world
They lose about to be home
Do or Die, in the middle of the Chi
Put your hands up high
And bounce ya dome

(Hook, R. Kelly)
Lookin' for that magic chick
Who wants to disappear
And get out of here, real quick
And get off in her good
And lick that magic stick
So put your hands up high
If you're a magic chick
Bounce up and down
If you can make that ass do tricks
Wooo!

We be uh (Uh-oh!)
We be all at them girls
We be uh (Uh-oh!)
When we into the club
We be uh (Uh-oh!)
To all the honeys, wassup
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels
It's Do or Die and Kels

(R. Kelly, talking)
It's ya boyfriend Kels, Do or Die
We've only just begun
Chi-Town under construction
Rock, I see ya
AK, Belo, Nard
Y'all niggas can keep bouncin'
Shit we ain't outta here
Haha, we still got magic chicks up in here
You know what they doin'</pre>
