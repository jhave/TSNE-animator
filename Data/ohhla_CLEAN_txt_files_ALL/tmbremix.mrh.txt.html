[Intro: Juelz Santana]
MC you make a nigga wanna sing baby
Dididididididi (laugh)
Yeah, Santana
Ya digg?
Dipset
Skull gang
Ay!

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana &amp; Mariah Carey]

[Juelz Santana]
I make you laugh, I make you smile, I make you blush
Just let me kiss, just let me feel, just let me touch
Then cock your legs back like a gun and make it bust
Not once, pap twice, pee times, good night
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it, just say it mama
I'll be the pool boy, I'll be the cable guy
I'll be the man next do'
Baby just let me know
I'll be the mail man, I'll lick ya envelope
There ain't no cameras up in here, baby I ain't no paparazzi
And if it is, shit, you can have the only copies
As long as you gon' make a promise, that you gon' go and watch it
Rewind it, then call me up so we can talk about it

[Mariah Carey]
I know that you've been waiting for it
I'm waiting too
In my imagination I'd be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me
Hundred and two
And boy I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof

[Hook 1: Mariah Carey]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me
When I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick
On YouTube
Cause if you run your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause they be all up in my bidness
Like a Wendy Interview
But this is private
Between you and I

[Hook 2: Mariah Carey]
Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Boy you can put me on you
Like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter
Than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me
Like a tropical breeze
And float away with you
In the Caribbean Sea

[Hook 1: Mariah Carey]
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me
When I do
If there's a camera up in here
Then I'd best not catch this flick
On YouTube
Cause if you run your mouth and brag
About this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause they be all up in my bidness
Like a Wendy Interview
But this is private
Between you and I

[Hook 2: Mariah Carey]
Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
I'm gonna treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Baby just turn to me
You won't want for nothing boy
I will give you plenty
Touch my body

[Hook 2: Mariah Carey]
Touch my body
Put me on the floor
Wrestle me around
Play with me some more
Touch my body
Throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel
Like you never did
Touch my body
Let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist
Just a little taste
Touch my body
Know you love my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah
Touch my body...</pre>
