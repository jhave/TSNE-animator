[Dr. Dre] (Snoop Dogg)
As the wheels turn city to city, hundred-spoke
Chronic smoke, twist up another Phillie (Done dilly)
(Them niggaz still trippin' off that old shit) Really? (How silly)
It's a whole nother day (Yeah it is)
Snoop Dogg (and Doc Motherfuckin' Dre) Nigga can ya feel this?
(It's the D-O-double, ya don't run up ya won't see no trouble)
If you caught up in these fuckin' streets 
(Who you gon' call when them niggaz gettin' ready to blast?)
Yeah, and if that shit's gettin' ugly
(Who you gon' call when them niggaz come to get in ya ass?)

[Snoop Dogg]
I came to get in that ass, Bigg Di-Dogg, push the big hid-ogg
You're hoppin' and poppin', how bout you hop up off my bid-alls
Got dirt on my pid-aws, I broke a few lid-aws
It really don't matter 'cause I'm only here to spit on
And get on and shit on niggaz
Do it to 'em D-O-double, right on nigga
I'm saggin' it, baggin' it, slangin' dubs
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds?
What's up cuz?

If you tryin' to get a dub sack page me
The hoes say "Dee Loc, you so crazy"
Poppin' that shit don't faze me
I need my chips and the dip, it's like gravy

[Dr. Dre]
Now back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feelin' that demand
Los Ang', broad day gunnin'
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre comin'
If this shit ain't played the party ain't bumpin'
If I don't show up the hoes ain't fuckin'
(Real talk) Cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All-Star League, you ride inventions
I handles my business, FUCK fake niggaz
I sell game a quarter million a track
Snoop and the Good Doc back with a brand-new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I'll blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Runnin' up, talkin' shit, get smashed
(Shoot first) Ask questions last

[Snoop Dogg]
Fallin' back on that ass
Hit the switch and let the ass just drag
2001, 2002 tags... My nigga what you holdin'?
Step out with the Stacey's and the Snoop Dogg Clothin'
Rollin', with the braids in my hair
Cripped out, way pimped out, oh yeah
You gots to pay the cost to be the boss
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed</pre>
