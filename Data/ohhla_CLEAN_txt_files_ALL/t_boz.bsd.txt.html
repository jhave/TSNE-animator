Uhh.. yeah..
Uhh!  Yeah..
Uhh.. yeah..
Uhh.. yeah..

	[Bass-D *singing*]
	Do you want my love?  (Not really)
	T-Boz tried to talk to me  (Well that's alright)
"Stop lying!"
	You don't have to believe me  (Do you want my love?)
	It may have been a big mistake  (Well that's alright)
	And if it was my heart will break  (Do you want my love?)
	I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me  (Well that's alright)
"Yeah I ain't bullshittin!"
	You don't have to believe me  (Do you want my love?)
	It may have been a big mistake  (Well that's alright)
	And if it was my heart will break

So have you ever heard of a group called TLC?
With hits "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg" and "Baby Baby Baby"
New Year's Day of 1992
I was chillin with the Leaders of the New
at the Fox Theater Venue
Atlanta, Georgia - where the girls don't ignore ya
Geronimo had TWO girls, and said, "This one's for ya"
The two were close related in fact sister kidren
and I was scheamin on a way to get her into bed
1992 and I was rhymin for fun
Had the thickest new style -- but no demo done
I wasn't feelin down about my past situation
I had only seen TLC, on Video Vibrations
Yes, this is just before they blew up
while I was gamin on the girl I had a chance to look up
TLC walked in for my man Yusef
Left Eye is her name cause she played me (to the left)
The girl I was with was silly, so was ..
but I was tryin to get on T-Boz any motherfuckin way
But what was I to say?  Hey sheeyit, I was a nobody
and nobody had ever heard of Count Bass-D
or TLC, but my despair turned into glee
When T-Boz pushed up and introduced herself to me
My heart went mushy, I know you don't believe me
but T-Boz, of TLC, tried to talk to me

	[Bass-D *singing*]
	Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me
"Stop lying!"
	Heh, you don't have to believe me
	It may have been a big mistake
	And if it was my heart will break
	I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me
"Yeah I ain't bullshittin!"
	You don't have to believe me
	It may have been a big mistake
	And if it was my heart will break

Huh, yeahhhh, I saw you on TV last week
'ello T-Boz, my name is Count Bass-D
I was thinkin last week, while I was watchin your video clip
than when I got rich I had to kiss your lips
That's how I wanted to step, but I had my doubts
about her findin out, about my lack of clout
I guess she saw me with the Leaders and assumed I had a record deal
but I was mesmerized with her sex appeal
Rumors ran free, that she loved Jodeci
Who gives a FUCK about K-Ci, he's just as skinny as me!
Heh, don't get me wrong at singing songs nobody's better
but +I Get Around+ like 2Pac and chain letters
But this time, I simped though, got played like a wimp though
The Pharcyde said it fly, she kept +Passin' Me By+
Not even ?Meryl Stuben? could have been more friendly
Huh, T-Boz tried to talk me yo..

	[Bass-D *singing*]
	Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me
"Stop lying!"
	You don't have to believe me
	It may have been a big mistake
	And if it was my heart will break
	I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me (word)
"Yeah I ain't bullshittin!"
	You don't have to believe me
	It may have been a big mistake
	And if it was my heart will break

Last time y'all, uhh
Females only step to niggaz once in a while
and you should react, if she seems worthwhile
T-Boz was a goddess, I'm honest, I wouldn't to lie to ya
but I procrastinated like a paper overdue
I know you're sayin, "He's just a crumb, he couldn't get none"
But T-Boz was a female who was full of sincerity
I know it sounds hard to believe
and I could give a FUCK if you believe
but T-Boz tried to talk to me

	[Bass-D *singing*]
	(Do you want my love?)
	Man really, T-Boz tried to talk to me  (Well that's alright)
"Stop lying!"
	You don't have to believe me  (Do you want my love?)
	It may have been a big mistake  (Well that's alright)
	And if it was my heart will break  (Do you want my love?)
	I'm serious, T-Boz tried to talk to me  (Well that's alright)
"Yeah I ain't bullshittin!"
	You don't have to believe me  (Do you want my love?)
	It may have been a big mistake  (Well that's alright)
	And if it was my heart will break
	Mistake..</pre>
