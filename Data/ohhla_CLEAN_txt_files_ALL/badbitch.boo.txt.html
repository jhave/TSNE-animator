C'mon I need a bad bitch
C'mon if u a bad bitch
(Shit) I want a bad bitch

[Lil Webbie] - Verse 1
The girl be cooking and cleaning and cleaning and cooking
She be constantly douching and cleaning her pussy
And when she step on the scene everybody be looking
And to get in them jeans everybody be wishing
But she only want players who far from rookie
And if you ain't got the cake
Can't play with the nookie
Her titties sitting pretty and she soft as a cushion
If you try to holla she might holla she tooken
And she walk like a bad bitch talk like a bad bitch
And go and get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
Now bad bitch go and buy fish more than average
And bad bitches get to take trips with the savage
Can never tell a bad bitch a freak she too classy
But shit I can tell from her lips that she nasty
Expensive ass pant-ses grip to them asses
She mean as a pitbull sweet like cabbage

[Chorus]
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)

[Lil Webbie] - Verse 2
Now see I can impress a bad bitch the girl gon smile
Caress the bad bitch now the girl gon wild
I'll feed it and treat it like that's my child
Then freak it up and beat it up and that's my style
You get alot of head when your bread in piles
Cuz I'm on right now and I'm saying that loud
A trifling ass bitch make the big dog growl
A bad ass bitch make the big dog proud
Which one is the baddest
That's the one I'm having
The with no kids or just one baby daddy
And she ain't hard-headed
Can listen and respect it
And you ain't a bad bitch if you got bad credit
A thong and press-ons and know how to cook neckbones
I want the MVP with that throwback dress on
Don't like to get dirty and don't mind working
And she don't mind giving me some mouth and lip service

[Chorus]
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)

Now make yourself seen
Cuz you a bad bitch
Girl you a bad bitch
Yeah you a bad bitch

Now show your ass off
Cuz you a bad bitch
Girl you a bad bitch
Yeah you a bad bitch

[Lil Webbie] - Verse 3
Man I love them bad bitches with them sexy ass tattoos
Them bad bitches with them bad bitches attitudes
She a damn a fool got a crib she'll let me camp

The kinda bitch that put a real nigga on his feet man

[Chorus - Repeat 2X]
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
