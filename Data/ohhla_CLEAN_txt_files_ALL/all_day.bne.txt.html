[Intro: Bizzy]
Ain't she bueno, mi amore
I represent a, dios, the uno 

[Bizzy Bone]
And I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this, c'mon
Baby I love you, and I was told to write this
Miss you in the worst way, I can't fight this, huh
Give me a stick or a candle so I can light this
Baby don't wanna hit it, is you chicken like Tyson?
Baby you hear me, for the moment while I'm walkin in the Garden
Madison Square, New York, New York, whatever I beg your pardon
I been lookin for you, not to be a stalker so I'm keepin my distance
I'd rather sing to you and hope that you'll listen
I'm reminiscin on the rib, how much did I give?
Keep that money honey, I can eat Ramen Noodles and live
What about the kid, ain't the children, better watch those numbers
I got on my silk clothes, I'm so prepared for the slumber

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
We go all day, all day, all day
All night, all night all night
All day, all day, all day
All night, all day all day all day all day... {*echoes*}
All day all day all day all day... {*echoes*}

[Bizzy Bone]
I hear you whiskin me away, in a brand new ride
I don't have to worry 'bout the Caeser, and the money's inside
The father tellin me to win, and I'm goin for mine
You can reject me if you wanna, it's the sign of the times
I like the {?} after the rhyme, the beef prime
Baby I don't believe you but I'm feelin you Bryon
It's all good, wanna cry, your presence steadily takin me
in the same direction, of the Father who made me
It's gettin crazy in the Garden of Eden without my lady
Baby, can't you see, that I'm yo' baby
Walkin around and I'm thinkin of you
And I feel like you cut my fuckin head off, but I know it's not true
I see you throwin up the one more and more and more and more than ever
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I can remember
I see you throwin up the one, more and more and more
Forever your love I spiritually kiss you I remember

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
All day, all day, all day
All day, all night all night
All day, all day, all day
All day, all niiiiiiight... in another life {*echoes*}
Blast on these motherfuckers!

[Bizzy Bone]
In another life, when you held me close
Said it'll be all right, and you love me so
Screamin your name and I'm feelin like you predicted it
But baby I didn't plan it but it happened little baby, didn't it?
You feelin it the love of the Father, so subsidiary never
It's the love of the people that we cherish like September
I cherish your voice, your spirit and yo' life and your breath
I feel you righteous, I feel you righteous to death
So tell Alicia, love and respect, and of course, the kid in love
I got a question what they say I've been waitin, from up above
Tryin harder everything, but you stay in my heart
I'm finna cry little baby don't even start
You better believe it, 'lieve it
All day  you better retrieve it, 'trieve it {*echoes*}

[Outro: Bizzy]
All day, all day, all day
All day, all day all day
All day, all day all day
Haha, yeah
One time for they mind, what?
One time for they mind, what?
Buck, buck buck, buck buck
One time for they mind, what?
One time, one time, one time for they mind, what?
One time, buck buck buck buck buck buck buck buck!
Brrrra, brrrra, brrrra, brrrra, brrrra, brrrra, brrrra, brrrra!
