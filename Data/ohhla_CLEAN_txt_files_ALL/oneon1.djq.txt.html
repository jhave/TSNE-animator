[Faint beginning: DJ Quik]
Just break it down
C'mon (Fuck me)
You wanna fuck? (Suck me)
You got a chip? (Thank me)
Come to daddy (Duck me)
Any type of position to be miss thang
Just lay it down...

Yeah, naw, nu uh, oh wait up
Hold up on you, you got me trippin
I could've sworn that I just had your coochie drippin
What happened to all the shit you popped in the spot?
Tell me, is this the position that you want it or not?
Is it feelin like the way that you imagined it would?
Am I tight, am I hard, is it fly, is it good?
Can I, bounce you off my leg?
Like I'm playin soccer with ya cock makin you beg
You feelin, Valentino Red that's when that's when you switch
And I'm lookin (lookin) for a 2002 bitch
Cus I'm (fly) feathered up like a cock-a-tail baby
But I'm still gangsta, got it glockin still baby
Cus I can't take chances
With ya man friends
Sockin you up in the back, where your hands be?
He aint goin crazy, he just thinking maybe
Soon as he turn his back, we be going baby

[Chorus: Talkbox]
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand
We be getting nasty
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You are so doooown, down, down...

Now I don't know what I'm gonna do about you baby
Say ya nasty, and ya freaky
You play the freak

[DJ Quik]
Last night we was drunk at the beach
You was off the E, I was off of the peach
Martini, watchin you walk around the room in yo bikini
I touched ya stomach, you got steamy
And then I bit you on the hip
Pulled your brown hair back across my chest and bit ya lip
And then I filled your belly button double whip cream
Then I licked ya clit for a hour fifteen
Who the best, baby? Let em know, baby
Valentino on ya titty, let it show baby
AKA mista Q-U-I-K
And I don't care what you do, she do what I say
Cus we share something that nobody here know
Just some up and down sex, not that weird though
In the bed, open window, by the ocean
And the Ecs got her lovin on the slowtion

[Chorus: Talkbox]
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You and me, hand in hand
We be getting nasty
You and me, One on 1
Right in front of everyone
You are so doooown, down, down...</pre>
