[Melle Mel]
In the darkness of night, huh
All the stage lights are shinin bright, hey
and we work very hard, to make you stay, RRRAAH
But it ain't no thing y'all
Cause I know that you can hang
We're not too expensive but you got, to, pay, RRRAAH

	Some say the money is the root, of all evil
	It's not the love, but lust of it, that makes men greedy, oooh
	You said, "You wanna go for a ride?  You gotta pay the fare"
	So stop!  You ain't got no money, you ain't got no beat
	Hoooooh, say you
	Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me
	And I say to you
	Can't you see baby, we don't work for free

	You know you gotta live, but shit they give you stuff for free
	Man these times are hard heyyy, ah don't nothin come easy-hee-ee-yeah
	I just got good news -- you wanna come with me
	Hey let's go uptown -- I got somethin you should see
	And my friends all say to you they say
	Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me
	And I say to you
	Can't you see baby, we don't work for free

Finance, city life
You gotta work to afford paradise, huh
But if you livin in a glass house
Don't throw no stones, rrrraah!
Slave, trade, don't get laid
You gotta get paid, if you wanna go places
where you never been before
OK baby, rrrraah!

	Where you been before, don't matter with me
	Better save your pennies nickels and dimes
	cause we don't work for free-hee-ee-yeah
