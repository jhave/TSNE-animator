[Krayzie]
This is combat - I don't think these niggaz really know
This shit is for real, this is not a game
So all my real motherfuckin thugs get the fuck up
And put ya guns in the motherfuckin air
And bust the motherfuckers like ya just don't care
And fuck the motherfuckin police
And kill all the motherfuckin enemies!

[Krayzie]
Nigga come a little closer, let me show you a ho
What's up, bitch we can roll
Anybody wanna fuck with me, cause I'm down to fuck back with you
What you wanna do, huh, huh?
You say you wanna fight us, come fight us
We do it cuz it's real fuck a title
It's all about survival, dedicated to my rivals
And you could die ho
What they talkin bout, Bone Thugs ran
Nigga we never ever run from no man
And fear none
If you see a clique of niggaz get the big gun
Pop one, spend a hun', bet the bitch run
He said he came to get some, nigga, he ain't really want none
Don't let them suckas fool ya (Nigga he ain't really want none)
Bustas won't do too much
I'll knock you out
That dumb shit comin out ya mouth'll get ya nothin but a rematch
Why these niggaz gotta lie?
They can't stand up and face the facts
Nigga your head got cracked
We heard what they said
Said that my niggaz fled
But y'all niggaz know what's up
What? Y'all wanna shed more blood?
Shit, then come on

(Chorus)
World War
World War
World War
World War (Now you know, now you know)

[Krayzie]
Nigga, bet our niggaz comin to bring the pain
Better bring ya hard hat
Nigga protect ya brain, get a gun and bang bang
Tell me when ya really wanna battle
My nigga, cuz we can handle that
Any way you wanna handle static
Nigga, thugstyle, buckwild
Some tear-up-the-club shit, whatever drop down
When the bullets get to jumpin around
The playa haters on the ground, bleedin
The 9-millimeter
Hit him and he drop like, uh!
Could it be ya life has been took?
No, not by the bullet
But the nigga with the heater
I'm trigger happy, I'll be in demand
I'm in command
So let's move, now you know what the enemy look like
The clones that look and sound like Bone
Give a motherfucka more than Speedknots
And when he run up to get punked, give a nigga lumps
Y'all niggaz ain't mobsters
Cause if this was the mob, somebody would've been shot ya
But we can get the hole out ya
Krayzie, Layzie, Bizzy, Wish, and Flesh Bone
Too strong for niggaz to hold on, to keep up
But I see ya still wanna be us
No matter who was claimin it first
It's who's the realest (realest)
Do not enlist if you not ready for war

(Chorus 3x)</pre>
