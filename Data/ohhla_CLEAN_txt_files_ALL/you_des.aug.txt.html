[Intro]
This is for the girl down the hall
Misused and abused
Yeah, yeah yeah
Pick ya head up love, smile
This is for you

[Verse 1]
Girl I know sometimes that I mistreat you, and you still come back
And I see your homegirls try to reach you, but you ain't hearing none of that
They try to get through, they say I ain't the move
I don't know, cause girl it might be true
When they tell you, you should walk away but you stay anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl I think it's best for me to say this, I ain't no good
And your heart ain't something I should play with
So let's get it understood
I ain't trying to ruin your life
If anything I just want to make it right
And tell the judge I ain't even gotta plead my case
I can tell my baby to her face

[Chorus]
I was just your nigga next door
But girl I see more for you, I see more for you
And you ain't gotta have no fear, no I'll always be here for you, girl I'm here for you
And I know you may not end up with me, it ain't gotta be me
Cause I'm still playing outchea in these streets
But I'm just saying
You deserve better, I'm saying, you deserve better

[Verse 2]
I know that love can be blind
But just open your eyes, open your eyes
Take a look in the mirror
Baby girl you a prize
And any man that don't see that you should let his ass go, believe that
Because his love ain't real
What he won't do another nigga will

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You deserve all the love, you deserve all the love
You deserve all the care, you deserve all the care
You deserve all that and more, you deserve all that and more
You deserve better, you deserve better
You deserve to laugh, you deserve to laugh
Baby you deserve to smile, baby you deserve to smile
You deserve the best of everything
You deserve better

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah yeah
You deserve better
Smile
You deserve better</pre>
