[Intro]
Deuce double-oh nine
Struggle!
Yeah, we gon' bring 'em back to reality right here man
TL, they ain't ready for it

[Verse 1]
All this time that I've been wasting
Tryina play in the world, no more wars
This tribulation got me facin the morgue
Drop down and pray to the Lord; Please forgive me for my sinny
But it's hard to maintain mayn, when ya livin how we livin
Rollin righteous for a minute, kept me hypnotized
Vicious, wicked spirits kept me feelin mystified
Struggle intensifies, as soon as them demons started scheming
Invading, they creepin, sneakin, tryina catch me sleeping
Awakened; I'm steady runnin, tryina get away
From that snake in the grass, I ain't escapin too fast
I got a whole lotta playa haters, hatin my shine
I don't know why, suckers keep hatin my grind (My grind-grind)
But they can never stop a nigga risin (Risin)
I'm a real (real) ill (ill) rider (Rider, rider)
Living truth, I'm a true ghetto survivor ('vivor)
Ghetto survivor ('vivor)

(Hook)
See, life is a lesson to learn
You gotta know which way to turn
You protecting yourself, or burn?
See, I can be the nigga to teach you
Stay away from the fire, it burn
But you don't wanna listen to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn

(Verse 2)
Everybody wanna live the rich life
Gamblin they souls, they so gone off of this life
Truely they dont know
Cause they so zoned from the big lights
And fancy cars, Big mansions, stars, no chance at alllll
And maybe lose a little bit integrity to gain-
The finer thangs, like shiny rings, and diamond chains
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Get out that slave mentality, mayn!
If it's vain, he gots to be vein
They hear it on the radio (Radio-radio)
And then they see it in the video (Video-video)
Then they say "This must be the way to go!" (Go)
And then they always do the typical
Get caught up in the race, often chasin the devil
It usually is a waste, let me put you on the level; rebel
Against the world and it's crooked, wicked ways
Resist the world; only way you can be saved

(Hook)
See, life is a lesson to learn
You gotta know which way to turn
You protecting yourself, or burn?
See, I can be the nigga to teach you
Stay away from the fire, it burn
But you don't wanna listen to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn

(Verse 3)
Times are changin, the vibe is crazy
The crime is raising, so the nines keep blazin
Nations can't save us and everybodies anxious
Death is contagious, but can't nobody escape here
We was born in danger
You'd see a clearer picture, if you knew where I came from
And I've been in ghettos all over the world, it's the same song
They stressed out and fed up
These oppressors won't let up, they just keep holdin me down
But I'ma rise up and make it to the real light
Can't wait to see, just wonderful, it feel like
So lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely-lovely (Seeee)
I can be the nigga to teach you
Cause you know that it take a real nigga to reach you
And to a better life, this advice could lead you
To tell them politicians that we no longer need you, you're see-through

(Hook)
See, life is a lesson to learn
You gotta know which way to turn
You protecting yourself, or burn?
See, I can be the nigga to teach you
Stay away from the fire, it burn
But you don't wanna listen to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn
See, life is a lesson to learn

(Outro)
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Say it, Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way
Life is a lesson, you learn the hard way</pre>
