Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't control yourself
This your life you own it, said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is this moment so who's coming, don't control yourself
This your life you own it, said you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment
so who's coming, don't control yourself

All I got is a dream come true, everybody wonder what we gonn' do
Drink in the red cup, pre roll ten blunts, when I go to sleep I don't think Imma get up
Stay in bed till the afternoon, cause you know what us rappers do, get high, get drunk
Then find some butt, girl, I wanna chase after you
Lets live it up, live it up, party like we ain't got shit to do
I don't give a fuck, give a fuck, nothin but cuttin up with the crew
My parents out of town so we gonn' put it down
We takin shots, who can go another round?

Don't control yourself
This your life you own it,said you own it
So live it up. All that matters is this moment so who's
coming, don't control yourself
This your life you own it, said you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment
so who's coming, don't control yourself

Hey, I wake and shit, the first thing Imma do is take a hit
Tonights gonna be great, lets get a little drink, I'm trying to get wasted bitch
Its gonna be something to remember, too bad we wont, wont
and its gonna get hot in here so, don't bring your coat, coat
Take your clothes off, we gonna get crazy
She's sorta fine, just borderline, but tonight she's gonna be my lady!
My parents out of town so we gonn' put it down
We takin' shots, who can go another round?

Don't control yourself
This your life you own it,said you own it
So live it up
All that matters is this moment so who's coming, don't control yourself
This your life you own it, said you own it
So live it up, all that matters is this moment
so who's coming, don't control yourself</pre>
