[Lil Wayne]
Eagle, eagle carter man
In a 96 regal contravan
On my way to the east to the laundromat
Gotta wash that money and get on my ass
Gotta flip them bricks it be gone so fast
I got to do something I done blown my last
Holla holla at ya boy I be on the ave
In dat g pricko is what I am known to have
Shit tend to be slow I put on a mask
And make it halloween and take all your bags
I say hallie hallie hallie why don't you go on and stab
And Make these motherfuckers understand
Look coach you pitchin' at me under hand
But I am a designated hitter I adjust so fast
Ya men designing women I am a one woman's man
I'm the cash money prince blow the trumpet man
They say they want the drugs to stop
But I am a major step back when my album drop
I got dat wet crack flow out ya mami's pot
I got dat I got dat jet black four at ya mami's spot
I am trying to get dat dough I demand it now
You panic now, you betta pan it down
For the neighbors be over here tearing it down
This is Weezy F. baby I am crowned the prince

[hook - repeat 2X]
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne,
This is me on my own, let's get it on

[Lil Wayne]
And the hand gun is so included
Don't get it confused I want no confusion
And keep ya hoe I don't want your contagious
I make my hoes stop and let the dough keep moving
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
Its money over bitches that I'm keep on provin'
Its weezy f. I got ya momma cruisin'
Outta all the hot boyz she say I am the coolest
I brought my bag of oranges, its time to juice it
This game is a bitch and I'm try to seduce
I floss awful lot and haters tryin' to reduce it
Put the laser on the 45 iron, stupid
One shot to remind who is the fly lil nigga dat's behind da trigger
I am all chronic combined with liquor
You will never see me like momma tigger
An eighty's baby a fightin' nigga, I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
I am something you call pepper like a viking snake
See me over the viking stove I am lighting bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out, I'm tighting clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting spliffs (I do this)
You catching my drift representing with my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince

[hook - repeat 2X]
This is my town, my home 
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own, let's get it on

[Lil Wayne]
So roll the carpet out, cause you fuckin' with a nigga from the royal south
See you are either in or you are out 
And if you out stay in 'cause  them warriors are out
Because those vultures, cops, and those lawyers are out
So I just open up the gate and let my holliers out
No nigga I neva call your house I am probably some where taking Toya out
Not answer my phone and ignoring your spouse
She leavin' messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey, I am ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name, naw better yet point him out
Me and the streets got a joint account
I am from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans, wodie put the gat in your mouth
And if we feed you with a lot of iron it will flatten you out
A few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never telling one another leave dat in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packing out
If I ever run into some trouble send my savages out
These niggaz talking sweet I will get dem cavities out
I got graveyard flowers man I am passing them out
Hey bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now
I am the prince

[hook - repeat 2X]
This is my town, my home
This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own, let's get it on</pre>
