[ VERSE 1 ]
This is Lyte, and I'm just here to say
That I choose to express my feelings this way
Always alone, either with a microphone
Or just plainly emphasize the tone
Of my voice, cause yo, I know I'm your choice
So when I am speaking, show your gratitude
While I am teaching, I have no attitude
I'm just here to get the job totally done
85% work, 15% fun
Sometimes I admit, I get so excited
Rhyme for rhyme, I just can't fight it
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistant

	(Big girls don't cry)	(2x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Can't stop the flow, it's just too persistant
The level is extremely low on my resistance
By you or any other I'll never be beaten at a
Rap meeting, in other words a battle
Cause y'all, I'm like a farmer, and y'all's the cattle
Be a big girl about it, don't you start cryin
That'll mean I made you weep without even tryin
Lyte takes it like a big girl, I'm no jive girl
Comin direct, tellin you that I'm a live girl
'I'm positive', you've heard this expression before
So next time you see Lyte shine through the door
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl

	(Big girls don't cry) 	(2x)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Don't talk behind my back, confront me like a big girl
So I can take you to all slimmies of the world
Big girls, we don't fight over men
Although there's one worth fighting for every now and then
But then I think again, it's not worth my while
And it's also not a big girl style
And I know you're thinkin: 'Wait, Lyte is slim and short?'
While being brought up I was also taught
Take it like it comes and proceed with the flow
Lyte is the biggest of the big girls, and now you know

	(Big girls don't cry)	(2x)

This is dedicated to Milk Dee from the Audio 2
To Gizmo from the Audio 2
The whole Alliance crew
You know what I'm sayin?
And to all the big girls
Also the small girls
You got time to grow up to be big girls

	(Big girls don't cry)
