Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh, Sneak peek through the window pane
Girls all aboard, this Young Money train
Ever since fame
Shit'll never be the same
The world want a show
So I'm a be the stage
Dim the lights
Listen to what I'm gone say
Gotta fan base nigga
Fuck what a hater say
They sleep all day
I'm up early doe
Scrollin through the phone
I'm watchin videos
Not much competition doe
I mean of course, it's just the same ol'
Bitches in plain clothes
Playing the same roles
Rentals of Lambos
Bend over bitch
Getting one
You know how game goes
Shame on all these models
But I'm a still buy all these bottles
Got a lot to learn young man
Life is your only friend
One day you'll understand
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi'
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
SaidI'm moving too fast
They say I'm moving too fast
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite
Baby you could spend the night
Say you moving too fast
Said I'm moving too fast
Y'all be gossiping more than the barber shop
Walked up in the shop
Everybody looking shocked
Why all the talking stopped?
Maybe, cause I was the one being talked about
Looking at your face
I can tell you don't know what this money 'bout
Four accounts, can't bounce
Nigga, check the amount
I took a pill getting drowsy now
Gotta finish this verse, can't write it down
Early flight, now I'm out of town
Freaking out, all I see is clouds
Hawaii looking nice man
Why every time I leave L.A. it's an earthquake?
Why every time I leave home, bitches thirsty?
Saying she be with a nigga all night
Telling her friends that "I'm the only girl that he like"
You gotta lot to learn young man
To all your loyal fans, I hope they understand
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi'
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
Say I'm moving too fast
They say I'm moving too fast
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite
Baby you could spend the night
Say you moving too fast
Said I'm moving too fast
If I ever get the chance to say 'Hi'
Prolly wave good-bye at the same time
Say I'm moving too fast
They say I'm moving too fast
Couple good drinks Patron with the ice
Come to my suite
Baby you could spend the night
Say you moving too fast
Said I'm moving too fast</pre>
