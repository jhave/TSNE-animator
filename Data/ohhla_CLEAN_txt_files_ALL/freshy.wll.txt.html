[Verse: Will.I.Am]
Fly kicks, fly wear, fly gear, fly chair
Fly swag, fly bag, fly niggas that ain't fly shit
Your chick, she know, for real, she know
Can't tell motherfucker, I won't go, icy, stay cold
This car right here I made, I made
I am, I am, I stay paid
You didn't know? Now you do
Motherfucker like me stay cool
Iglu, iglu, iglu, cool
Big willy, stay chilly
My money so funny is silly
Look at you, look at me
Look at these, nigga please
What's this in my pocket?
This not if I lie
Big dollar, big dollar, paper guap

[Chorus: Will.I.Am]
What's that? Oh, this?
Freshy, freshy
Freshy, freshy, yep
What's that? Oh, this?
This here?
Freshy, freshy
Come and look at this, nigga only here with

[Verse: Juicy J]
High price my cloth, overprice my hoes
New hoes, no fisc,
Make account, lot of chips
Get brain your bitch
She loves lot of cash
Going broke ain't an option
If I want it I'mma have it
Hundred K, that's nothing
Everybody talking money
Talking chips, that's done
Start the car, push button
Get trippy, pop pills
White girls, snow cold
I do it for the cash, for the drugs, not a ho
Nigga safe when I swear past
Get a bad bitch with a burkon bag
With a drug habbit, just roll the hash
In the strip club throwing cash
In here trapped out, money machine go beep
In here racked out, counting bands off in my sleep

[Chorus]

[Verse: Will.I.Am]
Hot wheels be hot
May what? Maybach
Bu what? Bugatti
Masa who? Masserati
My chick got body
It shakes like jelly
Big tit, big booty, no belly
Big tit, big booty, no belly
My swag, my style, supreme, don't
So slip, so fresh, so clean, so
My boat, my plane, no more cocaine
Uh-uh, don't sniff, that nigga idea is deep
My brain, I'm smart
This nigga right here gonna start
Big bands, big bands, gonna do it big like roll this
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey Mouse
Montaga big ol' house, no niggas sleeping on my couch

[Bridge: Will.I.Am]
What's that? Oh, this?
Freshy, freshy
Lambo, Lambo, Lamborgini
What's that? Oh, this?
Flush it, flush it
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci, Louis

[Verse: Will.I.Am]
Vuiton, Christian, Louis Vuiton, red bottom
All colors, all types I got 'em
I study, I bought them
I rock, I wear, that shit you won
Peace on, peace on, peace on Laurent
Your style be old, play out baggy
My style new shit, way out swaying
Freshy, yep, expensive, yep
I'mma buy me a jumbo jet
Least set to the New York jets
Balling, balling, balling big
Shot calling, shot calling, shot calling, yeah

[Bridge &amp; Chorus]</pre>
