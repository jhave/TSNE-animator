[Verse 1]
If you ever started hating me, how would you act?
Like you never fuckin knew me and you ain't got my back
If you ever started hating me, what would you do?
Try and stab me in the back when I'm just passin through
If you ever started hating me, fuck it that's it
Let it be known that you're a hater and you're just full of shit
If you ever started hating me, then catch your stone
Underground is better livin then your mainstream home
If you ever started hating me, then take it to the streets
Detroit, Eastside 7 mile is where we'll meet
If you ever started hating me, then watch your back
You'd be surprised what hood rats would do for crack
If you ever started hating me, then keep your distance
Why the fuck would you want to be up in my business?
If you ever started hating me, it's not my fault
You just probably never liked me from the start mother fucker

[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncaninly?

[Verse 2]
If you ever started hating me, then don't come around
Cuz I don't think you're gonna like it if I'm beatin you down
Pistol whippin mother fuckers for the shit that they say
Like my names the only reason that I act this way
If you ever started hating me, then hold your breath
Cuz it just might be the last thing that you have left
Grabbin on to your life movin closer to death
Cuz juggalos are gettin fed up with the shit that you spread
If you ever started hating me, then bitch fuck you
If it's that way mother fucker then I hate you too
Tell your family eat a dick I hope they whole crew dies
And they never fuckin make it up to Shangri-La
If you ever started hating me, then rest in peace
Cuz all the enemies I have are pretty much deceased
Dedicated to the dark cuz their soul was never wanted
So now I pray that their afterlife is fuckin hard

[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncaninly?

[Verse 3]
I can't help what I feel when I write so I'ma tell it
And I hope to all the haters that this shit is spreadin
The only reason there's haters is cuz they feel left out
No life, no home cuz juggalos shut 'em out
So now they hide behind computers actin hard when they soft
I swear to god I hope they're fingers fall off
I can't stand em, to tell the truth I just don't need them around
So when I see ya I'ma teach ya how to get smacked down
If you ever started hating me, just fall off the earth
Because the soul your body carries really has no worth
Understand the situation homie hate me or not
Or it's the ? that you hate that's why your stomache's in knots
Always feeling left out cuz you don't fit in
So now you spread around this hate and still act like a friend
But time will only tell how much your hatred grows
That's why we always screamin fuck a juggaho

[Hook]
I say fuck you! and offer no apologies
For my mythologies I be just how I be
And I be wicked too, so fuck your family
If they damin' me, and don't try bannin' me
This hatchet fam insanity, how can it be uncannily?</pre>
