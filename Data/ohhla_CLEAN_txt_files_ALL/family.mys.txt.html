Verse 1: Mystikal &amp; Female singer

I heat up the way coffee be
Tasty like pastry
Got mo' flavors than parsely
With 9 aunties and 2 uncles
I got a lot of cousins, so watch how you talk to me
Good ol' places, good ol' times, doing good ol' thangs
That was just the good ol' days,
most of my people still look the same
All though we deep in the numbers,
Our feelings is close as the lotto ya heard me
We originated in Louisiana way back in the 1930's
On the farm in the son of mister and misses Joyner and Mary Tyler
Hooked up with they daughter,
Daughter Josephine the difference do you know what I mean
She was on the cotton field
He was on the farm where the cows get killed
Then they moved off the plantation
Then ??? came in a few mo' years
First came Rosa Lee, then Lord June Bug, then Anna Lee
Then Louise and Alberta, then my mama came who they call Marie
Without a breather, um, here come Mary Alice, and Linda
Po' Grandma stayed bare foot, pregnant, and always baring
Don't worry be happy, whatever we got we was glad that we had it
After that, here come the last three, (Who was?)
Loyce, Alan, and Kathy

Chorus: Mystikal &amp; Female singer

Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from here)
Tell me where you from round? (I'm from right chere)

Where's ya family?, mighty family (from right chere)

Verse 3: Mystikal

Now that you know about my family ties, 
and my family history, and my family size
I done took ya back five generations and broke it down for ya,
Now haven't I?
From greatgrandparents to grandparents,
Mama's and daddy's and Uncle's and Aunties
To all of my in-law'es, nana's pa raisers and nephews and niece's
From moma's and papa's, stomach still growing so the number increases
From sisters and brothers, baby daddy's, 
baby mama's, branch cousins and play cousins
So watch how you look at me,
You never know who I'm kind to when you pasting
If you ain't in ya own back yard 
better be careful coz we just might ax ya
