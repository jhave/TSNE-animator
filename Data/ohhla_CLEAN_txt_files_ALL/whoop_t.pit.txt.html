Typed by: AZ Lyrics

So I heard this out in LA man
This whole thing about a 'Whoop-T-Whoop'
That means when you talkin' to a girl
Talkin bout all the things you gon' do to her
When you get to the room
Lasts like two minutes

I want you
I need you
Gotta have you
Have you

I want you
I need you
Gotta have you
Now let me tell me what I wanna do to you

I wanna touch ya
Kiss ya
Freak ya
Fuck you
Lick you
Tease you
Please you
Suck you

I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come

But she said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"
She said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"
She said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"
She said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
I wanna take it from the club to the room, from the room to the tub, dow-down to the floor
I wanna hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, ti-till y-you explode
Baby don't you know that you're dealing with a cer-cer-cer-cer-certified pro
And I love it when you rub it when you play wit' yourself
I'm a nympho and I love baby there's nothin' else
So, ichi, ni, san, shi
That's me, plus three
Voule-vous couchez avec mois? "Oui oui."

I wanna touch ya
Kiss ya
Freak ya
Fuck you
Lick you
Tease you
Please you
Suck you

I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come
I wanna make you come

But she said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"
She said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"
She said - "Save that Whoop-T-Whoop, I ain't tryna hear that Whoop-T-Whoop"</pre>
