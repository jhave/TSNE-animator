[Intro: U-God]
Forgive me..
For all that shit I did in my past..
You know what I'm sayin'...

[U-God]
Is anyone out there? Does anyone care?
This is my testament, my bedtime prayer
I resent my sins, oh Lord, listen clear
I can feel it in the heat of the night, and in the air
Lord, give me your ear, I want you, to understand
Please forgive me, I'm a righteous man
Tryin' to do the best I can, just to feed my fam
I might die, in these streets, by some jealous hands
Now I can it's some scam, from the root to the fruit
Cuz when they see me in the streets, grimey's guns salute
Me, it's the moment of truth, I got mud on my boots
Plus the sounds of the sirens, cops in hot pursuit
Pray for me..

[Chorus 2X: Autumn Rue]
As I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord, the soul to keep
If I die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, the soul to take

[U-God]
All this pressure, building up in the pot
When the schemes released, I'm bout to blow my top
I'm the cream of the crop, when machine guns pop
I seen the death angel come when I see son drop
I cried, tattoo tear drops, cuz inside it hurt
I saw his life flash before him, as he lied in the dirt
And searched for heaven on earth, in his debts, sold in land
I poisoned my own community, with kilos and grams
And people don't take a stand, politics tempers flare
They build, prisons 'stead of parks, children end up in there
It's the welfare, the precinct, the daycare's, indecent
The churches, the priest, inside the belly of the beast
It's, diseases, crack babies, people actin' crazy
Oh Lord, can you save me? If not, snatch up my baby
Ohhh..

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
