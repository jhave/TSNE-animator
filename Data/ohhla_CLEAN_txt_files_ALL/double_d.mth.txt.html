[Redman]
Oh here they come with the ruckus of the drunk
Funk doc (Meth-Tical) the veterans of medicine
Natural fruit juices, that alcohol beverage

[Method Man]
Come to get it on with that crooked ass veteran
Introduction you to this new special brew
Natural fruit juicin, alcohol double duecin
Take what the truth is, that rhyme through your toothless

[Redman (Method Man)]
Hey yo what are you a doofus? (Actin like you ruthless)
Guzzle that St. Ides, Superman flies through the skies
I'm crooked, leavin y'all chinky eyed
In case you were lookin
Ghetto natural now represent
I flip the script if you ain't
Hike up my guns and malt liquor
Drink it down to the sticker
If you can't finish it quicker

[Method Man]
Pineapple, coconut, lemon lime fashion
Mixed fruit, put it on ice and it be smashin</pre>
