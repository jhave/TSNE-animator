[ CHORUS: KRS-One ]
Schoolly D, Schoolly D, Schoolly D, Schoolly D
Original Gangster in the house, Schoolly D
Never in your life try to test Schoolly D		(4x)

[ VERSE 1: Scholly D ]
How many times must a brother in America
That I figure, have to pull on the trigger
To prove to the world that he is a man
That's one thing I can never understand
Cause you'se a fluke and a coward and a faggot
You know suckers like you are on the wagon
Schoolly-School, and I'm standin on top
Make it known that I'll never, never, never be stopped
There ain't a brother in the place any tougher
There ain't a sucker in the house any rougher
So tell me why that you wanna be a prankster?
There's only one Original Gangster

(So hot, so hot, so hot, so hot...)

[ VERSE 2: Scholly D ]
Schoolly-School, and I'm on it like a doctor
That is how that you know that I locked ya
And if you can't understand the reality
Of a young blackman mentality
Cheeba, cheeba, and your hand'll keep tokin
Like a Uzi you know that I'm smokin
I keep ya dancin, to the rhythm
That's what Schoolly-School likes to give them
And then I greet ya, like a skeezer
I beat ya down like a sucker, then I please ya
So tell me why that you wanna be a prankster?
There's only one Original Gangster

[ CHORUS: KRS-One ]

[ VERSE 3: Scholly D ]
So what that your record went platinum?
I'm the brother that you know that is slappin em
And then you tell all those suckers you a gangsta
Well, I'd say you ain't nothin but a prankster
And if you think that you gonna keep foolin em
I'm the brother that you know that is schoolin em
And then you gonna get killed by the Uzi
I think of all the times that you are a dewsey
So tell me why that you wanna be a prankster?
There's only one Original Gangster

[ CHORUS: KRS-One ]

(So hot, so hot, so hot, so hot...)
