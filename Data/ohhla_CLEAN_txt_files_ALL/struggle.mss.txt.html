[Grand Puba]
Yeah, Missy Elliott, Grand Puba

[Missy Elliott]
Y'all don't really know who I am, God damn
I'm like grease in the frying pan cause I am
bacon, eggs, toast, butter
Smooth sexy lover more FRESH than {?}
Go ask your brother if y'all don't believe
I control the industry cause Missy in the lead
{*scratching*} Uhh, I'm talkin to you man
With my upper hand, the fans call me Dapper Dan
When I was young my pops, throw rocks
Always shit talk to my moms and call the cops
Couldn't wait 'til I was nice and grown
Sick of daddy mouth 'til six in the morn'
On and on and on 'til the record scratch
And if I made a few scraps I would never come back (YES!)
Take moms with me and a few ADAT's
And make a song about dad and tell pops he's a rat (YES!)
Oah-KAYYYYY!

[scratched] hold up

[Chorus 2X: Missy Elliott]
Y'all don't really know my life
Y'all don't really know my struggles and how much liquor I guzzle (YES!)
Y'all don't really know my fears
And how many years to get here but I'm ready to rumble

[Grand Puba]
Yeah, I be that throwback cat, I throwback 'gnac
I spit hot raps, then I check my traps
Pockets stop the bulk, green up like the Hulk
Ram up in somethin like that nigga Marshall Faulk
I'm a low key nigga, a O.G. nigga
Entertain my guests in "The Basement" like Tigger
Grand Puba and the name ring bells
And if it ain't about paper I don't waste my sells
So the new school new school need to learn yo
I burn baby burn like a Hunt's Pointe ho

[Missy Elliott]
Yo yo Puba, hold up
Let's take 'em back on some "411" shit
MA-RYYYY!

{*beat changes*}

[Mary J. Blige]
I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
I'm known around the map to always make a comeback
I went through some struggles fightin with my ex-lovers
Stayed in lots of trouble, blessings then I had recovered
Had to pay them bills, the places I lived
Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give
I had to tell them back up cause I was quick to smack 'em up
I didn't give a WHAT, Mary J. would act up

[Chorus: Missy] + (Mary)
Y'all don't really know my struggles
(I had two or three jobs I had to juggle)
And all them liquor shots from the pain I covered
(Strugglin from the break-ups with my lover)
(Y'all don't know the half) Don't know the half
(I'm better off now that was in the past)
I had to take the good stuff with the bad
Now I'm (thankful for the little things that I have)

[scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
[scratched] Grand Puba, and the name ring bells
[scratched] I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
[scratched] Grand Puba, and the name ring bells</pre>
