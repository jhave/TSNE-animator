Gorilla! Ha ha {*repeat 3X*}
Ha ha! P, P
Yeah, Monsoon

You motherfuckers fake (fake), go 'head fucker hate (hate)
I smack planes off the building, I'm a fucking ape (ape)
My last LP (P!) I wore a fucking cape
Your last LP (huh?) You wore a fucking.. wait
It never dropped (dropped) you was never hot (hot)
{*scratched and repeated beyond comprehension*}
I'm so ready ready, I was {*scratched*}
I made a small fortune {*scratched and repeated*}

Gorilla! Ha ha

You motherfuckers fake (fake), go 'head fucker hate (hate)
I smack planes off the building, I'm a fucking ape (ape)
My last LP (P!) I wore a fucking cape
Your last LP (huh?) You wore a fucking.. wait
It never dropped (dropped) you was never hot (hot)
Me and Rock ready, but they ain't ready Rock
I sold readyrock - I was small time
I made a small fortune, but it was all mine
I got booted from Judah, from Aruba to Cuba
Came home, spent the rest of my loot on some Supras
I wrote another rap (rap) I bought another pack (pack)
They both did well, I doubled up my stack
I'm fuckin up the rap (rap) but I don't give a fuck (fuck)
Future fanmail like "Yo, why'd you do it Ruck?"
I should smack this nigga (smack him) with a lead pipe (bing~!)
But Diesel told me (nah) go get your sket mic

Go get your sket mic {*4X*}
You see that red light? 'Bout to be dead right?
It got you sayin D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-DAMN
