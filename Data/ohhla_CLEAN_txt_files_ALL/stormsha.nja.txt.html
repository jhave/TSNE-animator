[Lone Ninja]
Stormshadow the hunter bombs rattle the bunker 
swarm castle there's long battles in tundra 
The savage will hunger for a feast to enjoy
Ravage and plunder seek and destroy		
The killer draws near you dread vague image
Guerilla warfare you fled plaqued village	
The rifle's equipped with the scope I strike 
With a vicious assault the slicer is slitting your throat 
Rapid fire clash with the assassin
For hire, I'll bash until you bastards expire	
I have to admire and touch majestic thrones
The hatchets of dire will cut through flesh and bone	
The eye is blind Where the mind is absent
I'm behind the shrine I'm deguised and rampant 	
Defy entrapment smoke screens appear
Heist with bandits foes scream in fear		
Still waters run deep the look is deceiving
Kill, slaughter, hunt, creep you're butchered and bleeding	
The mugger's besieging with the rampaging mob
You suffer and grieving It's a sad day you sob		
Raid with arms foes prepare to die
You may get harmed yo nowhere to hide		
You fear demise I subdued your squadron
Beware the knives I am rude and rotten		
Bang with the cornershot I open pandora's box
Your man's a goner he saw my hands on the glock	
Can't hang you ought to stop none could surpass
Suckers get bashed I hover then I cut and then slash	
Bear the blunt of wrath I captured an enemy flag
Never wanted  to clash I'll bash ya then merrily brag	
I swing the soul blade you'll visit the mausoleum
My ring of foes slayed in the pits of the colosseum	  	

		
[Lone Ninja]
Creep silently I move past the palace guards
Beat violently my dual axe will damage squads 		
It's rather odd that you would challenge the technique
Your daggers dodged I slew and battered your best fleet	
Man your battle station hold a grudge and fury
Slam the gavel blatant lone's the judge and jury		
Sniper's telescopic sight clever smart precise
Sever harsh I'm terror's darkest night		
Embed a toxic fright in the pit of your soul
The wizard arose you froze in the shivering cold		
Your whimpering woes will fall on deaf ears
Injuring foes you oaughta get scared					
Bring horror and fear with cruel intentions
And fueled resentment I slew your henchman					
I use the weapons of mass destruction
You'll catch concussion you bastards done in					
Slash and cutting bullies get flipped
Blast like gunmen I'm fully equipped					
The lunar eclipse was a sign and omen
I rule the aybss under sky and ocean					
Spy for shogun the ninja sabotage
I hid in camouflage and give you battle scars				
The super soldier severs I'm somber and grim
Lose composure never I'm calm as the wind
