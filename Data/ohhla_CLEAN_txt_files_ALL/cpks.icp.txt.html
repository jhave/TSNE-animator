[Verse - Violent J]
I walked into the church, dressed up as an altar boy
I seen a preacha, he said "little boy I'mma teach ya"
Put his hand up on my shoulder, felt the claw of the beast
I never thought it'd be so fuckin' easy murderin' a priest
We went into the confession booth, he took off his clothes
And cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose
I jammed a butcher's knife, 12 inches into his gut
He looked me right into my eyes while I was yankin' it up
Preacha killas.

[Hook]
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas

[Verse - Shaggy 2 Dope]
I walked into the sermen, strapped with an iron crowbar
I beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunk of my car
How the fuck she got fake titties and a pussy ring? bullshit!
She sucked the preacher dick in the pulpit
I know the goin's-on, I've witnessed it while pushin' my mop
And blood gushin' no stop when my hatchet go chop
I ain't no fuckin' holy rolla, I'm outta controlla
Face painted, fuckin' preacha killas gone off that yola.

[Hook]
Crooked preacha killas (cola!)
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas

[Verse - Violent J]
We shootin' for the preacha, fuck I missed and hit the reverend
But it doesn't matter though, they say he's goin' to Heaven

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And then I for the preacha, I blew his ear off
We in the balcony bustin', gone off PCP and Smirnoff

[Violent J]
Shot again, I missed and hit somebody in the choir
They fell back into the candle rack and caught the place on fire

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I shot again, I finally caught the preacha in his dome

[Both]
Then we put our barrels to each other's heads and took it hoome.

[Hook]
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas (leave the fuckin' kids alone!)

Crooked preacha killas (faggots!)
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)
Crooked preacha killas (stop it!)
Crooked preacha killas (I gotta bloody him up!)

Hell...is a real place
Hell!
He-He-HELL!
Hell!
Hell!
Hell!</pre>
