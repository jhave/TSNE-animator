Typed by: UGRLS Webmaster

I vibe just to get away
I get in late my boss about to detonate
Trying to escape the mind numbing nine to five
Link up with dread for lunch trying to cop a dime

People walk in while I'm rhyming in the bathroom
Although I know I've got to be back soon
Sometimes "Sleep Time" in the bathroom
While music making me float
While I'm making dough - you know - you know - you know

[Chorus]
So I just lets it blast
Music in the morning
Wish I could relax in the cut just to count the cash - but I need this money
But I'm dream dreaming of the weekend
Music in the evening
Still I got to get up get up
Damn I need this money
Whistle while you work
Got to get me some hay
Got to get through the day
While the sun shines on me
Got to make this money

Rise and shine you hustle in the morning
Got to get dough from bums to those balling!
And it's about cash but still you ain't feeling that
Whether a nine to five cat or a stealing rat
You've gotta do the do just to move on
Serving as a waiter - you need to groove on
It's your only hope, it's better than doing coke
I go through my mind and start hearing quarter notes

[Chorus]
I'm really trying to get this dough here
Damn this sh!? Aint funny
But my 9-5 is going nowhere
Got to get this money
Whistle while you work
Got to get me some hay
Got to get through the day
While the sun shines on me
Got to make this money

This one goes out to y'all sweating on the grind!
Doing overtime - money on your mind
Edgy as a squirrel looking out for a nut
You get up to sit down taking orders quick
Working 9-5 got a brother instant messaging!
I watch the clock tic toc while I'm banging hip-hop 'til my shift stop
Ahhh shucks - break's up! Whattup now?!
Turn the volume up and look busy 'til it's time to punch out

[Chorus]
C'mon y'all get on this paper route
Let's all get this money
Wish a brother could just cut and just wild out
All I need is music
Bangin up in the AM, baningin up in the night time
Music in the evening
Still I think I'm going out of my mind trying to get right
Damn I need this money
Whistle while you work
Got to get me some hay
Got to get through the day
While the sun shines on me
Got to make this money</pre>
