Bounce, c'mon (8x)

[Chorus - 2x]
ROCK, we're the heaviest
STOP, or you're gonna get
CAUGHT, cause we never rest, drop this on ya
We're the heaviest, you would never wanna
Talk shit cause we come back to haunt ya

[Verse 1: Moka Only]
I rock heavy like a 70's icon
Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven, my mind's gone
Even though I only did acid twice
My rap's a vice; your head's in it ask the price
For you to be released and me to be happy
With all of your suffering I'm brutally crafty
Coming up with the best selections
To get inside of you like I'm a chest infection
Your best protection is to get down and drown
Remember that the Members don't clown around
I'm found downtown with rolls of cash
My passion is smashing you disposable cats I'm old fashion
With swift abilities to lift and drop
And ambulant skill plus whip and chop
I dump on a chump and punk ya assoc ass
I'm done with rap, now I'm prepared to cash in

[Chorus  2x]

[Verse 2: Madchild]
Ayo, I'm kick ass thick as a brick you bitch ass
Quick on the draw I come equipped with a pick axe
Rock solid, you cock-a-holics, I'm not gon frolic any longer
Cause my crew's much stronger
Donkey Kong stomp, Pac-Man chomp
Attacking competition I'm back in my position
Pop off with the must stop opposition
You have to listen cause mad division of beauty and grace
See what I do to your face, might be me, might be my friends
I might need an alibi it all depends
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like it, suck this
I'm a small giant, that's trying, dying to find success
You look upset stupid fuckhead
I'm locked, stocked, and loaded the most devoted
I'm a keep bringing the pain 'til your brains exploded
I'm motivated, voted and rated as one of the greatest
One of the most loved and hated and still haven't made it
Ya know

[Chorus  2x]

[Verse 3: Prevail]
I'm addicted to speed but not the drug
I lead by example my breed can hunt
Seen enough mayhem, step into the A.M
Weapons of contention for any given occasion
I attack with Battleaxe Warriors from the armory
Some of us kill you mentally; some of us hurt you vitally (Heavy)
A miracle of modern science
With the naturally passionate carnivorous diet (Heavy)
We're an anomaly, not a novelty
Enter at your own risk, private property
Do not trespass beware of dogs
Bear traps, alarms, and a right to bare arms
Where laws ain't applied my jaws homicide
The water ain't safe whoever said it was lied

[Chorus]</pre>
