[Hook]
Yeah these niggaz think I'm tripping, like I ain't on my game
Since I made it for the hood, niggaz looking at me strange
But I don't pay attention, till they get inside my range
And when they see them thangs, then they know ain't nothing changed
They know it's A.B.N., from the diamonds on my chain
Swanging on 4's, with them diamonds in my ring
Now I got these niggaz hating, cause they know I got the fame
Yeah nigga I'm the shit, Go on and put that on your brain

[Trae]
I'm ten seconds, from hopping out that mini-van
Haunted on something heavy, and sell to come cancel a couple minute plans
Try me nigga, I'll be the first to show you ain't nothing changed
Niggaz see the fame, and they think I won't take it to they brain
Don't let the fact that I got money, determine a thang
Homie I'm the same, inside these streets I'm a permanent lane
I'm still in the hood, black whip black vest
Black ice eighty grand, with a couple black ticks
They wanna hate me, I'm gon help em to hate me today
Tell em hate these twenty inch swangas, under my Chevrolet
Now who gon play with Trae, and get me outside of my zone
I'll have these niggaz draped in every color, outside of your home
I got a hundred sets, running with a hundred G's
With a couple hundred guns, loaded to put me at ease
Oh yeah I hear the talk, niggaz say I'm tripping
Like I'm off my note, tell em come try me see if I'm tripping

[Hook - 2x]
