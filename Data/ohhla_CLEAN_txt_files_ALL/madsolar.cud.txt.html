Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Didn't really know one
Can we talk just loony to loony?

How strange the notion, you don't really know no one
And what if I told you, you no longer know me
You better keep goin', keep it rollin' now
Ain't no thing you don't really need me

The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold ya
Into someone [?]
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad or on one
So won't you tell them I'm mad solar
M.A.D S.O.L.A.R

I guess I'm looney, I guess I'm on one
Guess I gotta finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healin' slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Starin' at myself in the mirror, they wanna know one
Wanna find about the real me

Soon moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But wanna act like they know me
You better keep going, keep strollin'
It's so crazy how you think you can play me

Show them pussies you're growin'
Hard times they mold ya
Tell the haters "I told ya"
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them

Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em

And people think I'm mad or on one
Won't you tell them I'm mad solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad or on one
So won't you tell them I'm mad solar
M.A.D S.O.L.A.R
