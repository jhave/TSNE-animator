Yeah, ok, y'all know how I do it
From old school rap to old school R&amp;B
Yep, that's me, heh
We gon' do it one time like this
Oh, oh, come on

I remember when we first made love (yeah)
It was so good
Nigga I was whipped and all into it (yeah)
Off of that good wood (come on)
And if I could I would pursue it
But you won't let me do it (yeah)
I'm like the first time around with playboy
You keep putting me down (mm)
I can't keep running away from you (hah)
But the sex don't feel the same (uh), no, no, no (whoo)
You don't hold me nor kiss me like you used to
I can tell your feelings changed (ooh, come on)
It must be some other bitch that's taken up your time (hah)
If it is then let me know (uh), ohh (ooh)
So I won't call you over to taste a piece of this good pie
Why you don't fuck me like before (yeah)

I like the first time, I like the first time
I like the first time, I like the first time
I like the first time, talking bout the second time
I like the first time, I like the first time
I like the first time, I like the first time
I like the first time, talking bout the second time

I remember when we first made love (uh)
It felt so good you made me cry, mm, mm, mm, aha
But now you just rush to get it over (come on)
And it don't (uh) feel like the first time (ah)

I like the first time, I like the first time
I like the first time, I like the first time (aha)
I like the first time, talking bout the second time (yeah)
I like the first time, I like the first time (uh)
I like the first time, I like the first time (ah, come on)
I like the first time, talking bout the second time (uh)

Yeah you probably the first girl I'm sprung on, I'm hung on the spots yeah
Put your lips and tongue on, you made me a fan
I took the cards that you dealt and made me a hand, aha
It's the feelings that I felt that made me a man, aha
Now I'm fighting to get it back like Mike Tyson
I wanna grab my helmet and ride but you took my bike license
I just wanna do it like we did it before, uh
Cindarella you was with it before (ooh)
Now when I bring your slipper you act like you don't fit it no more
Like I got it, but I can't get it no more
And I ain't usually a chaser cause write with my pencil
But also know how to use my eraser, yeah
And at the present time I think about the past, uh
Think about yo ass, uh, and can I see it in the future
If I see ya I'll salute ya
Cause for your loving I'm a soldier
Mommy, I thought I told ya

Why you dogging me out (aha), is this our last time (uh, uh)
Say it again, why you doggin me out
Oh what shall I do (oh), yeah (mm)
Tell me what I've done to you, oh (come on)

Yeah, aha, let the beat ride, hah, mm
Then work that, work that, work that, work that, uh
Yeah, hah, let the beat ride, uh
Come on and work that, come on and work that
Come on, come on, sing

I like the first time, I like the first time (come on)
I like the first time, I like the first time (aha)
I like the first time, talking bout the second time (whoo)
I like the first time, I like the first time (hah)
I like the first time, I like the first time (yeah)
I like the first time, talking bout the second time (uh, come on)</pre>
