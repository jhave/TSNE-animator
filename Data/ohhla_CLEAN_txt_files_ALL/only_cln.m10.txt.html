[Cube] Ice Cube the Megadon

       We got everythang to lose
[Mack] Speak on it

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Throw him back in, he feel the fin of the baracuda
I negotiate, Mack is the doer {*two gunshots*}
You the fool on the journey strapped to this gurney
We break bread with accountants and attorneys
Currency never worry me (Ay yo)
Which one of y'all never heard of me
Higher than a 33
Tell 'em what you drankin' (Hennessy)
Never tell 'em what you thinkin'
Never tell 'em where the [{*body*}] hangin'
No Lincolns
No Jacksons
Bankin' Franklin
What you thankin', hope your man come, with the ransom
Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome (Dance)
If you don't drop off, than walk off
WATCH IT, WATCH IT

Repeat Chorus

[Snoop Doggy Dogg {Ice Cube in background}]
(Verse 2)
Them west coast riders is real set trippers {West side}
Will get you for them zippers on that quest for them chippers {East side}
Slidin' on the ride
Not even hittin' switches (Yeah)
I'm hangin' at the high school, gettin' at them young misses
I keep them dubs fat
The homies love that
Yo, what up
Where it's at
I'm hollin' at the big homeboy
Who fresh out {What you doin'}
He hangin' at my grandmama house, the homie burnt out

Break: Snoop Doggy Dogg &amp; Ice Cube (Ice Cube in background)
What you gon' do when you get out of jail (Speak on it)
I'm gonna have some fun (Doggy Dogg)
What do you consider fun (What)
A ounce and about five hun'

(Verse 3)
So I
Put him on a move
That I knew about {For what}
I hooked him with a homegirl from the south, good lookin' out
Money made, plug a player in this game
Especially when he represent the same thing I claim {Dogg Pound}
Man, they don't make homies like they used to
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deux {That's real}
Cause everybody wanna see a star
In the city of dope
A.K.A. caviar

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mack 10 {Ice Cube in background}]
What have we, a house full of cavi
No stress
Well-known riders from different sides of the west {Yes}
Got the hi-zoes lickin' up
So hard, we stickin' up (Stick 'em up)
Yo, we tired of trippin', so we all clickin' up {West side}
So please, we ain't trippin' off C's and B's
It's the Westside Connect
With the D.P.G.s
For the cheese, we jab, the gift of the gab always cappin' {Uh, yeah}
Mack, Cube and Snoop rappin'
Now, how did that happen (Hun)
It's all good, fool, so peep game if you could
Snoop be from Long Beach, and I be from Inglewood (Yeah)
Now, you despise, cause it came to your surprise (What)
Two well-known enemies now becoming allies {BAM!}
In Californ-I-A
We parler the G way
Some wear red and black, and some sport blue and grey
Blow G's, don't dance, we hang-boogie and bang
So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound gang
And

Repeat Chorus

[Cube]  There we have it
        Ice Cube, the big fish
        Rollin' with the Atomic Dog, Snoop Doggy Dogg
[Snoop] Bow wow, bow wow
