[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
What is love? Love is love
What is love? (Loving you)

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, examinin her hour-glass frame
Exotic name, passion, splashin the fly fashions
On the 2 train, words soothin her brain
There's the cue, cross the platform, she 'bout to exchange
She wooed slowly in plannin a kiss
And in the same motion, bounced off with the switch
Couldn't let here go, before the train pulled off
She gave me a look that described my thoughts
And I was hypnotized by her ebony eyes
She wised to my scheme, made her temperature rise
Hours later, still zonin off the moment
Happened so fast, it's over with
And now you're gone, like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you"

[La The Darkman]
Yo, I met a bad chick, model actress
Soft as a mattress, said she was catholic
Physically attractive, earth-toned skin
Thick but thin, looked like she just came off an island
Rolled in Porsches, lady was gorgeous
I'm tryin to ram bar down her mental fortress
Loved my name, La song, how'd you like to have my 4th born?
I'm the God, I'll be your umbrella in a storm
We can smoke, parlay, see a ghetto matinee
Don't worry about me, young thug, cuz I'll stay...

"Loving you"

[Inspectah Deck]
Dana was a girl I knew, she was true
Twist L's with the crew, bust the gat too
Had the stash labbed for when the jake rushed
'nuff head to grab, razors in bags
Lettin me rest my head, wild fugitive
Acceptin all collect calls throughout the bid
Like a big sister, I've got major love
She waved my hair, plus hold a gun in the glove
While you girls move like slippery eels
You the diamond in the rough that been keepin it real
That's why you're closer to me than most I roll with
Smoked bones, rolled dice and made dough with
And now you're gone like the same short time
But stay so heavy on my mind, I'm...

"Loving you" (x2)</pre>
