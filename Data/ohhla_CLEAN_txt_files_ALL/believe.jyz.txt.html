Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to the Hamptons
20 million a wop, brand sac and mansions
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up
Glocks gonna pop, ya not understandin much
I hustle for the thuggest
Well, now I hustle for the rust, like fuck it baby 
I just love it
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped,my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love ya
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Bean's and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and that's right we coming for the title.....
Do you believe, it's Hova the God</pre>
