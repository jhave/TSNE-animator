[Intro]
Ain't a day go by that the cry of another mother
Increase the volume and sound, the volume and mass of tears
Drowning and drowning out the high in my hello, the sound is clear
 
[George Clinton]
Like anything greasy will have you slipping and sliding
Like anything sleazy will have you peeping and hiding
When I saw you at the party, I slid over to you right away
Awww before fellows could slip a line in I had you out to my place
 
[Chorus]
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
 
[George Clinton]
Oh bye, bye, bye, bye go bye
Every shot a scream another one dies
When I saw you at the party, I slid over to you right away
Before fellows could slip a line in I had you out to my place
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY
 
[Chorus]
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
 
[George Clinton]
Do you promise the funk? 
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Do you promise the funk? 
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Huh, do you promise the funk? 
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Do you promise the funk? 
Promise to keep it, it's promise
Promise you'll keep the funk
 
[Chorus]
HEEEEEYYYYY I LOVE YOU!
You can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello "HELLO!!"
You can hear the high in my hello 
"I ain't no preacher or teacher, COME ON!!"
You can hear the high in my hello "OOOOOOOOOHHHH HOOOOOO"
You can hear the high in my hello
 
[George Clinton]
Huh, wait a minute, awww, what's this I hear?
The funk is a fake, never let the icing
Get in the way of your cake
What's this I hear?
Y'all been faking the funk
That's way protects the pump, nobody's saking the rump
 
[Hook]
Vaseline Victory
Vaseline Victory
Vaseline Victory
 
[Chorus: X2]
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
 
[Unidentified Artist]
So it's said, that he who has the gold makes the rules
He who has the perspective, choose the news
Genocide in prime time, whose point of view?
All the news, and all the network, works against you
One perspective, for an entire media, is living as one
Who's the controller?
You can hear the high in my hello
He who has the perspective, choose the news
Genocide in prime time, whose point of view?
He who chooses the news, the network news to describe
Prime time genocide
 
[Outro: George Clinton]
Hello, hello!
Yeah, that's right
Only somebody, only somebody
Choose all the news, yeah, in one perspective!</pre>
