[Krayzie Bone]
Let it all go, let it go, let it all go, go, go, let it all go
(Let yourself go! Let yourself go! Let yourself go!) [Repeats throughout]

[Wish Bone]
I know it ain't easy! Put it in the hands of The Almighty and baby let it go...

[Krayzie Bone]
'Cause you need Him to guide your steps cause only Heaven knows...

[Bizzy Bone]
Angels is fallin'. I come in when they callin'...

[Layzie Bone]
Whatever the cause is heavenly soldiers all in! (all in)

[Flesh-n-Bone]
At night we send our prayers in the name of Our Creator, we ride &amp; strive...

[Wish Bone]
Hidden with good intentions. We listen so we alive!

[Krayzie Bone]
In a world so crazy, maybe...

[Bizzy Bone]
....and that's the way we do it now baby, baby!

[Layzie Bone]
So when you feel the pressure baby, let that be!
You gotta let The Lord guide you to be free

[Flesh-n-Bone]
No celebration for a moment in a physical
but true, divine condition that might as well be charm

[Krayzie Bone] (- Chorus -) 
Let it all go, let ya self go, let it all go [X2]

[Wish Bone]
My Lord! First breath - He was there! So don't just call Him when you get scared!

[Krayzie Bone]
Help me to save me from myself

[Bizzy Bone]
Yeah! You seem to be into livin'. Lord willin'!

[Layzie Bone]
What a feelin'! What I'm buildin' is for my children

[Flesh-n-Bone]
You can't pray enough for peace in the world from the warfare
and unless you felt the struggle then you probably won't care

[Wish Bone]
Poor health care! Senate killin' 'em with welfare
Ghetto-black babies, no daddys, who cares? Anybody there?

[Krayzie Bone]
So we patiently wait for this great tribulation!
Pray for the day we get that better situation
Still I'm lookin' for my brighter day, brighter day

- Chorus - 

[Bizzy Bone]
How many churches never did mention the Ascension? Baby let it go..
I'm in the trenches, never did mention the Ascension! Baby let it go...

[Layzie Bone]
'Cause it's never you're time to go until you're scheduled

[Flesh-n-Bone]
Everybody's ballin', sundown 'til sunup flossin'

[Wish Bone]
Ten years gone and we ridin' (ridin') just for you

- Chorus -</pre>
