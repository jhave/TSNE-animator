[Dre] (Spoken)
Yeah, look here Trina
I mean, me and you, we been friends for a minute but
You know how we get down, you know late night
You know, we do what we do we go our separate ways, but
Shit, lately, I been feelin' kinda different
Like, I been catchin' feelings for you and shit
You know when you call me Daddy and all that
Fuckin' with my head, for real

[Dre]
I never knew that I would fall so deep in love with her
Call me lover friend girl we was just hushin' it up
You got me feenin' for more
When other niggaz used to call you after midnight
It never bothered me, girl we was only friends, right?
So why does it hurt more and more?
Girl I get excited whenever you call my phone
I got a special ringer whenever you call me girl it goes
"I can't leave you alone" (remember that?)
You got me feenin' (yeah!) feenin' (shit) feenin'
So baby I'm pleading for you to bring your body home to me and let me lay you down

[Chorus]
Bring your body home to daddy (bring it home)
Girl I love it when you call me daddy (love that shit)
Baby you're my sexy little mama (unh huh)
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on (yeah, yeah)
Bring your body home to daddy (say what, say what)
Girl I love it when you call me daddy (love it girl)
Baby you're my sexy little mama (you are)
Step in my bedroom girl and we can get it on

[Trina]
I'm tired of the fightin' the fussin' and cussin'
Late night discussions of who you think I'm fuckin'
You puttin' me on guilt-trips like I can't see
You storin' his name for hers in your caller ID
Look I'm a Queen, the Don Diva
We should just flee in the lime green Seline two-seater you and me
My top down and yes my hair is blowin'
Flashbacks of you and me, got me moanin' but [moans]
Who you lovin' who you wanna be huggin'
I seen her in your six hundred and you claim it's your cousin
Look I know we agreed to, to see other people
But those feelings were shallow like my lingerie see-through
We both played this game unfaithfully (that's right)
See me with the next man and now you wanna play with me
Yo' I'm confused but I still wanna proceed
Without you I'm incomplete, you make me so weak
I love it when you say...

[Repeat chorus]

[Trina]
I remember, late nights we would just kiss
I remember wearin' them girdles, and takin' them trips
And I remember that we said it would never come to this
Never let something come between our relationship
Now how can I leave you to be with someone else
Without finding out, how you truly felt
All the ridin' on horses and creepin' and abortions
Thoughts of marriage, all white playin' organs
It started from the rough sex (ah!) on the deck of the yacht
Followed by Don Perion and the Canary watch
All the shoes from Italy, it was cool
Even a villa in Sicily, but it wasn't me
But I should of made it crystal-clear that I didn't really care
Whether you was dead-broke or you was a millionaire
From our first date to our anniversary
My thoughts changed of leavin' when I heard you say to me...

[Repeat chorus]</pre>
