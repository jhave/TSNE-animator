[Tah Murdah]
Yea 
We about money and murda
The fuck y'all want to do
Either pass that paper
Or we gonna have to kill you
It's like that nigga
Don't question why
Cuz when it's murda motherfucker
Everybody gotta die

Die motherfucker die
Die motherfucker die
Die motherfucker die
Die motherfucker die

[Tah Murdah]
Money ain't never been nothing
I hit the block if this shit get ugly 
And it ain't never been in my heart to let niggas thug me 
Hit the dealer and cop a drop if the eyes is buggy 
And pull up in front of the spot cause the mommies love me 
(It's gangsta) yeah and ain't no nigga gone match me 
Stocky, chubby nigga voice real raspy 
I see you real flashy "but that ain't gone last nigga"
Pop fire off shots "and that's your ass nigga" 
It's war now that's why I keep the four with long nozzle 
Six-hundred bad bitch on it holding down the throttle 
And fuck that beef shit cause some beef won't die 
And some niggas will say they gangsta but they won't ride 
And while it's hard for you to decide I'll let it fly 
Forty shots hit your ride up hit the tropics and hide up 
Under palm tree's to white sand 
Everything is a price man 
You snipe when bullets are piping hot 
When it's your flesh it begin warming you 
Now die motherfucker die
Cuz I'm tired of warning you

[Black Child]
Yeah we hear now, die motherfucker 
Don't be scared now, die motherfucker 
Black Child I'm off parole it's murda now 
In a hood near you about to burn it down
Word to God it feels like I'm from every hood 
Cuz when you ghetto your ghetto with gats you good 
Sell cracks if you could bust your gat when you should 
It's for my blacks from the bricks back to Inglewood 
We eat together nigga fuck the crossroads 
In this world my flow is another lost soul 
My shit sounds like shots from a four pound 
For these bitch clowns it's war now 
It's all about paper that's my issue 
Fuck peace you can have a piece of the pistol

[Chorus 2X: Ja Rule]
Everybody gonna die but nobody want dead
Die motherfucker die, it's your life 
Everybody wanna live, but they wanna live scared 
Die motherfucker Die, that's your life 

[Ja Rule]
Niggas know the truth 
Rule raises the roof 
Cuz I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf 
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ 
Come thru squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto 
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills 
But don't never slide down it if you to high ground it 
(puff, puff) uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots thru and silent 
And one nigga stripped of his talents 
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence 
Where first time offenders get floated to the island 
And one time give a nigga one time 
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind 
I blow lines like an addict 
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats 
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage 
So I thee wed till I'm either jailed or dead motherfuckers
Feel me niggas

[Black Child]
Word to God
Feel us nigga
We here, again
It's Murda

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
