Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I've seen 'em come and go, both in music and life
I've seen dreams fall to pieces, I've seen funerals live
I've seen talented people, grow accustomed to death
'Till their talent is nothing, shit I'm one of them now
Went along for direction, I just honour this lesson
This music shit is like ya life, could be gone in a second
So while your here, what piece of mind are you leaving for your own child to believe in
What kind of life are you leading
Do you want that, lifestyle of the rich and famous
I tried to be instantaneous, true that, when I list the greatest
Who that, my descriptions nameless
But now that I got some perspective, I'm scared to death of death
Ain't no-one to lift you up, or to bring you back or to resurrect nah
So if I die tomorrow, while I'm floating away
I just wanna leave something behind as a token of faith
So take these words, take this song, take this verse
Now let's sing this part together and let's make this last forever, come on

[Verse 2]
Look how hard I've worked, just to get here now
There's so many people in my past that have let me down
Never listened to a hater, nah, never gave it away
You all just fueled my fire, I sat here slaving away
I'm so hungry for success I'm gettin' hunger pains
Fightin' off my fake friends like the hunger games
Finally got an opportunity let's make the most
I ain't making bread, but let's make a toast
I've walked so many paths, chose the one I'm on
I wanna thank my 'rents, I'm blessed to be your son
So many people in my life just came and they went
And I've got very few people that I call my friends
So if I die tomorrow, while I'm floating away
I just wanna leave something behind as a token of faith
So take this verse, take this song, take these words
Now let's sing this part together and let's make this last forever, come on</pre>
