[Curren$y]
Uh yea
Grand national regal speeder
Americanoo magazine readers
Peep me in the fashion feature
My name spitta nice to meet ya
Wuts yo name, that's pretty I get you to the crib for I forget it
We kick it for a minute
But I'll kick ya out if I feel you tryna know to much of my business baby so chill out
Oxymoronic
Go to the sauna to cool out
We blow chronic in the pool house wut you know about it
Chevy "F" body cameros
Louisiana license plate we park em on melrose
New york pad pop california spot next
But I guess I play the telly for the mean in between mr clean kicks
Spent a couple "G's" in supreme
Paintins on my walls autographed jearseys and some flat screens
Smoove could dive in the water without splashin
Have you ever seen a shark with some wings
Word to these jordon 12
I'm in a taxi talkin to tidy B on the cell business as usual
Treacherous industry the musical
Heavy form in the game will do it to you but I keep it reduced to bud crumbs
Under my cuticles
Flippin on who ever guererro juventud wcw rappers
This shit trill and ya'll playin
But that's expected from children wut am I sayin

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea
On the grind made something from nothing so niggas will hate it (niggas will hate it)
Try and play me on some sucka shit oh cause I don't Fuck with you lately
Money on my mind you can name a place I just bought a plane
And I'm on my way there (on my way there)
I'm smokin while I roll another one baby (baby baby)

[Nipsey Hussle]
They say I spit that pistol grip poetry
It's just the loc in me
On my hip is 12 zeros after a quarter key
9 double "M" for you niggas that's not as cold as me
Dope cause I'm supposed to be
Slauson were my soldiers be
My story is ocean deep and my coast is controled by me
Bitches that ain't notice me now file my nails and lotion feet
I'm buzzin uncontrolably
Richer than with no release
Most of these rappers that's feelin like they is the golden C
H.I.L.I. to the D go ask yo bitch who fly as me
Fly as we Wiz Khalif Curren$y they certainly
Heard of me
Heard of we they beat the track while I merk the beat
Next time I sign I need atleast a bail for a murder beef
Fuck they web they searchin me I'm blowin up insurgency
9 11 portia and my car is an emergency
Carmen Sandiago were the hell on the earth is he probly some were gettin westanonamis with Curren$y
Hussle

[Chorus]</pre>
