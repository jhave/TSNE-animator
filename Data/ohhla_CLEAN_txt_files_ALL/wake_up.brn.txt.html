The attribute Haji helper to another god in need
He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized 
Word to wisdom from the groove to the wise
I guess I'm like the verbalizer for the fact I'm moving blackwards
This asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifesting thought with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels only 23 million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Cause the heart of the problem is this:
Preacher got my old earth puttin money in a pan
For the rest of the week now I'm eating out of soup cans
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my old earth believing that he's coming from the ground (Jesus)
Slain were those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the bite
Of drugs, controlled substances contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself you're not fooling me
You see, the answer to me is black unity 
Unification to help our bad situation
I wrote this on the day of wisdom power
All being born to myself
I won't diss the next brother to be paid that's not my trade
It's just the plan that was designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us (way of us)
That's the way the devil wants it so it is no fuss (it is no fuss)
It's just that sad old song self-destruction
To stop our reproduction

And put our wisdom before us (murderer)
That makes it wisdom knowledge (murderer)
So we need knowledge wisdom to bring forth the understanding (murderer)
Culture freedom (murderer)
Power refinement (murderer)
Equality god build destroy born za cipher (muderer)

(Can a devil fool a Muslim?) No, not nowadays bro
(Do you mean to say the devil fooled us 400 years ago?)
Y equals self a trader made an interpretation
saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
(Did we receive more gold?) Now Cipher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
True indeed God true indeed hajj (lack of self) - (*repeat 2X*)
True indeed God true indeed

Wake up wake up wake up (Come on)
Wake up wake up wake up (I want you to listen to me)
Wake up wake up wake up (Come on now)
Wake up wake up wake up (Bust it)

The solution: knowledge of self to better ourself
Cause I know myself that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causing trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community (That ain't right)
Can't even get a job (That ain't right)
Poisoning our babies (That ain't right)
Lying who is God (That ain't right)
Now here's some food for thought
Many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short
It's time to motiviate, build and elevate
Blind deaf and dumb we've got to change our mindstate
So I dip dip dive-a, civilize a 85er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brotherman
From the motherland now it's time to take a stand
I keep to striving to do my duty to awaken
To the universal family I say asalaam alaikum

(Reggae chatter)

Yeah
Now I've gotta give a shout to my Brand Nubian brothers
Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derrick X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the god is in here
Move on black man move on
We gotta move on black man move on - (*repeat 3X*)
Yeah
Now I gotta give a shout out to the SD 50's
Putting this in effect
I'm gonna say like this before I motivate
Please educate Allah's children with equality</pre>
