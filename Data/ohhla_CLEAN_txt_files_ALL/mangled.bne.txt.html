If motherfuckers wanna see me, nigga put some glasses on
Because I'm right up in your fuckin' face, it's to late
To try to run and try to get away, don't try clearin' your vision
Cause that's straight, you in the presence of Leatha Face
Just an average motherfuckin' thug, have to spit it for the fun
Bad nigga with a gun, uh-huh so run, run, run 
But he's testin' many slugs
Come in, you'll be done, done, before we even get started
Lovin' the war cause that's the art of it, and we'll bomb your shit
Before you even realize we the niggaz got a problem with ya
Mista sawed off, nigga bow down, now kiss this, click, click
What's up, what you niggaz really wanna do, get the fuck up
Mothafucker should a never put my name in they mouth
But I'm a get it out when I buck, buck, and you explode
Ya head, ya neck, conection no more, corpse hit the floor
Nigga never realize until they've been choked
Cause they've been told, time after time and it's still reckon
Like they don't know, so play me though, don't be blowed away
And stored away, in a box up under that dirt nails in the coffin
Just do this a, watch how we play, down with the dirty
Everytime we do it, I'm the nigga rollin' with the gold tec 'n
To use it, so be choosy and don't be stupid, don't walk in to it
When you see the Line rollin' by y'all better move it
Now I said excuse me, the money bust a u-turn, they come back
With the oozy, turn this thing into a movie
And you the first nigga dead 'fore the creits even roll up
I play the killa in the picture, and you know I'm gon' get ya
Cause it's my script, duh, movie produced by me
The original t-h-u-g, when you look in the dictionary
For the meaning of thug, motherfucker should see me
Now nigga did you see me, did you see me, did you see me
Nigga do you feel it, did you feel it, did I rap now a I see
Better nigga dog, Ken Dawg, kill a dog, now nigga let me hit it
I bust it and I fuck a nigga right up with a pistol (??)
Now you caught up in the middle of the crossfire
And now your lifes in danger, gonna wrap his neck with some
Barbed wire, hang 'em watch him dangle, you can run and hide
But we covered every angle, when the bullets fly
Niggaz body's gettin' mangled...</pre>
