Song:   Get With Da Wickedness (Flow Like That) 
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

From the end to the intro meaning the beginning, so 
I got the microphone one-two one-two here I go again 
Ready, to do damage, but just a little bit, slower 
To let you know Rage is that lyrical flow blower 
I'm smooth and creamy, milky silky steamy 
Eyes get wet and dreamy everytime a brother see me (cause why?) 
Cause they can't understand the gift of tongues 
That left em standin still and dumb 
in the dust, dare I bust, what I must, and I must son 
Continue to crush those that rushed, played dumb, and got done 
Yeah you played the high stakes and got baked 
Tried to be icing and wound up cake, translate 
meaning I broke em down to the least common denominator 
Not afraid of a sucker cause I drop em like a hot potato 
? later, if you still be or wanna be a instigator 
Daz cross the fader (why) cause no one is greater 

I be that chick with the hits and I'm hittin it 
I be that chick with the lyrics and I'm spittin it 
(c'mon now) 
Microphones, I'm definitely rippin it 
So come come, come again, get with da wickedness 

Now it's like bang to the boogie, I'm one tough cookie (betcha what?) 
Betcha bite a clit loaded wit lyrical arsenic 
as I hit wit my spitfire bullets 
wit licks from my tongue, so watch me pull it (uhhh!) 
Take it to the hilt, I'm thick like quilt (yeah) 
Raw like silk, uh-huh, or creamy like milk, ok now 
Let me break it down to the slab 
Silly rabbit, you can't get with da wickedness (why?) 
You gots to have true grit, and feel it 
from the gut, to the cut, move that butt, cause I'm rippin shit up 
Make em fall a victim to my def flow 
Lyrical murderer, that's why I'm on Death Row 
Lethal injection couldn't, fade me 
So, Suge and Dr. Dre scooped me up and paid me 
Now I'm, hah, rockin ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs 
Hah, blowin em away like the Big Bad Wolf-a 
Huffin, puffin, blowin, no bluffin 
When it comes to the Rage I ain't nothin nice (uhh!) 
on stage or mics, lights, camera 
Even Jeru calls me the Damaja! 

Chorus 

Now you're questioning the thought of gettin with me 
I tell ya, ya pumpin that ass up for failure (why?) 
I nail you to a cross (huh) hang you out to dry 
Me nah worry bout dem ting dere, cause me nah gon die, or fall 
Slaughter by the daughter of God 
That makes me a Goddess, the one who rocks the hardest 
Uhh uhh, definitely show and prove 
Lyrics hit like left jabs as, I stick and move 
so what? Back it on up like reversal 
Or get broke down with flows I run like Herschel, cause ahh 
frankly my dear I don't give a damn 
It's been a long time comin, and since I'm comin I'ma slam 
harder than your hardest (uh-huh), cause all that shit is garbage 
Now if you want the real deal, then step into my office 
Cell block H, hold up wait, think twice 
Cause if you don't it ain't gon be nuttin nice 
Cause I, ain't nuttin nice turnin men to mice 
Women are like, fallin all over me like I'm some type of dyke 
but uh-uh, you can take that bull and can miss me 
Because when it comes to sex I'm strictly dicky 
They pick me quickly (like what) like eenie meenie 
I eat MC's like Marie Calendar's creamy tortillini 
Now who, who be the baddest, who be the roughest (who be) 
The toughest, Afro Puffs when I bust this 

Chorus 2X 

I be that chick, get with da wickedness (2X) 
I be that bitch chick that be spittin shit 
So come come come again come come get with da wickedness 
Uhh! Get with da wickedness 
Come come come again get with da wickedness 
I be spittin it, microphones I'm rippin it 
Get with da wickedness, hah </pre>
