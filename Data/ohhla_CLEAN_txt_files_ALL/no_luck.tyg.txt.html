Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Okay, ocean view glass house, room full of heaters
Dick game make a faithful bitch start cheating
A blessing to these hoes, Got em praying for no reason
Got real niggas with me and all my hoes conceited
I eat it, beat it, then tongue wash clean it
A nigga start tripping, press em, cleaners
Fifty-Two niggas lined up, stay schemin
Turned ballerina when the bullet start hit me
Screaming, genius, fire-crack your house
Put them bitches at your front door like a girl scout
Now you run through the back trying to find a way out
But there's no way out, nigga go and take a bow
Finish to my level, I part bury your coffin
Is God giving her better, I'm hot, boiling kettle
Tea-bagging your bitch, I call it dipping my drizzle
I probably should take a picture , but she'll probably get offended, Bitch!

[Chorus x2]
I'm a good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
A good ass nigga, I don't need no luck
Fuck your bitch, now she walking with her nose up

[Verse 2]
I dreamed a genie, now pimpin is easy
And the ghost make your bitch reappear like Houdini
Spending hours with that toast, get the bread like a birdie
Got a ho like J-Lo, they call her Selena
Riding with that nina, I'm into my stature
Couldn't entertain you little non-factors
Got Eighty-thou for the show in Alaska
Spent 40k on strippers in Atlanta
Fuck off the weekend, fuck until the weekend
I got hoes in my house, better believe it
Like Killa Cam, yeah, I Really Mean It
Gotta walk around butt naked in some Valentinos
The new Nino, canceled that bitch and I reload
Click-clack, boom, guess who entered the room
Straps on my side like Tomb, Raider
Patch your eye, I don't gotta try again later

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm better than you
I know it, know it
Yeah, I'm better than you
I know it, know it
I fuck it up
I fuck it up
I fuck it up
I know it, know it
She fuck it up
She fuck it up
Fuck it up
I know it, know it

[Chorus]</pre>
