Get the fuck up!
Simon Says get the fuck up!
Throw your hands in the sky (BO! BO! BO! BO!)
Queens is in the back sippin yak y'all what's up?
Girls, rub on your titties (yeahhhhhh)
Yeah I said it -- rub on your titties
New York city gritty committee pity the fool that
act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

Y'all know the name
Pharoahe-fuckin-Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range, then your shit's inebriated
Phased from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain, with a long-term goal
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold platinum round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street, then shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider 
Roc-clock dollars flip, tips like a waiter
Style's greater, let my lyrics annoint
If you holdin up the wall, then you missin the point

Get the fuck up!
Simon Says get the fuck up!
Put your hands to the sky (BO! BO! BO! BO!)
Brooklyn in the back shootin craps now what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties (yeahhhhhh)
Fuck it I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee, pity the fool that
act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

(Yo, where you at?)  Uptown let me see em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put em in the mausoleum
And the shit don't start pumpin til after 12 PM
Ugnh, ignorant minds, I free em
If you tired of the same old everyday you will agree I'm, 
the most obligated, hard and R-Rated
Stated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether your ridin the train or in Lexus-es
This is for either/or Rollies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holdin up the wall, then you missin the point

Get the fuck up!
Simon Says get the fuck up!
Throw your hands in the sky (BO! BO! BO! BO!)
The Bronx is in the back shootin craps, now what's up?
Girlies, rub on your titties (yeahhhhhh)
I said, rub on your titties!
New York city gritty commitee, pity the fool that
act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

New Jeru, get the fuck up!
Shaolin, get the fuck up!
Long Isle, get the fuck up!
Worldwide, get the fuck up!</pre>
