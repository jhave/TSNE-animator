It's the return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow
that run up in yo' crib which contains
your lady and an 8 month old
child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
they do not want to hear it because they'd
rather be bouncin' and shootin' and killin' and bouncin'
and shit get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
them niggas that thank [think] you soft
and say y'all be gospel rappin'
but they be steady clappin' when you talk about
bitches &amp; switches &amp; hoes &amp; clothes &amp; weed
let's talk about time travelin' rhyme javelin
somethin' mind unravelin' get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
them niggas who got them kids
who got enough to buy an ounce
but not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
seein' light so they end up being like yo' sorry ass
robbin' niggas in broad ass daylight get down

Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
them niggas that get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?
When y'all gon' break up? When y'all gon' wake up?
Nigga I'm feelin' better than ever what's wrong with you
you get down!

[Big Boi]
Man a nigga don't want no trouble
a playa just want to kick back with my gators off
and watch my lli'l Gull blow bubbles
But still ready to rhyme
standin' my ground never back down
Willin' to rob steal &amp; kill any thang that threatens mine
But good luck couldn't be bought see
many a fights had to be fought G
for a nigga to ride these Vogues
oh so close to the sidewalk to be gawked at
watch your side my nigga 'cause we got gats
the first nigga to buck gon' be the first nigga we attack
don't want that but it comes though
most of the time you don't know
Stickin' together like flour and water to make that
slow dough we worked for everything we have
and gon' stick up for each other like we
brothers from another mother
Kinda like Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
strictly for the Caddy lovers and never the
nut huggin' punk motherfuckers</pre>
