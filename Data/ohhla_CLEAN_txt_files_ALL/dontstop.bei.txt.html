Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop

7 hours in, let the party begin
Don't care how much I spend, cause it's very few I call friends
4 bottles of Patron, 4 bottles of Rose,
Call the waitress, where she at, we need more Patron and Rose
Bottles to the sky, hands to the ceiling
Tell my haters wassup, we've been gone for a minute
Now we back up in the building
Hey, back up in this building
Every single time, we be shutting it down, and you know
Hey, I told you we would kill it
Now we back up in this building

We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop

Last night was our strobe lights
Atmosphere was set so right
Champagne click all night, say goodbye to your old life
11 hours in, let the party begin
Don't care how much I spend, cause it's very few I call friends
Bottles to the sky, hands to the ceiling
Tell my haters wassup, we've been gone for a minute
Now we back up in the building
Hey, back up in this building
Every single time, we be shutting it down, and you know
Hey, I told you we would kill it
Now we back up in this building

We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
Let's hope the party don't

Party popping, bodies rocking
Shawty over there lolippoping
I put it too deep she lolligagging
It's people smashing it's party cracking
Pulled up in that black truck, my nigga keep calling that party wagon
She put up in that old Benz, I tell her don't bring your old friends
My nigga Cole told me that they look like hers
All my white friends say they look like hers
We need more cause it look like hers, little pretty face
And a whole lot of curves
And I make her mine, don't it feel good when I beak it down
I am kinda faded I hate to lie
But being half wasted is a waste of time
So keep [?]

Bottles to the sky, hands to the ceiling
Tell my haters wassup, we've been gone for a minute
Now we back up in the building
Hey, back up in this building
Every single time, we be shutting it down, and you know
Hey, I told you we would kill it
Now we back up in this building

We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop
We just hope the party don't stop</pre>
