Verse 1 (Cristiles):

I don't give a fuck I'm on that hype again
life's hard, sometimes you got to fight to win
how would you feel if they was tryin' to bust you?
plus your bitch trippin' talkin' 'bout she don't trust you?
better listen, I'm pitchin' what you got to know
yeah I got a gun why the hell you think I got it for?
I ain't got to run 'cause I know foes come and go
so do friends so do bitches but it's nothin' though
I got haters 'cause I made it mother fuck y'all
bitches is hoes wonder why nobody cuffs y'all?
all this beef shit I seen it first hand
jealousy a bitch and I guess I'm her man understand?
I ain't playin' when it come to this
I got to win fuck everybody else who thinks they runnin' this
If you hate I hold a grudge, and I'm drunk as fuck
so when you see me in the function you know what's up

Chorus (Young Bari):

You know exactly why I came
just know we in this thang
all in the club and they lovin' us

all in the club and they lovin' us
haters mad 'cause they already know what's up

Verse 2 (Young Curt):

I'm on in this bitch I'm on like shit
lookin' for a bad bitch that could do it on the dick
swisher sweet packs got me blowin' whole zips

fuck a hatin' nigga in his face I'ma blow up
I'm fresh from my toes up that's why your bitch chose up
hundred on the chain bitch yeah I make it rain bitch

switchin' lanes grippin' grain nigga we are not the same
the bottles on deck moet get 'em all wet
Young Curt that's who I be your girl she know that

all we do is talk money got racks on stacks

Chorus (Young Bari):

You know exactly why I came

Verse 3 (Cristiles):

As I tip toe to the finish line, I'ma get what's mine
leave 'em behind I guess they ain't as sick as I am
two blunts to the face and we sip until we wasted
thizzin' out my body got no motherfuckin' patience
fin to give the whole Bay a facelift
you know who it is see the look on they faces?
it's amazin' Latinas and Asians
white girls, dike girls, all want to taste this
I'm treated like I'm already famous
grindin' with your girl but I thought that was your main bitch?
never mind that I'm on that insane shit
Curt, Bari and Styles, that take over the Bay shit
better yet the nation, never hesitatin'
to smoke in the function, fin to need ventilation
y'all on some dumb shit sayin' shit that I'm still ignorin'
I'm cold hearted, sympathy? nah I don't feel it for 'em (fuck 'em)
lil' homies want a bottle so I steal it for 'em
tell bitches drop dub roll some weed up for 'em
if they didn't know what's up, then they know now
probably why they be tryin' to shut my shows down
off of drugs, performin' at the club
sippin' on this bub got me feelin' like a thug
what's up?
the head feel so amazin' when I'm buzzed
plus these red pills got me sayin' I'm in love
when it's all said and done, I'm just tryin' to see a milli
let 'em say what they wanna haters ain't got to feel me
if real respect real then fake respect fake
weak respect weak and the strong respect strength

Chorus (Young Bari):

You know exactly why I came
just know we in this thang
all in the club and they lovin' us
haters mad 'cause they already know what's up

you know what's up, yeah you know what's up
you know what's up, yeah you know what's up
all in the club and they lovin' us
haters mad 'cause they already know what's up

you know what's up, yeah you know what's up (what's up)
you know what's up, yeah you know what's up (what's ha'nnin')
all in the club and they lovin' us
haters mad 'cause they already know what's up</pre>
