Yo!

Yes
Live from New York City
Blastmaster KRS-One of the massive BDP crew
And we gonna do a little somethin like THIS!

Once again I flash a style 
That you are probably thinkin that it's about time
The reggae scene and rap music must cross the line
And party (together)
You might think I'm not for yard
But that just makes this whole routine a little odd
Cause mixin rap with reggae music is not that hard
We must come (together)
This nonsense of rap being different from reggae is a big (lie)
Black people shouldn't separate themselves in music, no reason (why)

Yes, my name is KRS
And I have come to tell you that I'm funky fresh
And Sly &amp; Robbie simply is the nation's best
We must come (together)
Boogie Down Productions on the funky fresh lyric
Sly and also Robbie on the radical music
We can break down any system, and we break them very quick
I am teachin lyrics, Sly &amp; Robbie on the mix
So what do you do when we're comin to your town?
Run, get your tape recorder, tape the newest sound
It's just hip-hop-reggae-reggae-reggae-reggae-rap
Done by the crew, which is ready to attack

So
Once again I flash a style 
That you are probably thinkin that it's about time
The reggae scene and rap music must cross the line
And party (together)

Boogie Down Productions, or the mighty BDP
Radiatin knowledge to a poor community
You can take this for a joke, or you can take this seriously
Hip-hop reggae takin over constantly
It's drums and bass, and conscious lyrics
Dibby-dibby sound bwoy, we just can't take it
A lot of crews come out, and dem want to try it
But KRS-One only produce the hits
Whaddaya call that, hi-hi-hit, hit-hit-hit
Nuff gun man, .45, just a clip (Bo! Bo! Bo!)
Even though dem fire shot, we just can't stop it
Cause everything we say, you know it's well intelligent

Once again I flash a style 
That you are probably thinkin that it's about time
The reggae scene and rap music must cross the line
And party (together)
You might think I'm not for yard
But that just makes this whole routine a little odd
Cause mixin rap with reggae music is not that hard
We must come (together)
This nonsense of rap bein different from reggae is a big (lie)
Black people shouldn't separate themselves in music, no reason (why)
Yes, my name is KRS
And I have come to tell you that I'm funky fresh
And Sly &amp; Robbie simply is the nation's best
We must come (together)
