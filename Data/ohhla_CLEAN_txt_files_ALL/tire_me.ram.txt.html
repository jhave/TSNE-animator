[Zack de la Rocha]
YEAH, ya tryin ta tire me, tire me
I can see you in front of me, front of me
Ya tryin ta tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?!
Oh, she's got everyone's eyes (Yeah!!)
In every home there's a sickening distress! (Yeah!!)
Of roll that film she's a precious, a precious one
But we're all gonna.. - NAH, WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!
WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!

And those colorful words for the, Laos frontiers-man
Who passed away with the truth amidst the eulogies of bliss
Who will know now what I know about you?
Now that history's a FLOWERY CANCEROUS MEEEESS!!!
Yeah ya tryin ta tire me - A MESS!!!
Overbearing yes ya tryin' ta tire me - A MESS!!!
Yeah ya tryin' ta tire me, tire me
So get the FUCK from in front of me! - Nah, let's see it broken, bloody and UNDRESSED!!
WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!!

{Tom Morello's guitar solo}

In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time
In a violent time, in a violent time..

{whispers, intensifies to yelling}
I wanna be, Jackie Onassis..
I wanna wear a pair of dark sunglasses
I wanna be, Jackie O
Oh, oh, oh, OH, please don't DIE!!!

YEAH, ya tryin ta tire me, tire me
I can see you in front of me, front of me
Ya tryin ta tire me, tire me
Why don't you get from in front of me?! RUH!!

WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!
..
WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!
..
WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!
..
WE'RE ALREADY DEAD!!!!
