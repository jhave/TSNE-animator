[Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good? Yeah
And the missing love that's misunderstood, yeah
Black hourglass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past...

[Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect women
Girl get to bustin 'fore the cops come runnin, uhh
Chuck the deuces, chuggin D'USSÉ, uhh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say, uhh

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby long as I'm next to youuuuu
And if lovin you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in youuuuu?

[Interlude: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell but they don't knoooooow
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and yo' gun
I don't care if they come, nooooo
I know it's crazy but

[Beyoncé] They can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Taaaaaaaaake me
Now that I found the places that you
taaaaaaaaake, take me
Without you I got nothin to lose

[Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumpin 2Pac on my +Outlaw+ shit
Matchin tats, this ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggaz
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggaz
You ain't 'bout that life, ain't gotta lie to me nigga
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it's obvi' to niggaz
Uh, cross the line, speak about mine
I'ma wave this Tec, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click-clack
Push your muh'fuckin wig back, I did that
I been wildin since a juvi
She was a good girl 'til she knew me
Now she's in the drop bustin U'eys
Screamin

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to Heaven and they bring me to Hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doin with them rap guys, them rap guys?
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it, uhh

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if lovin you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Interlude]

[Beyoncé]
I don't care, I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all awayyyyyy
No I swear, I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all awayyyyyy
I don't care, I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all awayyyyyy
No I swear, I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all awayyyyyy
Without you I got nothin to lose</pre>
