[Intro: Frukwan]
Mmm, mmm, peace queen, how you be?
You know, I've been acknowledgin'
Kind of adaptin' off the science
Know what I'm sayin?
It's different slaves and moves
Different ways you groove
You know I'm feelin' that
It's givin' me energy right now, to radiate
So I gotta represent for you queen
Know what I mean, for real
Just knowledge that, I'm peepin' the science, yo
 
[Frukwan]
Go head boo, see you do your thing
I ain't mad you be cussin', showin' off your thing
Semi grind like earth, deep routed from birth
Under sisters in condition, loose their position
You got off, sudden the boats, failin' the check
I don't mean to disrespect, overprotect
Extravagant wine, candle lights and refinement
Night cruise the block, your mother like a fox
I keep your box damn firm, any other preturn
And the pew recognize, together we build
Motivated yo, you keepin it real, it's off the wall
Shine life from the livin' God, how's that
My back bone, my protection
I give your loved one twenty and affection
Any other is chores, provide it for the cause
Yo baby, I'm yours
 
[Chorus 4X: Frukwan]
Ain't nothin' like a strong woman by my guard
Liftin' my head when times is hard
 
[Frukwan]
Princess of Arabia, truth be lie
Comin' to you with a vision that I felt inside
They dig us for gold, but here to let you know
Heres a let down, teach a brother move slow
Don't need a woman to chase star struck brothers to fuck
Legal divorce, have his baby take him to court
Buildin' hatred and want to escape, or hesitate
Think twice, when only one rollin' the dice
If I was sick, you was rubbin' me down
Each and every conflict, you was holdinâ your ground
I'm feelin' that, one in a mil', boo, for real
So many to choose, you saved me
Gotta give my life to you
Homin' abroad connect, never loosin' a threat
How a loser even come close to forget
Adolescent throw me a rope to clear
When your near, the bad thoughts disappear
 
[Chorus 4X]
 
[Frukwan]
If love was a crime, penalty is death
But the love for my boo is all a brother got left
Baby gotta give me strong support, last resort
Anything I'm fortunate, I'm settin' it off
Only come once, take no shorts, this ain't a game
It's only one brother shapin', moldin' that frame
Brothers wanna disrespect, penalty is death
Thats enforced from the bomb we possess
If I ain't enlifted by your fur, diamond rings, Rolex
Seven day cruise, chillin' in the house and sex
Rather then that, devoted to fidelity, rhythm and melodies 
Massage you curve, match my fur
The fact is the time we both go broke
And ain't got, and end up in a cardboard box
I wouldn't care boo, wouldn't give a fuck yo
Long as your there, got my back (Yeah) I got your back
 
[Chorus 8X]
 
[Outro: Frukwan]
Yo, check it out, peace to the earth
The mother of civilization, word
I got your back, you know
You gotta dig deep within yourself
You know what I'm sayin?
And make sure and represent yourself as a treasure
Don't be so easy led to be open
Know what I'm sayin? For real
Make yourself worthy of being a prize, word
Know what I'm sayin? And keep it real
Know what I'm sayin? For real
I ain't playa hatin' or nothin', but yo
Whats right is right, whats wrong is wrong
Now, lets get it on</pre>
