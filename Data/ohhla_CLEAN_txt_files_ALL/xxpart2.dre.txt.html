[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9]
I might make it look easy
Thats just the way I be pimpin
Makin my money
Thats just the way I be pimpin
They wouldnt leave me
Thats just the way I be pimpin
You might not believe me
Thats just the way I be pimpin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm livin a motion picture
Me and my niggas, and 16 bars
will make the big screen ours
What is this? Everybody's jiggy now
Is the hustle that good in
everybody's city now? Or do they act good?
I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep
And when I snore it sounds like
I'm sayin "Wheres my money?"
I aint playin, I'm out there
Like, "Wheres my honies?"
You gotta be a pimp to understand
Just how I'm layin
Fuck a Lex bubble, I'm rich
And after this
I'ma be rich all over again, except double
See, you aint so hard if you aint burnin rubber
In somethin with numbers after the dot, you aint no star
Me and my whole crew, did either shot a nigga
Or been shot, and if you chuck us out, aint no scars
Hint: steppin to me is suicide
And that basically means that you can die
True superfly

Chorus

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
My lifes in the fast lane
Thats when I knew I had game
When class came I had hoes
But didnt know they last name
In school, when you niggas was tradin clothes
Me and my niggas was tradin hoes
Like "What they fadin fo'?"
Carry my books you hoe
I had 'em slavin, yo
I get scarred then I played the hoe
Like "Way to go"
Controllin the halls
Holdin a black Mack-11
Under the black leather
Platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties
And show up with Gold Gotti
Handsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from
Cuz you could only be the man in the shit
That I was banned from
Make this shit seem easy
Fiends need me
Make the most conceited chick
In this bitch seem sleazy
Pleased at what I'm doin
And to all yall pimp niggas
Pimp on, and I'll see yall at the reunion
