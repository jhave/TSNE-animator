[Pharrell]
Check it out bitch
See sometimes
You gotta realize
Where you are in your life
And order to feel good and I feel good baby
Listen to me

[Pharrell]
Walk in the club wit a bunch of thugs
Modify ya brains so they call me drugs
See a hundred girls, get a thousand hugs
One's in my ear talkin' bout her tub
She likes me
She say she needs me
Say she wants me
Cause I'm the shit
Said she likes me
She said she needs me
She wantes to see me
Cause I'm the shit

(Chorus)
Now it seems that things are really getting better
In my life
Is it just today or things are really getting better
We'll see tonight
We'll see tonight

[Shay]
Hey little girl wit the tattoo thigh
Baby you look like a slice of pie
Hope my style don't cause you fear
Matter of fact baby, where you goin' from here?
Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can't own me baby
Cause I'm the shit
Kiss on me baby
Lick on me baby
But you can't own me baby
Cause I'm the shit

(Chorus) 2x

[Pharrell]
Check it out now
Don't look at me like "What is up?"
Said I was a nerd but I ain't a punk
If you talk shit be prepared to thump
Plus Terrar's 4/4 is prepared to dump
Watch out boy
Get back then
Watch how you're actin'
Cause I'm the shit
I'm tellin' you watch out now
Tell ya boys to get back then
Watch how ya'll actin'
Cause we the shit

(Chorus) 4x

[Pharrell]
How do you feel?
I feel good (3x)
Girl, girl, girl (4x)</pre>
