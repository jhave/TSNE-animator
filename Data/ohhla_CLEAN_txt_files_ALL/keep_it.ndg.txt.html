[Nate Dogg]
Unless my memories fade (Unless my memories fade)
Wasn't that long ago (Wasn't that long ago)
Came out "Regulated"
Ain't no fun if your girl don't go

And I love to love ya babe
I love to love ya (Love to love ya)
(yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

I'm on the team cause I'm a playa (Team cause I'm a playa)
And you can't fit in this...groove
Oh no (Nah, nah, nah, nah nah)

I want you all up on the floor so go on and get on your feet
I wanna know what you about, I wanna take you with me
Girl as long as you wit me, see you can be who you be
I want you all to understand that I can never be beat

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
woah, oh, oh
Keep it coming (Keep it coming)
Keep it coming
Oh yeah
Keep it coming (Keep it coming)
Keep it coming
woah, oh, oh

[Rob Stricklong]
Yo I'm broke as a bum on side of the freeway
Singing hey Mr. DJ, gimme your replay
So I can receive pay, and live comfortably
Got women huntin' me, wantin' my company
Trying to pump me, full of *censored* I stay level
Recognize the devil, when he messin' with the rebel
I'm more then metal, ready to bring it to 'em strong
Rob Stricklong, make sure my name lives on
And last long, number one with every song
Rock a mic phone, even if my sight gone
Man your wrong, say you was hot as me
Better chance in the lottery
Make a mockery, If you ain't bringing it real
Lacking the skill, average run of the mill
What ever you feel, homey we can handle this
Get it on from the bricks back to Los Angeles

[Nate Dogg &amp; Rob Stricklong]
Keep it coming (We keep it goin' non stop y'all)
Keep it coming (All the way to the top y'all)
Keep it coming (We keep it goin' non stop y'all)
Keep it coming (Armed Rob and Nate Dogg y'all)

[Nate Dogg]
I can't stop, no not if I wanted too
I'm goin' to the mat with you
Be kicking up dust for you
One on one oh I can roll yo' hole crew
Let's take it to the concrete too
Leave you all black and blue

I can't stop, no not if I wanted too
I'm goin' to the mat with you
Be kicking up dust for you
One on one oh I can roll yo' hole crew
Let's take it to the concrete too
Leave you all black and blue

(Nate Dogg keeps On singing "Keep It Coming" in the background of the second
of these two verses above)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Keep it coming (Keep it coming)
Keep it coming (Keep it coming)
Keep it coming (Keep it coming)
Keep it coming (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)

Woah ohh oh oh

Woah ohh oh oh

Woah ohh oh oh</pre>
