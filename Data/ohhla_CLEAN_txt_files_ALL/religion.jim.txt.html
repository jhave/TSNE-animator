[Intro][Jim Jones]
Some sort of a desperation some said
it was like the money caught a hold of us and..
and we didnt have no other choice and when we couldn't get it
it was like we would choose to rob and steal...or some of us would kill
but this is what this life is about 
and we still going through it everyday...shit

[Jim Jones]
This is agriculture
I get cash with vultures
The chain is frozen
The glassy sculptures
The fastest culture
From young I had a ulcer
When I was povertated and hungry couldn't hardly make it
Now the homes we buy and we got cars to play with
And we roam the sky like gods our favorite
And I'm clearer than your blu-ray
Ahead you like a toupee
All the sneaky hatin
Keep debatin, I'll end you like today
Will eat you like souflette
Zoowoo...Eastside

[Chorus]
First million dollars
ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

3 million 4 million
ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

9 million 10 million
niggas might lose it

what wha-what wha-what
Still going throught it

Hit 20 M's life might change
but this is why we play the game

[Jim Jones]
The desperation it had us going crazy
Bread we chasin breakin' fast on the daily
Old heads said you livin' fast like 80's
I said for me it was the 90's
I guess the 90's was my 80's
Shit..got a thing for them fine ladies
Pretty foreign whips make me get up on my shit..shit
Pardon my french but I talk slick diggy
Meet me at the event, New Yorks the big city
Yall make movies we make the documentaries
Yours truly left the jeweler dropped a century
Huh..I told the dealer drop the Bentley
GT see'em the G's we being
Its he who be in
The V's no key in
The money the is the reason we keep tans off season
Peel off speedin'
Hand on freezin'
Blunt up in my mouth
Keep the handle out the reach'em

[Chorus]
First million dollars
Ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

3 million 4 million
Ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

9 million 10 million
Niggas might lose it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going throught it

Hit 20 M's life might change
But this is why we play the game

[Jim Jones]
Lord knows it aint easy being Jimmy
Speedin' up in Harlem while I'm leanin in the Bentley
Niggas think i'm ballin watchin niggas schemeing
I hear these bitches callin' but they just like niggas schemeing
They just plottin' on another man riches
I smothered up the wrist's rubberband on the digits
The paranoia stay wit' a roast up on ya'
Don't jump in the game without a lawyer
Avoid police contact but please keep in contact
No straight lines only use the bleep as contact
Dip the bag money like we hypocondriacs
And i'm washing up this paper like I got a laundry
Is what raised us some niggas praised us
Some beg to differ cause the street is what made us
V's came in flavors
The heat was our saviour
The ice was all blue
But my niggas is zoowoo

[Chorus]
First million dollars
Ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

3 million 4 million
Ran right through it
what wha-what wha-what
Still going through it

9 million 10 million
Niggas might lose it
What wha-what wha-what
Still going throught it

Hit 20 M's life might change
but this is why we play the game

[Outro]
See this is why we play the game the MONEY 
Like I was saying before it was sort of infectious
It was like uh..it got grab of us and we couldn't let go
so now we stuck between a rock and a hard place
They tellin' us to keep hope but
But where's the hope at when we couldn't get a job..so
We look at the drug dealers and the one's to look up to
Those were our inspiration so
We saw the fast cars, and the pretty bitches and the jewels and that was all we knew
See we was naive to the fact of real life until..until well until the streets came
And now still the same game we chasin'
Aint that a bitch...don't marry her</pre>
