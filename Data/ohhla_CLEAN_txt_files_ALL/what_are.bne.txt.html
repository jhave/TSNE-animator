Song:   What Are We Seeing
Typed by: Nickolye16@aol.com 

Tell me what we are seeing, tell me what we are seeing  and

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Tell me what we are seeing, have my head on a silver platter
Cause I can read yo' mind, I feel that chit-chatter
The batter up, baby we on deck
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit oh yes
What are we seeing, have my head on a silver platter
Cause I can read yo' mind, I feel that chit-chatter
The batter up, baby we on deck
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit oh yes
(Amen, amen, amen) Had a girl named shhh, she was movin a sssss
I was pullin a oooh, she was movin a whoo!
Did it up in the mmm, player the do-do
Call her my boo-boo, baby I'm so true

[Bizzy Bone]
Mashed and fucked up, smashed the brrrrap
Nananana now, what do they want goin down
Knocked out I smile, all the while stay wild
Little child from the Nile, still a juvenile
And you know you love my motherfuckin style
I'd rather be alone then be a little {?} now
The crowd in a frenzy, the envious around
Before I pass out, I'm so profound (I don't fuck around)

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Give me the bump bump, baby let's get crunk
I run up in your spot, and fuck it up, you know
And you know it's how I feel, baby it's really real
Don't try to change my words, you know that this how I feel
And every need worked out, every need will kneel
Tell him to shut his fuckin mouth, the don is in the field
God is the greatest, Jesus Christ I rise
Against the wicked demons of Cleveland, the Lord up top

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Bringin it to the front, I don't mean to be blunt
I don't mean to be crass, I don't mean to be brass
I don't mean to beat ass, I don't mean to be fast
I don't mean to be last, and I don't mean to be a mess
Spontaneous, in the best way
Search for the heart, in a test way
This is the real deal Holyfield, baby feel, keep it real
How do you feel, how do I feel, precious metal of steel
One time</pre>
