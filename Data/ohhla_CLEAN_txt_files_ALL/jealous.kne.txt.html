Introducing the mafioso of New Orleans Kane &amp; Abel balling
My gangsta shit sell like Air Jordan
Ain't that a bitch, straight out the parrish whipping ass like Tyson
Gun fighting slanging ice and fucking hoes like Peabo Bryson
Latinos counting cinos I murder Al Pacino
What these bitches boosting up shut them down like casinos
Getting murderous like the Menendez brothers
Dumb mothafuckas banging these hoes without no rubbers
And busters hate me like some bump weed
Cause babies dropping out they old ladies looking like me
Sporting Tommy's and Polos weed blows out my nose
Never sweating in my good clothes behind these fucking hoes
Who run this Master P, KLC slanging birds
So stop stunting dog bitch calm your nerves
Born a crack baby grew up to be a g
Whip that ass like I had a badge from NOPD
Like a second line gangsta niggas with 9's follow me
MC approaches I bury those cockroaches
Buck buck I got you fucked up like angel dust
In gacks we trust cause niggas bleed just like us

(Chorus)

Its time to get the gack again
Cause pussy ass niggas getting jealous again, again
Its time to get strapped again
Because them nappy head hoes getting jealous again, again

(Mia X)

I got that fucking regulator busting lyrical rhymes at all you playa haters
Fade ya made ya bow down to this slayer
Lady alligator still wetting up your earhole
With harmonizing gun blows still stomping out the NO
Hoes talk that shit but clear the way
Because they know I'm getting richer and bagging chips so call me Ms Fri-O-Lay
Mia X gots to flex and leave them hanging diamond rocks
?? be banging my name is reighning
I'm slanging this with No Limit
So you can talk that shit you raunchy bitch but just remember
Who finish, me running with these look alike niggas
The bad girl behind the trigger getting wreck its the 9 sister

(Kane)

Rolling 4 deep strapped in the black Montero
Shorting bright like Alfonso Ribiero but bitch I'm ghetto
Give me no heroin baby roll blunt after blunt
Fuck around and roll a thousand swishes in one month
You buster ass niggas I ain't scared of death
Had a dream I got stressed and blew up your whole project
Ask Mia X got bookoo checks
I'm like them got to get them papers like them crackers in them skyscrapers
Hitting switches avoiding bitches and them playa haters
And its time to get strapped again
Kane &amp; Abel got the gack and we back again

(Chorus)

(Abel)
Take away them chains and pain
What remains ?? the king keep a 9 in his grave
I seen so many soldiers I swore it was Beirut
Them gang signs salute, clack clack they shoot
The south coast you bleed if you wanna succeed
And I can have your fucking head in my lap for 10 g's
And you can ask the governor's name its nigga please
And even out in Cali Sam Sneed recognize me
Take it to the streets cause that's where I'm from
And niggas with gold teeth no I ain't the one
Niggas give me what you got I ain't got a fucking thing
And back in 91 I jack bitches for medallion earrings
So crappy headed nappy headed hoes get back
Cause its a 10 to 1 chance that you might get smacked
