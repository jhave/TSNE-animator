Song:   Two Miles an Hour
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah.. we gon' send this one out
to e'rybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you {*repeat 3X*}
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flo' and let's roll!

[Ludacris]
Yesss, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumpin 10 kickers, still grippin the grain
Still candy in the paint, still ridin them thangs
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screamin, "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghinis and Porsches, Ferraris and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats witcho' drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I MEAN to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seatbelts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys
We goin

[Chorus]

[repeat 4X]
Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets)

[Ludacris]
Yo, one of my ways of releasin tension while I'm releasin some steam
Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm makin sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew ballin they sick of my team
We gettin the cream, I'm through hollerin, I'm livin my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
And we lookin alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turnin heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezin on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side
and go

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm ridin up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's
Grand Prixs, S-S's cause we so so cool
Ridin Regals or the 'llacs, we in Chevelles and Verts
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works
Malibus and Camaros, T-Birds and Novas
Escalades, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H-2's and Denalis, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supremes
are goin

[Chorus]

[repeat 4X]
Assign your name in the streets (sign your name in the streets)</pre>
