[Lil' Cease]
I keep the 6 double 0 cranking
We be banking, Ben Franklin, Little Cease in the Lincoln
Jewels in the Pinkie, got you blinking
Shine too bright, rhyme too tight
Cuz I'm hot like, the sun on the spotlight
Brand new Gucci sweats, bustin yacht like L
You know robbin, steady mobbin, stay slobbin
Drinking liquor out the carton
You never seen no changes, wit lavish habits
Creep furniture, wit a lawn front and parish
Baton baggage full of carats, headed out to Dallas
Geez on the marriage, Balla time, playa all the time
Champagne, sweetheart, call ya round nIne
Set it up, get you crab niggaz wetted up
We started out, J.M. now we cheddared up
Uh

[Chorus] {Total}
Baby, My darling baby
I wanna know what set you off
Find me some way, yeah, I'll be amazed yeah
I wonder if I take you home
What you gonna do to me?

[Lil' Cease]
Just sittin, weed in the hash, T.V.'s in my dash
Waitin for this freak bitch, I need me some ass
She came thru, navy blue Subaru
Look beautiful, oooh,girlfriend, don't know what to do to you 
Too good to be true, said I was a cutie too
Could it be the dough print in my jeans
Should a sauce that, you know Cease neva boss that
Only play hoez, neva I been caught yet
You trick on em, while Cease lay the dick on em
I piss on em, you turn around and kiss on em
I shit on em, you turn around and hit on em
I be the one to catch the O.J. case
But I'm too smooth for that, chicks know my face
If you know Cease, know it's only dough I chase
Wit the mafia, neva let the pussy go to waste(huh)
Neva let the pussy go to waste, what, come on


[Chorus] {Total}
Baby, My darling baby
I wanna know what set you off
Find me some way, yeah, I'll be amazed yeah
I wonder if I take you home
What you gonna do to me?

[Lil' Cease]
Now one for the money, two for mo money
Three to the niggaz that give Mo to honeyz
Cease keep a beeper full of dime pieces
Only wifey know where I stash G's in
Give ho's the key to the Bentley
Go cautiously in the 8:50 
I got a lot of dough so I'm a bragger
Drink gold Swager and Kim help me out when we stag her
We wise guyz that roll wit ? 
Neva hit a honey if the chick is jobless
I floss in the Range so I'm never carless, 
Garage full of cars and I fuck wit goddess
I lay in the bed cause the feds wanna get rid of me
Hop to Hawaii, escape to Sicily
You ain't on the level we on, pushin the Neon
Froze like freon, chick you need to be gone

[Chorus] {Total}x 2 
Baby, My darling baby
I wanna know what set you off
Find me some way, yeah, I'll be amazed yeah
I wonder if I take you home
What you gonna do to me?</pre>
