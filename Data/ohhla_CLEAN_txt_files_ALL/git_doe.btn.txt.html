[Fatman Scoop]
*cough, cough*
Ya ya, ya
Fatman Scoop, Beatnuts
Yo, yo, yo yo

Fatman Scoop, Crooklyn Clan
Fatman Scoop, Crooklyn Clan
Fatman Scoop, Crooklyn Clan
Beatnuts, Beanuts, Beatnuts *echo out*
(x2)

[Psycho Les]
Let's rock and roll
Put some real hip hop in your soul
Over this track there's no stoppin the flow
Let's blast off in a ridiculous way
Face off, like Nicolas Cage
Slam pit, you get crushed, you should know better
And now you stuck, like you don't know where to (go go)
Make you a believer
Chop you in the neck with a mothafuckin meat cleaver
It's cool, you can fool the kids
But you can't fool niggas that live
The lifestyle, the lifestyle, the lifestyle, the lifestyle

[Fatman Scoop] [CHORUS]
Everybody let's get doe (get doe)
VIP in the disco (disco)
What you drinkin on cris mo (cris mo)
Light it up and get twisto (twisto)
(x2)

[Juju]
Yo, don't think about work, don't think about shit
Don't drink just two shots, drink about six
It's a party baby get that right
Lotta ladies in the house tonight
I'm fuckin drunk and the music is tight
It's the nuts and we at it again
Fuck this shit, either you or your friends better believe it
Cuz the fun never ends, you know a live nigga never pretends
Never cry about the money he spends
Vacation mami, let that go, whatever happens here stay here, ain't that so?
You sexy, better let that show
Come over here and light that droe
About love, we can make that slow

[Fatman Scoop]
You gotta bottle of Cris, throw it up, throw it up
You got a bottle of Mo, throw it up, throw it up
(x2)

CHORUS (x2)

[Psycho Les]
Ain't nothin but crooks in here
Everyone's high in here
Beatnuts is pioneers
Masters of the ceremony, takin it there
Look at me, I'm a monster y'all created
You met me once, now we related
You goin' round town sayin Psych's my cousin
Bitches see me on TV and scream 'That's my husband!'
You want me to go down, down like Nelly
But the dugout's smelly, so give me head and get the smell out the telly
*Get the smell outta here*

[Fatman Scoop]
Go, go, go, go, go, go

CHORUS (x2)

All my ladies say uh oh *uh ohhhh*
All my niggas say ay yo *ay yoooo*
(x2)

ay yoo, ay yoo, ay yoo, Beatnuts wild out
(x4)

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, now keep your hands up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, now keep your hands up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, now keep your hands up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, now keep your hands up</pre>
