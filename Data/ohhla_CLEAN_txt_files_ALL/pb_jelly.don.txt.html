Inside peanut butter out side jelly
Seven days of the week, seven different Chevys
Black ss with the top blowed off
Fuckin with them boys get your top blowed off
Inside peanut butter out side jelly
Seven days of the week, seven different Chevys
Black ss with the top blowed off
Fuckin with them boys get your top blowed off

[J-Money]
Got an old white Chevy peanut butter top same color
Flows out the back, wood stern wheel match my leather
Twenty four inches off the ground like Jeezy
Got that thang homie so you better take it easy
Catch me in the hood knockin pictures off the wall
Sittin sideways like the nigga Paul Wall
Got a four fifty-four and it's all chromed out
Just bought a platinum grill like the one off in my mouth
Niggaz down south all we do is ride heavy
Could had a Bentley but I rather ride Chevy
Pistol in my lap give a fuck about the law
Hoes see me coming and they all gon ball
Got ten bad bitches and they all gon call
Got five screens and they all gon fall
Old school new school we done had em all
All my niggaz ridin Chevys so we all gon ball

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Cadillac Don]
Monkey see monkey do so everybody got a Chevy
Three fifty with the flow masters the bitch runs heavy
Keep it clean plus it ride good
When I'm rollin through the hood
I get down in it that bitch sounds good
And for you niggaz who's snitches shit can't be trusted
Might as well call me Lee Dungarees I can't be busted
But I'm Cadillac Don nigga a real fucking hustler
Ridin through the south spreadin this game like mustard
I'm a Cadillac rider true enough
Better ball in the Chevy when I strut my stuff
Making money can't get enough
Haters get mad they fuss and cuss
Check my rep I drop the top
Lean out the Chevy let the four five pop
Cut it to the middle can't wait for cops
Sixteen switches watch that ass go drop
We hittin the curb three wheel motion
Seeing double drinking on the potion
I'm a movie  I'm hustlin and flowin
Getting paid, stacking, tokin
For this boy y'all niggaz ain't ready
Give me the crown I deserve the credit
Or catch me fucking your bitch in the Chevy
Inside butter outside grape jelly
