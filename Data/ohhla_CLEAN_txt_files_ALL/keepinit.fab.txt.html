[Fabolous talking]
Fabolous, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, Yeah
Yo, I don't care what y'all do, how y'all do
Where y'all do it, just keep it gangsta
Look at them gangstas

[Verse 1]
Fab's livin' la vida loca
Only nigga in the hood you can come see for either weed or coca
Nark's wanna see me and my team in a chair
They heard about the kid with the high beams in his ear
DEA been lookin' for proof since 9-3
When I came thruogh in the Benz with the roof behind me
Tell them jake's through on bullet proof's and find me
You need extingwishers to go in the booth behind me
Who the fuck wanna beef
My Fendi knits be 3X so you can't see whats tucked underneath
And I might not even drop
Just take my advance and make a small town in Cleveland pop
"Vivrant Thing" on my hip, that will make you "Breathe and Stop"
Rock ya chain in ya shirt, Your roll (Rollie) with the sleeve on top
You niggas know where my heat stay at
I leave niggas MIA and I ain't talkin where the Heat play at
C'mon

[Chorus]
Y'all know who
Keepin' it Gangsta
We come through
Keepin' it Gangsta
Y'all know how we do
Keepin' it Gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it Gangsta

[Verse 2]
Niggas don't think I'm still shavin crack
Cause I pull up in a truck with a system that make the pavement crack
Baugettes have my face and band covered
And I keep a "Lethal Weapon" like Mel Gibson and Dan Glover
Now I lose V Money and C Lo
And the cops think me and Muggs is G Money and Nino
I don't hit these honey's with C-Notes
Rather put them on Greyhound, Strap these honey's with kilo's
Type of gangsta every chick wants
I get Nike's from Aster you won't see hit the store for 6 months
Something bout the Beamer X5
When I come through it be increasing a skeo's sex drive
Half the click look like they stuck Genesis up
The other half is tryin to wrap they sentances up
I'm never gon' hate,half these artists never slung weight
When they call NY, its the only time they touch the 7-1-8

[Chorus]
Y'all know who
Keepin' it Gangsta
We come through
Keepin' it Gangsta
Y'all know how we do
Keepin' it Gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it Gangsta

[Verse 3]
I lay low on the other side of the globe
Carat's hangin out the side of my lobe
Pull in ya drivers side and unload
They find ya when its time for your ride to be towed
On side of the road
With ya brain on ya passenger side of ya Rove (Rover)
Ya'll niggaz ain't gangsta til ya'll ridin and Fed's tail ya
Hit a chick once and she runnin back like Fred Taylor
Im snatchin everything in the PJ's now
Thats why most these niggas is workin' with the DA's now
If I'm in a hoop ride or a buggy coupe 5
Keepin' it Gangsta
If I'm with a hoochie freak or a dime in Gucci sneaks
Keepin' it Gangsta
If I'm probally in the hood or I'm in Hollywood
Keepin' it Gangsta
If I spit 16 on a track or 16 from a gat
Keepin' it Gangsta

[Chorus]
Y'all know who
Keepin' it Gangsta
We come through
Keepin' it Gangsta
Y'all know how we do
Keepin' it Gangsta
My whole crew
Keepin' it Gangsta</pre>
