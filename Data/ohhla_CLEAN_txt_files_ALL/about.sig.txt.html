(Verse 1)
Yo Beanie Mac rap guerrilla 
I'm out for the skrilla
Face it ain't no replacement for this killa
Keep your hands where I can see em
Don't make me nervous
This 4-4 auto mat
U don't deserve this shit
Kids either don't make me make u a believa
I do a lotta talkin I speak wit the heater
I'll run up in your crib put some in your wig
Your baby's cryin pop pop pop put some in the crib
And I want everything not just some of the shit
Got niggas comin home at night like you son of bitch
Nigga done took me off yeah you shook and soft
You can't blink around no crook
One look you lost
Niggas'll find your bitch to find your bricks
See if you love your bitch or you love your chips
4-4 snub shit sendin slugs to the whip
Beanie Sigel desert eagle I love this thug shit

(Chorus)x2

Yo what you really know what a thug about
Locked up in the bing no grub about
On the block doin your thing slingin drugs about
Tell me what you really know what a thug about

(Verse 2)
A true thugs speads his game linked up in bubble
While niggas stay in one lane like the lincoln tunnel
I refuse to limit my game to one hustle
I don't only sling crack or let the cards shuffle
I know how to play cee-lo set it off like cleo
Ain't no tellin first union or mellan
First nigga that move put two up in his melon
&gt;From the 9-2 emberetem parabellum
And I run through cats 
I'm a true gun cat
One nickel 
One black
Who want that
I done schooled my youngins 
Gave tools to my youngins 
Broke food wit my youngins 
Broke rules wit my youngins 
Spark my way outta shit and had bad run in's 
Talked my way outta shit and near death come in 
Real thugs do what they want say what they feel 
They never front they keep it real 

(Chorus)x2

(Verse 3)
Niggas claim to be thugs you real fuckin suckas
Quick ass runnin good fuckin duckas 
Obey the rules when my glock unloads 
Cause when I start firin stop drop and roll 
Duck behind cars hide behind poles 
Know I live by the code anything goes 
Real thugs stand up straight they never fold 
And they don't know shit if anything ever blows 
Thugs don't wanna talk shit out 
They wanna spark shit out 
Till the cops come an chalk shit out 
Blaze wit the toasta extra clip in the leg holsta 
Face off like Cage and Travolta 
If you got beef a thug gonna roast ya 
Talk behind their back a thug gonna approach ya 
Right amount of stack a thug gonna ghost ya 
Lay you out flat like a thug suppose ta </pre>
