Haha
South East San Diego in the muthafuckin house
619
Gangsta Nation crew, nigga
Bullet Loco
So get your muthafuckin facts straight
Check it out

[ VERSE 1: Jayo Felony ]
What that Diego like? A Uzi or a Mack 10
Bullet Loco and I'm bailin with my niggas from the pen
These snitches and tricks makin the set look real bad
Instead of that rag, buster, you need a badge
I gotta watch the pad real close for the break-in
Cause suckers be fakin but it'll be no more mistakin
Hand-pick my click, no weak link or busters
Just pimps and murderers and straight up hustlers
Who ain't givin a fuck about a nine to five
When I can pull up on ya, blast that ass and then drive
Your car away, far away and leave you with a frame
Sittin on bricks and that's a muthafuckin shame
You don't know my name or the set that I claim
For years I let embalmin fluid take over my brain
Killin over colors, fuck if it's my brother
But if I hesitate on he draw I might not see another
Day, some say ( ? ) smokin and I start chokin them bricks
And I'm pissin on your floor cause I ain't housebroken, bitch
They snitched on the Loc when I was bangin
But now on my nuts you're hangin
And I just ask myself

Yeah muthafucka

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

Nigga

[ VERSE 2: Jayo Felony ]
You must be on caine, speed, water, weed, hot cock or ready rock
It's the Bullet Loco on the 47 block
On a mission as I'm gettin Inside like Edition
Bitches are wishin they could be huggin up and kissin
Me, but see Bullet Loco gon' stand with the upper hand
Hookers be lyin like the muthafuckin weatherman
Bitch, it ain't gon rain, it's a sunny day
For my AK to spray and lay any hooker that wants to play play
Taytay your baby kids were up and saw me fuckin you
Beatin up the poo-poo with my dick stuck in you
I might smoke anyone when I'm swimmin in the water
( ? ) to San Diego news reporters
( ? ) puttin out a fuckin hit
Suck my dick, you'se a trick, your perspective ain't shit
To my click I flick a shermstick bud in your eye
Bangin till I die
Nigga

Yeah fool
And it don't stop

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

[ VERSE 3: Jayo Felony ]
My little homies walk the streets strapped ready to peel a cap
So my enemy's gone on a muthafuckin map
Six feet deep, his boys might try to creep
I don't sleep, I keep my trigger finger on my heat
Huh, and sho' enough here they come on a sneak tip
But I got a AK-47 with a 50 round clip
Buck - I hit the driver and he crashed
Ran up on em busters and let em have it as I blast
Tic toc, you don't stop, mama smokin crack rock
Break that shit pipe and tell that hoe to stop
But on my block you got them ends, you got the lleyo
My kids got a appetite, so I just can't say no
I'm cuttin up my brick just as soon as I can buy it
I even got a sample of, here smoke and try it
It's all about the street life, my knife and my rag
The Loc used to sag even when I played tag
Fuck the drag, here I come with the gun, son
Blast that ass, question later, I ain't the one
Toss up the Thunderbird, never leave a homie hangin
Cause Bullet Loc ain't goin out, fool...

And I just ask myself
Muthafucka

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

You must be on dope, nigga
Yeah and it don't stop

Why I gotta live like this?
You're trippin and slippin and thinkin that you can fade me

You must be on dope, bitch</pre>
