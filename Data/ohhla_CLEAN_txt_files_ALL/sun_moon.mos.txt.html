A night where beautiful life is real
The mathematic to acting still
The unfamiliar the warm embrace
The family ties and the stranger's face
The lighting thunder the power steed
The what it is and the what is believed
The strong connections desire to need
The waking now or the moment to dream
The laugh the murmur the moan and the scream
The voice of reason somewhere in between
The one and all the me and the we
The I and I the thou and the thee
A man a design a child of the streets
The daily chore the impossible feat
The drum the chorus phenomenal beat
Easy to touch and the harder to reach
The sweetest fruit in the top of the tree
The sun the moon the stars and the bree-eze

I'm coming to it, and it's coming to me 
I'm getting ready</pre>
