[Intro: LL Cool J (Richie Sambora)]
Both hands in the sky, everybody in Giants Stadium put your hands up (baby)
I feel like I wanna get my Elvis on, on this joint (baby)
Oh yeah, this is serious, oh

[LL Cool J]
Met this lil' girl she was off the hook
I got cold chills when her body shook
Hot Sex on the platter, no need to cook
I let her steal my heart like a horny crook
Had her grindin and windin against my leg
She fucking with my head, want a nigga to beg
Sexy pumps on, toenails red
Your body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead
It's hard to hold you when you movin vulgar
Peace sign on your eyes like John Travolta
My Pulp ain't Fiction, it's an addiction
To see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen
Nasty girl, taught me all the lingo
While mama play bingo, she ride mandingo
She don't give a damn if I'm married or single
She makes me TINGLE! She wanna be my

[Chorus: LL Cool J (Richie Sambora)]
(Baby) any time of day
Get off the bus, girl, we running away
So you can be my (baby)
Let's take a roll in the hay
Let's go out in the yard to play
You wanna be my (baby)
All night and day
Let's go, put the books away
You gon' be my (baby)
Nothing left to say
That'll only take my buzz away, hey, hey

[LL Cool J]
She likes Hip-Hop and Rock &amp; Roll
Her lifetime goal is a movie role
She lookin for a man that could give her a break
Like Usher or Justin Timberlake
I'm really not sure if her breasts are fake
Cause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake
We drink some beers inside her dad's Camaro
She shot me in the back with cupid's arrow
We finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back
Pulled up her dress and she made me eat that
I'm drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty
Truck stop bathroom at 7:30
Order some dessert, muthafuck if it's early
Head spinnin around like roller derby
Everything about her says you dont deserve me
I hope im worthy, for you to be my

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
In the back of the pickup clothin ripped up
How about a cornfield, shit gets more real
Runnin and laughin, music blastin
Side of the road bent over crashing
Mouth all dry, I've been pumping herb
If you see my mama, dont say a word
The cops wanna know why my words are slurred
Don't ask me officer ask hurr
Wanna another drink baby she like surr
Wanna hit the club she like I dont curr
She all in the rearview doin her hurr
Hairspray and lip gloss everywhurr
This all happens on an average day
Your life is the shit, girl I'm here to stay
I never had a girl make me feel this way
Even though I had to pay, you gon' be my

[Chorus 2x]</pre>
