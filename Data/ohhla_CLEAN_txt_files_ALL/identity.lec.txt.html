[Lecrae]
Hair, check! Shoes, check!
A brand new fit, lookin cool, check!
I'm lookin in the mirror like oooh, yes!
To cover for an insecure dude, check!
But she won't feel me and they won't like me
If I ain't in them J's or them brand new nikes
Let's dig deeper inside my psyche
When it's all said and done even I don't like me
He live in the gym and his hair stay faded
Late model car so they think he made it
He's Christian, he gave his life
But he still ain't satisfied in the savior Christ
Still finds his identity in looks and cars
If he only knew that he ain't have to look so hard
If he looked in God, it may seem odd
But he be so satisfied, he can leave it all

[Chorus: J.R.]
I'm not the shoes I wear
I'm not the clothes I buy
I'm not the house I live in
I'm not the car I drive, no
I'm not the job I work
You can't define my worth
By nothing on God's green earth
My identity is found in Christ, is found in Christ

[Lecrae]
Got her hair done, toes, nails
Is that her, well it's hard to tell
Cause she's so caked up in all that make up
It's like she tryna make up for what she ain't but,
She's a saint, but so confused
Cause she's been rejected by all these dudes
That tell her on a scale of 10 she's a two
But that ain't true, if she only knew
In Christ she is loved, she secure and accepted
Never be rejected by God whose elected her
Her beauty is her Godliness
And she ain't gotta flaunt it cause it's obvious
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct
Identity is found in the God we trust
And any other identity will self destruct

[Chorus]

[Da T.R.U.T.H.]
Hey, how do I gain success
Why do I say I'm blessed, huh
Is it the car that I drive
Or the place that I rest
Or the way that I dress, now, now
Is the cause of my pride
The stage and the set
Or my face in the press, now, now
It's the applause that dies
When the praise is less
If my face is depressed, then, then
It's cause my value and worth is in the volume of the work I produce in the booth
It's a prize and a curse if defined by the perks when the truth is through
Man I won't feel like I don't want to live no more, no more, no more
Cause they don't like me, like they did in 04, 04, 04
So I swallow my pride empowered by God, I'm complete in him
He's got peace God's priest, I'm in
In his presence weak is strength
Meet his kin
We his brethren
Read this list
Me forgiven
He's dismissed guilt and my sin
And then I find my worth cause I'm Jesus' friend

[Chorus]</pre>
