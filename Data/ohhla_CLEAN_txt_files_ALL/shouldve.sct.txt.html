Song:   Should've Known
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I should've known not to trust you after all the things you done
I should've known that you would do the same after you said you'd change
I should've known not to give it up when my heart just won't trust
But it's love eh eh eh
My heart just said eh eh
I should've known

[Verse 1]
Never listen what yo friends say
I'm just tryna have a good day
Take you on a couple shoppin sprees
Yo whole life changed when you met me
Other girls see you spoiled so it's jealousy
You get everything you want and they don't like that
They know you got a boss sleepin with a set
Wonder if I go to prison will you have my back?
Yo mama told you she ain't want you with a street nigga
Tell yo mama street money paid yo whole tuition
I thought we had plans of making a business
Every day somebody different in our business

[Chorus]
I should've known not to trust you after all the things you done
I should've known that you would do the same after you said you'd change
I should've known not to give it up when my heart just won't trust
But it's love eh eh eh
My heart just said eh eh
I should've known

[Verse 2]
See my number in yo friend phone
Not again, girl please can we get along?
All that arguing, it made me stay away from home
When you think I'm with a bitch I'm getting my hustle on
Even you, you had the cheek just to leave me
But I don't never break it up, it's about you and me
Ever since you met me yo whole life free
I got all yo wants and needs, I'm a lot real

[Chorus]
I should've known not to trust you after all the things you done
I should've known that you would do the same after you said you'd change
I should've known not to give it up when my heart just won't trust
But it's love eh eh eh
My heart just said eh eh
I should've known

[Bridge]
Late nights with your homies
Working late but without me
You left yo phone in the car seat
Yea nigga I ain't dumb
I should've known
In the club all night
You weren't really worried bout home
I should've known
Yea nigga I ain't dumb

[Chorus]
I should've known not to trust you after all the things you done
I should've known that you would do the same after you said you'd change
I should've known not to give it up when my heart just won't trust
But it's love eh eh eh
My heart just said eh eh
I should've known</pre>
