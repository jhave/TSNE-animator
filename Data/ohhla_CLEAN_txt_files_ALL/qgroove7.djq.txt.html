[Jodeci]
I'm tell you one thing (just one thing, come over here)
Mmm yeah (that's right) that's right (you gon' party with Jodeci)
Ah-hah, you wanna play with DJ Quik (that's right, momma, that's right)
That's right, everything is right (ohh, that's right)
Tell 'em K (ooh yeah, that's right)

Lil' Daryl (ooh yeah, that's right) tell 'em that's right
Ay Quik, let her know it's right, everything is right

[DJ Quik]
When the bass pops, it'll make your face cock
Fuck the king of the West, I'm a prince, I bring the taste pops
Tell your moms Jodeci'll make they juke joint pop
"Diary of a Mad Band," fuckin with a bad man
My beats'll have you lookin down at your feets
I resurrect from the dead and put it back in your head
DeVante, K-Ci and Jo, those my pals
Pass the Cristal to Daryl and mind your gal nigga

[Chorus 2X: Jodeci]

Showin Quik and Jodeci love
Cause they want to bump with us
That's right, that's right
