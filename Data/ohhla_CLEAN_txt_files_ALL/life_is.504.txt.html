(Chorus 2x's)
(Erica Foxx)
Life is serious out here on these streets
Got us curious but were just trying to eat

(Krazy)
Why cry now inhale the pain is gone
Get your life back together it's time to move
I know it was your baby daddy I saw you kiss him
Hold up little boy screaming Jesus I miss him
Ain't nobody gonna treat you they way he did
He left you with biggest gift he made a kid
Now you grab him and smile remember your man
Even though the life you want it didn't go as plan
With no money for the baby never held a job
When the rent was due he always grab the chopper and ride
What you blushing I know you love my nigga
In the casket at 22 he didn't figure
You was mad at the funeral seeing his hoes
But he kept it real with you like an thug suppose
You chose to love my nigga that you met in the Ville
You gonna always love my dog even though he got killed

(Chorus 2x's)
(Master P)
Smile know Kendall I know you miss my nigga
Two kids to raise without an father figure
And your youngest son screaming my daddy going to heaven
You and Bobby Phills always suppose to be together
And everytime you see ball make you wanna cry
Cause my nigga had G and you know he could rise
From the streets to the big league
From the ghetto to the palm trees
We pour liquor caused he moved on
You shed tears but you stayed strong
And at the funeral made jokes about his birthday
His last words was same time but a different place

(Chorus 2x's)
(Mac)
And a time I burn a cross
For the nigga I lost
One slug took the life of my young thug in cold blood
R.I.P. to every daddy on Ken D
I'm missing ya'll till this cold earth send me
Sippin a sprite
Breakin my life
When the day turn night and just write
Till I bed wrinkle 
Dippin these hoes till I plant sequel
Running around with that desert eagle
Like it was a bit legal
I got a call from my uncle state
Said it will be a while for they let him out them gates
Drop the phone as the tears hit the tip of my ears
I'm gonna disappear if he gotta serve more years
(Chorus 2x's)</pre>
