Verse 1: Treach

I'ma shine on, time to climb on
Stun me with R&amp;B harmony
So far, first to the O-R
Hand the bill until paid is a coastguard
The sonar, sounds that will throw your
feet, to no more, no tour, show more
First ability, deeper agility
No harassment, pass the humility
A new style blessed with a few styles
Rhyme'll shine on, I'm on a new prowl
Clap your hands in the evening
Come on y'all, say "It's alright" before leavin
I like a party, overpumped and lovely
All who flow, show, you think you love me
Bow in the balcony, say "Owwwwww" for me (Owwwww)
Now dance, so shall we?
All night long to a long, good, strong song
Hug, the rhyme'll shine on much stronger
A tougher chart buster went tutta
Summer, been back thru another
Autumn, I'm callin ya all in
and fallin off like a soft man stallin
A party's live and it dies it when I'm gone
I'm born to see that the rhyme'll shine on

Break: (x2)

(*Clap your hands this evening
Come on ya'll, uhh, say it's alright
Clap your hands this evening
Come on y'all, say it's alright*)

Verse 2: Treach

&gt;From the tongue of a great one, I'm prepared for basin
Many are waitin, ain't in to tastin
a song which is on and long but still cock-strong
Wit an R&amp;B cross on
A switch tip, diff'rent from the last hit
Uniquely Yorky, groovy and graphic
A new rap? This is more than just that
When I'm back, you know I'm strapped wit hot tracks
And in fact, it takes the break to shake that
hottie of a body, waitin to get snatched
Put a dip to the hip then come back wit
some ol' new improved holy
Lyrics loaded, love now, let a man live
Dave, put the keys to the crib........

Aphrodite join the party

Interlude: Aphrodite

Driftin on the memories
Nature's in the place to be wit R&amp;B
Heh heh hehhhhhh
Wait and see, oh well
And I'm rockin, the rhyme'll shine on thru
Just for you

Verse 3: Treach

Straight from the soulful, smoother ruler
Doin my thing, many and whatever I choose ta
Involve the self in, many are meltin
Stop before you start, your little heart ain't helpin
The situation, knockin the nation
Hip-hop will pop pop pop the population
Praise is profits, systems knock it
Who? But this ain't as smooth as I get
A 90-man clan, a slam jam, bam stand
and I can can, play and cram fans
in any form or fashion, time for the cashin
Throw em rhythm and rappin
Half of half of even their half, then half of that half
I smash when I rap
Or quick, I stick to a hit like an iron-on
Oh what for? Cos the rhyme'll shine on
