Typed by: Lil Hustle

(Dallas)
Ah no-no, the rain is falling down
I ain't forgot about you, say you
I ain't forgot about you, ah no-no yeah

[Hook: Dallas]
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
And though you gone, you still on my mind
I often wish that I, could kick it one more time with you
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
I wrote this song, to let you know I'm down
I know you know I'm down, I know you know I'll ride for you

[Trae]
I just thought that I'd clear my mind, off the top and represent my dog
DJ Screw you know that I miss you mayn, so every chance I get I gotta mob
Never thought I'd be doing this song, but time after time I feel like I'm alone
I could recall kicking it like G's, but now I reminisce going down my songs
It really hurt to see your T. Jones, feel the wrath that he reaching fo'
Everybody wanna be, Screwed and Chopped
But they don't know, it's bout to be smoked
They don't feel the pain that I feel, the love that I got for you is too real
We been down since back in the day, if you was still here I'd be down still
Everyday I gotta ride for the team, S.U.C. for L-I-F-E
It's bout time I let 'em know who we be, you the Don and now the world gon see
Ain't no way that I'm gon forget ya, in my mind I gotta paint my picture
You was the realest nigga, Down South
One day we'll meet again, and I'll kick it with ya

[Hook]

[Trae]
For Ro, you know you number one in my book
Everyday, I'ma hold it down
Even though you locked up, for a hell of a time
Ain't a day that pass, you ain't on my mind
I love you mayn, never put no one up above you mayn
So you know, that I gotta keep thugging mayn
Still all about you, and ain't nothing changed
You the reason I wreck, trying to get a platinum plack
For my brother Dinkie, I remember just what you told me
That niggaz in the game, can't even see me
Me and Jay'Ton, fin to get your shine on until you get free
I'ma get my grind on, me and you
On another level it'll be that way, even when my time gone
I had to show, that you part of my heart
And it really hurt, when they split us apart
All I know is I still remember, I've been repping you since from the start
Everyday on my pen and pad feeling sad, seeing shit that we never had
All I know is what's mine is yours, for the good times or for the bad

[Dallas]
We still homies
Though we, be homies sometimes
But you know me
Cause we, be's homies
These be phonies, but real G's show me
That's what, you told me
That's why, I be homies - 2x

[Trae]
Kin folk I just got your letter, you and me we SK forever
You been gone, for bout three and a half
All of the times, is bound to get better
All I could say, is that we gotta ride
For the last and the time, you locked up inside
One day gon come, you bound to be free
When you hit that gate, I'll be right outside waiting
Donnie, you gotta hold your pride
I ain't forgot about you dog, everyday I ride
Everyday of the year, right by your side
Better believe, I'm keeping your name alive
And that's on the click
Even though, my pain might make me sick
My day coming up, and I'ma hit that lick
Then me and you, both'll have time to kick
Raise our kids like grown men, reminiscing like back when
Bleeding our block in a dead end, if time went back would I do it again
It's really hard to say, but I prolly would
Just to see your face, everyday got a time and a place
All I know is I miss you dog, South Klique for life and I'm still your ace

[Hook]

(Dallas)
I'm down down, while the rain is falling down
I'm dooown, I'm dooown yeeeah
Ah-ah no, ah-ah no, ah-ah uh, ah-no-na
I'm down I'm down I'm down jeah, you down yeah
Everybody down yeah, said I'm down for you ooooh yeah

[Dallas]
We still homies
Though we, be homies sometimes
But you know me
Cause we, be's homies
These be phonies, but real G's show me
That's what, you told me
That's why, I be homies - 2x</pre>
