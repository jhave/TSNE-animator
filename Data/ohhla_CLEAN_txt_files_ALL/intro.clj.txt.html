[LL Cool J]
Ayo this is the infinite, intelligent, extravagant and eloquent
That shit y'all talkin is irrelevant
I put it down from the gutter to the tenement
It's LL Cool J nigga, everything I do is excellent
And I got to represent, Q-Boro, the thorough
Y'knawmean? We get down, we get down baby
Check this shit out right here, uh

E Pluribus Unum is the album I'ma drop
It'll make you bitch niggas as hard as rocks
Givin head to the glock, pretend it's hard cock
Splashin niggas I came slow through the block
I'm, the original, visual, individual
Ten times platinum your career's lookin critical
Reach for this, motherfuck being a criminal
Look in your bitch eyes, the vibe is subliminal
You wanna freestyle fuck that
I need at least seven figures to even touch that
But since everybody was underestimatin' my format
I dropped Ill Bomb and now niggas want more of that
Aint a rapper dead or alive fuckin wit me
Ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
Talk about paper, I can talk about broads
I can talk about movies, I can talk about awards
Fuck the fantasies, yo I got all four
And 2001'll be mine, by law
Why name the Greatest Of All Times?
Because for fifteen years I kept y'all standin in line
Lovin the way I shine and my lyrics combine
With the ruggedest, illest beats that Def Jam can find
Fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
My hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
Back in the days it was the M fast stick
But now the Bentley is all get more whores on the dick
This ones for Clue and my Riker's Island niggas
That remember when I came through
The big O B C C H D M 2 C 74
Little Nasi and the crew, y'all niggas come home

Word up, the new album gon' be the shit baby
Aint no doubt about it, E Pluribus Unum
Out of many one, The G.O.A.T., Greatest Of All Time...</pre>
