Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Slum dog millionaire
The underdog sign when nobody can
Big shows, sick flows
I'm on the roll, that's just how it goes
I think big, I act high
I chop it up in the streets like crack rock

Got lots of money
But I don't got everything
Got lots of honeys
But ain't got me a Queen!
Feel like a champ
But I don't got me a ring
Not me, not me yup
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around around)
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around around)

The fast life, the fast cars
I spend my time with 'em honeys at the bar
Bank roll, credit cards,
Up in the club they think they know
Just who I ARE
A big deal, a big star
Ridding big WHEELS
Ahaaa!

Got lots of money
But ain't got everything
Got lots of honeys
But ain't got me a Queen!
Buy lots of diamonds,
But I don't got me a ring
Not me, not me yup
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around)
(Not maybe just yourself), yup
(I'm looking in your face)
(The life from the party)
(And everything will stay stay), yup

Got lots of money
But I don't got everything
Got lots of money
But I don't got everything
Not me, not me yup
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around)
(The sun goes up), yup
(The sun goes down)
(And I'm always alone), yup
(No matter who's around)
(Not maybe just yourself), yup
(I'm looking in your face)
('Cause I'm the life from the party)
(And everything will stay stay), yup</pre>
