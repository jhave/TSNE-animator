Verse 1 [Kyjuan]
Ayyo I'm laid back and humble, yeah I'm cool wit it
Kinda hungry, give me a salad and a soup wit it
Aint no need for extra rolls, Sue comes wit it
Baby girl behind the counter lookin' cool wit
She got a fat ass, I know I went to school wit it
She was the type that said I wouldn't know what to do wit it
I kick that Willie Bo Bo aqua suit wit it, went trough wit it
Got her number, she ain't it so I'm through wit it
I let Pooh hit it, he let the crew hit it
Hold on lil' derrty, for two minutes
I think I left my herb man I ain't cool wit it
Murph Derrt say he got me now I'm cool wit it
I make a lotta dough, pay a lotta pay dues wit it
Pimpin' already, now I got the juice in it
I got the grey Vokal wit the blue in it
Loose, new, blue, fitted, I'm so cool wit it

Hook [Kyjuan &amp; (Ali)]

Verse 2 [Ali]
Ayyo Nas was talkin' but I was cool wit it

KRS was speakin but I was cool wit it
And I ain't even gon trip nigga I'm cool wit it
We gon rep us to the fullest hope you cool wit it
Lunatic's for the culture is you cool wit it?
If sauce, stand up yell out yep I'm cool wit it
Yo mo Leezy Nell, I'm done come act a fool wit it

Verse 3 [Nelly]
I woke up at 9:30, I was cool wit it
I said damn it's kinda early but I'm cool wit it
I had a message on my celly I'm like who did it?
Turns out, it was this chick I'd like to 'ooh' wit it
Now I'm tryin' to figure out if I'ma fool wit it
She used to be the cheerrleader type, school spirrit
You know the pom-poms, back flips, split wit it
I know a lot of niggaz tried but they didn't get it
Or maybe they had the game they just didn't spit it
Or they won't admit it, cuz they carry too much pride in it
I like to slide in it, flip it and dip it and take a ride in it
Hide in it, might flight glide in it
You know I did it, cuz I'm cool wit it
A lot of niggaz talkin' shit but I'm cool wit it
Walk in a party, lotta gawkin' but I'm cool wit it
Look outside, see what I'm parkin? you can't fool wit it

[Nelly]
Not at all
You can't fool wit none of that young mate
Why is you trippin of the 24 Escalade
Powdered baby blue wit the Gucci Lou interior
A-HA! slide on young playa
Just be cool wit yo losses
A-HA! Pimp Juice

Hook [Nelly &amp; (Murphy Lee)]

Verse 4 [Murphy Lee]
Look, Look

I grew up and had to bounce so she cool wit it
Baby sister got a car and she cool wit it
'Cause she work and go to school so I'm cool wit it
My granny don't like rap but she cool wit it
'Cause as long as I got a job then she cool wit it

Told me boy don't blow yo money and be cool wit it
So in other words derrty don't be a fool wit it
He said don't wind up in the motherfuckin news wit it
And help the family when you can and they cool wit it
Separate the hatas from the friends and be cool wit it
