Ya (cmg)
This mixtape here
It's strictly for the fans (yogottimusic dot com)
Trust me!
I want my album to drop more than you
Call the fucking label and ask them what happening
Dear world, fuck it
Truly yours!
King

I'm on my grown man flow band up flow,
Nigga I jus brought a phantom off the showroom floor
See these niggas subtweeting, but his fans don't know
He's a pussy and I expose this nigga I said a hoe
In the streets niggas look up to gotti and I understand why
Ain't on this slick shit nigga, I see eye to eye
Runnin around,talking down, playing games, nigga die
Young niggas in the clip, black nines, nothing but fire!
(ay let the beat sing to em)
Look, my brother back in jail, my songs leaking out
Little rappers playing with me
I'm trying to stop from clicking out
Did a show in Alabama, guess my strap was sticking out
Security to try the arrest nigga, but instead they kicked me out
I've been going through a lot of shit, fucking with this model bitch
Baby momma left a nigga and now it hard to see the kids
Record label can't get it right, they pushed the date back
Ross hit a nigga up try to put me on mayback
Tip hit a nigga up trying to give me grand hustle
All these niggas are my niggas and I respect the hustlers
Some of these niggas like my brothers
They've been real since day one
Realest nigga in it, I've been real since day one
And a nigga keep sayin I'm one song away
Fuck that, I'm 5 million dollars strong today!
[money machine sound]
[beep]
See when You heard me doing that money machine shit, nigga
That mean I got that mother fuck'n sack bro
Nigga I make M's nigga
You know what I'm talkin about
I show these niggas how to do this shit I'm the blue print nigga
Show these niggas how to make these millions, nigga
And I ain't drop shit but a nigga bitch off.
You know what I'm talkin about

I'm in a two door coup
With a see through roof
And the a dope boy roll and a glock 9 too
Red bitch on the passenger, she semi cute
But her head some serious, so you know what it do
When I say I love my niggers, that mean I love my niggers
Yeah, I rap for living, but I gotta plug for my niggers
I talk cocaine, cause I know cocaine
Ain't on that criss cross shit
I'm trying to stay in my lane.
Say I rap like I trap, I gotta stay on my game
I'm strapped 24/7 I got to stay on my aim
They say Keep it real gotti I say I been doing that
They say the niggers are white, I say influence that
I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid
But I ain't fucked up with it
The streets know what it is
(I'm on my li-li-liter shit niggas following the kid)
(but I ain't fucked up with it)
(the streets know what it is)

My little homies keep telling me to smash on em
Met a bad bitch and I spend a little cash on her
Cope a new whip so I left the paper tags on it
Got a couple checks but I really hate to brag on it
Catch me in the club, Luis shoe, Louis rag on em
Standing on the couch, popping bottles dropping swagg on em
Zilla up next and I bet the pad on em
Soon as he said the name Cmg drop the bag on em
[beep]

I mean you know shit crazy
Cuz like the other night a nigga was in atlanta
We fucking around on the internet
And we see a moherfucking itunes ad
Like yo gotti Jan. 10th
I mean shit counted thru me for a loop
Cuz I didn't know nothing about it
And its like dec. 23

I'm a real nigga 1st, get money 2nd
Break bread with my niggas, we like family so respect it
Bad blood in the camp and nigga feel neglected
I try to work it out before it get all hecked
But if its about a bitch, just know I don't respect it
And if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie
I say if you talking foul I hope its ain't in my direction homie

Ay see
I believe nigga got a problem they handle it
You don't talk, you don't tweet
If its all good its all good
Know what I'm talkin about

I'm from the city of the murders
Were industry niggas ain't never heard of us
They be like who the fuck is gotti, nigga google me
Oh I'm a fuck nigga, that shit must be new to me
I'm damn near 30 and a nigga ain't done shit to me
Put your hands on a real nigga then its 1st degree
Get it (pow)
Hit it (pow)
Split it
Thats all my niggas do is murk some
I'm trying to hurt some
Mego got a 18 wheeler, he trying to work some
That bitch bad as hell, she trying to twerk some
I'm give that bitch back to you cause she worst-some
I'm out
C-M-G
I'm king </pre>
