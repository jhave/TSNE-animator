"She won't come, just when you want it.."

[Everlast]
Ya see I'm Irish, but I'm not a leprechaun
You wanna fight, then step up and we'll get it on
You'll get a right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A decendant of Dublin with titanic skill
I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin, you can bet you'll be chokin
on a fist full of nuttin, meanwhile I'll be puffin
on a fat blunt, what punk?  You don't know the half
Tryin to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin, I'm buckwhylin
The House of Pain is pumpin, start jumpin
Freak it, funk it, back seat trunk it
If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin it
Then you'll get a beatin just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off
We got the cake that you're tryin to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shileighly
I don't have dreads cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the Tin Man
you got no heart, here comes the good part
I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck 'em down
No fuckin around, homeboy ya get clowned like Krusty
Trust me, you shouldn't play.. and by the way

Chorus: Everlast + "Cheech and Chong" scratches

Top o' the mornin to ya.. "What's the hassle man?" 
Top o' the mornin to ya.. "What's the hassle man?"
Top o' the mornin to ya.. "What's the hassle man?" 
Top o' the mornin to ya..
"Hey, are you givin us a hassle man?"

[Everlast]
Greetings, salutations
Peace to the Nations of Zulu and Islam
Crack the bottle, rev the throttle
Put the gear in, now you're steerin
like Mario Andretti, so let me kick it
cause I can make a wicked - noise like a cricket
Rubbin his legs, my rhymes are like eggs
Allah'll keep layin em, I'll keep sayin em
This is the House of Pain, we're far from plain
But we're not fancy, Ron and Nancy
So "Just Say No," but I say go
straight to Hell, I kiss and tell
So if you're a hoe, all my friends know
What you gotta say?  Let's hit the hay
And have no delay, and yo, by the way..

Chorus

[Everlast]
Extra extra, read all about it
How could ya doubt it?  Now scream and shout it!
The House of Pain, soon will reign
over the Hip-Hop scene in white gold and green

[Danny Boy]
I rip shit and backflip like a Jedi
I roll with the groove and I'm smooth and you can bet I
Come correct and get respect when I'm flowin
Collectin my dough, I got you're girlfriend hoein
And how do I know that she's sprung?
I know she's sprung cause yo, the T's hung.. like a
Shetland pony, gettin paid like Sony
So never ever try to play me out like a phony
Cause I can get real thick like a bowl of Malt-O-Meal
And by the way..
