(Spice 1) 
Hit the freeway in a 850 goin about a hundred and forty, sporty 
Niggas slowin down as if they know me 
owe me a Chronic session but I keep on mobbin' I got my own 
Fiendin goin to the zone, rollin up I see a Vega loan 
Watchin out for the po-po cause the gangsta braise alert the coppers 
Smokin under them choppers O.G.'s see me and give me propers 
They say whattup to the Easy Bay Gangsta each and every time 
As I took my hat and light my Chronic up in the sunshine 
I gets my mobb on just like all you other players 
Lookin out for dead Presidents who want that green paper 
Put out my doobie as I mobb up off the freeway 
I'm goin side-a-ways, this way, that-a-way 
I see my partners up in the alley fightin they pit bulls 
High performance, old schools, with fat dulls 
Catch me cussin at the cluckers on the street 
tryin to stop myself from pullin out my heat, I'm mobbin' today 

(Chorus: Spice 1) 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 

(Spice 1) 
Po-po passin me up, lookin all inside my car 
it's full of smoke, rollin down my window, they see me choke 
And spit a loogie out on the street because I'm hella high 
Rollin around, maddoggin with some Red Eye 
Talkin slow and show them about which way to go 
Just hittin corners, tryin to find myself a liquor store 
Hustlers slangin on the stow-front tryin to make some ends 
I'm gettin deals on blunts from the Iranians 
They know my face cause I comin up at them every day 
For some Hennessy and lemon squeeze a Alazay 
Then I'm back on the streets drivin through the track 
See fools fresh out the Penn, killers from way back 
Hoppin out the hooptie chop it up with real ass O.G. homies 
Jerk players only, cause ain't no time for fakes or phonies 
Come catch a glimpse of a real player up in the Bay 
Gotta get my pay okay, I'm mobbin' today 

(Chorus: Spice 1) 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 
Shoobedoop de doop de doop doo, doo 
Mobbin' today, hey 

(Interlude: Spice 1) 
Yeah I've seen up out there player, 
runnin with a five hundred knowhatI'msayin? 
850, guard be, knowI'msayin, somethin proper, 
somethin fly, say knowhatI'msayin? 
Get your mobb on you know, youknowhatI'msayin? 
Or you can sweat these busters with their mean muggin,
