Yo whassup, this is Tajai of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
and my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[1]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[2]
I get inspired by the blunts too (too)
I'll front you (you) if you hang with a bunk crew (chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

[3]
Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the gut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[4]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
cause the man's all that
All fat - I be the chill from 93 'til

[Chorus: S.O.M.]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til

[5]
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
another person's business, I cause dizzyness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

[6]
Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
under their noses, this bro's quick
yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid

[7]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the hoe in's
basement, my ace spent
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[8]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
who got the fat sacks we can max pumpin fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit

[Chorus]
Hah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til
Yeahhh this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til

[9]
I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own click
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggaz is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

[10]
Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

[11]
Flip - the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The ex..traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[12]
I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get - my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

[Chorus]
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
Huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
Yo, this is how we chill, from 93 'til
Aww yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how.. we chill, from 93 'til

[Outro]
Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?
  Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin
Yeah tell me who's chillin then then Plus

Casual - you know he's chillin
  Yo, Pep Love - he gotta be chillin
Jay Biz - ya know he's chillin
  Aiyyo man, my my man Snupe is chillin man
Yo Mike G - you know he's here chillin
  Heh, my man Mike P - ya know he gotta chill
Del the Funky Homosapien is CHILLIN
  Aiy ay my man Domino - yo he's chillin
Yeah.. it's like that, yeah..
