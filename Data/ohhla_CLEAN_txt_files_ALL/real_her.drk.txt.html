[Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dyin to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
Ohhhh

[Interlude: Drake]
Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down
But I gotta say, oh baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already, feel like I know the real her

[Chorus: Drake]
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody will look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
Ohhhh

[Drake]
They keep tellin me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then somethin isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
Ohhhhhh

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book, by its cover
I don't want be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
about her, and she wit it if I'm wit it and I'm wit it
I know what makes her smile but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first but it's better than your last
Tunechi

[Chorus]

[André 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw the hoe a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped, and this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote "bad bitches" work the whole flo'
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her, niggaz that are married don't wanna go home but
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us, are colorblind cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise State, can't see her play or the team cause
E'rybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't souls will later on say to them "That ain't true"
All of them will have an opinion, but y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you're unsure I'll take you on tour to a place you can stick that in
Well, sittin here sad as hell listenin to Adele, I feel ya baby
+Someone Like You+, more like someone unlike you or, somethin that's familiar maybe
And I can tell, that she wants a baby, and I can yell, "Girl that you're crazy"
Oh what the hell, nope can't be lazy, please be careful, bitches got the rabies</pre>
