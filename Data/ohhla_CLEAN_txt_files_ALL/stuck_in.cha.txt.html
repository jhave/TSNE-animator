I got a degree
But my felony won't let me get a job
Life's so hard
And just today
Somebody stole my car and the bus don't run my way
I think I'll walk the streets today
It seems like I'm stuck in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Sometimes it seems like I'm stuck, I'm in the ghetto, Ooh
But I got love for the ghetto, ghetto
When I go to my friend
Now with open arms, let me in
And everyday
We just dream and scheme and drink our lifes away
I think I'll fly the sky today
It seems like I'm stuck in the ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Sometimes it seems like I'm stuck, I'm in the ghetto, Ooh
But I got love for the ghetto, ghetto
But everytime I seem to keep my feet on the ground...</pre>
