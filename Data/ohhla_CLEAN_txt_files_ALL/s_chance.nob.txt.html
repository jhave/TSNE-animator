[Verse 1: Young Noble]
People like to wait till times is hard
Before they find a little time for god
We all grinding hard!
Sometimes we don't even get the message
Before I count the paper
I'm counting up my blessings
Deeper then rap every verse it true
Look around how many people doing worse then you, Yeah!
We still complain hide behind the pain
We are all worth sin in me it's all in the brain
Young Niggas better watch the signs
The good die young in these hostile times
You gon' wish you can turn back the hands of time
Stuck on the block and your whole life passing you by
Pay attention to your homies before you take there advice
Analyze what they sayin' where they at in there life
Get yourself around people thats a positive influence
Make a positive change little homey and stick to it

[Chorus: Young Noble]
The little homies never got a second chance
The big homies never got a second chance
My enemies never got a second chance
These young niggas never got a second chance

[Verse 2: Big D]
Traumatic flashbacks of the rain that falls black
My lyrical bars drop quick like sand traps
Lost souls like Tupac and Outlawz gang related soundtrack
Wise sentences venomous nemesis since the genesis
Reality turned mythical like Pegasus!
Some took a rebels path now they watch the devil dance
Praying for a second chance in effort to be a better man
Exchanged fetters for feathers, man
Too many lives takin since the creation of knives
Guns and such bombs abusive dads and f'ucked up moms
Kids that don't understand what's right what's wrong
I've committed too many sins, witnessed to much death
Suicidal images in my head of leaving cuts in my neck
Talkin' tense of the past cause I feel events are destined perhaps
Perfectionist? damned? if my life was destined in the sands

[Chorus: Young Noble]
The little homies never got a second chance
The big homies never got a second chance
My enemies never got a second chance
These young niggas never got a second chance

[Verse 3: Grizzly]
My rhymes are venomous
Invisible infamous images
An intimate imagery influenced killing them elements
My business is limitless, stimulus, spitting my synthesis
Lyrical impetuous, surrender to my wickedness
Built like pyramids, tongue made out of eloquence
While I see those rappers just talking with a mouth of decadence
Teaching little kids arrogance, limiting their excellence
But y'all can't reach us analysts cos were flyer than pegasus

Grizz, what have you done other than Hustling?
Your just another thug tryna' sell another gram
Have you ever tried or worked to be a better man?
So tell me do u think that you deserve a second chance?

No I don't.. Cos I'm on to the streets
Blood, sweat and tears, hustle hard for the green
Or for a second chance cos it's not fuckin' free
So I take a bigger step like Godzilla feet

My kind of jungle, concrete
Not anyone that could survive these raw streets
I stand my ground, strong roots like palm trees
How could we be good when everything is not clean?!
The only time I could right my wrongs
Is on a paper just to write a song
No father figure to show me how
Or what to do.. When times get hard. Preach!

[Chorus: Young Noble]
The little homies never got a second chance
The big homies never got a second chance
My enemies never got a second chance
These young niggas never got a second chance</pre>
