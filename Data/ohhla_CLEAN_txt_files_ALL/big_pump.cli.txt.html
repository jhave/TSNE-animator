[Intro]
COME ON!! Awww!!
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Baby, yeah
 
[Chorus]
Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "YEAH!!"
 
[Verse One: George Clinton]
You're my lover, yes, you are
Shining brighter than the brightest star
You turn me on so naturally
Your heavenly body only I can see
People are saying, baby, you're so smart
Picture your mind, it's a work of art
Feeling like a frog and I wanna jump
Got to do your body with the big pump
 
[Chorus]
Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Pumping by the big pump"
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump 
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "YEAH!!"
 
[Verse Two: Unidentified Artist]
You've been shooting this crossbow
It's the chance to dance and fall in love, move your torso
Don't be afraid to shake that.. (SHAKE THAT!!) back
Move your rump to the pump track
Get your back up off the wall, get with the bass that pumps
Ya jumps cause you got to dig the stroke
It's no joke, cause the groove's all that
Move your body, baby, cause you know it's fat
In a club after hours
Doing the pump, is sure to move the wallflowers
You're up now, it's time to get down
If you got a bad foot, use the good foot like James Brown
Let the rhythm improve your step, swing your partner
And if you can't swing with that, it's all in the technique
But this beat's so fat, you look good with left feet
So feel the heartbeat with the bump
Cause you know, you dig the big pump
 
[Hook]
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Good God, you dig the big pump
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Good God, dig the big pump
Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!! Pump!!
Good God, break it down
 
[Verse Three: George Clinton]
If it could make you dig this philosophy
Then I'd be doing better than the ones before me
I'm feeling like a frog and I need to jump
Talking about doing that body up
Talking about doing that body up
Talking about doing that body up with the big pump
With the big pump, good God!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse Four: Unidentified Artist]
Under a thick brick house Judy with a booty that's fat
And I'll show you how to skin the cat
Yeah, cause I'm digging the format
I ain't laying my game 'til I get you to the welcome mat
As we dance the horizontal
When I'm in the skins, baby, I'm hitting lotto
Cause I likes to humpty hump
I'm up for the down stroke with the big pump
 
[Chorus]</pre>
