How did roaches get started
Started by dirty people and
They was nasty, sleazy, sloppy
They house they never clean it

Roaches have big families
Your house they think they own
I tried to kill one on the couch
Using my telephone

Roaches think they cute
Girl i'm not impressed
It ticks me off when I find 'em
Wearin' my momma's dress

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away
Look at all these roaches
I can't take it no more
Get up at night, turn on the light
And see the floor show

Did you hear the one about tina
Who's sloppy as a moose
She got some raid, then she sprayed
They drank it like orange juice

Did you hear the one about michael
They say his roaches are gay
I tried to fumigate to make 'em straight
But they just stayed that way

Lots of pesticides
Big money I done spent
None of them be workin'
So I charge my roaches rent

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away
Look at all these roaches
I can't take it no more
Get up at night, turn on the light
And see the floor show

Can't go no place
The drain board they would linger
They see my face, they laugh
They flip me off with the middle finger

They run so fast
They always get away
I bet you there'll be roaches
Runnin' around on judgement day

I think i'll write the mayor
Have him pass a law
That would help me get these nasty roaches
Off my wall

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away
Look at all these roaches
I can't take it no more
Get up at night, turn on the light
And see the floor show

(roach and rapper arguEing)

My house is fine, I ain't got time
For roaches over here
Came home from a hard days work
And found they drank all my beer
My house is fine, I ain't got time
For roaches over here
Came home from a hard days work
And found they drank all my beer

ROACH:
Well I be chillin' in the bathtub
Swimmin' in the pool
Eatin' leftovers
Is the golden rule
Well i'm the hip hop roach
And i'm raisin' hell
When i'm in NY
I'm down with LL
Rats don't like me
But I don't care
'cause i'm down by law
And this I swear
When i'm in L.A.
I'm down with Bobby Jimmy
I like bad ??????
And he's got plenty

The roach
The roach
The roach is on the wall

BOBBY JIMMY:
This is a raid
Raid
Raid
Raid
Raid

Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
Stop roaches from runnin' around
Stop roaches from runnin'
