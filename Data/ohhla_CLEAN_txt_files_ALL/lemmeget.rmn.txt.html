[Redman]
Uhh, chka-yeah
Chka-UHH, chka-yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
Saukrates!

[Chorus 2X: Saukrates]
Have you ever been so proud in your life
You livin on your own cloud in the sky
Wanna take e'rybody wit'chu
Forget one, lemme get two

[Redman]
Yeah! Yo, hey
I love travellin and seein people
Showin the ignorant my color skin is equal
I like tryin different thai food and seafood
Makin my episode of life another sequel
I like flyin on Delta and Continental
First class, playin them elevator instrumentals
I'm in the window, got on my headphones
Listenin to Big Pun and Wyclef Jean
It's like Exxon, I get gassed up
I shuffle 'round the board like Cassius
That's us when the plane land, hey man
It ain't hard cause I can do it like a caveman
Fix my Ray-Bans, I hit the hotel
Do my show, get my money, hit the hotel
Sittin at the hotel like "Oh well!"
I call shorty that I met today at Modell's
Go girl, it's like we in The Matrix
I'm in a new city, with suitcases
I'm overseas with bills with new faces
And if you're not about that you need a facelift
Yup~!

[Chorus]

[Saukrates]
Lemme get two, lemme get two {*3X*}
Lemme get two, bartender lemme get two
Yo
If it's a high life you seekin then you say it
Cause how the hell you gonna win the game if you ain't playin?
I'm in Monaco, swimmin in the deep end with 3 dimes, this ain't dominos
Well maybe it was, I set 'em up to knock 'em down and go
The skeletons in the closet, I'm makin a new deposit
She was never so erotic 'til we got to the ex-o-tic
-tic, now I'm thinkin
that this time bomb is about to explode
Got me wishin that it was different than money, contradiction is funny
I just told y'all to play the game if y'all wan' eat
The truth is it's what you make it
That's why I got my baby girl naked
Long before I bought them tickets to Turks and Caicos
We love each other, beyond under covers
That's why I'm feelin so high like them Wright brothers
Fly, I hope it never take material
for you to get yo' Applejax cereal, here we go

[Chorus]

[Saukrates]
Lemme get two, lemme get two {*3X*}
Lemme get two, bartender lemme get two

[Redman]
I'm on vacation BEITCH!
And I'm flyin high</pre>
