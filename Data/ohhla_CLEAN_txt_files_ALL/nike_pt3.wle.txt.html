[WALE]
Southside what up
Uptown what up
PG what up
Moco what up!

[Verse 1: Jennifer Malsch]
The revolution of an era
You think you're revolutionary 'cause you got a shirt with Che Guevera
Look in the mirror and tell me what you see
Decked out Commonwealth
Yeah I'm rockin' Stussy
Got my Nike Boots with the laces all crossed
Welcome to DC shout out Mambo Sauce
On Billboard for weeks and more weeks to come
DC's on the map so y'all better run
DC is my city and I'm pretty sure
That from Potomac to the Eastern Shore
Never ever have we ever done it ever before
And although we getting close the DMV's got more

[HOOK]
[Jennifer Malsch]
Just check the Nike swoosh
Cause we will carry you
And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce!
Flyer than the rest of 'em! [x4]
[WALE]
Southside what up
Uptown what up
PG what up
Moco what up!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Malsch]
But they forget what to remember
Just know the DMV it's got a brand new music member forever
Don't waste your temper
Don't bother hating on me
Rock, hip hop, and r &amp; b
Always be a part of me
95.5 and 93.9 been doing what they do like Amy Dub does lines
And I been a star but you ain't seen me shine
It goes through your ears and runs down your spine

[HOOK]
[Jennifer Malsch]
Just check the Nike swoosh
Cause we will carry you
And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce!
Flyer than the rest of 'em! [x4]
[WALE]
Southside what up
Uptown what up
PG what up
Moco what up!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
If it's bullshit they want, bullshit I shall
Yeah I'm a break 'em off, nig go head and tell
Red lobster every day, shrimp heads and tails
And bad bitches give me head and tell
And bad bitches give me head and tell
See I'm ahead but you stay the snail
I move, they see the back of my Nikes
Got to the end of the tunnel and I was the light
Always strapped so I was alright
Naked women rub my back and ask me how was my night
I say bitch stay out my business
When we fuck, she say just stay out my kidneys
And don't say it if Simon didn't
America idolize a nigga
But they better come bitch out me
And you are you too but bitch I'm three!

[Jennifer Malsch]
Flyer than the rest of 'em! [x4]
