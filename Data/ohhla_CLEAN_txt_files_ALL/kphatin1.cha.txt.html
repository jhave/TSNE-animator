[Chamillionaire]
I see you tryna hate on Koopa the mixtape god
Keep talking that noise
I see you tryna hate on Koopa the mixtape god
A round of applause cause I'm bout to...
I see you tryna hate on the mixtape god
Keep hating, keep hating, you know I gotta go hard
I see you tryna hate, you can keep talking that noise
Keep talking, keep talking, you know I gotta go hard

Attention, attention, calling Zab Juda
He's not here so I hit him like BOO-YAA
Kill him with a verse, I'm the man with the Ruger
Ink on the bullet, bet ya I can tattoo ya
You don't want that do ya? Your homeboy's like NO!
Harder we hate then the harder he go
He gon' rise to be great, we gon' fall to the flo'
All y'all boys tryna count my bucks, male groupies all on my nuts
If you can't walk a mile in my shoes then tell me why you tryna put on my chucks
Go on lace 'em up, yeah I'm talking to you, go on lace 'em up
Do it the G way, hit the freeway, prove to me that you can race a truck
You bad homie, take a flight superman
You the man, nah you the man, stupid man, King Koopa man!
You forgot, remember me? I'm the one you call because you depend
On for food, tried to bite the hand that feed, I withdrew my hand
Super deeper super soak, know I'm still the same boss
Your career will be deceased, see concrete and taste chalk
If you ain't as focused as me then you just can't talk
Damn Chris, how you get fired on your day off?
Hurt me? I beg to differ, I make my way to where y'all stay
Maybe with a new baby sitter cause you to me, you're like child's play
You're too emotional, too emotional, too emotional and you approaching who?
I'm revoking you, bomb your vocal booth, super soaker you
Whoo! I swear these male groupies be acting homo
Give me that but let go my hand before we can take a photo
They like "Man Koopa! How you ain't tryna deal with the nonsense no mo'?"
Cause they keep on putting tears on my Sean John polo

Go hard
I wake up everyday feeling gay, I start my car
Hit the boulevard, I'm bout to go hard
Just let them haters hate but the paper chase won't pause
Keep acting like broads and I'ma go hard

Pull up in a 5-5-0
That ain't him, um, yes it is bro
Ain't no way, I don't think so
When I walk up, "Ay, what's up fool?"
What's up Koopa, how you been?
Feeling them rims you got on your Benz
Where was I, very little twin?
Heard your mixtape, you go hard with a pen
Switch - Heard you been tryna talk down
Standing right here homie, what's up now?
What's up mayne? What's up now?
Switch - Koopa mayne you gotta calm down
That wasn't me, I ain't do that
Why you getting all in my face? Fall back
Well you heard that but they really ain't fat
Game tryna make you mad... that's wack
We been tight, we buzz right
You the hardest rapper that's on the mic
Why you gotta feel like you wanna fight?
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fight

I see you tryna hate on Koopa the mixtape god
Keep talking that noise, I'm bout to go hard
I see you tryna hate on Koopa the mixtape god
A round of applause, I'm bout to go hard
I see you tryna hate on the mixtape god
Keep hating, keep hating, you know I gotta...
I see you tryna hate, you can keep talking that noise
Keep talking, keep talking, you know I gotta go hard</pre>
