[Nelly]
oh oh oh oh oh oh

So you the kang boy

you gotta be blind to sell more records than me boy
I can't complain boy

I'm like a run away slave I'm off the chain boy
I'm bout' to jet boy

I'm about to round princess cut and bagette boy
don't disrespect boy
I'll break your neck boy
I got niggaz that sherm it up and get wet boy
we driving vets and bentley coupes boy
I ain't lying check my garage, I tell the truth boy
I do it big boy

I do some shit that you can't even do at all boy
platinum tooth boy

you can run two miles and you still in my yard

[Chorus]

[Big Gipp]
Quarter Quarters Nickels Dollars Dimes everytime boy
butterfly my 84', fly first class boy
dipping through the hood candy coated paint boy
triple zero dope sacks no tax boy
you walk fast, well I slow-poke boy
you grip the leather, well I grip oak boy
I keep a crease in my Dickies when I corner hang
I love to sip champangne, funny ass names
ladies love to see me Gucci or many of poochie
love to see me in the gazelles to King Louis'
shingles hanging from the end of my pants boy
they love to see me do the old man dance boy
I smoke plenty grass boy
I'm touching on the ass boy

I'm from the South boy

and touch they toes boy

[Chorus]

Lil Flipper..
[Lil' Flip]

I'm from the South boy

pull up in my drop top, you like boy
to you it's a Bentley, to me it's a toy
I'm like a pimp boy
I ride spinners boy
I'm hopping out with 3000 dollar tennis boy
come take a look at me
I'm off the chain boy

I'm Lil Flip boy

[Chorus]
