[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Bump bump, ha ha ha
Make it bump, bump bump
Bump bump, said what?
Bump bump, yeah
Yo, kick this shit homie!!
Ha ha ha

[King Tee]
Once again, it's the shadiest
In the 80's when you was pushing Stadias
I was rolling on Mercedes with the alias
Daily, throwing up my radius
Maybe it's why your ladies afraid of me
Don't know what to say to me
But she's intrigued by the diamond cut watch
The black silk socks, the video is on the pock
Let's move the party to the Doc Dre at 80 foot yachts is
And you can hear the bass from blocks
Fool, wet bar just to fade ya
Whores left behind, keep blowing up my pager
And it's a freaky scene, chains and whips
Only bring the squeaky clean tricks that came to mix with Tha Liks
The authentic, Indo is scented
Limo, windows tinted, so you can't see who's in it
There's no limit to how many mics get tore a minute
If the party's cracking then I'm in it

[Chorus: Bud'da X2]
We got the party locked down, what you wanna do?
Ladies wanna dance, homies do too
Don't even bring a strap to this
King Tee'll make you clap to this

Word up, y'all  -----&gt; Quote from a previous record

[King Tee]
Now, you're rolling with the King
Flossing with no flaws in the ring
Tossing to leave jaws in a sling, often
The scrilla peeler, cabbage clutcher, kitty luster
Tiny toucher, not a buster, hustler
Rush the dancefloor, see a whore
That make me wanna "Be The One With You" like Usher
Plus the cluster, the type black in the bar back was cool
The front and the back was cool
So we do, Cognac for two
That make the King wanna Act A Fool (remember that?)
Player haters hot, cause I got more gold than Willie Gault and them
I ain't faulting them, but let's talk about sex like Salt and them
I won't end, you won't gain, let's not pretend
I'll get the party hot like the cops walked on your blocks (What's up?)
Cause King Tee got it locked

[Chorus: X2]

[King Tee]
Some of y'all still don't know what King means, it means ruler
Castle dweller, old schooler with the wine cellar
And a drawbridge, my troops got you crew hostage
While I'm getting head at their grapes and sausage
Y'all kids wanna know how the boss lives?
Crib, saucy like ribs, and I got first dibs
Soon as you crack the bottle, toss it back 'til it's hollow
Mackin' everything from hoodrats to supermodels
Never subtle, save your rebuttal
You couldn't get play in a huddle
So ladies tell your man tonight, you can't tonight
He gotta use his hand tonight, I guess I planned it right
We can smash out in the glass house
Hit the hotel, pull the cash out
I'll hit it 'til you pass out, then slide back to the spot
Cause Aftermath and King Tee got it locked, yeah!!

[Chorus: X4]

[Outro]
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee
We gotta get in to you, aww wweee</pre>
