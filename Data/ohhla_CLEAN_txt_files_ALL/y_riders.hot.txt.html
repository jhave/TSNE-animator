[Baby]
Off top, peep this lil' four youngstas out
Watch how they lay it down

[Juvenile]
Say baby, hand me the chopper, let me cuttin' loose
Nigga talkin' crazy but lil' daddy ain't +BulletProof+
Put him in the water with the sharks, let me see if he can swim
Ya playin' wit'cha life wodie, you hangin' on a limb
Boy y'kno you scared and I know you is
You been talkin' a whole lotta shit but lemme tell you this
I'ma Hot Boy a-k-a the Juvenile
Come in through your door with that iron - callin' ya out
You want do? ya bitch you
Got me all rav'd up and shit and I'm ready ta split you
+Tha G-Code+ I live by it and die by it
If you play with me - ya playing with ya life right
This ain't no walk in the park - it's a walk in the pen
Niggaz try'na take that ass, make it their girlfriends
Na' eat that meat, fold my clothes
Cuz all you niggaz ain't nothing but hoes

[Baby]
Nigga what? I don't give a fuck
Lil' BGeezy show these niggaz you don't give a fuck

[B.G.]
My presidents make a nigga break it off
Becuz they know if they don't off this earth
I'ma take them off, nigga I play it raw
You think about droppin' your nuts, better pick them up
Cuz you and everybody wish that I'ma hit 'em up
So nigga give me mine, don't make me have ta take it
Cuz I put your family in a fucked up situation
Your mama like where my son at?
Everybody know I done that
But the law, don't know where the gun at
So they can't touch me, can't question me
Can't fuck wit me - so it's an unsolved mystery
BGeezy a dawg yea
Don't give a fuck about the law
Ready ta send you ta the morgue yea
Have you feelin' like a number 2 pencil
When I put that lead in you
They fly ta H-Town in Continental
Live with a bad bitch, have my hoe strapped too
I got a Mac-11, she got a tec-22

[Turk]
Block of blocks, I rob niggaz
Better drop it like its hot 'fore you die nigga
You can think it's a game if you want, they fly nigga
Them hollows hit you live, uh uh nigga
You be left as a memory, on a fresh white is ya picture
I keep it on the low, so no one a know that I did ya
Playin' like that, these days niggaz a stain ya
Play the game rap, kidnap ya L.G. and (rape) her
I'm dirty so they call me low down - where I'm from
Shot first, I can't miss with a chopper with a drum
I'm shootin' ta kill - no wheel chairs or shit bags
I shoot you in places where I know you gon' die fast
Ya head and ya chest wodie
Catch ya dippin' by ya whole house when ya loaded
Give it too ya in blood, that's one way of solvin' problems my nigga
Come around my spot - don't know ya that's a problem my nigga

[Lil' Wayne]
All I know is bend swangin' - make the enemy block scorch
Nigga I been hangin' - oh I ain't just jump off out the porch
I'ma iron toter, my niggaz got me drinkin' Henne' - got my mind towed up
So all I do is +Spin tha Bend+ I keep my rag top
I had it on ever since the day my dad died
And now it's on and I'm ready for guerilla war
This C.M.B. - y'kno who my only niggaz are, the 17th
I put it down for my lil' thug niggaz - too young ta get in the club niggaz
But waitin' front so when you come out they bust nigga
Trust nigga, this shorty wild
And I been thuggin' with BGeezy - he taught me how
Now play with me and watch it catch it fire
I hit'cha block with the long clip - ride it - fryer
Now watch how I make my bullets spread like gengivitis
Lil' Wayne - Cash Money Record's young rider, young rider

[Baby]
There you have it nigga, off top, four lil' youngstas
Knockin' niggaz dick in they dirt, ya understand?
So if you can't get with this here put ya dick in the sand
Nigga we got this shit, lockin' this shit, doin' this shit
Cash Money Millionaires and Fresh droppin' this shit
Nigga if you'ont like it you can suck my dick
what Ha! - what Ha! - what Ha! - what Ha! - what Ha! - what Ha!- what Ha!
We doin' this bitch, get it or get with it
If not motherfuck ya nigga</pre>
