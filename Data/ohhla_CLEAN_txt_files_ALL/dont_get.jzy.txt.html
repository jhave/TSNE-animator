[Verse 1]
Trunk full of yoya,  here's the situation
Flash light in my eyes, he want my registration
Should I stay or should I run
Got hard, got soft, got pills, got guns
My driver license is revoked
Just got done burning, so I know he smell the smoke
But never let 'em see you sweat
Cause if he search the trunk, he might find the teck
Or bag full of O'S rapped in duct tape between some dirty ass clothes
But I talked to him the right way
He told me slow it down and have a nice day

[Chorus]
You can do your thing shawty, its ok to flauce
But there still one rule player, don't get caught
For everything you gained and everything you lost
But there still one rule pimpin', don't get caught
For every ho you hit dawg and every ho you tossed
Cause there still one rule player, don't get caught
And you can ride clean shawty, you ain't got to walk
But there still one rule player, don't get caught

[Verse 2]
Some niggaz rob, some niggaz slang
Some niggaz stack, some niggaz bang
But I congratulate, not playa hate
You in the streets pimpin', make your move, get your cake
Fuck what you heard through the grape vine
You out of line nigga, I'ma straight line
And I don't believe in wasting time
Will catch them hoes later, stay on your grind
Got a low tolerance for ignorance
You think it's pleasure, I think its business
The streets didn't raise no fool
When you live by the code nigga there's only one rule

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Got the phone call, had a funny feeling
Told him everything was cool, that I was chilling
We used to chill out and smoke blunts
And I aint seen him in awhile, maybe a couple months
He said he wondered why he seemed anxious
First thing on my mind is go and get the stainless
Make his folks pay a ransom bout him
On that bullshit, make a good example out of him
This nigga hot, he on fire
I hope his ass aint wearing no wire
Nah dog you bullshitting
Said his partner set him up, that nigga snitching

[Chorus x2]</pre>
