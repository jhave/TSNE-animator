Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Aiyyo! I'm ready for whatever this world brings to me
I'm ready for the night, I'm ready for tomorrow
Whatever's after that you know what I'm saying, let's go
We stay fly new clothes on smoking on that Drake
till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by
need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Ain't a damn thing change I'm happy to get away
shawty's in the morning she's grabbing on me to stay
I'm ready for the next day, just text me
she said I hit it out the park like feinway
Aye it's just one nights work after
stay up late and sleeping in my shirt
Girl I gotta leave now I need to get to work
I'm a young heart breaker believe me it's a curse
Hey I stay focused cause the money comes first
but my real life situations I throw em in the verse
That's the formula of the truth
it's more than what I do I'm exploring it for the proof
Who am I? Mother fucker who are you?
Don't be asking questions you should know the answer to
You should know my name
don't forget me bout to take over the game I'm ready
We stay fly new clothes on smoking on that Drake
till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by
need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Uh yeah I'm ready to have the glory I'm ready to have the name
I'm ready to have the fortune, I'm ready to have the fame
When I get up in the game it's never gon be the same
those to dumb to notice tell em to use their brain
I spend a whole day on the cloud
firetrucks comin through tryin to get me down
Mom say she proud cause I'm stickin to my dreams
get myself out to big and better things
It's the high life boy I live the fly life
honey's want my number cause I rhyme nice
ain't that some shit she gave her girl
the camera sayin can we have a pic, click
so let us speak a thousand words
shawty says she want me cause I'm down to earth
aha tell gravy you won't forget me
cause I'm headed to the top, I'm ready
We stay fly new clothes on soakin on that Drake
till I'm so far gone I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
Baby girl you fly but we got away let's take a drive by
need to get away I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready</pre>
