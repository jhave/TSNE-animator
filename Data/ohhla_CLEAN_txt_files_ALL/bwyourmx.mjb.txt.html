[Raekwon]
We used to do the smurf together and bump
Hit Macys up and do {?} all down in the trunk
Aligator blazers and three fingers, playing the boat
Holding that thang, you holding my mans
Like a westside flick with a fly shorty
A bunch of young live niggas want you but their money is corny
What it do lady' Kiss your man hand and let him through sweetie
Watch it, she got a man, it's the remix

[Mary J. Blige]
Chemistry was crazy from the get-go
Neither one of us knew why
We didn't deal nothing overnight
Cuz a love like this takes some time
People start off as a phase
Said we can't see that
Now from top to bottom
They see that we did that (yes)
It's so true that (yes)
We've been through it (yes)
We got real (cencored) (yes)
See baby we been

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Too strong for too long (and I can't be without you baby)
And I'll be waiting up until you get home (cus I can't sleep without you baby)
Anybody who's ever loved, ya know just what I feel
Too hard to fake it, nothing can replace it
Call the radio if you just can't be without your baby

[Mary J. Blige]
I got a question for ya
See I already know the answer
But still I wanna ask you
Would you lie' (no)
Make me cry' (no)
Do somethin' behind my back and then try to cover it up?
Well, neither would I, baby
My love is only your love (yes)
I'll be faithful (yes)
I'm for real (yes)
And with us you'll always know the deal
We've been

[Chorus w/ Raekwon ad-libs]

[Raekwon]
Ayo I heard you in the hood like Hilary
Expensive boots and bags, bullets holding mad artillary
I been seen it coming like an all red, this was the date
Your whip change cus you wanna be more {?}
I blessed you with half my tolernace
Copped you the R5 and you went and crashed it up for following
And yeah, you let dons be dons
The chemistry so sincere, I'ma show and prove it's on
Fuck hanging, I need luck slangin
Plus when you got a real nigga in the cut, what, that's bangin
Kissing your head, getting bread, trying to avoid plagues
Chilling at your momma's crib, kissing they boy legs
Cus when I ain't home, you holding it
If love got it fucked up, tell the truth, ma you stole it
And don't take it personal lady, cus I can't (be without you baby)

[Chorus]</pre>
