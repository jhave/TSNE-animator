From his rolex to his Lexus truck
But we'll never get enough
Got this rap game fucked up
And we greedy like some hungry tigers ikn this rap feezy

My lil B.Geezy
Know if a nigga get outta line he gotta come see me
But for now got to Strails and get a nigga some steak and fetticeezy
So I can go by one of my hoes with a full steezy
And watch this hoe scuff up to her kneezy
And send the video tape back to B.Geezy
And when finish hand it off to Man Feezy
And when he finish won't he toss to Suga Seezy
Fuckin' with my B.Geezy
I'll clear my bank account playboy you can believe me
