Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?

Look at all these people
Searching for a reason
Searching for a piece of mind. Hey!

They say we're all created equal
That's what they teach us

But that ain't how we treat each other
Nah that ain't how we treat each other
Shit, The truth is that we need each other, yeah

[Chorus 1:]
Diamond in the back
Babies on crack
Kickin' the door
Wavin the four four
White collar war crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down
Heroes often get shot

Peace is long been forgot
Ohh, will it be too late when we found out?
That we're all that we got

Take a look around now, yeah
Just take a look around, here

Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid

Aren't you appalled?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

[Chorus 2:]
Diamond in the back
Babies on crack
Kickin' the door
Wavin' the four four
Candles in the sun, blowin in the wind
Sun goes down
Heroes often get shot
Peace is long been forgot
Ohh will it be too late when we found out? Yeah
That we're all that we got

Look around
Just Take a look around, yeah
Look around
We're all that we got
(ooh)

May we all live long
and may we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all be strong
and we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all live long
May we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all live long
and we all be brave
and the bridges we burn, will be the bridges we burn

We're all that we got
(ooh)
We're all that we got
(ooh)
We're all that we got
(Nah)
look around now
That we're all that we got

(Yeah Yeah)

Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
Is there a God?
I'm sure he's watching
What are we doing?
Where are we going, nah?
Take a look around now

We're all that we got</pre>
