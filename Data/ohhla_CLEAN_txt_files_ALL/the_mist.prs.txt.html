"KFLB newstime 4:36. (part two, part two..)
 In the top story of the hour, the largest single law enforcement
 (part two, part two..) operation in California history is 
 currently underway. (part two, part two..) The police in five 
 Southern counties are engaged in a massive battle.."

P-Dog, back to break 'em off somethin
And never frontin when the rhyme keep comin
Not lotto but I'm in it to win it and never lose
Never singin but swingin and bringin nothin but bad news
And I'm madder than a motherFUCKER
Won't slip and the record won't skip, better get hip
Fin' to pop, but I ain't pop
How many cops gotta drop when the gat wreck shop
P-Dog comin up on another level
No hope for the black folk, FUCK a devil
It ain't nuttin but a skanless-ass trap
to keep motherfuckers broke and smokin crack!
So I'm grippin on the clip and finsta move
Another nigga on the trigger with nuttin to lose
You better duck when the gat buck bitch
cause the funk is on and Young Mark gimme some of that!
{*scratching*} Yeah - pass the match!
{*scratching*} Pass the match!
{*scratching*} Yeah..

Ain't nuttin changed, still anti-pig
Still anti-drug dealer and anti-house nigga
from bein broke in slavery
And if the skin is brown they only want you to stay down
I see the community need work
Black power mean mo' than a t-shirt!
All I'm tryin to do is be sure
that the young black youth stay true to the format
And see the plan to kill the man
and understand, it ain't shit for life to end
Look at the Oaktown murder rate
We need mo' than a panel to set it straight
The next time somebody asks why
a motherfucker sit still while the black keep dyin?
I'ma do a (?)alley U(?) and make you see you cain't
bullshit around with the people's fate!
And that's why we hate ourself
Sleepin with the enemy you're bound to catch hell
They ain't never been down with our side
So fuck Schlitz, Olde E and St. Ide's
You better hear the word when I warn ya
Now it seem like the whole WORLD's Arizona
One for Rodney and Latasha and Tawana boy ya better check ya list
for guerrillas in the mist!

[interlude]
Alright y'all, get ready for roll call
We got the gats, we got the masks, we got the gloves
The van's packed, and motherfuckers is ready to roll!
	Uh-uh, wait a minute motherfucker
	You better go on with that ol' trick shit
	Cause in the 90's, niggaz ain't havin it
	So you best just learn to deal and get the FUCK out!

[Paris]
White supremacy ain't never been a friend of me
You better check it when I wreck it cause it's gettin deep
And get ready for the funk when the pot boil
With a dry rag, kerosene, and motor oil
Now the Aryan is scary and I'm runnin up
Fat Tom better duck when he try his luck
cause I'ma see that he suck on a tech-9
or fifteen to his dome'll be fine!
Or maybe I'll just tar and feather ya
and castrate ya cause I hate a devil too
Rape your women up and then I'll rape your mind
Think about it it's an eye for an eye!
And now it's fittin that I'm spittin on America
A black man with a plan and I'm scarin ya
It ain't a threat but a promise out to each
In L.A., Forsythe, and Howard Beach!
Duck down when the clip from the tech POP
You cain't fuck with the sound when the needle drop
So don't speak when I plans to wreck the house
You can't win when the truth is spoken out
A real case of a brother you love to hate
Can't be roughed up or hushed or set STRAIGHT!
You better know me on the Mike McGee tip
and grab another clip, for guerrillas in the mist!!</pre>
