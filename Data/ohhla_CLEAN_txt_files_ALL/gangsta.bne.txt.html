[Intro: Bizzy]
Yeah (he's a gangsta boy, a gangsta boy)
If you a motherfuckin gangsta put your pistols in the air
(Put your pistols in the air!) 7th Sign (Allah-u Akbar)
Allah - one time for your motherfuckin mind nigga (ha ha)
And they'll never invade the territory, it's the story of a gangsta, gangsta
And they'll never invade the territory, it's the story of a gangsta, gangsta
(Never invade the territory)
And they'll never invade  yeah
You know you a gangsta boy (you's a gangsta boy)
Just like your daddy nigga, ha ha

[Bizzy Bone]
Out of the slums, in the midst of the darkness
and come in, they callin, all in
Ready for the mission when they listen many people
Many soldiers better touch 'em; deliver the one, better tell 'em
You can ride to the rhythm, come on and get your gun on
Run on, the Benz along, already
Christ to the rhythm for keepin the boat steady
Everybody gather around to protect him
The lesson of the spiritual, kick kids and every
Everybody's goin through shit, got to be carried
No we not angels and different for the feelin
Troopin in the galaxy, murderin the unwillin
Get 'em in the process, normally
Givin all my money to the poor and the streets keep orderly
Sort of like a weapon, we sharin, we still carin
Motherfuckers blessed and in heaven everybody sharin
Some of us try so hard to get attention
Nonsense, thinkin for tellin me who was winnin
But the fellas ain't finna forgive all the lies
Never the spies wise, and you heard my battle cries
You'll never see my face or my eyes, no way
Headed to a place, nobody don't know my name
No lames, no game, no shame, no blame
No mess, no dress, let's crush this pain
And you'll never see my face or my eyes, no way
We headed to a place, nobody don't know my name
No game, no lame, no shame, no blame
No mess, no dress, let's crush this pain

Now if you still got some gangsta in you
I want you to put your pistol in the air
And let that motherfucker go "Buck buck buck!"

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (you's a gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (you's a gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (gangsta gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (you's a gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (you's a gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta (you's a gangsta boy)
And they never invade the territory in the story of a gangsta, gangsta

[Bizzy Bone]
Dear Lord, hit 'em in the head, word written in red
Candle lit with the light and the beer
Burn it up, try to fight to the death like this
Tell 'em what we doin and we movin with their peers
Doin in a ditch, turnin around
they shit dippin around, the whip flippin around
The kids skippin the rims and did that with the fish
Bizzy and the kizzy, is he comin around to kick it?
I know you with it and we with it, {?} from the bullet to the pulpit
Duckin through the bullshit
Runnin the game, and automatic with the torches
Trenches, henches, lynches, horses
Forces, choices, orchids, djinns
endorsed with the sword, just normally morbid
Fortress, soldiers cordially cautious
Fire's are still in that orchid
Man, damn, life in the 'ville, no flim-flam
Yes the Lord has a plan
The Lord has a man in us and I trust in him and he perfect
We human, thuggin and get it
scoopin the ladies out of Hades, so it's cool like 80
Cursed them, inflection, protection in the section
Young gifted and crazy and lately
Playin up these radio stations, Twista, X-man, Jimmy
Gimme that money, gimme them songs, we thugged out
These voice tell in harmony with the symphony
Grind and keep inside of the hood still
Mic check, left right, would ya?
Grandpoppa keepin me safe like boo-yah
Big Poppa understood the hood

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
My father and grandfather so happy to be in existance, alive
Mom understandin the meanings, the reason is lust, the answers on how to survive
How to rewind, make it through affectionately, I'm gettin as close as I can
As y'all teach me to be a man, I stand for somethin that's more grand
The rest of the fam, Venus twins, Abraham, bring some of the Gin
Timothy, Saul, {?} and all of the candles be pointin to sin
I thank the light, creator from darkness, the angel just wanting the love
But the love that he has can never be bought and I thank him and call him a dove
Plus he love Allah, and plus the son and I know that he love me as well
My name is Glory and Jesus my dad, even if all of the children fail
We'll never fail, better be careful the mysteries here to {?} of the holy grail
Angels still on your trail, you worship the Lord, you'll always prevail
Never could teach, I tried to preach you know what they do to me, wanna be righteous
'Stead of me stuck in the shelters, I'm kinda famous, singin it right
And Grandfather, I'm feelin I heard the balance the talent just like I was told
Make me strong to face invisible things that Bizzy Bone can't behold

[Chorus]
