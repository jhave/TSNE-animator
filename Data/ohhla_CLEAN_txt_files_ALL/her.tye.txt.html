Oh I don't need the metronome bruh... ayyy!
Made the 'caine, you make the 'caine
When you wanna be-ahhhh
Wanna eat, all the cheese
in the store, in the store, in the store
In the store yeah yeah yeah (aight)

[Tyler, the Creator]
(It's this girl) she lives next door
to the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text, I get pissed when I get no reply
(It's this girl) I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of, when I am beating Richard up
to mental images her face look
The closest that I got is when I'm poking her on Facebook
(This girl) video chats are so exciting
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
Yeah; I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate
(This girl) I see her in class
Not really two doors down, but anytime that I pass
to take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Lockin lips on the wall, her hand grabbin my dick
My left hand on her tits, aww my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch...
(It's this girl) her name is my password
Fuck~!

[Tyler, the Creator]
(Girl) all my niggaz got they bitches and stuff
but all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts
but she's special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
a relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharin straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holdin hands walkin home
I look past that, the fact that she's fuckin guys that I hate
But, things are lookin great, cut copy
Last time we talk she said that her relationship was +Rocky+ (action)
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
(Girl) Next day metro's taking me home
I see her in a cut at Wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy? Fuck wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her... nigga
Damn - damn... fuck (it's this girl)

[Tyler, the Creator]
(It's this girl) she's so pretty
Fuck self pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
but if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile I know
What do I do with myself? Sit in my room for some days
Play Xbox and piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
(Girl)

[Tyler, the Creator]
My nigga ask, "Ace - what happened to such and such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked
or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead I lie and say she moved to Nebraska...
(It's this girl... but she's not mine)</pre>
