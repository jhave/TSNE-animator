"Oh, Dre... oh, daddy, PLEASE!"

[Drunken Master while orgasam above is repeated]
"Uh, Drunken Master- Yeah, yeah- '99, We Be Fuckin'
Wha-wha? Remix- WE BE FUCKIN'!
It's goin' down- Like that?
WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN',
WE BE... WE BE FUCKIN'! WE BE FUCKIN'!
Uh, yeah- Check it out, wha? Wha-wha?!"

[Drunken Master]
On the 'Lac, hoes don't know how to act
I'm the mack, hittin' that thaaang from the back
wit' a stack of rubbers wit' 'cha baby's mother
workin' undercover like a motherfucker
The only drunk hittin' skins in here wit' your daughter
Got the bitch doin' shit she don't think she oughta
Spread, eagled in the back of the Grand Charokee
You know how us niggas be off the hennessy
She been down wit' me since way back when
Drunk off that henn- Blowin' in the wind
Let me stick it in in the back of the truck
Drunken Master's ready to fuck- Nigga, what?!

We be fuckin'!
Everbody likes when 'dem hoes suck somethin'
to show they ain't frontin'
Keep bumpin' 'cause Dre got 'ya fuckin' and suckin'
like there ain't nothin' wrong
Ya got it goin' on
Ha, what? WE BE FUCKIN'!
WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN',
WE BE FUCKIN'! Player style- Drunken Master
WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN'!
Uh, yeah- Drunkenstyle '99- What? WE BE FUCKIN'!
WE BE FUCKIN', WE BE FUCKIN', WHA-WHA?!

Uh, yo
We just left the key so what's up now?!
Bitch, D-R-E, Double Tree 'bound
Headed downtown
Runnin' through these hoes like a crow
'Do you fuck wit'out a rubba?' Hellll no!
You can hit the shower while I blaze up this bud
Remember, if I call you a bitch, it's only love
Dubs for all the girls up in this bitch
especially the ones who be fuckin' and shit
and suckin' my dick- You beggin' me to stick it in
and when I bust a nut, she tryin' to get it stiff again
Fuckin' me? I'm tryin' ta fuck her!
She's puttin' in work, now watch her suck squirt ("Oh, shit")
Show her to the car
and don't get mad
'cause, baby, this is where we part
Ya know Dre's in charge. ("Where ya goin'?")
EASTSIIIIIDE, NIGGA!
I'll meet you at the titty bar

I love it when they take it off and break me off
I love it when they take it off and break me off
I love it when they take it off and break me off
I love it when they take it off and break me off
I love it when they take it off and break me off
I love it when they take it off and break me off
We be FUCKIN'! ("FUCKIN'! FUCKIN'...")

"Drunken Master, '99
We Be Fuckin'! Whoo!
Feelin' this"

[Ice-T on a phone]
"Yo, shut up! This is Ice-T
All you bitches out there in Detroit betta bring me my
mothafuckin' money when I see y'all
Don't be frontin', I'll bust ya up, bitch- Yeah, straight up
Drunken Master-style, I'm up outta here like I stole somethin'
Peace"</pre>
