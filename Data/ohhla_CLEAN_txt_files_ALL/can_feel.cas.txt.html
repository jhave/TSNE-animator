Song:   Can You Feel Me
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know you sensin me missin you
Must be feeling a vibe
My heart is on fire, about to explode
There's too much space between me and you
Gets hard over time, it's a crime
I'm hoping my love overflows

And finds it's way for me
Into your arms, where I belong
Come to me
I'm sending love at lightning speed
I've been in need since you've been gone

Heres my love, reaching you like I wanted
Call my name and I'll come running
Lovesick, boy I need you to heal me
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)
Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)

Impulse is urging you to get closer to me
You're wondering why it's so intense in your mind
Don't go against what you know
I'm where you wanna be
I'm hoping my love will fly

And find it's way for me
Into your arms, where I belong
Come to me
I'm sending love at lightning speed
I've been in need since you've been gone

Heres my love, reaching you like I wanted
Call my name and I'll come running
Lovesick, boy I need you to heal me
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

Heres my love, reaching you like I wanted
Call my name and I'll come running
Lovesick, boy I need you to heal me
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

Feel me
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)
Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)

I'm touching you, though you don't feel my hands on your skin
I'm loving you from a distance until there no end
You feel the vibration I make through the sound waves
Your love is my lifeline, I need to be saved

Feel me
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)
Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me?
Ca-ca-ca Can you feel me? (me, me, me, me, me)</pre>
