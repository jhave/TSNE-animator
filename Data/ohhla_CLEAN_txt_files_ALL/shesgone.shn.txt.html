(She's gone)

You know, even though we're far apart so many miles away
My love for you grew stronger with each passing day
And it seems just like yesterday, baby, since I met you
And from the moment I seen you, I knew I had to get you
You know, cause sweet girls, they're one of a kind
And you just simply blew my mind
And a love like ours, yo, that wasn't easy to find
And yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)

You know, I cherished every moment we spent
Wishin it would never end
Just when I had told myself
That damn, I'll never fall in love again
Cause love can lead you blind
See, it snuck me up from behind
And before I knew girl, I was yours and you were mine
Our love had a value that love just couldn't buy
And I knew that you were true just by that twinkle inside your eye
And yet I bless the day she was born
But I still can't face the fact that (she's gone)

You know, I met many girls around the nation
But see, I just knew that you were there, and I wanted to share my relations
And I loved you like I do for so many reasons
And since you been gone ain't really nothin changed but the seasons
Things are different without you but I can tell you are still the same
I wake up and find myself screamin out your name
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)

You know, just to be close to you, that all that I miss
You know, I used to get chills up and down my spine each time we kissed
And how much it thrills me just to talk to you on the phone
Next best thing to being there but I still feel alone
You know, it had to be love, at least it was in my case
Cause every time I close my eyes, damn, I still see your face
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)

I did every thing that I could just to make you happy, and Lord knows I tried
I'm in so much pain my boys can still see it in my eyes
You know, I crossed through mountains, travelled over the great divide
Just to show and prove to you all the love that I held inside
You know, you gave me love, you know, more happiness that a man could find
And yo, and forever I woulda been yours if forever you woulda been mine
But yet I bless the day she was born
But I just can't face the fact that (she's gone)

Yo, ain't nothin like the good old days, the good old days
You know
Just can't face the fact that you're gone, sweetheart
Why?
Why?
Did everything that I could
Keep you happy
And all that, you know?
But everything I did musta not been good enough for you
You still wanted more
And I mean, hey, what more can you have?
To me, love is everything
Everything is love
And I was giving you all of mine and I expected the same in return
And I got shitted on
Youknowmsayin?
But it's alright though sweetheart
It don't matter
Life goes on, everything goes the same
But still and all I still can't the fact that she's gone</pre>
