[Beelow]

I'm tellin' ya, brah,
Them boys ain't got no deals,
I don't even know why they put that on there.

Chorus [Thug Addict]:

You got a BIG MOUTH, BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
Mouth ALMIGHTY, Mouth ALMIGHTY
You got a BIG MOUTH, BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
A BIG MOUTH, A BIG MOUTH,
Mouth ALMIGHTY, Mouth ALMIGHTY

First Verse [C-Murder]:

Run your muthafuckin' mouth like you a broad or somethin',
These niggas actin' like they muthafuckin' hard or somethin',
I'm from the cold-hearted streets of the CP3,
The Calliope, where the other niggas just like me,
And bullet proofs on my muthafuckin' ass my nigga,
Cuz when I bust I hold 'em up and let'em laugh my nigga,
I got some soldiers on that tank, that would ride for me,
My brother Silkk, even told me he would die for me,
You want beef?  Or do you really even know what beef is?
We go to war, it's gonna be kinda hard for you and your kids,
My money too long, and my clique too strong,
And when it's on, it's on,
Put the chrome to your dome,
M-11's in the back of the benz, ya dig?
Just in case you get slack from your friends, ya dig?
Nigga you doin' too much, that's why your ass got touched,
You got a big mouth fool that's why I fucked you up

Chorus

Second Verse [Thug Addict]:

You wanna stay in my business, tellin' my girl this tellin' my girl that,
Runnin' your trap, speakin' to me tryin' to gimme some dap,
All that yappety-yap, talkin' that bullcrap,
Tell them people bout my business talkin' behind my back,
I don't like that,
And around your mouth'll get you killed right fast,
And I can see straight through you like glass,
All that talkin' and tellin' and snitchin',
Tryin' to knock me out of position,
All that he say, she say, they say just make my day,
Man, you hear what Thug did with ol' girl around the way,
Talkin' loud, but ain't sayin' nothin',
Stuntin' and bluffin' gone get'cha caught up,
Get'cha sowed up,
You tried to get in that water, 
But it was harder that you thought up,
I'm the nigga that tell a daughter,
I says Mama, tell her Mama that I sexed her DAUGHTER,
Shit and ran a train on her,
You just mad, cuz you couldn't do that,
Now you spreadin' them lies,
Actin' your shoe size,
Can't even look me in my face,
Can't even look in my eyes,
But that's alright, cuz when I catch'cha I'ma catch'cha,
And I'll bet'cha never ever ever ever ever ever ever
Tell a lie, run your lip,
Talk about this nigga right chea,
Talk and stuff,
When you're nothin' but bluff,
Hey man you talk too much,
Home boy you never shut up,
You got a big mouth, a big mouth, say what?

Chorus

Third Verse [Beelow]:

Hanh what?  Hanh boy, you all know me,
You say we related how the Hell could it be?
I never seen ya out my house or at my family cookouts,
When you say you my cousin, what the Hell you talkin' bout?
I'm that balla you wants to be, but your paper ain't long enough,
With that broad you want to be with, but your game ain't strong enough,
Come with that yakkety-yak, cuz you know I'm a star,
You should spot me when I'm flossin' in a big body car,
You always talkin' that noise,
Actin' hard wit'cha boys,
But you won't even look my way, you know I'm packin' them toys,
Boy, ah-ah, but you be runnin' your mouth,
Boy you talk so much, you talk worse than Bell South,
Now I done hooked up with that tank you best respect it,
C-Murder and Beelow straight flossin' Ballin' Records,
All up in a nigga biz,
Who you think you is?
Talkin' to them people bout to get'cha tail killed, wootay,
Everytime I come round,
You sayin' you wanna be down,
But see I know you'z a hater plus a big mouth clown,
You got a big mouth, you can't keep your trap shut,
I guess I gotta close your eyes and seal your lips up
