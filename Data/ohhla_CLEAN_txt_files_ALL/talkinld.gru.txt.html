Typed by: peterg4life@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
He was talking all loud and he knew that he was frontin'
And he slept on his job so he didn't see us coming
Had to fall back, he didn't want no problems
It wouldn't be a nice thing to get involved in. (2X)

[Verse 1]
It's gifted, unlimited, rhymes universal
I get at you, I'm that dude, my style could you
GURU, the keeper of the gate, lead you to your faith
Righteously I stand with my heat around my waist
They said I couldn't do it, I suceed with ease
Others bleed over greed, I'm smoking trees overseas
Listen fucker, you don't want to tussle and muscle
You don't want to end up on the wrong side of my hustle
I could walk on any block in any continent
MAke MC's step their game up and fuck up their confidence
A true definition of a season vet
I ain't expose you, 'cause I ain't have a reason yet
ANd If I seem upset, or maybe even vexed
It's 'cause somebody owes me dought and yo I need my check
Still I'm a daring, dash it, tearing their dome
Said you was a gangsta, found out you was wearing a thong

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 2]
It's them loud-mouth cats that get you into trouble
Keep your nose clean, that way you could slowly bubble
I created a man and created supply
If I had a school, rappers coudln't wait to apply
I'm tremendously tight, when defending my right
I'll throw a combo, and then I'm ending the fight
The G U R U with SOlar on the track
Pop shit and run away and catch a hole in your back
The streets been mine and I ain't never left
I ain't never forfeit and I ain't never forget
The hallways, the alleyways, the cornerstore action
Straight gullyness, I generate pure attraction
New York talk without a pacid to walk
Better reach motherfucker, that's your last resort
I'm a daring, dash it, tearing their dome
Said you was a gangsta, found out you was wearing a thong

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
