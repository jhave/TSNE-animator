Verse 1: Magic (Ms. Peaches)

Let me explain my situation before we even conversate
see I'm involved with this female that just can't be replaced
So I'm just looking for a friend are you interested? 
Cause I would love to see you butt-naked lying in my bed
You won't regret a mintue just tell me what you like
and I promise to make this the best night of your life
(Now would you dine on me?) sure baby only the best
(Now would you treat me like a queen?) only if you can pass the first test
Is the pussy good? ( You just got to see for yourself) 
Well is you cold with it? (Oh believe me this is the best)
It's just me and you and I won't tell nobody
so put your hands on my hips and let your neck get rowdy
If you suck my soul, I'll play with your emotions
so at the point of pentration, your wetter than the ocean
getting aroused by my every motion
as I'm getting aroused by your Victoria Secret's lotion
I'm harder than an armadillian, can't fight this feeling
if you get on all four, shoot that ass to the ceiling
as I apply the pressure as she starts to moan
Ohh if it's it's on...look
Why is you biting at that pillow baby, screaming my name?
(Because your working that dick, you got me going insane.)
(Boy you'se a soilder) I told ya ( How you keeping your composer?)
Cause right before we started, I smoked three gards of dolja
You getting the dope dick, I prepared for this
Wanted to dick you down before I blasted
The plastic got the bed down better than average
it's only been an hour and she's speaking of marriage
I get upset, but then I start to laugh and I can't blame her
She's been exposed to Magic, 
no other man can make her feel like I make her feel
(Shit I aint trippin on your wife, I'm trying to keep it real)
So what you sayin boo? Cause I'm hoping that I'm hearing you
I told you from the jump there was no future in this
( So what you sayin? Don't I fulfill your biggest fantasy)
Nah to tell you the truth baby you bothering me
I undressed you, only to sex you
gave you the dick and it must have impressed you
(Man you shiesty ass niggas fucking make me sick
I wish I would have known, I would of asked you to lick my clit
Dont you recall the day that you begged for the pussy, 
paided for the pussy)
Yeah but now I got the pussy
(You just a fucking same nigga, aint nothing changed
You just another lame nigga)

Magic (Ms. Peaches) talking:

Yeah Yeah Yeah
Whatever save all that shit
you know what? get the fuck out of I'm sick of your stupid ass (What?)
(Fuck you, I'll get my shit, I knew I shouldn't have been fucking with you)
I aint got time for all this fucking shit (Stupid ass nigga)
I got what the fuck I want, I got what the fuck I want
get your ass outta here
(Fuck you Magic you know that) alright alright whatever
(It's cool it's cool 
 I knew I shouldn't have been fucking with you bitch ass  nigga
Fucking make me sick) get ya shit...get ya shit...
