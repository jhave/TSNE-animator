Feast your eyes, surprise, I got you locked in
The beat is droppin and Lakim's rockin
A lyrical landslide, my status is strong form
My days of rhymin old school are long gone
You better watch it when I get to the vital stage
Rhymes'll come crashin down like a tidal wave
You ( ? ) path of destruction, it caused an eruption
Cause Lakim was lustin
For a low-down, low-life lame brain with the same
Gameplan, I can't stand cause it's too plain
You need to slow your roll and switch your pitch
It's time for Lak to rip, so prepare for this
I'm cool and smooth, this is what Lak means
Rhymes are sometimes referred to as whipped cream
Give me a def kick, give me a hype snare
Mark give me a high-hat for those that bite, here
's a chunk of funk for you to nibble on
This is a rain rap shower, so I'ma drizzle on
Those who chose to oppose the way the Lak flows
Cause only those with the given gift knows
You gotta be nice, real hard, real hype
Have the real type of lyrics to present to the crowd
But when it's time to flow they will all know
That Lak Shabazz is black and I'm proud

I'm black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud
Black and I'm proud
I'm black and I'm proud</pre>
