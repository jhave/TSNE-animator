[Jim Jones talking]
Hello, oh' whats up baby, ain't doing nothing I'm on my way home right now
What?!? I'm in the studio, *click*, Yo I gotta get ready and go home man

[Denise Weeks]
I'm in love... with a thug
I'm in love... with a gangsta, yeah

[Jim Jones]
Now my wife she won't stop blowin' my phone up
Every bitch conversation they keep throwin' the Jones up "[They Lien]"
It makes it hard I'm tryna show her I've grown up
But deep down inside she know I will never give them ho's up
She talk marriage but ya boy froze up, cold feet
Man she know I'm in love wit' these cold streets
So I'm flowin' threw the night, just left my bitch house
I'm going home to my wife, as I live this double life

[Denise Weeks]
I'm in love.... with a thug
I'm in love..... with a gangsta, yeah *2X* 

[Jim Jones]
It started as a crush for years wishin' I could fuck her
Next thing I got caught up, she had me trippin' like a mushroom
Shit became fucked up cause we both became love-struck
I be out commitin' crimes, she be still up on my mind
Now I'm tryna shake it off, she still drippin' through the brain
You know I fean for her like a hit of that Cocaine
She say my thug is like drugs and she need her a rehab
And she strung out over love when she see me see relapse

[Denise Weeks]
I'm in love.... with a thug
I'm in love.... with a gangsta, yeh *2X* 
No matter what, no one can judge me or tell me how I could feel
Lord knows this man, is ryde or die, he keeps it so so real
Even if his pants hang low, or some times he'll even roc the corn rows
Lord knows my everything, and I gotta GOTTA let'em LET'EM know

[Jim Jones]
Now that we argue every night, the most horrible of fights
If I get caught cheatin', you gon' carve me wit' a knife
But let's take it back, when we use to party every night
I thought you of all people would know its hard to live my life
I say I'm in the studio", You say You wit' some groupie ho
We going back and forth, GAWW-DAMN, this ain't a movie yo
I'm not the one for complainin', be mentally drainin'
But some times just listen its only one thing I'm sayin'
I Love You

[Denise Weeks]
I'm in love.... with a thug
I'm in love.... with a gangsta, yeah *2X* </pre>
