Uhh! Check it out, yo; it's called, uh, well, uh
"K Sera Sera," whatever will be will be
And the track is kinda in there, so lemme bust a li'l
A li'l rhyme...

Check it out on the one, two, three...

Standin' 5'11", and I'm almost 6 feet
18 years old, rock a new beat
Got no nickname, stay the cool sane
Kick the same rhymes, play the same games
To watch my back, but ain't no vics here
Bring in the new--that tune was last year
In strode the baby brother, comin' from the mind school
Flow from blue Bic, and paper's wide-ruled
If I had a penny for every note that I played
Or if I had a dollar for every bar I create
I guess that I would reckon, "By golly, I'm gettin' paid"
Or better yet, "I reckon it's time to be gettin' paid!"
So I sit and think, "Well, should I pull my Plan 9?"
I'll leave it up to the powers and the stars
Since I'm from the cosmos of another planet, see
I believe my karma will guide me to my destiny
So I flow, not on the rhymes
But related to my shade of mind, or, rather, vibes
Que sera sera, what will be will be
Whatever's kinda clever, what the future holds for me
I guess it's just a thought, though my mind is kinda hazy
My name is Justin, baby

I got my skullcap on, then the flow from my mind starts
As I rip for days from the land of the mic arts
Cream of the crop, a cool, blue beatnik
Blessed with the gift, and now it's time to kick the ill shit
Love to eat the scallops, and quit with the doo-doo raps
Stay away from ill crack, listen to the Fatback
Smooth on a rough track, time to catch a catnap
If you are my brother, I'll be sure to give you much dap
Ya bound to get your head smacked, if you try to illjack
Get your kit from Acme, set yourself an ill trap
I used to talk of vickin', would step and finger-lickin'
But now my mic endeavors have improved over time
Oh yeah, I'm still the same brother who has got to pickin'
So listen to the moody groove, piano, and the vibes

Ahh, and ya don't stop. Yeah, ya know, yeah
And we the sure shit, guaranteed to be the ultimate
Ya got to keep it on to the break-of-dawn
To the rhythm, y'all, ya don't stop
And ya don't quit, ya don't stop
Ya gotta keep on, keep the flow on
And, baby, ya know you and the rhythm is always on
And I'm out...</pre>
