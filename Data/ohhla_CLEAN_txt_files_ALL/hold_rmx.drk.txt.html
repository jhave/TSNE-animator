[Intro: Rick Ross]
Shorty I got more money than I ever had
But you the only thing I need right now 
You make it all so simple, you my new thing
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

[Verse One: Rick Ross]
I fuck her like an addict, she fuck me like she mad at me
But it's all cool though, I flew out Aneisha just last week
When I'm away she send me pics in the sheets
Saw my grin on my cars on my sneaks
Wait, let me keep this shit simple
Fuck the radio this shit's a nigga tempo
Fat boy blue jeans and a gold watch
Started at the bottom then she rolled on top
Black testerosa, zero to sixty on the strip she's explosive
Just got back from Dubai, Emirates live flew in with 1.5
Never fold is the threshold, like my mother sayin now never let go
Hood nigga with a escrow, bad bitch but she special
Went home and I prayed for a angel appeared in the dark here to take away the pain too
War wombs on the big dog, but she get the ball like it's tip off
Watch D-Wade got two seats, got her everything but the blue beach
Cartier wings nigga two seats, nigga gettin money like a new Meech
We the knights of the Templar, dirty little nigga with ten cars
This whole clique another Enron, baby girl it's time for you to get gone
Here's a shoulder just to lean on, Rozay baby and the team strong

[Verse Two: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Chorus: Drake]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
I know exactly who you could be...
Just hold on, we're going home...
Just hold on, we're going home...
It's hard to do these things alone...
Just hold on, we're go-ing home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..

[Verse Three: Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Chorus: Drake] + (Majid Jordan)
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (ohh yeah)
You act so different around me (la-da dah daaah)
Cause you're a good girl and you know it (la-da dah)
I know exactly who you could be...
So just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)

[Interlude 2X: Majid Jordan]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you every.. thing I loved
I think there's something... baby
I think there's something... baby

[Chorus: Drake] + (Majid Jordan)
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
(Cause you're a good girl and you know it...)
(I know exactly who you could be...)
Ohh, just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home) ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)</pre>
