[ VERSE 1: Big Daddy Kane ]
Give a demonstration
To the whole rap world rhythm nation
And take a taste of this verbal vibration
With more color than you see on animation
And bear witness to my smooth operation
As I give the party people a sensation
And give them all a good feel of jubilation
Me and the mic become a good combination
To rock the house without any complication
The crowd'll give the Kane a standing ovation
That just gives me even more motivation
To pick up the pace and give you more fascination
With the ryhmes in my rap creation
They show the power of the Kane's innovation
And create an extravagant inspiration
So here I am, to give a demonstration

[ Big Scoob ]
(Give a demonstration)
(Give) (give a demonstration)
(G-)(give a demonstration)

[ VERSE 2: Big Daddy Kane ]
Give a demonstration
And take time out for a dedication
To all the deejays and radio stations
Who put my record in heavy rotation
Reprise reps for their affiliation
Of course Warner Brothers help my elevation
For publicity to artist relation
And Rushtown for a great three-year duration
And Carol Lewis for the tour preparation
And Farrakhan for the righteous conversations
I can't forget the people all around the nation
From the adults to the younger generation
The black, white, Chinese and even Haitian
Because the music ain't about segregation
It's a harmony to bring communication
So listen up as I give a demonstration

[ Big Scoob ]
(Give) (give a) (give) (give a demonstration)
(Give) (g-) (give a demonstration)
(Give a demonstration)

[ VERSE 3: Big Daddy Kane ]
Give a demonstration
For you to get a  much better illustration
And give the sucker MC's an education
Because their style is just a cheap imitation
It seems you need a little bit of dictation
But what I'ma do for you in this situation
Is supply a process of elimination
Serve justice by means of termination
Because a biter only brings aggravation
A lotta trouble and a lotta frustration
So here's a little bit of useful information
So that you can see some acceleration
It's gonna take hard work and concentration
A lotta tears and a lotta perspiration
That's the way that you blow up like inflation
And then maybe YOU can give a demonstration

[ Big Scoob ]
(G-) (g-) (g-) (give) a demonstration)
(Give) (g-) (g-) (give) (give a demonstration)
(Give a) (g-) (g-)(give a demonstration)
(G-) (g-) (g-) (give a demonstration)

[ Big Scoob ]
So can I give a demonstration
For the sick people with constipation
You need to take a little bit of medication
So you can go take a dookie on the toilet
Know what I'm sayin?
Do you know what I'm sayin?
So can we give this demonstration?
So yo
Me and Big Daddy
We kickin it on the down low
Word up
Word up, just buggin in the studio
Know what I'm sayin?
Givin all y'all party people out there a - little - bit of - de-mon-stration
For the year '91 me and Big Daddy gon' say peace</pre>
