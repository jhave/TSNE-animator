Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: La the Darkman]
Yeah, yeah
You're witnessin' the sounds of La the Darkman

[Chorus: La the Darkman]
I like a lot of cash, I like a lot of hoes
I like expensive cars, I like expensive clothes

[La the Darkman]
La the rap ruler, tight nigga, smoke mad buddha
In a Benz, Coupe, Range, Lex or Landcruiser
Some say I'm a psychic, I predict my future
To be rich, disrespect my crew and I'mma shoot ya

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
It's like I hit the the lotto, shoes Nike Air, watchin' Mavado
GMC truck, new powder blue Tahoe
Grant my own wishes like a Genie from a bottle
Remember the tip of my shells stay hollow

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
Son, I get money and I get sophisticated funny
Buy the pops, sell ya niggas crummy
Pushin' the seven, use to walk and look bummy
My fifth turn tone tough niggas into mummies, dummy

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
My trees stay green, keep my jewelry and pussy clean
Lookin' like a nander off the T.V. screen
Get head, like a pornographer's dream
Was a peasant, a pawn, a prince, now a king, breathe

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
Son, I let the tech blow, faster than pass from Drew Bledsoe
Black talents get, twist ya body like a preztel
Dogs, we not affraid, yo, just give me a sec, yo
I'mma have these rap bastards run a petro

[Chorus 3X]

[La the Darkman]
Catch me at the Rutger, watchin' a game, burnin' a Dutch
A four-fifth, cop me some one and ten truckers
A cold day in hell before I'm played like a sucker
Sing-Sing, yeah, I'm a bad muthafucka, pluck ya

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
What the deal is, I'mma trynna be rich as Russell Simmons
Skyscrape it out, chillin', hittin' women
Stop at the light, my rims, keep spinnin'
Every time partner see my face, start grinnin', I'm winnin'

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
My style vary, just like different guns I carry
Lookin' down the barrel of the fifth, gets scary
My lifestyle's real, never imaginery
Have bitches in the hot tub, bad as Halle Berry

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
I get cash pronto, La the Darkman head honcho
Catch me on Maui, litin' haze in the fonto
Style Benny Blanco, my type of poncho
Kick dimes, ridin' the dick like a bronco

[Chorus]

[La the Darkman]
And I get greasy, I'm on the street that's for sheezy
Where I put my hustle down, niggas wanna be me
Catch me on the block, with my click or on the TV
East, I'm off the hook, West, I'm off the heezy, easy

[Chorus]</pre>
