[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen 
We are gathered here today
To join
I see it, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I like this right here
Yeah, yeah
One-Two, One-Two, in the place to be
As you can see
I am the crush groovin' 
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight 
The record breaking and the record making
Yeah, yeah, turn this up

From the states to over seas
Every city in between I hit the scene 
Catch fire like kerosene
Geting paid for more then a decade
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?
No one important, just another nigga flossing
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real
You just a clone wit' a production deal
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth
Hottest niggas out
Alot better, the shit's too strong
I'm home now, daddy's been gone too long

1 - 	[Lil' Kim]
	What you niggas want
	Wanna talk slick 
	Wanna do shit, try shit, new shit
	Who you fucking wit'
	You and your weak clique
	Bitch you creep wit' got you in some deep shit
	You coppin' pleas now, it ain't a secret
	Trying to be niggas you can't even speak with
	You can't run, you can't hide
	Bad Boy 'till the day we die

Tell they all like Jordan in the fall
On top of the hill like Lauren, Killing 'Em Soft'
What you grillin' me for?
Kept my name good, we from the same hood
Made some change, put the range wit' the stained wood
Now chicks, they keep they eyes on me
Wanna grind on me
Haters plotting so I keep my nine on me
You can't stop 'em when them shells is popping
Look good to the public eye, your streets is watching
At all times, put it all on the line 
Without a care dreams of cream turn to nightmares
No one to talk to, don't know who to trust
Got your gun out and don't know who to bust
It get like that though, when you stack that dough
Can't run from it yo, that's when they get close
So put up you guards, keep faith in God
I promise y'all the world'll be ours

Repeat 1

Your games amaze, but alot of ways, many choices
Can't sleep, when I do I hear voices
Speakin' loud and clear, wait 'till you come out this year
So I listen back cause the street is missing that
What a world we live in
So cold I'm shivering, slipping
Gotta work with what I'm given, shit
Bitches is trifling, hands out grabbin'
Niggas hating, scheming and back stabbin'
That's why they hang around you, just to be seen
Type to leave a gun fight wit' a full magazine
No blood, not hit, chamber ain't warm
What part of the game is this? And who's side you on?
Can't be out for wealth and out for self, won't work
Find yourself tucked and surrounded by dirt
In a verse I show the whole earth my work 
It got to get better because it can't get no worse

Repeat 1
Repeat 1</pre>
