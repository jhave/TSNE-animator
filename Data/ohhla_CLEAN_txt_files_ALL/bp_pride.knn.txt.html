Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I've been running out of
My 70 excuses
There comes a point when patience
Can't take all these abuses
Now my reserves are empty
I'm feeling kind of low
Because when do you fight for someone
And when do you let 'em go
The other day I thought I saw you on a magazine
Your stubborn nose pretending to belong to the machine

I've been waiting for you to come to your senses
Holding up your heavy heart, down there in the trenches
You don't have to carry that weight all by yourself
Even you the mercenary could use a little help
You've got your gun, your bulletproof pride
You never run, but you sure know how to hide

My friend said he had seen you
At a movie theatre
You looked just had you had always
Didn't ask about me either
I won't say life ends without you
But you're the only answer
You got me like a thief
You got me with my hands up
The other day I thought I saw you on a magazine
Your stubborn nose pretending to belong to the machine

I've been waiting for you to come to your senses
Holding up your heavy heart, down there in the trenches
You don't have to carry that weight all by yourself
Even you the mercenary could use a little help
You've got your gun, your bulletproof pride
You never run, but you sure know how to hide

[Bono duet with himself]

Your wish is falling before you
The stars are frustrating
You're always into waiting love

Yeah, there's something wrong
Yeah, be safe now
There's a faith in my heart
Going days won't stop
When I feel that I'm still
In the beat of your soul
When you talk
When you write
When you weave and you flow
And you leave and you stay
Only waiting is left
Now I'm kneeling around in the cold

I've been waiting for you to come to your senses
Holding up your heavy heart, down there in the trenches
You don't have to carry that weight all by yourself
Even you the mercenary could use a little help
You've got your gun, your bulletproof pride
You never run, but you sure know how to hide</pre>
