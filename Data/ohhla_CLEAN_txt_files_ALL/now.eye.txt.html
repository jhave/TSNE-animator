We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see thru
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose
Check it out now

This is a necessary change from the grim simple and plain
Gotta exercise that brain to break the chain pain is a part of gain
No need to explain
We innovate to generate an intricately interwoven tapestry
Of musical and ethical epiphanies
The interest is minimal
I'm on my own mission to mess with an angel
to take it all the way to where the sun is
Just like a runner loving running
Around to turn it into a simple symphony
Simple sentiment adrenaline is coming back
I made it my own city, whys it gotta be a superstar
I'd rather be a galaxy
But how you see is so dependent on the medicine the rhetoric
And how at any second you think you could sit on the brink of this
World is all asleep and I have no apologies
I breathe
Keep my rhymes on what we ride on
Let bygones be bygones
The migraines don't sidetrack
My final destination nothing rivals predetermination
To exterminate the germination
Of a nation that accepts anything that's thrown in their fat face
Cause when there's nothing left
There's no more point to the rat race
We don't waste a minute of the day
Hope you can figure what I'm saying
Trying to send it all way to another stage
A creative alternator rated and greater
The crazy maniabilities take it all up in your face wait
Success ain't only based on self esteem
It takes a sense to differentiate between
Whats yours and someone else's dreams
I felt the screams climbing up my cold spine
Saying now's the time to put in all the energy
To get rid of the enemy.. I said its so..

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

We see thru
Repetitive etiquette and the highly unoriginal

We're here to
Bring the people and the music and the movement all together now

They will lose

Sick of the same old thing

Free us and touch what we can't see
Twist that knife and watch him bleed
Lost inside its way too deep
Someone choke me
Help me breathe

Run from mistakes
Right in my face
Feels like I'm running in place</pre>
