Typed by: Tha_Realness_Eternal_E@Hotmail.com

[Chorus]
If our worlds collide
(It's my world)
I hope you know that one of us gon' die
(It's my world)
It won't be me cus I was born to rise
(Yo, It's my world)
So when the war I hope you on my side
(It's my world, It's my world, It's my world)

{*Repeat 2X*}
[Scratching Chino from Sway and Tech's "The Anthem"]
Chino makes the world go round...
[Scratching Nas from "Hate me Now"]
The Illest...
Blame God he blew breath in my lungs...

[Verse 1]
Don't call it a comeback...
I've been here for years
I'm like a record deal from Select ending anyone's career
But does anyone care? And did anyone dare try prepare ya?
I got the world hemmed up my daddy should've named me tailor
I'll scare ya' like I knock at the front door when the rents due
The true, lyrical O.G., shine's inevitable
Rhymes irrefutable digital decibels
Louder then Busta Rhymes wardrobe, and I've been foretold
Ain't a tough cat in your zip code, city or rural
Will I become immortal and make you a graffiti R.I.P. mural
Complete with artist rendering on how you used to be proving you're mortal
Surrendering victory to Chi
Underneath flowers and candles from your friends and family
The walls are reminded you should've never fucked with me
I take it to your f-a-c-e but don't respond
Cus I'm the big dog, the world's a fire hydrant that I piss upon

(Chorus w/ slight variations)

[Verse 2]
Yo, yeah, yo...
360 of unadulterated battle rhyme
You must be inebriated wanting to challenge mine
My distance is so accurate anytime laps cameras capture it
Tearing apart time's fabric, no exaggerate
Thirty five thousand Giga hard drives only could store half of it
That ain't the half of it, I spit the blood of Christ on a catholic
Lyrics specialist ain't this a bitch rip shit so effortless
Smoke method with Method Man being chased by thirty Methodists
Seven day adventist tempt this and try to prevent this
So I curse like the Motto leaving them praying/preying like the mantis
Perform in front of Mormons 'til they banished up in piss
Start dramas between Amish 'til they turn to Blood and Crips
Go to war with four continents make Saddam turn protestant
Bill Clinton's advisors like look at what your big mouth got us in
Give the world surgery
Resurrect ?Isaac Raveen? then mandate the extinction of all of Germany
Blanket the universe in darkness for all eternity
I'm like Vernon Jordan on the stand committing purgery
I'll resurrect Hannibal,
To show Italianos how African they are for thinking of us as animals
I'll resurrect Mussolini,
Piss in his hat and show him with all his tyranny
Armies and gases couldn't see me
Resurrect Idi Amin and Hitler
Then sit around exchanging war stories to show whose mind is sicker
And full of hatred, life ain't far cus if it was
Biggie would still be here and these wack rappers would be dead

(Chorus w/ slight variations)

[Verse 3]
[I have survived] Twenty-four years of being poor
[I have survived] My hometown claiming I wasn't raw
[I have survived] Being shot at and stabbed while on tour
[I have survived] Millions of niggas stealing my metaphors
For three years, broken down that's thirty six months
Twenty six thousand two hundred eighty hours holding a grudge
A non-vocalist drama belonging in the theatre
So raw I'm charging my reflection for rhyming in the mirror
Your flows ancient, I'm past the prehistoric stages
I flip vocal booths equipped with roll bars and cages
Temperature rise you're feeling faint when my heat fell
You wish for death like Lady Di wish she'd wore a seat belt
Seek help, May Day, S.O.S. explode
Dot dot dash... I'll beat that ass in Morse Code
Your rhyme like down syndrome
I make you limp home
For sleeping on my Puerto Rican skin tone
(Leave him alone)
And I don't give a fuck who you get...
I don't give a fuck if Jesus write your verses and Satan and God produced it
I don't give a fuck if Puff signed it
I don't give a fuck what old school rapper you getting outta retirement
I'm on my own dick like a man in solitary confinement
Release enough pollution to destroy the whole environment
Chino strikes again
Lose your hearing from my buzz
Sell CD's? Shit, I sold water to Noah during the flood
