[ VERSE 1: Smooth B ]
I met this girl at the French Riviera
She said, "Smooth B, won't you come nearer
And let me kiss your lips and give you a - treat?"
I said, "Baby, listen, I'm not dissing
But I'm not one who goes round kissing
Each and every woman I meet on the - street
I like a girl with some class
(Got a big, big, big -)
Nice and smooth, not a girl that's too fast
Please, take my beeper number, and chill
I'm not ill, I like things at a cool-out pace
It's me and you, not a relay race
You see, I'm not greedy, slow down, speedy
Save those hand-downs for the needy
I respect you and won't neglect you
And try my damn best to protect you
Cause you're fly, girl, so don't play yourself
Splurging's bad for your health

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Greg Nice ]
Greg Nice, I met this dame
I like her style, she feels the same
Is she gaming, merely claiming
To be my girl, to change my world?
I don't like to be uptight
I don't wanna fuss, I don't wanna fight
She's obsessive, too possessive
I wish I knew this girl's objective
I met baby girl when I was on tour
Gave me more than what I bargained for
Makes me breakfast while in bed
She loves to keep her man well fed
Diplomatic, socialistic
Baby girl had strawberry lipstick
It tastes sweet, just like honey
Said to myself, "Yo, this dip's a dummy"
Tried to gas me for my money
Teddy Tedd, she looks like a Playboy Bunny!
