[Intro]
{*paper crinkling*} What is this?
This was written for you?
You want me to say this?
Yes, I want you to say this
Stay out of the wonderland baby

[Bizzy Bone]
Rebuke murder for me; lust, wrath and sloth
Greed, gluttony, envy and the pride of the thought
I'ma tell you smite that servant, kamikaze no curtains
Slice through the smoke of the mirrors, imperfect
Impervious to danger, fear God, the beginning of wisdom
Enter to the kingdom, would you listen?
I miss you most definitely, spit knowledge, smell my breath
Righteous watchin the way, memory step, whoa!
Pay attention to the street signs
I ain't leave yet; never will, love all
Heavenly Father in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ y'all
Stick with the fight y'all
Spiritual physical shit, c'mon fade that
Feel me though

[Chorus]
No they don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all? Never break y'all
Misfit maneuverin, tryin to take y'all
Plead, excuse me?
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all?
How could I take y'all, misuse, fake y'all?
Split serious please, they don't even know me!
Flash in the flask
They don't even know me
It coulda been flash in the flask
They don't even know me young homie

[Bizzy Bone]
It coulda been the flash in the flask in the dash and the cash
And the mask of different madman, flip blast
In the glass of vision, precision to, get past on the map
Very bad vocal from every paragraph
Blast about bad ass, booty and task
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat, mash on wicked minded and smash
What's nasty? Who the fuck ya talkin ta?
Take off my shirt, quickly tell 'em harkin up
Save last days c'mon, show 'em what we workin with
We praise God, Jesus Christ, most certainly
Baby, baby, world so crazy
Kinda hazy on them sucka, very wary time when I say

[Chorus]
Man, they don't hear me though shake y'all, break y'all
How could I fake y'all, take y'all
Maneuver, try to take y'all
Man please! They don't know me!
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I fake y'all, break y'all, take y'all
Please! They don't know me!
... For the, rest of my life
They don't know me
For the rest of my life, my soul
They don't know me

[Bizzy Bone]
For the, rest of my life the soul and spirit are priceless
I'd rather be iceless than to get played twice
Give 'em tussin homeboys in red, throwin up thrices
Peek deep inside the 4-4, and you can see rice
Like it or not, find it or not, I'm feelin Tyson
Fuck that sick round, missionary shit now
Licensed to pulverize, premise is capital
And the capo go fast in the battle
As they rattle an awful judgment, who the fuck you judgin?
Little grudges is so sledged in the murder while we walk in the dirt
Tryin to cure my little spirit, turn me over my lil' soldier
And they lookin at me tryin to keep me hurt
Feelin the pain huh, gain huh, plain huh
Throw up the one, stay the same huh
Rain come harder, call us homies huh
Footprints, mop, dust, turn the pallet
Power come quick fast, watch yo' ass
Hand on the hourglass, power be the God
Guess that, press that, full court with a fine ass wall
The sin it be the biggest, let's get spiritual
We're off into the light, when it's our gaaaaame
We flip pages, how we rock the ages, the kid is so amazin
But they don't feel me though
They don't hear me though, shake y'all

[Chorus/Outro]
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
How could I break y'all, take y'all, fake y'all
Maneuver man... I say they don't know me
They don't hear me though, shake y'all
Fake y'all, break y'all
How could I maneuver and then take y'all
They don't know me, they don't know me
They don't know me, they don't know me
Evidently they don't know me
How could I fake y'all, shake y'all, break y'all?
They don't know me... heheh</pre>
