[Devin the Dude - singing]
I got nuttin to roll with, nuttin to smoke with
And I like to smoke all day long
I got nuttin to roll with, nuttin to smoke with
I guess I'll just pull out this bong

I'm just sittin right here with an ice cold beer
and I got a bag of weed that I don't have nothin to roll with
I'm in the vocal booth and behind the mic
and I'm just, spittin some off the wall bullshit
I wish I had a paper or cigar
Somethin that I could twist this big ol' fat joint with
But without somethin to wrap this weed up in
I'm just beginnin to figure out the shit is pointless

I got nuttin to roll with, nuttin to smoke with
And I like to smoke all day long
I got nuttin to roll with, nuttin to smoke with
I guess I'll just pull out this bong

{*more bubbling sounds*}

I like to get high in the backyard lookin at the stars above and
{*laughter and bubbling to fade*}</pre>
