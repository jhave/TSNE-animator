[Left Brain]
Left Brain

Bitches all wanna be in the club with me, me
Bottles of the rosay in that V.I.P., P
With the Wolf Gang, Yeah you wanna be
Just because you got that ass don't mean you gonna be
I know what you want, you want this dick inside you
You want me to be your man and stand beside
I'm a player, a/k/a a slayer
I fleed out the scene told her see you later
Bitch, chocolate chip, what you drinkin' tonight
I'm sippin on that promeslane, cold and sprite
Yeah I'm moving slow, but the music is fast
Don't even start thinking about my cash
Yeah I know a nigga just payed for that cab
Cause driving drunk will end up in a bloody crash
But fuck it in the end of the night, I'm very well
And you can go and tell your friends the fairytale, Whoa

[Hook]

[Hodgy Beats]
Keep on playin''round
Watch you bump yo head
Hit yo noggin hard
Should've listened to what I said
Wisdom from the wise
Eyes all bloody red
Intoxicated dreams
Woke up in hell instead
Of my cow kid cottin
And a lady of breast
Neighboring my flavoring
Tryna see which move was next
Bitch I'm a secret agent
Fuck up as my gun
Maggin' up, extended thumb
Dragon tounge, nigga fire
You needa stop playin' round
Curiousity killed the cat
But you roll in dark and nightime like a bat
Niggaz be on the corner tryna teach themself how to ollie
And I ain't catching them catching the 7 bus home until I got it
Life of a teenanger, young, black in the hood
Inspirations of making out so everything can be good
Mellowhype lifestyle, odd future records
We the hot shit got them sneezing out this pepper, oooh</pre>
