(Young Noble)
This is a letter to my son
In case I happen to past
And he'll never even here it
If I happen to last
And I damn sure plan on it
By any means -- it's bigger than me
And I provide for my family
My son is my pride
Now I open my eyes
He got my peanut head
Exactly the same eyes
He was born 3 weeks ago
I watched him breathe
If is daddy don't make it
Lord watch him please
I'm coppin' please
Cause son it ain't safe out here
Everybody wanna see a brotha break out here
It's rules to life
Baby boy play it carefully
I know how to love you
Cause nobody wasn't there for me
A site to see
You was the reflection of me
A lesson to me
Better yet a blessin' to me
The best of me
I give you my all
Picture life without you
Ain't living at all
I give my life for yours
Cause now I'm living for you
I did it all for you
It all belongs to you
I give my life for yours
Cause now I'm living for you
I did it all for you
It all belongs to you

(Chorus) (2x)
This is a letter to my son
God forbid I die
All the answers right here
Neva ask 'em why
Don't cry
Neva let life past you by
Even though you can't see me
Son I'm by ya side

(Young Noble)
Noble be yo own man
Don't follow nobody
Get locked up
You know who care? -- Nobody
Souljah life ain't fair
I'm tellin' you now
It might not be nobody there tryna help you out
First of all you learn from ya own mistakes
The right one you take
The wrong one you make
Second of all Imma tell you the truth
Nine out of ten times I'll show you proof
Tell it to you un-cut
How it's 'suppossed to be
Make sure I always keep you close to me
Respect ya mama to the fullest
She had you boy
She tell you to do something
Be glad to boy
And ya sister too
And the same for ya Grandmother
When nobody else love ya
Ya family want cha'
Lil older --- you see what I mean
Everybody want a piece of this American Dream
Outlawz don't die we just spread the love
Sometimes ya gotta go to war
But it's better to love
Outlawz don't die we just spread the love
Sometimes ya gotta go to war
But it's better to love

(Chorus) (2x)
(Young Noble)
On ya journey into manhood watch the signs
And the only thing that don't stop is time
And the only love that don't stop is mine
Neva let nobody try to stop ya shine
You was born to be a souljah
So use ya brain
Inherited from ya daddy
Better use ya game
You got nothin' to lose
And everything to gain
Son ya daddy write rhymes cause it deal with pain
Still the fact remain
That I love you to death
And can't nothin' separate us
Not even death
Family first
Everything else is second
And ya uncle Pac told me how to sell these recordz
Puttin' food on the table for my family to see
When you grow up
You try to be better then me
Stay away from the law
And the world is yours
Want something -- go get it
And you call it yours

(Chorus)(x2)</pre>
