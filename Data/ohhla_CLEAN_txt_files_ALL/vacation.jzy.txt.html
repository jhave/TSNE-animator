[Intro]
I got to...
Like that don't you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hahahaha
Yeah nigga, say I see you nigga
Turn me up a little bit

[Hook]
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
My days, so long
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
Got to, move on

[Chorus]
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Decatur where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin to The Bluff where it's rough
See if I can pick me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin to College Park where it's dark
See if I can get me up some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin to the four where it good
And errbody know I make it snow
I need a vacation

[Verse 1]
You see me standin here, like a chandelier
Gangsta of the year, sippin Belvedere
I'm smokin Inglewood, I'm feelin hella good
A nigga wish he could, I wish a nigga would
I'm smokin on the good, I'm grippin on the grain
Louie the thirteen, mixed with Hurricane
And like a crippled mayne you can catch me with that cane
Gon' be a bloody murder if I catch you with my chain
See these hatin ass niggas gettin on my nerves
I'm so disappointed y'all, I'm at a loss for words
I put it on the hood, I'm gettin money till I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin is the muh'fuckin Feds

[Chorus]
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Kirkwood where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Thomas Field where it's rough
See if I can get me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Allen Temple where it's dark
See if I can get me up some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Bankhead where it good
And errbody know I make it snow
I need a vacation

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm outta here, send you a postcard
And if you outta that, send you some more hard
I need a peace of mind, some relaxation
I'm mindin my bid'ness, so why you niggas hatin?
I keep it too real, so why you niggas fakin?
You try it if you want, cause my niggas waitin
Won't let you stress me out, won't let you worry me
Just cause I'm doin good, won't let you murder me
It's drivin me insane, it's makin me crazy
You know you owe a nigga, so fuck you, pay me
I put it on the hood, get money till I'm dead
The only thing I'm fearin is the muh'fuckin Feds

[Chorus]
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Pittsburgh where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Summerhill where it's rough
See if I can get me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Edgewood where it's dark
See if I can get me up some hard
I need a vacation
Jonesboro South where it good
And errbody know I make it snow
I need a vacation

[Hook]
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
My days, so long
Said I'm stressed out, so tired
Got to, move on

[Chorus]
I need a vacation
I'm goin to Decatur where it's greater
See if I can stack me up some paper
I need a vacation
I'm goin to The Bluff where it's rough
See if I can pick me up enough
I need a vacation
I'm goin to College Park where it's dark
See if I can get me up some hard
I need a vacation
I'm goin to the four where it good
And errbody know I make it snow
I need a vacation</pre>
