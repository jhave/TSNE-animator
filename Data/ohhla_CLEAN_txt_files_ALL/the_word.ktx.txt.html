Verse One: Damien

With this mic in my right hand
I can reshape the face of the world
And shift sands
Child, woman, and man stand on command
Communicating with others across foreign lands
Understand
The Word can bring wisdom to a fool
A destructive weapon
Or constructive tool
The words that I speak
Can give power to the weak
Courage to the meek
Hope to the bleak
The power
To combine with minds of many kinds
Whether written or recited
Or spoken within a rhyme
In time
The way my very life is defined
Crossing over cultural and economical lines
The ability to break barriers
Break bread
Break ground
Break it up
Break it down
Words can contact
And impact with sound
Make contracts with verbs
And attack with nouns

[Chorus]

What's the word
People all around stay bound
By the Word
Spoken in tongues
Or even sung
What's the Word
Communicate from state to state
With the Word
Live by the Word
Die by the Word

Verse Two: Mic

Every match is like a Royal Rumble
Every man for himself
With every step I take
I'm gaining more health
Ain't no good MCs left
Cause their minds ain't right
Wanna get a record deal
But can't deal with the MIC
Camouflage couldn't hide you
From these words I serve
Check the pulse
Rappers ain't got the heart or nerve
Realize
Looking at fraud guys through God's eyes
Utilize the mind
As the guiding light through lies
Specialize in the rhyme, dialects, and beats
Enemy crews unite
But can't compete
Nor defeat
Anything like this
My likeness is priceless
The two nicest on mic devices
Is me and D
Weak MCs
Yo, we're training 'em
On the other side of tracks
In cells bangin' 'em
My words stimulate the nerves in your cranium
They want the gold and platinum plaques
We want uranium
I flip the game
To make the players think I'm playing 'em
My people think I'm evil
Cause I rhyme with Damien
K-otix Universal is law
Leave 'em open-jawed
Cause the words I say is raw

[Chorus]

Verse Three: Damien (Mic)

Many with the power
Abuse it
Many with the power know not how to use it (Word)
I can make a living
Or bring death
Initiate a change
Every time I take a step
What's left
If there were no word at all
See, societies would crumble
Causing cities to fall
Even though we speak in various tongues and dialects
With the Word
We connect in universal respect
Check Check
Bringing attention to the ignored
Comprehension to whatever wasn't mentioned before
I can illustrate a clear idea with metaphor
A mere syllable will have you feeling for more (Word)
Plus the meanings even change with the trends
Little words with four letters
Often seem to offend
What I say
Can provoke war
Or invoke peace
When I'm speaking through a mic
It's like my power's increased

[Chorus]</pre>
