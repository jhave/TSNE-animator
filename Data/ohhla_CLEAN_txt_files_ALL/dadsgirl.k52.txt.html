Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You're so beautiful
You'll always be daddy's girl
You're so beautiful
You'll always be daddy's girl

Just an average girl they might've missed ya
You got a mom a step dad a little sister
I know his words they used to hit ya
You feel fat and ugly so your getting thinner
Sometimes you throw up or you skip dinner
Sometimes you hate the face you see in the mirror
You cry at night but nobody ever seems to hears ya
Nowhere to turn its getting no clearer
You got father in heaven though who wants to hold ya
Wrap ya in his arms lay ya head on his shoulder
Keep ya safe and warm when this world is getting colder
Tell you that you're beautiful over and over
He sees u struggling cause he's the one that knows ya
Sees the pain ya in plus he wants to show ya
How much you mean to him that's why I hope ya
Take the love he gives this is what he told ya saying...

Well do you hate what your looking at
Hate looking at this person that's looking back
Hate the way that they talk behind your back
So ashamed when ya walking to ya class
And every time now that you pass
They tease you any way they can it makes ya mad
You wanna run away from all the stress you have
Just want to fit in but it seems you never can
The other girls treat you like you're so strange
In your life it seems like things never gone change
You just feel like a no name.
And all you wanna do is make it all go away
Skipping school sneaking out your coming home late
Far from cool so you coming up with no dates
How did your own face become what you so hate
When all along you couldn't hear what he was gone say it was..

Do you see how much you mean now to your Father
He don't make no junk but yet you feel you gotta
Chase so many things that this world wants to offer
You got so many needs he wants to fill yet you bother
To try to run after anything this world will give
But do you understand how beautiful you are to him
Cause then and only then that's when you truly live
That's when you comprehend who my Jesus is
Now to every single girl down to every kid
That struggles with your looks but now you always hid
How you felt deep inside but you always wish
To be somebody else well listen up to this
Don't believe the junk don't believe the lies
Cause your always beautiful now through his eyes
In your life you can find ya peace of mind
Cuz for you he died now here's the reason why</pre>
