[DJ Khaled]
We the best
I represent the hood
I represent the ghetto
I represent the people
I represent you
LISTEN!!!

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldnt change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggaz in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because.....
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'

[The Game]
Ayo Cali
Walk with me
Yeah thats what got me here
The chucks the khaki suits
All the swap meet years
The six dollar socks the five dollar rocks
Uncle Greg rest in peace he taught me how to chop
Thats why I love the hood and everything we got
From the ice cream trucks to the fourty ounce tops
All white Air Force Ones to fake Jacob watch
A few reasons why I drive the Bently hard top
Use it in my songs cause I live it on the block
Tattoo it on my face let the whole world watch
I'm that type of nigga yall made my city bigger dawg
Turn the TV off got tired of watchin Jigga boss
So we told our mom's we was lookin for jobs
When we was really in the record store lookin for Nas
Project of the ghetto, Ghetto and the project
From compton to being Dre's number one prospect so.....

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldnt change me
No diamond rings or them fancy cars
Cause my niggaz in the hood woulda let me
Holler this because.....
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the pojects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'
(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'

[Jadakiss]
AAHHAA!!!
Yeah ugh
They know
Yeah ugh
Aint no help there just food stamps
Weight checks and welfare
Every man gone for self there
Still might need to borrow your medicade card for health care
Yeah if you never got knocked then you made it
Everybody know eachother if not they realated
You can get shot or get bladed
Theres dudes that got jobs now that had blocks in the eighties
Six months five years for you just to cop out
Ninth or tenth grade is usually when niggaz drop out
Fights break out when you wired and start joking
Alot of OG's retired and started smokin
House party games of spade sweet kool-aid
Loud music all night till the boys in blue raid
So therefore I could never be too paid
I know where I'm going and where I'm from will get you laid

[Dre]
All the money in the world couldnt change me

[Trick Daddy]
Haha
Tell me this how come
Black folks get a little doe
And forget where they come from
Man we used to have good times
But since you moved on up you aint cool with us
We still support you tho we dont see you much
You aint the first fool its cool with us
But why you living out your idols dreams
Remember how for you came and help you keep those thangs
Now its cool that your adress changed
But I'm tryna holla at my dog and the number aint the same
I guess new homies came with his fame
But see true homies will stay the same
Through all the up's and down's in your career
A couple wives few kids scattered here
And when you dead or broke without a deal
All the groupies cleared... The ghetto will still be here

(I'm from the ghetto) I'm from the ghetto
(I'm from the projects) I'm from the projects
All over the world and every hood they know
I'm from the ghetto and thats fo sho'</pre>
