CUNT, New York City New York City CUNT!
Whatever
Yo I'll put it blunt if that's what you want
Yo I am a Cunt and that's what you want
You take affront, just shake your butt just shake your butt
New York City? What!
I'm busy, getting busy on the mic
Cause I do, do whatcha like
Jump high, yeah hit that height
Now bounce that ass, just bounce aight?
Ya'all show me love when I step in your club
I'm nasty, I don't care, you bug
Hey check me, fresh candy on the shelf
When I think about me, I touch myself
CUNT!

It's hot in the city, I'm from New York City
Not Atlantic City no New Jack City
Hey yo Kansas City, I love New York City
Wha? Twin City is my titties
I'm money, put your mouth where the bitch is
Ya'all finished check my sink
wash dishes, Vicious, I'm the CEO see
You wanna get with me, work for me
CUNT!

Gotcha on lock walk on the block
ya'all wanna talk cuz you're ugly I'm not
I got a man (What's your man got to do with me?) --Exactly!
Coutures fight to dress me
SAT scores ain't high to test me
Dow Jones on my ass try and assess me
Steal your shit then do the cop that arrests me
Rentin the Bentley just to rock Wendy's
Frosty on my Fendi crash into your Hyundai
Blob of the Bengay put it in your panty
so while I fuck you man your thing's burnin with the Bandaid
Ya'all don't wanna mess with me
honestly, they call me the other white meat
I keep my fee so deep
I got those motherfuckin Jetson jets on my feet
Ya'll don't wanna mess with me
honestly, they call me the other white meat
I keep my fee so deep so high
I don't gotta finish my rhyme</pre>
