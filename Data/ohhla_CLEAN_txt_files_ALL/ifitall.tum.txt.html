[Tum Tum]
Had more fights than Sugar Ray Robinson, more car wrecks than Yay
Did get hit in a drive by, still hurr today
Is the Lord trying to tell me something, I think that he is
Had to change my lifestyle up, you know what it is
Had to show another squad, still love em the same
But at this point in life, we're not in the same mindframe
Tree told me, separate the helpers and the hurters
Only run with the ones, that will help you over hurdles
Broke down the list, X'd off a few
It hurt, but you gotta do what you gotta do
Look people in they eye, you'll see straight to they heart
You could tell if they A-1, from the start

[Hook]
It's two type of niggaz, trill and the lame
Suppose to be your partnas, then they go against the grain
First the money come, then the new friends follow
Will they still be here, if it all go tomorrow
A bitch is a bitch, and I love my bitch
A hoe is a hoe, she'll sleep with your bro
Man I'm trying to tell ya, stay on all ten toes
Because the do', turn friends into foes

[Trae]
It's like my partnas turn to foes, ever since I got off my ass
I went to get it for the hood, but I guess I got it too fast
It's like they turn to camouflage, when I started collecting cash
So I'm doing it by my lone', with a frown that display my mask
It ain't nothing personal homie, that's how I had to learn to take it
They knowing me being real, but instead they wanna try to fake it
I started out with a hundred niggaz, repping the gang
And about fifty percent of they ass, went straight down the drain
But I'm truly dreaming for niggaz, who ain't dreaming the same
So I'm riding through the hood in my Cheve, just doing my thang
I told em get they shit together, and come get in my lane
But for now, it's like they going against the grain

[Hook]

[Tum Tum]
Blunt full of kush, make your problems disappear
Your high come down, and your problems reappear
Just lost Ms. Understeen, I know Skoola took it hard
Me I'm happy for her, cause I know she with the Lord
How can it be so good, and bad at the same time
They told me hold on, I tell em it's no time
They asked me when I blow up, I tell em in no time
Just remember I told ya, when I touch down it's show time
Jealous ass bitches, you gotta come harder
Ain't been on TV a week, and noticed the hate done came larger
All the real niggaz, say keep doing what you do
Keep God first, you'll get what's coming to you Zilla
