Yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
Today's your day
We going out my baby
You and me
It's a safe location
Let's get away
For your birthday
Take a nice little trip
Somewhere cross the bay

Hit the mall
Go get your tips did up
Your nanny got the kids
Let's live it up
About a quarter to eight
And I won't be late
The 55 will be parked
At the gate baby

Make a wish
Close your eyes
Blow away hey
When you're done
Girl
Give me a kiss
Make a wish
I'll make
All your dreams
Come true
Make a wish
Girl
There's nothing
That I wouldn't do
Make a wish

Just make a wish
Write out a list
What's broke is fixed
Make a wish
What's diamonds
And pearls
You know
You're my girl
I'll give you the world
Make a wish
I ain't talking bout
No ifs or maybes
No possibles
Girl
You're driving me crazy
Make a wish
Now open your eyes
I gotta surprise
It's in the garage
I copped a CI645
Are you ready
To take
Your first slide
Cut the ribbon
Off the whip
Put the key in
And let's shift

Let's ride
From coast to coast
Hit a nice lounge
Might as well
Have a toast baby
On this special day

We're gonna celebrate
My baby's birthday

Make a wish
Close your eyes
Blow away
When you done
Girl
Give me a kiss
Make a wish
I'll make
All your dreams
Come true
Make a wish
Girl
There's nothing
That I wouldn't do
Make a wish

Just make a wish
Write out a list
What's broke is fixed

Make a wish
What's diamonds
And pearls
You know
You're my girl
I'll give you the world
Make a wish
I ain't talking bout
No ifs or maybes
No possibles
Girl
You're driving me crazy

It's your day
Girl
You're bout
To have it your way
We can set it off
At the spa
Black card no limit
Anything
You want you can get it
We'll talk no gimmick
Yeah
I'm committed
Gourmet chefs
Fireworks and more
Camcorder
Gonna catch it all

Make a wish
Make a wish
I'll make
All your dreams
Come true
Make a wish
Girl
There's nothing
That I wouldn't do
Make a wish
Just make a wish
Write out a list
What's broke is fixed

Make a wish
What's diamonds
And pearls
You know
You're my girl
I'll give you the world
Make a wish
I ain't talking bout
No ifs or maybes
No possibles
Girl
You're driving me crazy
