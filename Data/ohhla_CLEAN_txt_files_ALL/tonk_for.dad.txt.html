[Hook]
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle
When I was a young nigga, I always had to hustle
Always had to hustle, always had to hustle

[Verse 1]
I know you thought this track wouldn't ever could have a hook so long
But that's how this summer shit get down, you better get up or get gone
But I promise that this shit ain't just no other boring song

[Verse 2]
You can put your bitch up if you insist, motherfucker
I'm in the club with my kicks up kicking shit, just looking, but, hold on
Fuck what you rolling, it ain't that strong, it ain't that potent
It's either you flexing or you don't know shit
Fuck you and the horse you rode in
I'm Nick James, if you don't know
And you probably just don't know, cause I'm never in your photo
Fuck that Kodak, get your ass up
Hit that blunt, and then I pass it
Hit your bitch and then I pass 'em
Smoking mad, she just an action
Want her back? Nigga you can have her
Oops
And Nigga that was just the motherfuckin' intro?</pre>
