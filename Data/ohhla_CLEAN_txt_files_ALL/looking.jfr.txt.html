[Chorus]
I am looking for the one to be with me now
Are you looking for the one to be with you, now?
I am looking for the one to be with me, now
Are you looking for the...do you feel the same way too?

Come on, clap your hands, wind it up if you're feelin' alright
Clap your hands, wind it up, if you're feelin' the vibe
Nod your head from side to side, as you ride the vibe
'Cause it's a party all night
You can't fight the feelin' you feelin'
'Cause you're feelin' fine wit' nothing really on your mind
It doesn't matter if you're wit' your crew
Because (they can feel the same way too)
I came to get down (you came to get down?)
You came to get down? (we came to get down)
I like that sound
'Cause it's a party over here, party over there
Party right here (hey)
Few over there (hooo)
Keep it goin', keep it goin', keep it goin' now
Keep it flowin', keep it flowin', keep it flowin' now
Keep it going, 'cause this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)

[Chorus]

You know the puck don't stop here
Fuck, the puck started here
That's why I gotta put my heart in here
To give you that old funky-funky-funky-funky-junky funk
That I know you want
So get your boom box so we can boom blocks
Or shake it up somethin' pride for life
'Cause we rockin', right?
It ain't a question 'bout bein' true
Because (you can feel the same way too)
A little somethin' for the radio (hooo)
A little somethin' for the video (hooo)
A little somethin' for the jeeps (ride-ride)
A little somethin' for the streets (hey, hey)
A little somethin' for the homies on the block
A little somethin' for the honies in the flocks
A little somethin' from me to you
So (you can feel the same way too)

[Chorus]

Nine Trey, everybody wanna be a gangsta
Buck-buck-buck-buck, but no more, thanks to me
You got somethin' you can flip on the other tip
As you get lost in the smooth rhymes I rip
Years and years my peers misunderstood
That I made cuts from my guts to make you feel good
And if you get it, this is for you
So (you can feel the same way too)
Put your hands in the air, come on now
Put your hands in the air, come on, yeah
Feel the vibe, Jazzy Jazz in the place, right
The upper-ground sound and pound to knock you outta your hide
Feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
You feelin' a'ight? You feelin' a'ight? (yeah)
Well next time bring a friend wit' you
So (they can feel the same way too)
