Bounce (yeah), rock, skate (yeah), roll
Bounce, rock, skate (ha), roll
Bounce

[Baby DC]
It's Friday, I had to work all week
Keep the cool hip, school, gettin' A's and B's
Cuz if I came home with an F or a D
My momma woulda tripped about the skatin' rink
But since I got that under control
Daddy said it's cool, get his spark on
So I picked up the phone and called Rico
I told him I'd be at the rink for sure
Around 8 o'clock, they began playin' the grooves
That me and you like to bounce to
We rollin' man, on skates for sure
A gang of homies in the corner on the dance floor
Got the skate police always on patrol
Tryin' to catch you outta bunker if you gettin' too close
To the girl that you groovin' with
No stoppin' on the floor, keep moving it
To wearing straps to my feet, criss-cross to the beat
And all the people tryin' to peep the styles of the D
Cuz I'm rollin', just havin' a ball
No time to laugh when somebody falls
Straight bouncin'

[Imajin]
Bounce (just see), rock, skate (everbody skatin' on the floor)
Roll, bounce (c'mon, c'mon), rock, skate (rollin', rollin', rollin')
Roll, bounce

[Baby DC]
Now it's 10 o'clock and the music stops
And it comes back on with a slow song
The announcer says 'Couples only'
And then all I see is cuties rushing at me
So I chose the one that I knew could roll
Not one steady fumble on the skatin' floor
Follow what the Joe shootin' pass me like the wind
When Darnell fallin' down and back up again
And bysides from the club to the video game
Playin' Mortal Kombat, tryin' to arrest the thing
To the snack bar, munch, get my drink and change
Rested up, now I'm back on my wheels again
Straight bouncin'

[Imajin]
Baby D is bringin' out the fine young breeds
Parties jumpin, V.I.P.
We off the heez (we off the heez)
Roller skate is one in front and one be-hind
Everybody, grab your partner, form a line
And get

Bounce, rock, skate (yeah), roll
Bounce

[Baby DC]
And you know there's 30 minutes left (*sigh*)
I'm on my second wind and I done caught my breath
I'm on to the DJ's booth to request a song
Baby D's on the rise, now I'm up and gone
As I look to my side, I see my Daddy
So smooth, on the wheels like a caddy
With his Afro, lit it in diamonds is butch
And then I, switchin' lanes at a fast pace
Losin' all the slow rollers up on my way
So I can find that girl and all her friends
So we can hook next week and come do it again
Out here gettin' excite, the GA way
But I learned how to skate in the Golden State
Straight rollin'
So everybody keep bouncin' 
So everybody keep bouncin'
So everybody keep bouncin'

[Imajin]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
