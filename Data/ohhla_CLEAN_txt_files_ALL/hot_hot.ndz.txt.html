(Mad Skillz)
I got what it takes to spit mean (uh huh)
Shit what y'all know about the heat my click bring (uh)
More flows that shit means more cream
I been fuckin rappers up since I was 14 (uh huh)
Who wanna get hemmed up nigga test the team (uh)
Catch me timmed up nigga guess the jeans (uh uh)
You mad cause your girl got a spleen lean (uh)
While yo ass was cutting grass (?) king and queens (what)
In my lifetime I done seen things (uh huh)
Like manajes with Christine and Janine (uh)
Man haters talk drama they doubt things (uh)
Man I call they mammas when I wanna get my house cleaned (what)
Like hunting if I'm ever on the club scene (uh)
Man this shit I do with rap is obscene (yeah)
I'm stunning with it dog I'm a mad fiend (uh)
Battle me Imma do you like some bad greens

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Aiyo everything we make be hot hot (uh)

When I bust like a 4-4 go low (Get down)
Cause it don't stop like whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa)

And I miss from the track like Flo Jo

Naw Dog I aint gotta say the track with my draws off
To show my ass when I bust like a sawed off (pow)
Another dead rapper getting hauled off
They said the superfriendz crew was gon fall off
Help me out ready set FUCK ALL YA'LL
From the back Juvenile  style raw dog (uh)
Did I sell out cause the plaques on my wall? (naw)
Cause I spent a couple g's at the mall? (naw)
Cause I pump babyface in my car? (naw)
When ya heard we was back ya'll said (aw naw)
Face got tighter than some small draws (come on)
Plus your hater celebration got called off (oops)
Don't call us we gon call ya'll
That's what the labels used to say

Cause they know the super friendz about to scold ya'll
