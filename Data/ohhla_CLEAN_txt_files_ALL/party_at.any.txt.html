[Verse 1 - Anybody Killa]
There's a party goin' on, who's comin' with?
To kill the rest of that malt 40 and grab ya shit
I hope you got some money, cause I ain't got your back
Especially how cheap you was on that chronic sack
There's a party at the liqour store, don't be claimin' broke
Actin' like a cold 40 ain't good on the throat
Who you think that you foolin'? Cause it sure ain't me
Should've borrowed five dollars from your old lady
Is there anybody's cup as empty as mine?
Pile into the hoo-ride, seats recline
Stopped at the weed spot, order up another
This is how we do it, MUTHAFUCKA!
CD burned full of old school tracks
On the corner of the party store shootin' some craps
If this is something that you normally see
Then you probably live close to me

[Hook]
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)
There was a party (Anybody!) party (Everybody!)
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)

[Verse 2 - Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I showed up dro'ed up, khaki's creased
And a chickenhead hangin' on either side of me
Sendin' me to the store, to cop some 40's
And I take my time and make my way around the party
See my boy JD, the weed spot on wheels
65 Impala drop top, he make the shit hop
Copped it out and snatch the blunt
With two bitches that came through the skunk, we got fucked up!
Seconds passed, the chickenheads came back
Now it's off to minglin' and see who else up in the shack
The music started bumpin', there ain't no sign of the pigs
If there was, I'd pull my shit and split they fuckin' wigs
I'm high as fuck, and stumblin' off six 40's
By the time I see my homie ABK up at the party
Chillin' with seven hoes in they shell toes
Or they dream about sex and those in birthday clothes

[Hook]
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)
There was a party (Anybody!) Party (Everybody!)
There was a party at the liquor store (C'mon!)

[Verse 3 - Anybody Killa]
When I got there, shit was tight
So I rolled up a blunt of that chocolate thai
Everybody was chillin' out front, sayin' "What's up?"
Walk in to grab a 40 as I spark my stuff
Went straight to the back where the brew be at
Grabbed a cold 4-0 and proceeded to crack
Gotta dollar fifty sub and a bag of Better Made chips
Phone number from the hot bottle return bitch
It was a good day, perfect day to party
Hot bangin' bootylicious freaks actin' horny
Man, this party store is kinda like the club
Besides the bums comin' in cause the beer's cheap enough
I was gettin' my groove on, straight big pimpin'
Aisle of the party store, Bud Light sippin'
I heard a gunshot, my drink dropped
I coulda swore it was the fuckin' cops

[Hook]
There was a robbery at the liquor store (What happened?)
There was a robbery at the liquor store (What happened?)
There was a robbery (A robbery?) Someone got shot (He got shot!)
There was a robbery at the liquor store (What happened?)</pre>
