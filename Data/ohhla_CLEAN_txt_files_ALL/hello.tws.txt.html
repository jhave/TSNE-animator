Hello grimy niggaz, hello shady niggaz
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye
Hello dirty niggaz, hello bogus niggaz
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye

Why do I always be feelin like somebody be watchin me?
Cause they wanna bring me down, destroy my life and stop the T
In the '04 we done done big thangs and we been makin money
But the enemies and haters out here tryin to take it from me
At the crib my girl been trippin, sayin that it's paranoia
You gon' let them thoughts destroy ya, shit, I got somethin for ya
AK-47 and a Tec with two clips cause I get a thousand threats
So I stay peekin out the window like I'm Malcolm X
It's a shame that you might have to die for thinkin you was hard
I done seen you drive by, I done seen you creepin through the yard
So I gotta think like a soldier, straight up load and cock these guns
If I catch you creepin on me you might just get shot because

[Chorus: Twista]
Hello grimy niggaz, hello shady niggaz
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye (hello niggaz)
Hello dirty niggaz (hello niggaz) hello bogus niggaz (hello niggaz)
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye
Through the window, through the do', in the basement, up the stairs
Either way you come homie you better get me
Through the window, through the do', in the basement, up the stairs
Either way you come homie yo' life is history

[Twista]
I see you niggaz, caught you stalkin through the gang way
Now I got you runnin for yo' life when I let that thang spray
Now you gotta die cause you let a motherfucker pimp you nigga
Creepin right up on him with the 40-shot and scream "Who sent you nigga?"
Try to send yo' guys at me but I'm ready cause I got the cameras on 'em
Like a phantom on 'em, kill 'em dead when I up them cannons on 'em
Gotta make 'em all fall and them yearnin cause I'm off on the burnin bush
Instead of cocaine I'm sittin at a table full of kush
You think I don't know my enemies even though you hooded?
Blast through the do' when you pull it, bitch I'll take yo' fuckin bullets
If you ain't loaded right you ain't gon' be able to stop these guns
If I ever catch you slippin you might just get shot because

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Hello grimy niggaz, hello shady niggaz
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye
Hello niggaz, hello niggaz, hello niggaz
Hello niggaz, enemies I gotta say goodbye

[Chorus] - latter 1/2

[Twista]
I see you comin</pre>
