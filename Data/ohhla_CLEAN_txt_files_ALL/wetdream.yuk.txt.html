Man, hey you ever had a mother fuckin' wet dream man?
That shit is crazy man [Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
Fuckin' dreams man
Fuckin' these industry bitches man [Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
In my dream these bitches ain't about shit though
You feel me, oh boy

[Yukmouth]
I fucked 'em all from models to center folds
To rented hoes in videos
Bitches in thinner clothes
I used to wanna fuck the leader of En Vogue
Before the Benzo when I was 10 years old
Now I wanna fuck Free
Take her from A.J. and Luda
Stick a dick through her
Pipe her down like Rotor Rooter
Make the bitch maneuver
My jewel'll keep me iced out like Rick the Ruler
Then I fuck J.Lo, Trina, Beyoncé
All in a ménage
Off X and broccoli
And I got Missy ass waitin' in the hallway
I'm not a minute man fat bitch
I fuck all day
I take Sadé
Get head on the highway
Then fuck that little Mexican bitch from "Next Friday"
I take Tyra Banks from Chris Webber
And fuck her and Vivica Fox both together
West Coast forever
Now what's fuckin' wit that?
I need gangsta love
So I fuck even Da Brat
Alicia Keys in the back
Suck dick 'til they knee's get scratched
Then pull they head 'til they weave detach
What

-=Yukmouth Talking=- [Girl]
[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
My dreams be crazy man
Last night I fucked Whitney Houston [Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
And slapped the shit out of Bobby Brown
That nigga still had that thizz face
He crazy

[Yukmouth]
Mack 10 better watch his bitch [Watch your bitch]
Little Usher better watch his bitch [What your bitch]
Rest in peace Left Eye the shit
I make Chili and T-Boz both slob the dick shit
I like Lauren but I hate Wyclef
I take his singin' bitch Claudette and fuck her in the Lex
Next Pamela Lee wit her big ass breasts [Whoa]
I fuck the bitch since she like rough sex
Then fuck MC Lyte since she like a rough neck
Then take that bitch Jada Pinket from the Fresh Prince [Faggot]
When I was young I had a crush on Whitney
Now I wanna fuck Christina Aguilera and Britney [Fo sho]
And Shakira since she dance like a gypsy
Get 'em tipsy and make 'em all give me Lewinsky whoa
I fuck Janet Ms. Jackson if ya nasty
Ray J my nigga but I'll still fuck Brandy
If I fuck ya daughter I'll be wit the family
Down wit Quincy Jones
The nigga prolly win a Grammy
Then fuck Rachel fine ass in Miami
That's why the whole BET staff can't stand me

=-Yukmouth Talking=-
[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
Oh yea man
I can't forget my drankin' potna Mary J. Blige man
[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
She suck a good dick in them dreams man
Big ass lips
Oh Boy!

[Yukmouth]
Even if it's Dre Day
I'll still fuck Michelle'le
Take Lisa Ray bust a nut on her belly
Hit Mya on the celly
Knock her up in the telly
And I'll still fuck Kelly even though she fuck Nelly
I'll fuck Vita
She could be my murder mami
Get sucked from Charlie Baltimore
And then fuck Ashanti
Ex Destiny Child
I still love Farrah
Fuck her in the Porsche Carrera
Make her get her shit together
Then I take Pink, Tweet, Lil' Kim and them
Fuck Mariah so good that she forget Eminem
Don't fuck Foxy cuz I heard she fuck him and him
Fuck Ms. Jayda 'til she scream "Fuck Timbaland!"
Me and Halle Berry go half on a baby
I take strings from Baby
And dick her down crazy [That's right]
Then I take Madonna wit her crazy ass
And Stacy Dash
Then fuck 'em in the back of a Jag [Sheees!]
And take 702 and 3LW
And have a 5 way ménage at The W [jeah]
What you wanna do [jeah]
What you wanna do [jeah]
What you wanna do [jeah]
Bitch what you wanna do

[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
My dreams be the shit playboy
I'm tellin' you man
I took that bitch Kelis from Nas [Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
You know what I'm sayin' It's nothin'
That nigga ain't no pimp in my dream you feel me
[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
I'mma tell you who suck a good dick in my dreams
That bitch the Truth Hurts
[Dreams of fuckin' an industry bitch]
Even though these my home girls
They still give me good head

Y'all got good head in them dreams whoa
Let's make this reality baby
Holla at ya boy at the Grammy's shows
Or wherever you see a nigga at Oh Boy!
