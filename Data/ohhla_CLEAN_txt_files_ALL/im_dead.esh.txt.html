Who stole my soul? You tryin to kill me, how you gonna kill a dead man?
I'm already dead you can't kill me you God damn bastard!
I'm ddeaaaaaaaad

(CHORUS)(4X)
I know you tryin ta kill me
I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead, I'm deeeeeaaaaaaaaad

I'm comin in but I need some therapy
I gotta stay medicated just to keep some clarity
My cranium cracked open and started smokin
Fire comes outta my mouth when words are spoken
I spit this sickness, slit ya wrist with the quickness
The wicked one with the wicked tongue
I close my eyes and see visions of niggaz bustin guns
Snatch ya tongue outcha mouth and you'll hafta hum
Come get some, be another victim
And I dog fight all night when I hear sick em
Because I'm dead (I know you tryin to kill me)
Slugs to the head, blood stains on his shirt turn red
Never thought I'd get twisted like a dred, deceased so rest in peace I said

(CHORUS)

I'm dead from a bullet from a gun
Emptied out two clips not one
Narcles raid, you best run or you'll be locked down can't see no sun
When ya dead, you don't give a fuck bout what's goin on
Whats on the radio, what a number one song?
Bitch don't blow my bust
Cause if you do, I just might hafta put a few in you
Cause you don't have a clue, you know who the fuck you talkin to?
Lil' hoe, ay yo watch me go Quasimodo
So live niggaz copy the dead like a photo
Never rap about fans named Stan like a hoe doe

(CHORUS)

Kill me, Kill me, kill me, kill me</pre>
