(Apl De Ap)
It's so amazing when a show is captivatin'
Gettin' everybody jumpin' and celebratin'
Only one's own musically be overlayin'
Connecting energy circulatin' inspiration
Together movin' in a synchronized formation
And if you're feelin' down this is survival from depression
You see the lesson is we're rhyming for our mission
Abolish circumstance transmitting from a piston
Taking what I can but keeping peace in moderation
Ap is like an eagle with the alligator patience
Ready to attack any mic that I am facin'
No limitation where I'm takin' my creation cuz

(Will)
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that

(Chorus)
You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon stop)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (ooh wee)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

(Will)
I'm more than ready to slice like machete
Leave ya like confetti
Break hearts like Tom Petty
Are you ready?
Cuz I am every metaphor
You are nearly ready for
The media predator
Cuz I'll bust in your session and kick my own raps, yes
Grab the microphone and show you where the forms at
Tell your girl adapts cuz the rhyme contact
And she easily attracted to it just like that
It's like this cuz the way we capitvatin'
We put her in a situation where she debatin'
If she gonna up and jump and leave her mate and
Go promote for us down at the radio station
She likes the
She really likes the music we be makin'
She likes the
She wants to be down when we creatin'
She likes the
She likes the way the vibe's vibratin'
Yo, yo
She likes the way the vibes y'all ratin'

(Chorus)

We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
Cuz we got got it like that
We got we got we got it like that
We got got got we got it like that

(Taboo)
1,2, 3 Taboo is on the set
It's the family clique Broshiggez (aw shit)
Boy don't fret everything's aight
We gonna fall on up when Luis in flight
Yo, fuck the rhyme tryin' we on poetic control
Nevermind the behind and step ahead of your soul
And move on to the next with the words we bless
Cuz Black Eyed Peas is comin' hotter than sex
We're writin', rhymin', makin' the beats
Okay, hip hop blazers bringin' the heat
Motivate cut, cut and scratch the groove
Elevate then make them powerful moves
How amazin' is it?
It's so amazin' the blind be gazin'
Even got deaf people listenin' and sayin'
Keep on
And ya don't stop
We got the music that makes your body hot

You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
Hot, hot, hot (ohh wee)

You're so amazing, you are so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
Hot, hot, hot (y'all need to quit)

You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)
Hot, hot, hot (c'mon now)

You're so amazing, you're so hot and so blazing
You're hot, hot, hot (its time to go)
Hot, hot, hot (its time to go)</pre>
