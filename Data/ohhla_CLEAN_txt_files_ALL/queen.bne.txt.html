[Krayzie]
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, it's the Queen)
Yeah, the Queen has arrived
She's collectin' all the royalties
(...As an angel falls...Tell me the name of me, the Thug Queen...)
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, it's the Queen)
She's devoted to thugs, so we show her love and loyalty

[Thug Queen]
Thug on the corner sellin' drugs
E.C. where I run, about my life, don't give a fuck
It's 'cause stealin' my Mama weed
Just to smoke on blunts
Stealin' forty-ounces from the Arabs
To stay fucked up mentally stuck
Feelin' I'm a little nigga with no nuts
Just for a double up, helpin' the devil
Turn this soldier's soul to dust
Who can I trust when I'm just livin' for lust?
I lost my Daddy to the shit - the drug epidemic
Got everybody and they muthafuckin' mama sinnin'
Just wishin' for new beginnings
Prayin' the Lord will forgive me
Just searchin' for what's missin'

[Krayzie]
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, that's the Queen)
yeah the Queen has arrived
She's collectin' all the royalties
(...Forever humble. Forever devoted. This queen is humble...)
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, that's the Queen)
she's devoted to thugs, so we show her love and loyalty

[Thug Queen]
No direction, knowin' nowhere to turn
Mama say I'm actin' too grown; she kick me out
On my own, so alone, no place to call home
Hear a angel tellin' me
Just stay strong (you better be strong, just stay strong)
Bailin' back to Land that I call my home
My friends have turned to foes, 'cause I went broke
Ain't had shit to eat
But potato chips in about a month
On the block losin' focus
In the front of the church, sellin' dope
Feelin' hopeless, copeless, 'cause I'm homeless
Shit, I gotta serve to eat
Feel the Lord hate me
'Cause I'm livin' in a world so shady
Stay intoxicated so my problem don't overweigh me
Prayin' daily that the Lord'll help me
Lord save me, devil raid me

(Chorus)

[Thug Queen]
Queen with a seed inside of me
Offsprings of a black queen
Planted secretly by Almighty
Ignite a flame inside of me
Gotta use another strategy
These streets ain't helpin' me
See, my destiny is servin' fiends
Basically, helpin' my enemies
Destroy me and my self-esteem
Through all the sinnin'
A Queen shine from inside of me
Gifts given to me: my qualities, Mo Thug, my family
We'll always be forever devoted to the thuggish side of me
The Lord presents to the world the Thug Queen (Thug Queen)

[Krayzie]
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, it's the Queen)
Yeah, the Queen has arrived
She's collectin' all the royalties
(...As an angel falls...tell me the name of me, the Thug Queen...)
It's the Queen (that's the Queen, it's the Queen)
She's devoted to thugs, so we show her love and loyalty</pre>
