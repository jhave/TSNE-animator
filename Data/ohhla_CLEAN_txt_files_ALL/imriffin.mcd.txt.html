[ Jesse Jackson ]
All of us one are people
Singing our music
Popping our finger
And doing our thing
Lets give ourselves a great round of applause

[ VERSE 1: MC Duke ]
To make things clear - let the world range
You don't need to ticket to ride on this train
Another jam from the Miracle maker
Wizard of the word, MC undertaker
I'm comin back for the ducks who made me mad
No chances - here's dad
See, I'm known to speak scientifically
Other rappers have great difficulty
Step to me, that's MC suicide
Neck snapped - you die
I'll never budge, I'll hold a grudge
I'm in a fury - here comes the judge
Steppin off, lettin off, bets are off
Get hard, never soft
Through my rhymes I ride and roam
This is a trip to Twilight Zone
The game's over, you better start listenin
I need freedom - cause I'm riffin

[ VERSE 2: MC Duke ]
You had Jack the Ripper, then the Jack of Spades
Not a new jack, the jack of all trades
I'll let you enter my train of thought
The record you bought, your attention I caught
Known to speak about men of freedom
Look for books on King and read 'em
I didn't come to make you alarmed
Your life ain't charmed, you can still be harmed
Now say things were rearranged
You had my colour, everything changed
No house, no dog, no wife
No material things, absolutely no life
What would you do, are you sure you could take it?
Maybe you'd die - or maybe you'd make it
Is there a chance that you'd survive?
Is this what it takes to stay alive?
The game's over, you better start listenin
I need freedom - cause I'm riffin

[ VERSE 3: MC Duke ]
Now I can hold a grudge for at least five years
Cause gettin even is my career
So the first line on the back of the last one
And if you wanna know, yes I have done
You see me, step out my way
Cause I ain't no toy, I don't play
That's not to say that I don't have fun
If you're lookin for an attitude, I'm the one
I get mean as I get old
And I'm twice as bad if I catch a cold
It's just the way that it seems to go
Can't beat the system, go with the flow
We cover and smother another brother
Throw him away just like a used rubber
See, the system says that we succeed
But I say that sucks and they're on speed
The game's over, you better start listenin
I need freedom - cause I'm riffin

[ VERSE 4: MC Duke ]
Now whoa - don't you step to me
If you do, you'll wish you never knew me
Get your gang, get your boys, get your crew
But I'll still get you
So fuck your system, suckers I diss them
And when they die nobody will miss 'em
Fratricide all across the world
That's destruction of boys and girls
You know the score, we all die the same
I didn't make the rules, I just play the game
If you start with me, I return the favour
Like Biz said (Nothin could save ya)
I start waxin, taxin, no relaxin
I keep breakin till I'm maxin
I'm on a roll, I'm in control
Your neck I hold till you go cold
That's how they play in the world today
We got no say, and come what may
The game's over, you better start listenin
I need freedom - cause I'm riffin
