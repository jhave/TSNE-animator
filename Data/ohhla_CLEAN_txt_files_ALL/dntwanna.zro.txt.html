[Z-Ro]
You already know who it is nigga, "King of Da Ghetto"
It's a new day and time, but shit
It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe
Y'knahmsayin?  I'm tryin to keep it civilized
But motherfuckers keep FUCKIN with me doe mayne

In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name
Z-Ro the Crooked, "King of Da Ghetto," all about my change
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain
There's some niggaz mad at me cause I got cash mayne
I'm the future of Rap-A-Lot, quit livin in the past mayne
Remember flippin with a brick, in the dash mayne
Now everytime I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain
Probably be somebody baby momma, I ain't ask mayne
Baby daddy got a problem we can hit the grass mayne
An Asshole By Nature, livin in the fast lane
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne
Honor Roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day-ayy
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around and bust ya brai-ainn

[Trae]
I guess they never seen a Guerilla when he stompin and pissed
But they bout to see a young Guerilla whoop they ass with his fist
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin and shit
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin me bitch
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it cause I had it By Nature
And that's the result, of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya
And I ain't trippin, I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet

[Lil' Boss]
I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it
Servin suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin like a {?}
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment
I'd rather keep ca-ca-cash, cause I'm alreaady wanted
I'm an Asshole By Nature, my flag's on the left side
Gave him a pass before I stepped {?} side

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black'n'mild
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin to make money stackin piles
Some niggaz trie to rob me befo', try to jack me now
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the _Lethal Weapon_ with maxi 9
Cain't a nigga lavish any mo'?
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?
And 9 times out of 10 it'll be one of my friends
that'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me
Ain't gon' be no bad actin with me, homie
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

[Chorus]</pre>
