Good evening ladies and gentlemen

[Heavy D]
Dig it (aowwwwwww!) C'mon
See you?  You be frontin a lot - uh-huh
You the type of chick to bring the heat to the spot
Cats be like whoa, when you out on the block
'Specially when it's hot, you like the neighborhood watch
See me?  I'm impressed with that
How you sound, Diggy bound to get next to dat
Guaranteed don't care, when I'm sexin dat
What'chu think?  One wink, and I'm smashin dat
Now why you wanna go and flirt with D?
Boyfriend all mad, he musta heard about me
Tell me who you know flip licks like this
Piss Crist' like this, with a dimepiece miss

[Chorus: female singer]
I know, you love me
Tell them they can't touch me
You're big and, you're sexy
I know, you love me

[Heavy D]
See you?  You be frontin a lot - uh-huh
Runnin off your mouth in the gamblin spot
You the type of dude that'll get cats knocked
Snitchin to cops, you be bitchin a lot - blah blah
Talkin 'bout, Heavy don't keep it real
Well whydon'tcha stop tellin, and keep it real in jail
See me?  I just play my lane
Baptize my game, fraternize with dames
Diamond lit crucifix, dangle from chains
Simple and plain, I'm handlin thangs
When it's warm, put my minks in the freezer
Bodyguard, two divas, with the two heaters in the 2-seater
Diggy gon' spread like germ
When it's my turn I jiggle my worm, wiggle like sperm
Watch me Bus like Bettis, I got a cheddar fetish
Because I heat up yo' spot, you gon' feel me a lot
H-E, A-V, Y-D
And I'll be damned, if you ain't lovin me, c'mon

[Chorus] - 2X w/ ad libs

[girl] I know you love me

[Heavy ad libs to end]</pre>
