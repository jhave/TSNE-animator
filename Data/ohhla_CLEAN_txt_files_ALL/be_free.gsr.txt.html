[Guru]
All, all.. let's get together now
This is the time for gettin fresh for the weather now
Seek the sheik speakin, and those keepin the faith
We won't have to hesitate
We just skate, straight, into the heart of it
This is the scene and I'm the Dean and here's the start of it
So see how things should be, and come along with me
Agree with this decree, and let your conscience be free

Release me, ? me, so I can set it off
And if your body's feelin hottie won't you sweat it off
Flow and go, farther, because we are the
crusaders -- so you know we can create our own fate
Great, let's get into it now
Ain't nothin to it but to do it now, fluent now
Word, you heard, this is the verdict now
You can shake it don't you break it don't you hurt it now
Flex, bend, and twist, into a motion of
just bein down with the sound -- I'll give a potion of
vocab, so go grab, the one of your choice so
Then you'll feel good like you should, and you'll rejoice so
see how things could be, and come along with me
Agree with this decree, and let your conscience be free

[Guru]
Girls, girls.. these are the details
I like sophisticated, liberated females
Dutch, treat, I have no qualms with it
Your shape is neat, and I'd like to grace my palms with it
Clocked the suave talkin, you won't be walkin away
Because I know that you'll stay
for my play, and sway, to rhythm pumpin baby
You must admit this is legit and you'll jumpin maybe
hold up, wait up, and don't get too excited
For genuine is the line while others you invited
Time for rhyme makin, and never fakin the move
So get involved with the groove
while I prove, smooth, that's how I kick it to you
Because with all the respect, I wanna stick it to you
see how things could be, and come along with me
Agree with this decree, and let your conscience be free

[Guru]
What's up, what?  I am continuin
All the chumps and the punks, I'll do em in and then
pose for those lookin, that put the crooks in the cell
Cause they're the wrong personnel
I propel, swell, and I start blowin up
All the babiest ones they should be growin up
Bright, lights, I'm shinin on you now
This is the time and the place, peace be upon you now
see how things could be, and come along with me
Agree with this decree, and let your conscience be free
Let your conscience be free
