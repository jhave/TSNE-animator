Typed by: timm2014@hotmail.com

My crack is working!

[Chorus]
Why you wanna piss Bishop off like this?
Da da da da da da
You better stay off his dick and mind yo business
Da da da da da da
Homie it's just too much money, why you actin' greedy?
Da da da da da da
You better get down or lay down right now
Da da da da da da

[Verse One]
You nigga gon' learn to respect the new west
Resistance is useless, statistics deduce this
I'ma shut 'em down like Tha Row did Ruthless
You niggas can't stop evolution
Dinosaur's been extinct, what's y'all excuse then?
You outta touch with the streets
You can lie about your age but can't hide your crows feet
You ain't appealin' to the children
Tryin' to dance like Chris Brown but you look like Charlie Wilson 
(Shaba daba tweet tweet tweet tweet)
I ain't hatin', I'm just statin' the facts
Even the greatest of the greats must succumb to that
Even Michael Jordan homie, had to hang up his hat
Get down or lay down it's as simple as that

[Chorus]
Why you wanna piss Bishop off like this?
Da da da da da da
You better stay off his dick and mind yo business
Da da da da da da
Homie it's just too much money, why you actin' greedy?
Da da da da da da
You better get down or lay down right now
Da da da da da da

[Verse Two]
I'm here now and won't be denied
Plus I carpooled and brought along new niggas for the ride
And I got Warren G in the passenger side
I'm ridin' for your ? till I'm old I die
Then we gon' do it all again nigga, ball in the sky
My new west niggas put some smoke in the air
And push these old hater niggas out they fuckin' wheelchairs (Church!)
You know who you is
I used to wanna be like you, I was a dumb ass kid
For believin' all the bullshit you never did
You lied to the streets, tried to keep the truth hid
Don't make me expose you, I got the negatives
Negative ain't what I promote
I'm tryin' to feed families give the streets some hope

[Chorus] [x2]
Why you wanna piss Bishop off like this?
Da da da da da da
You better stay off his dick and mind yo business
Da da da da da da
Homie it's just too much money, why you actin' greedy?
Da da da da da da
You better get down or lay down right now
Da da da da da da</pre>
