(Yeah)

Tell you 'bout my bitch

(Oh-oh, baby)

Some might even say she our bitch

(Yeah)

I don't even trip

(Oh-oh, baby)

(It's you I'm keepin nigh
You, baby, that gets me high
You blew my mind a thousand times
My savior of a troubled life
Laced up too just how I like
Everything sweet, a pure delight
You got me fiending day and night
Anticipating your very sight)

I was 16 years old when I met this hoe from Flint
And found she was out cold when I tried to let her through
Flashbacks of bein without her, with me
Fucked with me till I went and got her with me
Every day niggas ask about her, I know they on her
But I'm gon' hit this corner
To keep em from gettin on her when I want her
She appear, she in my system like a bomber
Name was Sinsemilia, that's why I love her
She never played me jealous, though 
When I be fuckin with some other hoe that she don't know
She in the cut like 'I don't give a fuck'
She's just so potent that she know she got me stuck
Run over like a truck
To me it's all a pipe dream
I'm knowin if she leave then I be on fiend
Though, so I lean like I'm supposed to
Come up with something no one can come close to
She help out, sometimes she let me in
And tell me, "That's because I love the way you took me in
I work better on whatever if you got some gin
So get the Seagram, we can see if we can both win"
She like that, I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only hoe I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove

(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only hoe I love)

She was the baddest thing I ever hit
I think it was November back in '86
Outside the [Name] she was doper than those other hoes
I've been bent since her scent first hit my nose
Light-skinned, peach fuzz got me buzzin and chasin
Strokin her with my cousin in the basement
She's all I ever needed when I was rhymin
I started clockin and lacin my girl with white diamonds
And I was all in
About this time is when I started ballin
I never got caught above or fallin short
When haulin some dope from my niggas in Flint out of Detroit
She kick it with my when I roll her with my dogs
Smoked out, cause this is not your ordinary broad
'No future' brought me closer to her
I use the odor through my lyrics when I do it to her
She like that, and I write that dopeness
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only hoe I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's My Dove

(Miss Dove, you got me feeling high
Miss Dove, so high as the star sky
Miss Dove, I place no above her
My Dove, the only hoe I love)

"Ooh, la-la-la
Look at fat, fat ass" when my girl walk by
Wearin shit like plastic and askin why
All these niggas in my area be actin high
Like they watchin Toni Braxton in they bedroom lie
Missionary and be very interested in I
Get up in her like a winner cause that ass too fly
I wish she had a pager
So I can hit her off with somethin major
I'm sayin she a hoe, I know, still a nigga don't pay her
24/7 she got her ass in the air
Fuckin with some other song
But I'm gon' still fuck her with no rubber on
That's where we at, everyday I be with my girl
Sometime I think she twisted like a jherri curl
Cause she be in these hoes' mouth constantly
Then right back in my pocket where she 'sposed to be
They say they always see my hoe off in the Bay
I guess I get with Davey, let him know I'm on my way
Hooked up the Yukon, the futon, I got the bomb, and it's all day
So let's get it on like we Marvin Gaye
And so I stay ever ready to be bustin like confetti
On your whole congregation of blatant player-hation
But she say, "Fuck em
Punk-ass muthafuckas ain't really sayin nothin"
She like that, and I write that dopeness 
Cause she got my focus
Clownin like it was jokers
Buzzin like it was locust
The only hoe I ever loved
Since I came up in this muthafucka, that's Miss Dove
