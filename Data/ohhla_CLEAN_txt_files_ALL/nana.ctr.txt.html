[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
No, no no no, no no no (IGH!)
No no no, no no no (IGH!)
No no no, no no no (IGH!)

[Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' (IGH!) Chance the Ruthless
Trip 'shrooms and lucy (hah!) dreams is lucid
Loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus (IGH!)
Deuces douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BLAOW)
Shoes might boot 'cha and a suit might suit 'cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy (IGH!) cigarette ashin'
'til my voice get raspy; last week suspended
Last night kissed Va$htie, parleyed with Ashley
Always in the hallway, so I never been classy (hahaha)
Shut up!

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na

(IGH! IGH! IGH! IGH!)

[Chance the Rapper]
Acid, acid (IGH!) get it? Acid
Melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette (IGH!) talkin' paper
If this was work (IGH!) I'd get higher (hahah)
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered (IGH!)
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like Bourbon mixed with Jack (IGH!)
Lickety-split, look it, he slipped on a shell
from peelin' (IGH!) banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat (AHHHHH~!)
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra, I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha mean? Hit me back when that mean shit (SHUT UP~!)

[Chorus]

[Action Bronson]
Na na na.. na na na.. na na na
Uhh, it's me, uh (oww oww oww oww!)
yow yow, ying-yow
Uhh, yow, yow yow, yeah, uhh

Introducin', Itâs Bronsonlino (it's me)
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino (uh)
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino (haha)
Lettin' trees blow, oh (yeah)
I rep the East Coast (uh) I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother
With a number on his back, ainât no fumblin', in fact, Iâm -
back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat, it's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back (uh)
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate (uh) I ordered chefâs salad (okay)
She had the club foot (what else) with that little arm (haha)
I couldnât help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on (it's me)

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Suck my motherfucking dick, it's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby, uh
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, {*gibberish, followed by coughing*}
Blow me!</pre>
