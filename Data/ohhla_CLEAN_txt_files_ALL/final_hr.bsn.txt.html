Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feelin
Stack it wall to wall till it's leaking through the ceilin
Man, All fucking hundreds so what's that like a zillion?
Working grave yard shifts cause were finna to make a killin
Went from intern to the owner of the building
Bussin nuts counting money like oh what a feelin
To be seeing what I'm seeing after I've seen what I've seen
it's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality
and pride that's worth more then a salary
and a text from the girl I love I stopped calling Quote "I hope it's worth all it."
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder
and then work harder then who worked the hardest
man the life of a workaholic
You either on your work or just workin on it
Man fuck it kill'em all we gunna need a ton of flowers
And if you need impossible give me bout an hour

It's time to turn a polaroid to a portrait
Rockin street clothes gettin money like I'm corporate
Young and gettin it, isn't life gorgeous
Bet the crib on em and you'll end up with a fortress
And I'm a need that new condo, town home, brown stone should I fuck with the dow jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead?
There's no need to save, I could get change off the street next to the meter maid
Cause I need a made house with a piece of shade
Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise
Bad chick with an angel ass and an alyiah face
Tryna show a little TNA.
Hell ya I'm tryna see the day
Man life is so bright when you don't see the gray
The new school appointed me to lead the way
A real nigga to the DNA.
Me mike grace and dilla stickin' to the script
and what's her name still lickin' on my tip
Gon a head and tell these bitches who they fuckin with
Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Man to get where I'm I'll make her suck a hundred dicks
Her mouth lookin like dannon because me and canon
and to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks
Man I got on versace shades
Versace belt, versace shoes
I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today
You don't understand man I came from nothing
This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about
Boy
B-I-G Sean Don nigga
