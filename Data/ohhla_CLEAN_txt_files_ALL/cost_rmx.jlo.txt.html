1 - Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
    Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
    Even if you were broke
    My love don't cost a thing
    Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
    If I wanna floss, I got my own
    Even if you were broke
    My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

2 - All that matters is
    That you treat me right
    Give me all the things I need
    That money can't buy yeah

Repeat 1

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Puff Daddy]
Yeah let's go baby
Bad Boy
Ayo ma' peep this
My game's tight like the way your jeans fit
Please believe it
Yeah you independent I can see
I'm glad you got your own dough
You can spend that on me
And why not, we can stack our dough
And buy blocks
If I got you got
Watch, they hope we might slip
But we keep a tight grip
And make hits like this, holla!

[Jennifer Lopez]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Puffy](J-Lo)
Yeah, yeah
I like this right here
Just come on, come on
Just bounce for me
Like this
Just bounce for me
Like this
Just bounce for me
Like this...
(Even if you were broke)
Bad Boy, J-Lo
