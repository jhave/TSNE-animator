[Intro: Franchize]
In my white tee
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I slang in my white tee
I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee
Serve fiends in my white tee
Forget a throwback, I look clean in my white tee

[Verse 1]
Step on the scene wit' some green, and some hard white work
Real clean, fresh jeans and a all white shirt
We all get money, and we all smoke purp'
Hit the dirt, one squirt will leave all y'all merked
'Cause I'm fesh in my white tee
They glance at my white tee
And I got that hat to match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see
I know they got a white tee
Homeboy, Brother, Sister, Mother, there go ya wifey
Hanes or Fruit of Loom be the name on my white tee
I gotta change man, there's a stain on my white tee
Lames in a white tee
I bring the pain in my white tee
Hispanic, white, black, even yang wearing white tees
Hit the club deep and we all got a white tee
A throwback, know that
Hell naw it don't excite me
You don't need no throwback, how you be set on ya white tee
You can get a sucka or a female on ya white tee

[Chorus 2x]

I hit them errrrrrrrr!!!
REMIX

[J.D.]
That's right...

[Slim]
J.D. whats good?

[J.D]
Yeeah.. Who in the building?
Nigga I'm richer than a son bitch and still in a white tee
All flavors, bath in it
I'm cool on them Nikes
These niggaz wanna fight me cause all they hoes like me
Pockets filled with hundred dollar bills--in my white tee
Man how my ice be--dirty that ain't like me
You listening to the 2004 "Teddy Riley"
Pumping in my white tee, I do this all night B
Straight from 'College Park' and got Ms. Jackson as my wifey
Riding in my white tee, it's hard to be like me
Club hot as Fuck, shirt off in my wife beat
Young, fly and flashy
You know how my cash be
White tee, white whip-- everything nasty
Looking like I'm up in Heaven with it
One of the best that ever did it
Paper, paper, paper
I'm jus trying to get it, get it
In the box, in my white tee
Throwin back that the lock 3
Shorts, pair of socks-- flip-flops
In white my white tee

[Slim]
I got Jersey's buttoned up
White tees ballin'
I'm in V.I.P, where the rest of the stars at
Tee  (?) chain over all of that
If I ain't a hot boy-- Then what do you call that?
On my beats be them bigsters
I lean 'cause I'm a gangster
You point, say they hot
My response will be thank you
Jeans gotta sag too, bop as I pass through
Short sleeves showin off my watch and my tattoos
Dark see doo-rag, hat's in the back too
Hoes on my clothes on a path to the bathroom
Dope boy fresh, and I don't wear 'Guess'
Got a dent from my chain, in the middle of my chest
And I airbrush white tees
Airbrush Nikes
I wear big, but I got a Air Force wifey
I'm white teed out
All you see is the bling, and on that boy shirt
It say Slim is my name

[Outro: Franchize]

Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
Yup (In my white tee)
