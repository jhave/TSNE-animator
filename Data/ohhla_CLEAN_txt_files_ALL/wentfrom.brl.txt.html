Been a hard road
Still walking this walk you know
From over there to over here (still smokin')
And its nuthin'..

[Verse 1]
I went from selling dope to selling weed and CD's
And doing little dirt for my BG's for green leaves
I went from knee-deep, from stateline to stateline
I had to make mine so I wouldn't have to take mine
I went from playtime to robbin in the nighttime
I went from daytime to mobbin on the bayline
to Alcatraz it was taking chunks outta my ass still I
I went from empty to a full tank of gass
I went from filty to clean when my momma passed
I changed and went from doing good things to drama fast it's strange
I went from pain to gain I went from game to game
I went from grain to grain, and went from the past
to the present I went from artist to the president
CEO Siccmade musicc is my residence
I went from broke to fiendin' for dead presidents
I went from no hope to king its all evident

So everybody rise with me
Realise with me
You don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Sicx when I spit this rhyme
Sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

[Verse 2]
I went from hospitals to funerals to graveyards
From Hell's Kitchen like Mel Gibson in Braveheart
I went from they yard to my yard
I went from having light scars to bulletwounds tight cars and silverspoons
I went from the southside to the north to the eastside
I let the meat fry, stress from eating pork
I went from me ride to I ride
I went from livin it up to writing notes that talk suicide do or die
It's been a hard road I went from slamming cardoors to 6-4's to 2004's
I went from blued out in clothes to never booed out at shows
Who doubt the foe led toast
I went from homies to enemies I went from gold weed to indonese
I couldn't stop needing
I went through every season I went through to every reason for nothing
Plenty reasons to be touching the remedies

So everybody rise with me
Realise with me
You don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Q-ball when I spit this rhyme
Sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

I went from next to nothing to pressing button and black keys
from 15 to 23 walking the streets
from OE to no weed I'm paranoid
They all tell me they love me, it's all null and void
I play with toys, you know, shots to big Zo
I went from 40 to 0 just to get hydro
I went from him to him thats how the story goes
Tearing from limb to limb touching the 44's
I went from Sac to Chicago just to promote
200 dollars in my pocket looking hella broke
Did the show and made 15 g's
and don't you know I smoked 15 bleezies
I went from I don't got enough its nuthin
I went to damn I got it rough, where's the luck at?
I went from hell and back I went from ballin in black to smelling up the
back alleys with Maui Wowee, I been telling you that

Everybody rise with me
And realise with me
That you don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Big Dan when I spit this rhyme
Sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
and I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time (you know it)
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

So everybody rise with me
And realise with me
You don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to E-Mill when I spit this rhyme
Sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
and I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

So everybody rise with me
And realise with me
That you don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to X-Raided when I spit this rhyme
I'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
and I'm all up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

So everybody rise with me
And realise with me
That you don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Jam Master Jay when I spit this rhyme
I'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
and I'm all upon the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

So everybody rise with me
Realise with me
That you don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to Royal D when I spit this rhyme
and I'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
All up in the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

One mo' time everybody

Rise with me
Realise with me
You don't know whats on my mind
Shots out to No Love when I spit this rhyme
I'm sloppy off the X when I writ this rhyme
and I'm all upon the cut when I hit this dime
Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time
(Tomorrow's gonna be different I swear this time)

Watch out

(Hey lets continue this shit -- into the next ??)</pre>
