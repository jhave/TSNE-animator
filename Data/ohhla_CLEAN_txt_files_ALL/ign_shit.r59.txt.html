[Intro]
Green Lantern drop that shit
Yeah, my nigga Green (Green Lantern)
We ain't gonna change the beat on this one at all cause
I'm gonna flow it all the way through. Gotta have one or two of those
This is Bar Exam 2 by the way. We gonna kick back
This is for my nigga Keno. (Shout to Keno)

[Verse One]
There's got to be
Nobody hot as me
Flow outta this world like Odyssey 
That's why your girl is ridin' me
At the cottage
For the summer, she like me
Cause I operate with numbers like the lottery
Dick in a duke shoot
What you know about sodomy
I do what I want with her body
I'm a commodity
Last Real Nigga Alive
2Pac's prodigy
Take it even past conceited
I mock modesty
I'm major
Bitch it ain't trickin' if you gettin' it
That's why niggas don't be trippin' if I page her
My whole clique just like me
We roll in circles in packs
They call us the Life Savers
She behave, I put her beside nice neighbors
Let her ride to the top of that high rise
And that dark fader
I call it that 
Cause the second you steppin' with the weapon 
It's gonna light up like it's light saber
The car creeps invisible through the dark streets
With the lights off because it's dark with dark feet
I call a cab at any Miami heart beat
My bitch drawin' my bath like she's an art-ist
I'm a kingpin, son
I don't bark at puppies I ain't Queen Pen's son
The second one of y'all rap niggas start talkin' bout y'all boxin' me
Bet it's gonna be Ding then done
Swingin'
Only my ink pen runs
Never been chased
Been A-1 from day one (yes)
I don't know who the fuck you is
But I'll show you what the fuck this is
I fuck with the same type of niggas that fucked with Big
Niggas that'll throw them over the bridge
Right after they fuck your kids
Niggas get all surprised when 5'9" responds to 'em
I'm like naw, I ain't gonna do the Saigon to 'em
I leave the slappin' to him
I do 'em more like Ben Wallace
Alonzo Morning and put the arm to 'em
Forget the arguin' 
Cause when the contract is intact
It's a wrap
Now the Mobb is signed to 'em
Fuck beef nigga
Life is short
It don't stop till they take you off that life support
Basically
Beefin' with me, your life is shorter
The definition of a Christ supporter
I come down like the wrath of the hand that made you
In the flesh of his flesh
And the blood of his blood, I bathe you
The flows amazin'
I closed the deal for show
My respect for your soul I'll trade you
But you probably already don' gave it to Satan
Cause how the fuck you doin' sold out stadiums?
To God, you as big as a baby bug
Doin' all them crazy drugs
You gonna be hotter on the day you judged
Y'all niggas peakin' out your careers like EQs
Deep down in your ears you're hearin' he's true
But you won't let it out, you're weak
You refuse
So I'm gonna stay deep in the field like cleat shoes
If I don' reached out to a dude to do a song
And it ain't happen
I give him dap and I move on
It ain't nothin' personal nigga
This is a business
This is the shit that we do to put our kids in cribs with
Nigga I'm an 80's baby
Fiend, foamin' at the mouth like rabies baby
Why you knockin' a G?
The only threesome you seen is on your TV 
Somebody with a release right outside the top of the key
I'm right back in 'em
The truth's in these eyes
So you can believe I
Like that denim
I still say Shady's the greatest
But some people believe 
I'm the only one around who can put the light back in him
But I don't like that
Gospel's Hostile like Kweli
And I ain't stoppin' till y'all niggas starve like Somalians</pre>
