Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This is my haiku
The sick pedophile
Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die

I think the world needs more light
Cause what they do in the dark too haneous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she 4, livin' on this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hardslide on everyone he come across
Molotovs go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatlands stoppin' the bad man, we'll grab hands
Girl he groping going in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol might just erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
There was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hey,
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratched out cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now a marathon done blew up
And it's bout has two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he'd done I almost threw up

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
If them was my youngins I'd try to bring the sun in closer to them
Turn it up a hundred and hold it up to them
Take a bite and chew them
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily daily
I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotovs make the night brighter

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Yeah,
Depresin' to seeing them
Was heaven cause we had sinned
The reverend is begging brethren to be seven and being friends
Tecca don't wanna see kiddies die
Mine is in the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yessir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of the meth would step in with death and press us
To mess a, good will divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, but I finally can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
This is for kids that once and often go through my head, they don't wanna run so off them
I don't want no sack on my pants, so I'm asking her friend,
"Just keep a list so this don't happen again."

[Chorus]

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
A wonderful musician once said
"If the people that are trying to destroy this world aren't taking a day off, then why should I?"
I feel that
So how do I light up the darkness, Mr.Bob Marley?
This is my attempt right here
I'm trying</pre>
