[Missy Elliot]
Uhnh, uhnh, uhnh, ooh, ohh
One, two. Ha, ha
Coko, uh huh. Coko uh huh
Misdemeanor here. One, two. Hit me
One, three. Hit me
One, four. Hit me
Unh, unh, unh, unh, yo

(Verse) - [Coko]
I woke up this morning,
And my man, he wasn't sleeping
I called over to his boy's house
I told him, "Give me one reason
Why he ain't been home since."
I told him, "It don't make no sense
That I got to try and find him."
Now he got his boy lying!

(Chorus)
They say, "He be back"
They say, "He gone to the store"
He probably out driving my car,
Going to pick up all his whores
And I got one thing to say:
Why you trying to fake on me?
'Cause I used to have you tamed
Now you act like you're untrained

(Verse 2) - [Coko]
You say you're going to a party
I see you at the strip club
You standin', looking silly
The third time that you done fucked up
Now you say that you're back on track
Like I'm supposed to believe that?
That you're now confinding
Now you got your boy lying!

(Chorus)

(Bridge) - [Coko]
I don't know what it is about you
That always makes me doubt you
It's those bad friends around you?
Telling you what you should and not do?
I don't know what it is about you
That always makes me doubt you
It's those bad friends around you?
Telling you what you should and not do?

(Chorus)

[Missy Elliot]
Why I gotta call your boy crib?
Why I gotta ask what y'all niggas did?
Why I gotta sweat you like a wack groupie?
See, when I was a star, you was claiming me
Maybe 'cause my records ain't selling no more?
And I ain't that fly bitch that used to headline tours?
But I'ma be for sure, just to even the score
Don't call Missy when ya ass go poor
Check, check me one time

[Missy Elliot]
Say what? Coko. Misdemeanor here
I know all y'all girls know what I'm
Talking about, when y'all call
Y'all niggas friend house
You know what they say? You know what they say?
You know what they say? You know what they say?
They say, "He be back."
They say, "He gone to the store."
He probably out driving my car,
Going to pick up all his whores
But I got one thing to say:
Why you trying to fake on me?
'Cause I used to have you tamed
Now you act like you're untrained
Check, check me one time</pre>
