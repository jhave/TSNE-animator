[KiD CuDi]
Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck, I never a fuck about what niggas thought about me 
I mean I did, but like fuck it you know what I'm sayin? 
You gon' love me man 
You gon' love me man

They can't comprehend or even come close to understanding him 
I guess if I was boring they would love me more 
Guess if I was simple in the mind 
Everything would be fine 
Maybe if I was jerk to girls 
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words 
Then maybe it would be okAY to say then, I wasn't a good guy to begin with
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy... 
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above... 
Feelin' like a airplane in the sky 
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy... 
They got me thinking I ain't human
like I came in from above, above, above, above... 
Feelin' like a bird sittin' high high

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I be that man on the moon 
I'm that man on the moon 
And I'mma do what I do 
So do you, hey hey 
I be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude 
I'm that man on the moon I'm up up on the moon 

[KiD CuDi]
Feels like I-I'm gonna play all my stuff for everybody 
You know and all my people give me feedback You know and they be like, 
"Yo! Yo, why, why your shit sound so different? You know what I'm sayin'? 
Why, why your why you shit like on anotha le-Why's it sound so different?"
Like it's a bad thing!?! And I be like, Why not? Nigga!

Close my eyes, high in the dark 
It's a curtain call, come one come all 
All I do is try to make it simple 
The ones that make it complicated never get congratulated 
I'm somethin' different, all aspects 
Don't want a woman just to love her assets 
I still wife her up even with her flat chest 
The type to get hurt but that's the past tense
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy... 
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong, cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame... 
My swag was a little different 
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy... 
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame... 
I got the last laugh, nigga...

[Chorus: KiD CuDi]
I be that man on the moon 
I'm that man on the moon 
And I'mma do what I do 
So do you, hey hey 
I be posted with my blunt and a brew my dude 
I'm that man on the moon I'm up up on the moon</pre>
