Review                                                  Alan Sondheim

sondheim@panix.com

Ryotaro Shiba, Kukai The Universal: Scenes from His Life, trans. Akiko 
Takemoto from Kukai no Fukei, Muse ICG, 2003: 

9th-century Kukai founds esoteric Japanese Buddhist Shingon after
traveling to China, the book a brilliant account of physical/body and
philosophical transmission, virtual carried on the shoulders of desire and
flesh. Saicho, founder of Tendai - both travel together to China, known to
each other only later. Later still, Ennin, translated by Reischauer, who
also writes a commentary on him, two books: Ennin's Travels in Tang China,
and Ennin's Diary: The Record of a Pilgrimage to China, which occurred
838-847. Kukai was deified, more tendrils described in George Tanabe, ed.,
Religions of Japan in Practice. Accounts are endless, for example Bai
Letian (Bai Juyi), Waley's favorite, appears in Shiba for his Chang'an (NW
capital of Tang) descriptions - I found his work elsewhere in several
transliterated volumes complete w/ the Chinese. There are meanderings back
and forth, everyone crossing from Japan to China and back on ill-equipped
and poorly-designed boats, many of which never returned. These journeys
read like spirit-journeys of skin and soul; Ennin goes in Search of the
Law, and his diary records Tang's Wu-Tsung's search for immortality,
complete with Taoist tower, as well as his persecution of the Buddhists,
almost to extinction. Later Ennin continued Saicho's work; Saicho and
Kukai had a problematic relationship, with the former declaring himself a
student of the latter - in Shiba, Saicho is presented as hurrying through
the Sutras (much as I do), not as therapeutic (in the Freudian sense), but
as knowledge; Kukai refused him a loan of some manuscripts, and, rude, the
falling-out intensified. Kukai was at Koya, Saicho at Hiei, later
destroyed. Of Kukai, later sainthood, legends, including his survival
beneath the tomb, eternal meditation, mummification. But then there are
accounts of cremation. Kukai wrote The Ten Stages of the Development of
Human Mind, 830, described in Shiba, and certainly critical in the rising
up and annihilation of world and consciousness; all these agreements and
disagreements are a far cry from monotheism with its tired and dogmatic
narratives necessitating loyalty, violence, and belief. There is always
space, such as the liminality within the sculptural mandala at To-jo,
founded by Kukai - who has also been credited, rightly or wrongly, with
the hiragana and katakana syllabic characters (that appear related to
Sanskrit, a language he knew well). Kukai also founded a university,
dammed a reservoir, built on top of Mount Koya, organized and reformulated
the Sutras he brought back with him from China. And within his writings
and travels - and within those of Saicho, Ennin, and others - one can
almost envision the origins of vision, invisibility, the accompaniment of
absence, the horizons of enlightenments. Not to return primarily with the
relics of Buddha (although these were also carried), but to emphasize the
inscription of the world - all those sutras brought from China - as well
as the necessity of transcendence. It's the letter and its erasure, a
semiotic formation that has never been equaled, I think, anywhere else -
and a formation that's neither Chinese nor Japanese, nor of this world,
nor of any other. One might move from these books to the sutras themselves
- as much as possible, I recommend the translations of Bill Porter / Red
Pine, and at least glance at the Chinese and the weights and absences of
the characters themselves.

lopsided pill becomes identified 
with pillar - this 2 the best of my 
recollection - thematic tracking etc 
- i have infinite sides - begin 
anywhere - they diverge - come 2 
fruition - my work is multivalent - 
there is no end 2 it -

such was written in the dark hours of futile despair therefore production
after another interview about xyz and i think it is one for the ages

from brooklyn

theyre' coming in the tubes, several to each tunnel, theyll' burn
furiously, theyll' be in trunks of invisible cars, theyll' be the cargo in
the golfbag, the petcarrier- litterbox-, theyll' be simultaneous, were'
waiting for the compression wave, air and steel have nowhere to go, the
waters rush in, people screening, theres' no escape, theres' the blank
slate -

were' here in brooklyn, were' waiting for the end, theres' not enough
food, theres' not enough anything, the airs' thick with it, as i said
were' cut off, the tunnels are blocked with mangled cars, trucks, buses,
bodies, the bridges cant' bear the weight, its' beyond alert, its' taking
over all thought and presence, its' their gift to us, its' our gift to
ourselves -

we can only imagine youre' there, were' starving out here, this is going
nowhere, the electrics' cold, the presidents' an evil thing, i thought:  
ill' never look into the face of evil again, i was wrong -

he turned the world into a black slate, flesh into smashed flesh, memory
into smashed debris, he taunted them, they came for him, they brought the
rest of us along, we couldnt' fight it, they got to all of us -

the lights' gone out all over, theyve' seen the whites of our eyes, were'
going to die out here, youve' no idea, were' on an island past an island,
were' cut off, theres' no food or water, fires everywhere, father kills
son, son kills father, the tunnels are drowned, brooklyn is burning, women
aren't safe on the streets, theres' no shelter, were' going to kill
ourselves, theres' no help for it, were' burned out, the bridges are next,
weve' lost cellular, static on the radio, ive' got batteries, ill' listen
to some foreign station on the shortwave, theyre' out there -

they couldnt' be caught, you cant' stop everything in the tubes, its' like
from one family to another, from one warehouse to another, even an
ambulance, the police will make way, theyll' let them through, theyll'
make it happen, its' going to happen, its' coming now, its' not a dream,
theres' no food, theres' no water, i cant' make sense of things, we
couldnt' fight it, the worlds' exploded, the subways are next,


if i write the future it won't happen
if i write the future it will happen



in any case i write the future

holy days 


jennifer says:
god took us away from ourselves, god brought up back!

in the middle of the night: a flash!
these words, printed on the starry heavens!
what could they mean?
thousands flock to cathedrals and synagogues!
there are hosannas on earth and in heaven!
through god the world has been restored!
humanity is bathed in holy joy!
prayers rise to the vaulted ceilings!
miraculous sounds and lights!
angels flock bringing peace to one and all!
praise to worlds and deities!
praise to the lowest and highest!
hosanna! hosanna!
on these holiest of days: hosanna! hosanna!

harvest-talk in february coming


role of the dreamer in the middle of net-formed
environments - students praxis in cyborg theory
but not following what people are doing in the
field program - people interested in the misty
cottage but don't know what people are doing
with it mfa people practicing dreamers also
people from the thinking science apartment

lecture question of alternative worlds to
gathering / communication or experience other
than the misty world - holography - quantum
stuff - penrose - question of embodiments in
my-form, use of term 'defuge' - where the
symbolic breaks down - a moment where the misty
falls - how does defuge appear in mist-form
questions in mist-form - self, deference, other
deference - how do we pin down the deferential
in mist-form -

lot of this falls under - i made a programmatic
claim that mist-form should be seen as the
aporia of the interstices of harvest and
experience bring up immersive and definable

how are the texts dreamed in daily practice?

question of other worlds for gathering and 
harvest -

unadulterated text


the knowledge of the citadel came too late.
the ancient city.

nothing is happening here
i must put my affairs in order
my jewish back is against the wall

'I always said that one of the things I thought about my writing is that 
I try to write in the midst of confusion and be strong enough to stay 
there, rather than swim to the shore of some kind of conclusion, because 
I think that's how I live my life and to me there's a value in that.' 
(from Charlie Kaufman interview in Adaptation, The Shooting Script.)

it's safe to rearrange things, procreate file outputs, intersperse code,
hide behind kabbalah. here is text, i am on a journey to bring back the
law from another country. it is 399 a.d. it is 835 a.d.

it is not a.d., it is c.e., my jewish back is against the wall.

the wall is moving and collapsing. (perhaps there are no more walls, 
perhaps the world is an earthquake, perhaps we are all guilty. in any 
case, i must put my affairs in order.)
