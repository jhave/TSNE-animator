[Chamillionaire]
A-Keem drunk gleam
Unlock, pop the scene
Kickers soundin' like my trunk just swallowed a soccer-team
The candy-berry drop
Sittin' outside the Merriot
Is what got ya miss very hot
Tryna give me the hairy spot
My album ain't barely drop
I don't live on a fairy block
A scary block, where niggas get buried and carry glocks
Niggas be frontin' like they brave, cuz scary niggas get shot
Bullets be in the glock, talkin' bout "ay let me out"
Hold up..If you can prove I ain't the throwedest on the streets
Then stand up, right now go ahead and speak ya peace
Anybody? Okay, unanimous vote
We all agree that every time he touch the mic it get broke
Choke the chord til' it smoke
And don't get Twin pissed
He'll put the heater to ya lips and you'll wish that he missed
I hope you get my drift while I un-twist the Crist'
Lookin' like a poisonous light-bulb bit my wrist
I'm showing so much green, I'm glowin' so picture me
As a iced-out ghetto, statue of liberty
"Chamillion don't spit for free
That nigga turned down a G
I sent hI'm the deposit, he sent it right back to me"
For the record, Chamillion wreck-it
I wreck it so don't eject it
Disrespect have ya girl at the hotel showin' naked
Get it right dawg correct it
I got this rap game perfected
Detect the women went blind when my necklace reflected
Wood-grain got molested, does this mean I'm peverted?
Ya feelings got hurted, she want me to insert and squirt it
She wanted to make love to my voice, the first time she heard it
Look, don't touch me, to broke hoes I'm allergic
The jury was the verdict
Chamillionaire is guilty
Of being, off the hook, off the heezie-fa-sheezy filty
Bitch, get off the dick, this the Boss Hogg year
Nigga we all floss here, poof-pow disappear
Whoo!</pre>
