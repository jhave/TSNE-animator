(Tanya Howard &amp; Niguay Fa)
I'll be you friend
Though I love you like my brother
There'll never be another baby

Hook: [Akinyele], (Tanya Howard)

Sister, Sister (you're like a brother to me)
Sister, Sister (We go back like family)
Sister, Sister (Nigga I knew you ever since day one)
Sister, Sister (Man me and you be having mad fun)

(Akinyele)
Yo girls be acting like they my sister
What the fuck
You mess around and get your sister's ass
Inscest up
Talking about you can't buy them like your brother and shit
But we don't got the same father never suck on the same mother's tits
She'll have coming to this
Putting lego sticks
On my dick
Cause you cumquat and shit

Hook

(Akinyele)
We used to conversate and shit
For a little bit
You told me about the guys you hit
You said I probably lied about the girls
In the world that I said I done hit
But I let it pass
With a simple laugh
Cause it was the beginning
So I stay smiling and grinning
Even when you joke and said my wrinkled sweater reminded you of
Fucking crushed linen (that shirt is wrinkled like crushed linen Ha ha)
Anyway ha ha ha ha ha
Had to find that funny
So I said yo bitch would you fuck me for money
Na na na I aint said that I aint said that chill chill chill
This is what I said
Hey listen yo
Every time I try to set it off
You be like no
Quick and call the kid up every time you broke
Talking about some nigga played you out
Slapped you in your mouth
And if I see you you want me to react like pulling on
Risking mafia as I watch some kid's blood spill
Why you run around town talking about(yo nigga I get you killed)
Girl don't get me wrong
I'm not ducking and shit
Before I make moves I got to fuck and shit
Bust a nut and shit
In your gut and shit
Fuck you down
Turn you around
In your butt and shit

Hook

(Akinyele)
This right here
Is for everyone who got an artificial sister
This is just being sung for
This is just being sung for
This is just being sung for

(Tonya Howard &amp; Niguay Fa)
I'll be your friend
Though I love you like my brother
I can never be your lover

(Akinyele)
Yo this song right here is dedicated to
All the girls who want to be some dude's sister
So she can get all the priviliges of being the dudes girl
Without fucking that mother fucker
Know what I'm saying
