[Grand Agent] 
When it's phenomenal, you fiend to know who produced it 
Phrases frequently heard regarding new music 
Who's the kid rhymin? Where he from, who's the label? 
Now's a bad time to approach the turntables 
Try again next millennium or some other bag 
But when they jock a disc jock, it's another smash 
I just hit em wit it a minute ago 
On some exlusive promo to spin at the show 
Twenty-five hundred heads waitin on Black Star 
When J-Rocc throw your record on, you feel like Allah 
Visions of my image on the stage that I'm lookin at 
From the balcony to down front, I coulda took em back 
Every ear spectatin inside the palace 
Hype cuz my likeness just might bless the stylus 
But that was when I was the limelight addict 
Nowadays, gettin music added is my habit 
The kind you wait on to debate on, or hate on 
Ever since the ad wit the street date on 
And now the future can't come quick enough 
Promotional bandits out stickin mad stickers up 
They got grafitti ? all city 
The anticipation keep clerks at Fat Beats way busy 
Long for the day of reckoning 
We make it so that when the album drop 
You cop nuff respect again 

[Chorus] 2x 
And now you want it like every five minutes 
You recognize vintage when I spit it 
From the Illadel side all the way to Venice 
No flaws, no blimish, you lust for it endless 

[Grand Agent] 
Word life, thought you heard it last month but wasn't sure 
Now you so salty, what you lent it to your cousin for? 
Not that you thought you would see it again 
Lent the mixtape you hate, either one that you lend 
Or is it the same joint that's on your box now? 
When your man's ridin shotgun, point out the style 
Then he turn it down, speakin on some pigeony shit 
Like the whip wasn't yours, like you let him forget 
So you scrape up some manhood and give him a look 
By the time you turn it back up, you recognize the hook 
Meanwhile inside your Honda, the gonga go clockwise 
Cuz you from the markets where private stock risin 
Fall by the bounce cuz you bounce hard and plastered 
It's the same joint, it just sound better mastered 
Try to tell brothas but you couln't recollect 
How my newest labors went, you just knew it was correct 
Caught a line here, a verse there 
But the flow, you couldn't do justice 
Told them "Look, all I know is Grand came wit it 
He followed up like a publicist" 
You're still thinkin 'bout the tape your cousin covered it 
But can you blame her, it is off the gauge 
Required listenin for livin in the Grand Age 
It's like that... 

Chorus 2x 

[Grand Agent] 
Now I'm like Wyatt Earp, come through, quiet your turf 
Get your city up in the arms wit the science I birth 
I'm oxygen, my coast to yours 
Line the meaning up wit the jetstream and get it across 
It's all about asthetics, the sound 
Satisfaction is my attribute 
The proper noun, hands down 
It's the retail spots known as the Grand Agent 
See me at the in-store, hear me at the station 
Feel me at the concert, live is the preferred way 
Fuck what you heard, only a herb'll say wordplay 
Now you found out the livest sound out but sort out 
That be mine, your shit wasn't thought out 

Chorus 2x 

And now you want it every five minutes.... </pre>
