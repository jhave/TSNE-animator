God damn man these radio station be buggin
Man it's three o'clock in the mornin, damn
This hip-hop shit just keep
Damn we got to slow this shit down man, yaknowhatImean?

[Tekitha]
Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there

Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress

As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then suddenly in the sky

Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)

False MC's are melting
In the dark, all the weak LP's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn

God released the tape out, early May

And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang

Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress

Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posess

As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky

Billboards started melting
In the dark, all the weak MC's are
going dowwwwwwwwwwwn

God released the tape of, Earthly pain

And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme

And I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmmmmmme

Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
