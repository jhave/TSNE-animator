[Intro - Maimouna Youssef - singing] - 2x
It's, just, crazy
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy worldddddddd

[Verse 1 - Skillz]
Skillz, come on
Has there ever been a time? (yep)
You thought you'd lose my mind (yep)
The world is crazy but trust me that's how it's designed
This country's blowin up, the gas lowin up
The Million Man March, niggaz ain't showin up
Man, what the fuck is happenin?
Where's the fuckin action?
The richest country in the world, seems like we always lackin
Somebody call Oprah, tell her I'm comin over
You got the money hunny, why don't you spent it where you 'sposed to?
Don't bring no babies here, it's too shady here
Yeah, it's easy livin, but shit, it's kind of crazy here

[Chorus - Maimouna Youssef]
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy worldddddddd
It's, just, crazy
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy worldddddddd

[Verse 2 - Skillz]
Yeah, yeah, hey
There's youngin's on my block, with pockets full of rocks
The used to think that school was cool, but that came to a stop
The madness settin in, I know a veteran
He fought for his country, can't afford his medicine (damn!)
This whole place is screwed, I hate to watch the news
I used to rap but now, I think I should sing the blues (oh!)
Does anybody care? Is everybody weird?
The internet's not even real and you ain't safe in there!
I know a baby, she 'bout to have a baby
So I've been thinkin lately, is this whole place crazy?

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break 1 - Maimouna Youssef]
Stop, look, lis-ten
Turn, on, to, it
Ya heard me?

[Break 2 - Both]
Stop, look, lis-ten
Turn, on, to, it

It's a crazy worldddddddd (come on, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, woo!)

[Outro - Maimouna Youssef] (Skillz) - w/ ad libs
It's, just, crazy
(It's a crazy) world
(It's a crazy) world
(It's a crazy) world
(It's a crazy) worldddddddd (yeah, yeah, come on)
It's, just, crazy
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy world (yeah)
It's a crazy world
It's a crazy worldddddddd
