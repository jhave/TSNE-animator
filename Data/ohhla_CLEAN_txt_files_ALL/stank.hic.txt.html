[KK]
Hey y'all (hey!) I'm the fool
Waitin' for them Catholic girls to get up outta school
Parked right across the street checkin' a tire
Tossin' up my KK hat so I could sign
Soon as I crack the thick ones get to walkin'
I pulled straight to the curb and start talkin'
Yo I'ma get either one so it don't matter
Gotta have hot sex on a platter
So dress lovely when we goin' out
(Uh, for what?) So I can check them backs out
Quit playin' girl, let me see, don't hide it
Cause later on them cheeks gettin' divided
It won't pay to play with K, when it's time to lay
cause you'll get left on the freeway
(Uh, so what you tryin' to leave me or somethin'?)
Girl what you think? You shoulda gave up that stank

[Chorus]
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about makin' bank
And gettin' you a lil' stank
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about blazin' dank
And gettin' you a lil' stank

[Hi-C]
It's Mr. Hi-C comin' back at that ass
Fools try to flex but you know they can't last
Chill with the drags 'fore I bomb to your mask
When I hit the skins I'll leave a gash
Baby come chill, let me dig ya out
Show ya what the young dogg's all about
When I get inside it you won't keep quiet
My D hit the P and it kicked off a riot
Wasn't nothin' burnin' and there wasn't no lootin'
Ha, but I was damn sure shootin' (Say girl)
(All I wanna do, is stick my D in you, with a lubricated rubber)
(Why?) Cause I'm a lil' hot mutha...
I ain't no sucka, tell me what you think
When I pop off inside ya stank

[Chorus]
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about makin' bank
And gettin' you a lil' stank
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about blazin' dank
And gettin' you a lil' stank

[Gangsta D]
Tell me why (why?) Why you actin' like that
Actin' like your coochie don't stank with your big back
You should know hoe, never mess with a young pro, of life
Wonderin' if I'll break you off somethin', yeah right
You better stick with your first plan
to find a sucka ass for a man
But not me 'cause I ain't that type
So don't throw drag 'cause I might throw a right
I'm not mean, I'm very much fair
And if you wanna come, I better take you there
So what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
Pull down your panties and smooth go up in you
And show you what I'm all about
Take it out your gut, throw it in your mouth
And if it smells bad to where I wanna faint
You can keep that stank

[Chorus]
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about makin' bank
And gettin' you a lil' stank
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about blazin' dank
And gettin' you a lil' stank

[Hi-C]
Ey fool, be cool with your Oscar Meyer
Talkin' bout you're hittin' it all night, you lil' liar
You couldn't work it if she gave you the job
But I get done like corn on the cob
Give me a minute and I'm all up in it
She never shoulda told me love no limit
(Say hoe) Don't waste money on the hair-do
It'll be nothin' by the time I'm through
Baby bring your crew, I got a crew too
(Orgy, orgy) Is what we gon' do
Now you gotta come clean when you picked up
Damn, this a good place for a stick-up
I'ma go bump-bump-bump-bump-bump on your butt
When I'm in the guts give me two thumbs up
Sip a 6-4, take a puff of the dank
Baby gon' have to give up the stank

[Chorus]
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about makin' bank
And gettin' you a lil' stank
Baby gotta give it up
I hope she hurry up
It's all about blazin' dank
And gettin' you a lil' stank</pre>
