Yeah, the motherfuckin East Bay Gangster back in the house
A.k.a. Mr. Kill Yo' Ass
187 Fac mothafucker
Nine-trey
G-Nut in the motherfuckin house
Big John on that goddamn bass
I'm 22 with a motherfuckin beer belly
Some say I'm a OG already
When I was young I had the lust to pull the trigger
Spice-1 the giggity gangsta nigga
Oh shit it's a glock and a clip
Put the clip in the glock put the glock by my jock
In my neighborhood niggas try to gat ya
Better watch out Spice-1 is gettin' faster
Quick to let the dick hang
Listen to this bitch sing
Her name is Mrs. Mossberg I think I'm goin' nuts man
Better back up off me G, I think I'm blackin' out
And every time I do niggas get bucked in their mouth
I keep one in the chamber so I can get you first bitch
My nine is at your dome
I think I wanna burst this
Switchin' personalities to another nigga
Spice-1 is the clip Ray(?) gangsta is the trigger
Soon to meet ya Jah steppin' to me posse
The 187 is heartless like the ???
Mini me say now me the gangsta nigga with the AK
Tryin to sell ya Dayton off the GTA
Got to get me hustle get me scratch every day
Mini me say wa the ma jackin mothafucker slingin' yay
Come again now
Me me got to get me hustle every day
Mini me say wa the ma jackin mothafucker slingin' yayo
Bluh!
CHORUS:
The clip and the trigga the clip and the trigga
Them niggas can't deal with the clip and the trigga
The clip and the trigga the clip and the trigga
Them niggas can't deal with the mothafuckin clip
(repeat chorus)
Shoot the heart out the back of a nigga that wanna squab with me
187 mothafucka steady mobbin' G
Kickin' the gangsta
Rollin' down the block smokin' indo
Cluckers owe me money what the fuck should I grin for?
187 proof
187 pure
187 up on that ass if you touch the door
Of my f-fly blue drop 'Stang
Rollin' with the top down chitty-chitty gang bang
Coke slinger, make the gat sing a
Song for the niggas who wanna fuck me in the game up
Who the fuck is on a gaffle?
Leave your body half-full
When the hair-pin trigger pull
5-0 try to creep so I ran a
Check on my motherfuckin 8-channel scanner
Packin' 3 gats nigga with the weed hat
Never gettin feedback slinging yay, speed, crack
And anything on the black market
Jackin' niggas for their d-dana danes so you better park it
The mothafuckin gangsta nigga
Spice is the clip Ray(?) gangsta is the trigger
CHORUS (except slight variation)
So to meet ya Jah steppin' to me posse
The 187 is heartless like the ???
Mini me say now me the gangsta nigga with the AK
Tryin to sell ya Dayton off the GTA
Got to get me hustle get me scratch every day
Mini me say wa the ma jackin mothafucker slingin' yay
Come again now
Me me got to get me hustle every day
Mini me say wa the ma jackin mothafucker slingin' yayo
Ya can't tell me shit about the mothafuckin clip
Ya can't say shit about the mothafuckin trigga
Them niggas can't fuck with me mothafuckin clip
Bluh!
