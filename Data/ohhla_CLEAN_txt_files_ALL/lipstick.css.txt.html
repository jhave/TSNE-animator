[Intro - Jazze Pha]
To my super fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl
Your so beautiful

[Swizz Beatz]
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two
Full Surface, hey, awoo!
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two
Cassidy..
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two
Jazze Phizzy Wezzay
One two, one two, one two, one two, one two
Swizz - The Monster

[Chorus - Jazze Pha] + {Swizz in background}
To my super fly girls, all around the world
Shake ya ass in the club, make it twist and twirl
Your so beautiful, girl ya so beautiful
And ya shinin, shinin like lipstick
To them thugs in the club, if ya know ya fly
Some cash in the air, wave 'em side to side
Your so beautiful, (Woman: Boy you know you doin it)
And ya shinin, (Woman: Shining like chrome rims)

[Verse 1 - Cassidy] + {Swizz in background}
I'm shinin, doin it big
I spend more time in the club, then I do in my crib
The kid is a ladies man
But I get called "Shady", cause I'ma lot of ladies man
And I can't be commited to none, I hit it and run
But my hand glittered, and I get her to cum
I floss on a chick, with the frost on the wrist
And my diamonds shinin, like the gloss on her lips
Ms. Frankie B., thanks to me
When we get to the bar, all drinks is free
I own the party, cause I chrome the Ferrari
Maranello, and this Canary yellow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Cassidy] + {Swizz in background}
To all my chicks that's strippin, makin the cash
That's beautiful, keep on shakin ya ass
Even though you gettin naked, and you takin it off
You be rakin in the cake, when they be breakin you off
Now where all my girls in school
You will lose in the world, if ya girl a fool
You need brain in ya life, some change in ya life
Some Cognac, and some Champagne in ya life
Or you might need a workin label
You go girl, twist and twirl, twerk it baby
Ladies! we all gon' shine tonight
Get blind, and have a good time tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Cassidy]
It's Full Surface, better notice the name
You can't help, but to notice the chain (ching-ching)
And my fist it bling
I just gave a chick a cold sore, when she kissed the ring
Sing - "I got girls all around the world
And thought I got a hit, I get around ya girl"
Don't take it personal though
Cause I look good, and I'ma good person to know
So, pop ya bottles, pop ya E's
And I got the dutches, got the trees
The kid, get his gig on, bumpin and grindin
Then I hit the hotel, wit a slut and a condom

[Chorus]
