Song:   Betrayed
Typed by: Sef

[Chorus - Skeematics]
Feeling betrayed by the things you do
I don't give a fuck who you are, I'm superstar
Flying through the airways high
Don't give a damn I'll live it or die

Feeling betrayed by the things you do
I don't give a fuck who you are, I'm superstar
Flying through the airways high
Don't give a damn I'll live it or die

[Verse One - Wordsworth]
Being successful is course and a gift
People swear that they know me on a personal tip
My close friends are amongst the first persons to flip
Want my life
Probably wishing at birth we were switched
That person was Nick
And find my parents, said not to talk to strangers
Keep out of danger in the X-Man and Power Rangers
Transformers at nine
Was at obvious at that time
Daddy stole my Optimus Prime 
Subtle signs that I notice as grown man
I'm zoning and honing on moments should know was omens
Could have known when I'm alone and doing radio he's not
There that's when all the haters would phone in
Stardom will always stark them
Until you start to starve them 
A hooker with some groupies, of movies you got to star in
That's when they wanna be best friends
Fake friends at the wedding wonna be best men, pretend

[Chorus]

[Verse Two - Wordsworth]
Yesterday I court my lady in lies 
My lady denies
The question if the baby is mine
I swore, that I'd stick around till the baby arrives
Snooping around like a ninja in some crazy disguise
But these Nike's ain't my shoe size 
In the mirror saying that she want's a bigger boob size
Contacts and a new ride 
Disagreeing got me being two timed
Found condoms
We ain't used them ever since she got her tube sided
See us park a lot
Fretting like she park to shop
A green Jeep pulled up next to her
In the parking spot
My heart had dropped
Once I saw the doors, on the car was locked
Saw the car start to rock, of course it was hard to watch
She had other lovers before
Don't my son to discover his mother
Is undercover a whore
She's sleeping with the brother in law
I'm creeping with the sister to settle the score
It's just the luck of the draw, betrayed   

[Chorus]

[Verse Three - Wordsworth]
Deception can be fatal 
Your buys waving weapons to persuasive you 
for the safe combination or the spray you
In E.R. naked on the table with some seconds
Just to save you a reflection 
In portrayel of betrayel
When your recording the jam you call me
But the court you on cam
Taking out of hand damn you was fam
So who your calling your man 
I ask those once you pass
Don't put gas in your coroners van, betrayed

[Chorus]</pre>
