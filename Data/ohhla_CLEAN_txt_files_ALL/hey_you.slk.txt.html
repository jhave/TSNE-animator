(Silkk Talking)
Yeah yeah hold up, hold up, hold up
I don't think this nigga understand
I'ma take this back to the old silkk, nigga
Yeah, yeah, dirty nigga, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey you, Yeah You
Nigga, Whatchu looking at?
Hey you, Yeah You
Nigga, Whatchu looking at?
Hey you, Yeah You
Nigga, Whatchu looking at?
Keep muggin and frontin
Gonna get your face pushed back
You don't want me looking
You shouldn't bring her up in here
You don't want no problem
You shouldn't be looking over here
You don't want me looking
You shouldn't bring her up in here
You don't want no problem
You shouldn't be looking over here

[Verse 1]
Even his own boy is like, "Nah, don't fuck with Slim"
Anybody else could spit, "Please, don't fuck with him"
They know once I go there, it be hard for me to come back
Put you in a place where it be hard for you to come back
I keep it straight gangsta look, I ain't talk money
If I bust nigga, he don't die, he survive, he gonna walk funny
Look, let's box, let's talk about that
You don't wanna be gangsta, You don't talk about gats
But if you got gangsta, and I ain't talking bout a rat
So when I put something on your mind, I ain't talking bout a hat
These jealous niggaz can't stand me, they hate me
If I ever clap a nigga, It wouldnt't be to give 'em a standing ovation
Niggaz mad cause my wrist stay frozen
I'm straight cause I done seen more weight than Gold Gym
Everybody is strict, respecting no slim
But he must not so somebody in this bitch should've told him

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Like one nigga, two nigga, three nigga, four
When I pull this thang out, everybody better get low
Or if not, then their clothes shake like a barber
Whoever who still standing, lay 'em down like carpet
These fake dudes, always wanna talk hood
He ain't real, He ain't gangsta, He just really talk good
And that get chu put up on a stretcher
For pullin it out, trying to mob like you was Claudia Shepard
See my motto is "I won't pull it out unless I use it"
So if you heard I pulled it out, no doubt you heard I used it
Niggaz step to me, then you know that he stupid
Cause a real nigga live this whodi, this just not music

[Chorus]

I know this bitch ain't looking at me

Hey you, Yeah You
Bitch, Whatchu looking at?
Hey you, Yeah You
Bitch, Whatchu looking at?
YEAH YOU</pre>
