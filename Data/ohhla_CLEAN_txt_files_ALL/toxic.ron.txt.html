[Tiggers]
Baby, can't you see, I'm calling
A girl like you, should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Oooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up

[Tiggers]
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Enough to make a nigga, go crazy
Shut down the Grammy's, ask my grammy
Wu-Tang for the kids, but your host can't stand me
Wu-Tang for the kids, bust them off for family
Catch me on Disney (ma, who is he?)
Down Dirty, stinky, grime and grizzly
Old man McGirt, lookin' under your skirt
Fucked the pussy til' it's orange, like Ernie and Bert
Like, ooh

[Tiggers]
Too high, can't come down
It's in my head, spinning round and round
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus: Tiggers]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic
Yeah, I'm burnin' up from what you do, you know that you toxic

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Like, ooh, igga, I'm burnin' up
She said, ooh, nigga, I'm burnin' up
Meth got the weed, we can burn it up
I told the D.J., nigga, turn it up
I want a girl that help me take my medication
So I don't end up at the police station
I don't wanna go back to the police station
They tried to send Dirt on a long vacation

[Tiggers]
It's getting late, to give you up
I took a sip, from my devil cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air, and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
