[Dr. TC]
So, what's going on Wolf? Talk to me man...
People worry, we hear stories about you getting into fights
and all this unnecessary bullshit
What's on your mind? Talk to me I'm here

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
Domo roll another one, I'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun
Merch booth made niggaz extensive funds
Momma got the Rover with the Range
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again
And I put that on my dead grandmother's name... too soon

[Tyler, the Creator]
My nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is reppin' like I been fuckin' with Kony
Nigga Phillip and Kobe, to my niggaz that know me
Ya boy seem happy as fuck but truthfully ya boy lonely
Niggaz a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target without bothering customers bothering
Asking me for a picture, then I talk to their sister
Naw nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God I wanna quit, but I can't, cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
4 stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And tourings' paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Lifes' a bitch bruh but from the third floor which is gorgeous
A year ago I was broke, now how can I afford this
I started off with disposables now I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now the frame is a pain in the ass to get it in
Without a scratch or stain on the glass
But that's not important, just as long as it's printed
And I hinted it is, and when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy bitch
Shit I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-ature
I'll even tell you the film I used in the aperture

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Grandmother died, didn't cry not a tear
I got a lot of fuckin wind no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck
Cause when my mom dipped out she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom callin' and callin', I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she cryin' sayin' Sadie is dyin'
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck, nah this is really awkward for me bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Gettin' there, family sittin' center chair
Awkard in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello
Our conversations brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin days bruh, I'm talkin 'bout her strife
I sat there 20 minutes tops
hopin it was just a fuckin' plea that she could cop
She died that night

[Dr. TC] Oh that's heavy man, I'm sorry for your loss
 [Tyler] Yeah whatever, don't worry about it..
[Dr. TC] Last time I seen Sammy he was lookin' for you
 [Tyler] Fuck that nigga Sammy
[Dr. TC] Uhh... Have you seen him?
 [Tyler] Nah but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed 'em</pre>
