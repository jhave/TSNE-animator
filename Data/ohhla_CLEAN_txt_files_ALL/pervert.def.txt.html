[Chorus]
Better check up on your girl 'cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Down to do some dirt
Better button up your shirts, 'cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Biggest freak on earth
Better cross your fucking legs, 'cause I'm a pervert!
I'm pervert! Eyeing up your skirt!
I said my mind is in the gutter, I'm a pervert!
I can't help it! That's just how I work

[Tonedeff]
Oh yes, I'm that cat that your mama warned you about
See I don't care if you're a ditz of if you're clever (No)
I've got a penchant for mentally undressing
Sexy specimens of the feminine gender (yeah)
Since that's the case, I'm dickin down entire cities of chicks
In broad daylight and in the middle of the street
But see, it's all in my head, and though we'll probably never meet
I've seen you nude and on your knees
I'm walking 'round with mirrors on the tops of my shoes
So, don't get lazy, ma - I can tell if it's bushy
Now, Peeping Tom's a pussy, no need to hide or be pushy
It's way more fun when I know that you see me looking
I've got a confession to make, and the truth is
If I'm spending the night over yours to sleep (You better lock your door)
Cause in the morning, the minute that I'm alone
I'll be sniffing your girl's panties when you leave

[Chorus]
Better check up on your girl cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Down to do some dirt
Better button up your shirts, cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Biggest freak on earth
Better cross your fucking legs, cause I'm a pervert!
I'm pervert! Eyeing up your skirt!
I said my mind is in the gutter, I'm a pervert!
I can't help it! That's just how I work

[Bridge]
Don't gimme that look, like you don't want it as much as I do
You prolly feeling my desire times two
make a move, girl, you know it's time to
Don't be timid, girl, shy's for high school
I wanna get you from behind and grind you
Really, if you're girlfriend is bi, cool
We can all intertwine, true

[Tonedeff]
Let's cut to the chase, ma - There's a reason that rubbers exist
And I'm another son of a bitch that's hunting for kicks
The fun of it is, wouldn't you rather have somebody sucking your clit
Then to be stuck in this shit-hole of a disco?
Let's go bake a naked pretzel, Pet Tone's snake and make it spit all over your lips
The width of my dick is so thick, it won't fit in the midst of a ship's haul
Did you call me chauvinist? All because I just wanna be blown and kissed
Lick your slit and just make you moan in bliss, Stick my dick in your kizzle-hole and jizz
You know what your motive is, otherwise, you would've stayed home and shit
Roll with it, my hope is this, we fuck and your homegirl's next
Only smoking chicks apply to ride T
And no little bitches get by me, cause I check ID
Kindly, step away from the cock if you ain't got the jist to freak
Gimme your heiney - it'll fit - you'll see!
I'm a pervert and your Ms. Discrete
Leaving a bitch with more glistening shit on her neck than Mr. T
Skillfully spread the legs she's wet between, I'm thrilled to eat! Pussy's a delicacy
I'm getting obscene, but I can't think of another way to be letting off steam
Unless you let me get a pet in your jeans
I'm stretching the seams with my hands in abandon feeling titties in tandom
But I can't stand to take it anymore
I got plans to act, a true pervert will fuck you till you're handicapped
And so, gimme your number, nah, fuck it, gimme a hummer
Shimmy your bum around her mug and then cum to gimme the thunder
Stick it up under your G-Spot, and rock on
Then watch the replay at 'Shhhhh! Iwonttellnobody dot com

[Chorus]
Better check up on your girl cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Down to do some dirt
Better button up your shirts, cause I'm a pervert!
I'm a pervert! Biggest freak on earth
Better cross your fucking legs, cause I'm a pervert!
I'm pervert! Eyeing up your skirt!
I said my mind is in the gutter, I'm a pervert!
I can't help it! That's just how I work</pre>
