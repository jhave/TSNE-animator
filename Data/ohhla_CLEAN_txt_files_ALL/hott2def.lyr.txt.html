[Joyo Velarde - Intro]
Get up, get down, get on the floor
C'mon, ain't that what y'all came here for?
Get off the wall, on the count of four
C'mon un, deux, trois...
 
[Lyrics Born]
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
 
Who's really wit me? Goin city to city 
Doin it real big, it ain't a thang if any 
Baby, y'all ain't ready; I'm so exquisite 
So clean, so sharp, chopped like a machete 
Wanna taste of Remy - gimme Amaretti 
and some 5150, y'all know already 
Get crunk, go dumb, go stupid, go silly 
'Cause life's too short, baby, I ain't trippin 
All my fellas wit' me, need to get on your grizzy 
Too many winners in the building no to put your bid in 
All the women in the vicinity lookin so pretty 
Make it really difficult for me to stay committed (HEY!) 
 
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
I'm hot to death, I'm hot to death
 
[Chali 2na]
Who the syllable killa, slash verbal guerilla? 
Thinkin ain't nobody illa than the one in the mirror 
2na comin equipped, and I'm runnin my script 
like information from an anonymous tip 
Marijuana we twist, and if I don't get lit 
Make a bundle from the words that we mumble and spit 
While the party people move to the sure-shot groove 
Ain't got shit to prove cause we comin legit 
Men, women, and children, Manphib in the building 
More than a civilian, shit, I'm one in a million 
Killin 'em until you notice that I'm not the rest 
Makin heat that'll stop yo' breath, watch yo' step
 
[Chorus 2X]
 
[Joyo Velarde]
Get up, get down, get on the floor
C'mon, ain't that what y'all came here for?
Get off the wall, on the count of four
C'mon un, deux, trois...
One step, two step-out tonight 
Like TNT, we dynamite 
Get off the wall on the count of four 
C'mon, un, deux, trois...
 
[Lyrics Born]
Uh, who's really wit' me? Goin city to city 
By the way that people feel me you would think I was Diddy 
Cause I'm makin a killin, and I'm sittin so pretty 
Ridin high like a hippie in the Coupe DeVilly 
Who wanna get wit' me? Y'all thinkin y'all witty 
Y'all ain't sayin nothin and your sound is tinny 
Really stop bein silly, y'all bein so petty  
Quit cryin like a baby, get up off the titty (HEY!)
Light it up like Teddy, 'cause I'm +Raw+ like Eddie 
Tear it up, tear it down, shred it like confetti 
Then I'm jetty like a Chevy on fresh Pirellis 
I'm talking "Venni Vetti Vicci", baby, the rest is history
 
[Chorus 2X]
 
[Joyo Velarde - Outro]
Get up, get down, get on the floor
C'mon, ain't that what y'all came here for?
Get off the wall, on the count of four
C'mon un, deux, trois...
One step, two step-out tonight 
Like TNT, we dynamite 
Get off the wall on the count of four 
C'mon, un...deux.... 
Un, deux, trois!</pre>
