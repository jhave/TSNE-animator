[Madrox]
If everything is going my way
Then why does it suck so much to be everywhere today
I'm like the captain of the football team
And every girl who's someone in my school they wanna
suck my dick or sleep with me
I get big props and high fives
For them quarterback sneaks from the thirty yard line
I never fucked with drugs,
I only drink for the buzz
I can handle my liquor and my daddy is a judge
And he looks out for me
But what about the prom queen it's been at least two
week since she's been heard from or seen
Susan Quesada, her mama is a lawyer and her daddy is a doctor
Her picture's in my locker
Her body's in the lagoon, underneath the lilly pads
Glow from the moon, dark watery tomb
Consumed her body then pulled her below
I wrapped her in my letterman coat and slit her throat

Then I let go, the loudest splash I ever heard
And from that day forward I haven't spoken a word

[Chorus]
The marsh lagoon (so many wanna dump there dead here)
Only the water (the waters know what stories they bare)

[Monoxide]
My names not important
You never thought you'd see the day when you would see
me again but now I caught you
I've been abused, confused but uplifted
So I choose to keep this inside but that's shifted
To a hate that will keep me alive until your heart stops
Padlock your pine box and drop it in a black marsh
To hell and back is where my mind has been
And once upon a time I had a friend I thought I really could confide in
Bad scratches and I touch it, uncomfortable feelin
Can't sleep much at night, I'm crawlin the ceilin
Got me feelin like I'm sick and depressed
Cause everybody that I've told, well they just laid it to rest
But now I'm twenty five, and I'm sick of all the talk
And now I'm stalkin you
Waiting by the door that you'll be walkin through
No disguise so you can recognize my face, and all the shame and disgrace
Will be the reason I dismantle you
I handle you like a candle, break you in half and then I laugh at you
Soak you in gas and make you flammable
I burn the body and I gather the ash
And then I sprinkle the lagoon every time I get the chance

[Chorus]

[Violent J]
I got dark secrets, initially I told everybody
One day I'ma snap and leave a crime scene bloody
But they only think I'm playin I'm just Dave from Donut Hut
They always like "What up Dave Nut" when I show up, but
That doesn't really bother me I suppose
Yet there's a darkness inside of me which eagerly grows
When I was younger I murdered off some neighborhood squirrels
And this abandoned garage was like my own private world
Now its honey, I had a bad dream again, I'm trippin
Demons eatin me alive and burnin within, I gotta feed it
I roll down another dark street
I'm tryin to find somethin alive so I can smother out its heartbeat
I'm thinkin a hooker, you think I'm bullshittin
I reached for my leathers but I only found my wife's mittens
In the glove box, circled some blocks, I picked the chick up
I let her suck the dick up, before I cut her neck up
She kicked for em and I'm not puttin much in it
Never thought I'd get this bad, I'm glad I did it, I admit it
Feels so much better, a neck wetter, a throat shredder
I got blood on my sweater and I better not get ahead of myself
The first matter is disposable of the body
I found the perfect spot out past my uncle Marty's
A some hidden lagoon where it'll be dark all the time
I dumped her there and got on with mine

[Chorus]

[Violent J]
Only the trees
Only the fish
Only the bugs
And only the water
Truly really know what happened that night
What went wrong, and how they got there (x2)

[Chorus]
