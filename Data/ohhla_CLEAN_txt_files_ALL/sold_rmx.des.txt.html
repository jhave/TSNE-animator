(Verse 1)
[Kelly Rowland]   We like them boys that be in them 'Llacs leanin' (Leanin')

[Destiny's Child] They always be talkin' that country slang, we like

                  A rude boy that's good to me, with street credibility

Chorus: Destiny's Child
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street, if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things, if you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Better be street, if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough, and he better be street

(Verse 2)
[Beyonce]         We like them boys up top from the BK (BK)
                  Know how to flip that money three ways (Three ways)
                  Always ridin' big on the freeway (Freeway)
[Destiny's Child] With that east coast slang, that us country girls, we like
[Beyonce]         Low cut caesars with the deep waves (Deep waves)
                  So quick to snatch up your Beyonce (Beyonce)
                  Always comin' down, poppin' our way (Our way)
[Destiny's Child] Tellin' us that country girls the kind of girls they like

[Rap Verse: Bizarre]
You lookin' for a soldier, Bizarre's just that
Matter of fact
I just came back from Iraq
Wow
Crazy
Somethin' the girls like
And for a beat got, I got a whole lot of pipe (Yeah)
And I don't want your number
Cause all that's fake
I'm a harass you, call you, til I get a date (Hello? Hello?)
And feed you cake
Walks on the lake
I told you I was your fatso-mate/phat soulmate (Ha ha ha)
I can't buy you a car
Or diamond rings
But I can give you a Pepsi
Out a soda machine (Yeah)
So you lookin' for a soldier
Girl, I'm ready
Beyonce, Michelle and
Kelly

I like them boys over there, they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homey in the Dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight
Oh, he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Everytime he look at me, my girls be like (My girls be like)
That one may be the one tonight
