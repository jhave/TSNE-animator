Chorus: 
I'll always come back to you 
I'll always come back to you 
I'll always come back to you 
I'll always come back to you 

Lil whodi lost his life this ghetto shit got em 
Some friends knocked on his door but we don't really know who shot em 
I lost a homie and a brother in the same week 
And momma got bags under her eyes she gets no sleep 
And these chickens love to flip flop 
I seen a hardest thug lose his life in the hood behind some zip locks 
I wrote Kevin on the wall but never moved on 
Girls screamin at the funeral cuz you was smooth homes 
Me and you and jimmy we used to ride together 
We all family lil one we supposed to die together 
But you had to go first (first) 
I mean the first to make it out the ghetto but you left in a hearse 
Now the preacher sayin life goes on after the rain 
After the pain but it aint the same 
I remember we used to ball together 
Me and you homie hustlin project halls together 
Whodi we all stood tall together 
Silkk C and me got you on our arms forever 
 
Chorus: 

We popped dollars together 
Counted dollars together 
We was on a roll doin shows nigga 
We was always together 
I lost so many peers 
Shared so many tears 
It's a trip to see so many rappers get killed 
And uh its' a mystery on Tupac 
Biggie Smalls changed his life and the next day he got shot 
Easy E died of aids 
And its so many unknown rappers lyin in graves 
To the media you aint shit till you die 
You make the cover of every magazine when you take that final ride 
Big Pun went triple platinum when his heart stopped 
On the radio and video stations nonstop 
Who wanna be next 
While you a dead superstar the record company still cashin checks 
Pour some liquor for the homies that done moved on 
And light your lighters for the soldiers cuz they never gone
