Typed by: kirenamloh@msn.com {with help from liner notes}

Oh...wait a minute now..
Ha ha ha....Come on..
Wait a minute now..
Check..

[Zack de la Rocha]
To the Young R to the E, the B to the E, the L
Never give up, just live up
Fed upon America, we be spittin' it up
Rippin' it up for an even amount in each cup
To my brothers burning bare feet on black top
Whose curled 'neath the shadows from the gaze of the cops
Whose huntin' for 9 to 5's through factory locks
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

[Hook]
Mic Check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker!
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?!
Mic Check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker!
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?!

Check-check-check-check-the check..
oh....packin'..

Flexin' and mashin' with complex text
Fast and in a fashion that snap back necks
Quicker than a fed cash the company checks
Come with the "Fire" only +Marley+ could +Catch+
This be the flame in the cellar beware
Nameless cold millions gaspin' for air
Those naked and wageless, now scream within cages
What, they make you pull your shit
Just to get your share, what?!

[Hook]
Mic Check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker!
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?!
Mic Check, ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker!
Mic Check, ha ha ha ha
I be the anti-myth rhythm rock shocker, what?!

[Tom Morello does guitar riff while Zack yells something]
(Welcome down with the warrior sound, UGH!)
[Tom Morello make guitar sound similarly as a turntable]

With this mic device, I spit nonfiction
"Who got the power?" this be my question
The mass of the few in this torn nation?
The priest, the book, or the congregation?
The politricks who rob and hold down your zone?
Or those who give the thieves the key to their homes?
The pig who's free to murder one Shucklak
Or survivors who make a move and murder one BACK!?
