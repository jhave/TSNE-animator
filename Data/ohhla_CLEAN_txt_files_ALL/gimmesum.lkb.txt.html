[Tame One]
My medulla oblongata's too proper for rhyming stupid
But embalment fluid life got drama to it
Unusual pharmaceutical dip is a trip if you have the patience
If you go nuts dust is your travel agent
The bom-bom-monster of my genre
Swimming in purple rain Minnetonka
My lungs are rap practically bonkers
Like Yonkers I got locks
All you need is a jay, styles and loops like busdrop for this bad boy to ruff right
Deny the novice is obvious recognition
If you can't stand the leak get out the kitchen
Consider me different, usual suspect for missing equipment
Look forward to what I record for your shipments
I black out in an instance, off two point three seconds
Confessing that the nine at my waste ain't no measurement
Approach with caution, the leak brother addict with habits forming
So cheer to star at the end of the bar like my name was Norman

[Chorus]
Old man on the floor, robbed and bludgeoned
His breath, running out he's like "Gimmesumdeath"
Showered a gunshot wound to the chest
Laying on a operating table like "Gimmesumdeath"
And a whole club of people drinking, scheming on flesh
Get blown out of the building thinking "Gimmesumdeath"
In my own endevours I'm not right I'm what's left
And if that passion burns out then "Gimmesumdeath"

[Cage]
Churchbells ringing, I'm only six
My foot up my dads chest, I'm pulling his turnicet back to fix this
My skull pops out of its shell, I'm stable
Circulation cut off from the jumprope tied to the coffee-table
Something's pulling me, nylon cuts through my baby ankle
And it pops off, I'm sucked to the wall at lightspeed being strangled
With angel hair I'm dangled over
The edge of the universe is a razor blade I'm longing for closure
Decode and implode her with her own psychosis
And embrace her odor, I fold her over and over
Till she fits in the slits in my shoulder
Then pull her out and hold her a bloody baby in my palm growing colder
I'm out of my head, I'd rather be dead, just splatter me red
All over the wall then gather my friends
Throw a stone in my face and leave some flowers
Follow me, walk away or laugh for hours and hours

[Chorus]

[Tame One]
Alter reality practically form brainstorms on songs
Bubble like my wet chunked on
Upon lift off, the fumes I'm giving off choke throats on both coast
Until all of the bom-bom gone
When something go wrong
With whole songs dedicated to medicated faded intoxicated sedated goings on
Head strong, dead wrong
Experimental generals out of the boomsquad, retarded after the jargon

[Cage]
Welcome to Waterworld, pull the covergirl over my face
Chuck on draw then walk away from this place
It's cinematic irrational, tragic magic
You can smell a fresh bag of wet pulling the cd out the package
This whole planet of shit, I love this hobo nation
Escape another nine to five with leaky glorification
Ex-patient, rather puff purple stuff and stay mental
To the next deep sea, all of hell love Cage Kennylz

[Chorus]
