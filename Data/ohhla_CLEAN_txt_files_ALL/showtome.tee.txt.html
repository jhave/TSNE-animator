Aye bend that ass over, and let it move back
Come kick it wit me, I'll get your groove back
And give it to me
Show it to me
Give it to me
Show it to me
Give it to me
Show it to me

[Hook]
Aye bend that ass over, and let it move back
Come kick it wit me, I can help you get your groove back
Aye give it to me
Show it to me
Now give it to me
Show it to me
Now give it to me
Hey whatcha doin'?

Give it to me
Show it to me
And let it wiggle 'cause I like it when you do that
Come kick it wit me, I can help you get your groove back
Now give it to me
Show it to me
Now give it to me
Show it to me
Just give it to me
Hey whatcha doin'?

Just give it to me
Show it to me

[T.I.]
I got a whack dough flow
Stacks on swole
Five different hoes in Cadillac four door
Niggas think they gonna attack, I got a mac on hold
I'll bust ya in your stomach leave you back on the floor
You see T.I. and Nelly on it, know the track gone blow
Man you niggas barely pro, I don't even practice no more
Aye shawty I was gettin' dough when you was rappin so-so
When you barely had flow I had crack for the low
You can stunt for the audience and act for the hoes
Let me ask you what you gon' do when we ain't actin' no more
Aye when I finish wit you you ain't even gon' be rappin' no more
Aye "How he doin'?, Where he at?" somethin' they ain't askin' no more
Aye picture me not bein' the main attraction no more
That's all the talkin' I care to do to you back to the hoes
Baby drop it back it up til you can't back it no more
You show me you bout that action, I'll throw a stack on the floor

[Hook]

[Nelly]
Aye come on in lil mama sit down pay attention
You don't want to get to school, then take your ass to detention
Stick my key in your ignition, I'm crankin' up your engine
I'm pullin' your extensions Now we switchin' up positions
Got an ill technique, in makin' ya knees weak
A non-stop treat until your g-spot leak
To your G4 seat, we'll be back next week
so tell that lame ass nigga you got places to be
So give me your participation, don't need no hesitation
Don't want to be mistaken, ma I'm plannin' on relations
Yea, you rollin' wit the King and the One
Country niggas in the chevy passin' Grey Poupon
Man, we been gettin' dough since we was way too young
The record sales was the mob that'll make me a Don
You see this is why I'm hot, and this is why he not
so mama climb on top, and show me what you got, aye

[Hook]

[T.I. &amp; Nelly]
The independent ladies that can buy their own Mercedes I say
That's the one, that's the one
Country girls that represent, payin' they own rent holla
That's the one, that's the one
For the women constantly poppin' tags with the newest Louis bags yea
That's the one, that's the one
To all the girls who in shape, slim waist, pretty face hey
That's the one, that's the one
Okay
Now bend that ass over</pre>
