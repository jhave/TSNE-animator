[outro: Half-A_Mill]
Yea, yea, uh huh
uh huh, yea, uh, huh
Dedicated...to all the ladies out there
Half-A-Mill, how can I trust you?
Uh, yea, uh huh

[Verse 1]
When we first started out it was lust
Now you talkin marriage and trust
Carriage for us, baby carriage
Your love nearly made me savage
You like it when I grab it
And twist you backwards and let you have it
Sexual magic, you like it when you get ya ass whipped
You need a man to take over, see you in your Range Rover
Hoped off the 11th hundred, made you pull that thing over
Went from what's your name to Champaign to hangover
Now you want me for yourself so we became closer
Blazin haze on the sofa, no more spendin days watchin Opera
We eatin Lobster at the Copa, monster hat wit the toaster
Poppin Velvet, makin a toaster
A new relationship wit that's Kosher
Plan to make it last forever
But tell me can I trust ya?
How I know you ain't creepin wit another buster
How I know someone else ain't rubbin butter
All over my lover, can I trust you?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
How can I trust you?, how can I trust you?

[Verse 2]
Spinnin the five, call you up spend some time
I'm like Ginuwine I got flowers and the wine
Conversate wit you for hours, stimulatin ya mind
On a rainy day I'll make it shine
Bring ring field wit mines
Enough ice to make you blind
But that's still won't make you mine
You prolly like to play wit my mind
Make me chase you around and you body like di-da-damn
So you know I had to bling you down
Waitress bring around of that drink wit the crown
You prolly tired paintin in town
Ma let me put that mink down
I roll enough to snake now
You poppin drinks that blue berry haze got ya eyes shank now
We at the steak house, came along way from take-outs
Police stake outs, lets take a vacation and break out
Let's go to Africa where the Zebra's and Apes is out
Go under -- a waterfalls so I can blaze you out
But can I trust you?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
James Brown, yea, uh huh
Can I trust you? can I trust you?

[Verse 3]
Sippin a glass of Reds, you tellin other cats is dead
Want to get married, every since I hit you wit the Jagged Edge
You can throw that thing away wit the plastic head
Cause I'm packin a lead that got you grabbin the bed
You neva knew that your back spread so much
Is like I got your soul touched
Hardened stiff still won't nut
'Til you errupt like a Volcano, I feel you liver
Feel you mama puttin you through physical drama
Yo the dick tellin your mama
Your friends say I got you whipped
Tellin chicks its natural Phenomena
Is like sumthin magical, how I attracted you
The conversatin captured you
Have you sippin Carot-chews
Blazin hazin black roots mixed wit absolute
Tree or life, come here ma let me grab ya fruit
Unites are ripe, heres a lil ice for ya life
Imagine if you was my wife
But can I trust you for life?

**How could I trust you -- anythin you eva need it**

[Chorus: Half-A-Mill]
uh, uh huh, uh huh, yea, uh
Can I trust you?, can I trust you?
uh, uh huh, yea, uh, uh huh
James Brown, yea, uh huh
Can I trust you?

[Outro]

Word, you talkin 'bout relationship

Word, I can like you, I can love you
But can I trust you?</pre>
