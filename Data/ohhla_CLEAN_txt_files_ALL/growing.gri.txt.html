Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I take a breath and breathe it out
Life has been a bitch holding onto me, I'm always freaking out
I don't play well with others, I panic in a crowd
And I'm quick to fall in love, that's why I'm always on the ground
So pick it up
Pop the umbrella over my problems
And understand I'll never be a man until I solve 'em
And sometimes I wish that I could go back home
Yeah, crawl into my childhood dreams and be alone
And that be everything, just another boy left with nothing
An object of security slowly losing its stuffin'
The Sumter Square slum king
Looking for another motherfucking chance to re-break the broken in is something
And that's the part I'm never going to get
Growing up is more than just a mind state and owning all your debts
Blowing out the breath I don't feel so tall
So tell me how am I supposed to reach anything, anything at all
Anything at all

[Chorus]
Tell me how, can I, grow to see the change in my life
I wanted, to overcome the battle inside what is owed to anxiety's hold
Is there a better way to figure it out?

[Verse 2]
I sweep it all under the rug
Cover up the loss found inside of me and wash it down with blood
I was born with an option and taught to swim a flood
But the older I become I start to humor giving up
So pick it up
Listen to all of the words in my head
And understand I'll have a shaky hand until they're said
And I don't know if I can get my mind state back
But I would travel to the end just to feel that grasp
And that be everything, speak it through the can on the line
And prophesize the future from the twinkle in my eye
I could wrinkle up and die
In that room where the dreams started talking to me constantly
And dancing through the sky
I'm alive, but growing up has proved to be a task
And left a couple daydreams broken down and smashed
Looking through the glass I don't feel so tall
So tell me how am I supposed to reach anything, anything at all
Anything at all

[Chorus]
Tell me how, can I, grow to see the change in my life
I wanted, to overcome the battle inside what is owed to anxiety's hold
Is there a better way to figure it out?
