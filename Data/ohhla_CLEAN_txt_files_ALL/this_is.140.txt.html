[Hook: King Just singing]
Hey yo, you got mad flow, you gon' get dough
Light that endo (Come on say it again!)
Hey yo, you got mad flow (You know you got it!)
You gon' get dough, light that endo (Come on say it again!)

[King Just]
You done lit dynamite on Mr. Excite
You been rappin' for a long time and don't sound right
Not quite as the hype that you recite
Mr. All Day, I do it to ya ass all night
On sight, I smash anything you write
With canine teeth for niggas who back-bite
Walk to the light and bring ya mic
You won't last one minute in a ten round fight
The Al Qaeda type that'll snipe ya windpipe
And seize ya General and strip him of his stripes
Either you men or mice you gon' still pay the price
So take my advice and roll the dice
Real life, still trife
Walk with a gun, talk with a knife
Double CD so you could buy me twice, hold tight!
And you just might take flight
MC's got left while you think they not right
Hang-glide like a kite on the turnpike
with two bad bitches that suck Dick Van Dyke
Pay per view satellite is a need to feed my appetite
Pick up ya weight cuz you ain't got the hype
Battle me? You need an invite, black or white
And I still drink a 40 with Ike
I still smoke a Lee joint from Spike, aight?
I'm the reason why Coca Cola gonna have to fuckin' remix the Sprite
He's nice! And safe like Chinese rice
If I'm the shit on the stick, you the baby wipes
You the Latter Day Saints, I'm the Poltergeists
I'm the whole damn pie, nigga, you just a slice
This is a heist, I suggest you remove ya ice
before you be Up Close and Personal with Christ
Get on ya Big Wheel bike and take a hike
cuz around these parts, you not liked
Parasite, don't have me flex my mic
I don't rock Air Force 1's, I call air strikes

[Chorus: King Just]
This is Hip-Hop, this is who I am
You think I really give a damn? (Get 'em!)
Cuz we here to stay, KJ, man, I'm on my way
(Now everybody say..) This is Hip-Hop, this is who I am
Do you think I really give a damn?

[King Just]
Listen here, pioneer, lemme make things clear
Any cosmic rappers I'll blow out the atmosphere
We are Borg and we came to assimilate
Violate, annihilate, vindicate and get it straight
And once and for all, I'll give it to y'all
And shit on ya name like a bathroom stall
Number 1 draft pick without the b-ball
And the bigger they come, the harder they fall
If I was in ya era I'd still be a terror
The only nigga that could beat me is standin' in the mirror
You'd hear me clearer without the interferer
If I was in the woods fightin' a bear, help the bear
He's what's up! And you? You not
Ya old school like Rocky Johnson, I'm more like The Rock
The people's eyebrow, the people's elbow
If anyone fuck with the Just, hell no!

[Hook x2 w/ ad-libs]

[Outro: King Just]
Told y'all, KJ, everyday, all day
Around ya way, in ya hallway, puffin' John Jay
You see me say?</pre>
