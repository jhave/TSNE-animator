[Megan Rochell]
I can't handle this
I'm tired hearing you talking about this chick
How can she acting so hot to diddy
Tell her to check herself 'cause I'm hotter than she
Ever be a thing she can be
And I knew you before she came through
And I'm still cool you know how I do
So tell the truth you know how I do
You know that I ride with you

[Hook]
No she can't do half the thing that I do
She can't do what I would do for you
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I CAN BE THE ONE YOU NEED

[Megan Rochell]
See the time is now
For you to realize it's going down
Why put up with this when you know I would be
More than happy to be what you want me to be
Whatever it is I promise I'll be
Whatever pleases you I'll do it times 2
Taking her spot 'cause she has no clue
Calming her 'cause she has no clue
You got to know that I'm the truth
Tell me why settle for good when you could have live lavish
She's fooling you stressing you out what's next
Skip all the dramatics no ghetto fab jus break it down easy simple as this
I'm the one you know you need to be with
I see it in you eyes and looking foolish
No one can love you with all of this and I'll prove it

[Hook]
No she can't do half the thing that I do
She can't do what I would do for you
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I CAN BE THE ONE YOU NEED

[Megan Rochell]
And no, no more holding on
I gotta have all or nothin'
Tell her shop it's cold so pack up and hit the door
I don't care and I know it don't seem fair
Sooner or later she'll find out you have always been my man and oh she could never

[Fabolous]
Girl keep playing come on and climb in
Whatever he do I do it times ten
Whatevers on me I flur with diamond
Whatever I say it do like simon
That 151 bacardi lime in
Imma start kickin' in with perfect timin'
You see what I'm in
You hear the rhyme and
But guess who it is though
L to the izzo
S to the izzo
You put his flow
With them rizzo
Sounds like a gizzo
That's what it should be
I'm what they would be
Only if they could be
I'm in the good b's
Sittin' on black boys
With the click clack toys
Just for the jack boys
Shorty got some odasity
I'm in her legs more then a thight master would be...shyea

[Hook]
No she can't do half the thing that I do
She can't do what I would do for you
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I can be the one you need
I CAN BE THE ONE YOU NEED</pre>
