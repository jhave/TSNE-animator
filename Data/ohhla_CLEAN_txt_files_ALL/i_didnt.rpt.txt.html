[Intro: Kurupt]
Black flood, feel me
Yeah, slice (slice)
Bonzi J. Wells, Kurupt Young Gotti, nigga
Feel me, real talk, gangsta
 
[Kurupt]
My life, my family - they hate me
They wanna execute me, fuck around and shoot me
Damn, do I gotta change my whole mind state?
Throw a brick up, new nickel to eighth
I gotta go to a different world
Cuz right here is a motherfuckin nightmare
It's Young Gotti, I'm always the motherfucking underdog, dawg
Wait a minute, I got a question for y'all..
Do families turn there backs over emotions or acts?
Turn their back over emotional acts?
Do they fall in emotional traps?
Do it transpire into emotional collapse?
From nickel's and mac's, over bread and bitches, poetics and rap's
Or who they choose to do business with or perhaps, we talkin bout family
I can't believe my eyes, it's the stand up, fall and rise
All cuz how cuz I'm fuckin with Blood
Oh this niggas hot cuz I'm fuckin with cuz
Oh this nigga got problems because of this
He read an article and thought a nigga tried to dis
When we was young we use to roll like a all nighter 
Then roll a pimp game kicked in and popped collars
Me and one of my brothers use to be the tightest group
Until this motherfuckin day, we the tighest group
I can't help it if a nigga make a sudden change
Would it be a different game if it wasn't change?
Would we be as close as we was in '93?
I can't help but think a little bit differently
I can't help but think we might even be closer
We use to be back to back holdin toasters
 
[Chorus: Kurupt]
I didn't change..
When y'all niggas wanted to stay - I didn't change
When things wasn't going our way - I didn't change
When y'all niggas wanted the verse
The shoe was on a different foot and the roles reversed - I didn't change
When niggas use to call us wack
Like "Fuck the Westcoast" and never call us back - I didn't change 
When niggas was talkin shit
Talkin bout they ain't fuckin with us - I never changed, nigga
 
[Interlude: Kurupt] *scratched*
Give me mines, give me mines nigga
This is for the homies
"It was ninteen nintey three"
Blaze that shit up
This is for the homies..
 
[Kurupt]
I'm about to change motherfuckin rules
Here first like wild motherfuckin bulls
I'ma make something for niggas to link about
And leave the whole hood with something to think about
I can't help but think a million times a day
A nigga got about a million things he gotta say
I never been the type to beat around the bush
My big homie introduced me to Benz's and cush
God grant me the strength to go the length, the width
With a little bit of that and a bit of this
It's fucked up that a nigga that I barely know
Would give it up to me but my homies won't
My success pattern is in a constant shake
It's like film making without no film to make
It's like hang gliding but I can't hang
And now niggas tryin to kick me out my game
All because of where I choose to lay my hat
All because of where a motherfuckers at
I'm feelin like I'm falling like dead leaves
It like I'm swingin from vines like Tarzan
I'm about to take another trip to Tarzana
Pop something for a motherfucker to go bananas
Rack up the gauge, cuz I can feel it coming
It's the heater home in the summer, I feel it coming
My kids my main priority, you thority, agility, ability
My tranquility to toss a typhoon at the moon
Hurricane spread through the saloon like alien goons and harpoons
I could do this shit by myself
I'd rather be read then be placed back on the shelf
I'ma motherfuckin G, nigga, forever til I die DP, nigga
I love y'all cuz..</pre>
