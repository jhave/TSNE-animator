[Verse One - Pressure]
I got committed to the pen now my shit's so locked down
MCs think I'm doing time for this hip-hop sound
Debris the mastermind, Suffa's my partner in crime
I be the microphone felon, tell them your master design
It all started when I was young fiending for mics
Dreaming of heights that I would be reaching despite
No one would put me on, or even play me at that
So earned my dues ganking mics labelled radio shack
At open mic one night far from sober or with it
This guy pulls me off and says 'You're rhyming over the limit
And heading that way you won't last a day or a night
You need to be down for the long haul kid we call 'em lifers
Beside you need to stick with me cos rhyme pays
And I know this heist where we can jack some sine waves
They're mainly small timers, freestylers
Street urchins and beat merchants, none of them real rhymers
They're raping this culture and make me sick to my stomach
These fools need to be arrested for sleeping in public'
I dug it, got serious and mastered my rhyme
The rocked to the spot with my new partner in crime
Trespassed on stage, stole the mic to further insult
Committed arsony, defamation and verbal assault
They tried to blame the engineer oblivious to our ploy
So we crept backstage as they buried the sound boy
I stole the DJs crates and his diamond needles
Now they got me on the run so it's time to leave ya'll
We tried to cross the border, got cause as a noun carrier
Pulled over and evicted for breaking the sound barrier
This cop threw me to the ground, cos hip hop is violent
Said 'You got freedom of speech, just choose to remain silent'
Then he checked in the trunk and he found the hot sound
I got committed to the pen now my shit's locked down

[Chorus]
I'm a rhyme felon peeps do what I tell them
People can't handle the product that I'm selling
I left my dwelling now I'm on the run
Microphone felony number one
I'm a rhyme felon peeps do what I tell them
People can't handle the product that I'm selling
I left my dwelling now I'm on the run
Microphone felony number one
I'm a rhyme felon peeps do what I tell them
People can't handle the product that I'm selling
I left my dwelling now I'm on the run
Microphone felony number one</pre>
