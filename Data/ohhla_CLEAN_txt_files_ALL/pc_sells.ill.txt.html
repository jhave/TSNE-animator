Album:  What's Wrong With Bill?
Song:   Peace Sells
Typed by: seta@streetracing.com

I'm a creator of terror berserk teens no escape from the toxic traits
Pop ya face storm 'em with madness and blind faith
The angel of death read between the lines out the heaven
Expectable youth divine intervention teachin' y'all a lesson of violence
Doctor Death injectin a virus apocalypse
I'm a horseman in the circle of tyrants in debts for era
Posessed like Jeff Parcera
Consuming impulse drown you in the depths of terror forever

[Chorus]
Peace sells but who's buying
Who's tryin who's crying who's lying in a pool of blood dying
Peace sells but who's buying
Who's tryin who's crying who's poppin with a four pound iron
Peace sells but who's buying
Who's tryin who's crying who's lying in a pool of blood dying
Peace sells but who's buying
Who's tryin who's crying who's lying in a pool of blood

Stranger in hell buy America day to betrayal
Brainwashed by a system that's created to fell
Freedomer fire securetron arm in his fate
Fear factory manufacturing hi-tech hate
A slave new world world gone mad a world without heroes
Used to go to show surrounded by weirdos
Lovelomoss masterin the science of war
Read metal forces magazines dying to tour
Power hatchets &amp; carnivals livin their life for agony
Where to go we got to know like Harry Flanagan
I lecture funeral children of a grave behind a wall I sleep
Be afraid kill 'em to be safe
I don't need society down for life foul &amp; trife
Ill Bill dirty rotten imbecil down to fight
Give me my taxes back money god's a liar
Speak truth to deaf americans like Tah Meraya

[Chorus]

Psychic vacuum jab you with a knife &amp; stab you
Rival this medicine try veconvictions as heroin
Experiment macrosolutions to megaproblems
Let the revolvers solve 'em chaos miners a cosmic drama
Peace sells but who's buyin so I stay with the funds
We real so you die find you laced with the slugs
With the quickness you callin me my sacred love
I got bad brains the reason I spray with guns now listen

[Chorus]</pre>
