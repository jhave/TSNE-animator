[Intro: Cappadonna, (Digem Tracks)]
Yo Digem, (Yo, YO) Yo, Thanks for recording this joint man
(No problem my dude) Cause no matter what
We gotta stay shining, Through it all man, My heart is broke
It been broke for years, But I'm gonna keep on pulling through yo

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Without the suffer and the pain and the hurt and the sorrow
How will we appreciate tomorrow
Without the tough times, Heartaches, Bumps and the bruises
How would we still love the music
Without the ups and the downs, And the ins and the out yall
How would we kill all without yall
Follow your dreams keep glowing, Let the love start flowing
Keep shining, It's God's perfect timing
Young ladies in the ghetto keep climbing
Young brothers in the hood stay grinding
Wipe my eyes cause I'm crying, Why these Devils keep lying
Why these Devils keep lying, Why these Devils keep lying
Why these Devils keep lying, Wipe my eyes cause I'm crying
Keep shining

[Cappadonna]
I got a cross on my back, And my hands is pierced
I'm down with a hard team and my mans is fierce
Got a cable with a crown, Lord prepare my table
In the presence of the enemy, I never pretend to be
More then I am, I'm the truth in the way
I keep throwing love at you, Til my hands is grey
Allah holds me, Brought me up out of affliction
Keep me safe from the heartache and crazy addiction
From the streets where the shorties be killing each other
Yo they wild like savages, Don't respect they Mother
They be selling crack for babies and cheating each other
Dumb, Deaf, And blind ass thugs, They still my brother
Wake up little homie get your mind out the gutter
What you know about grinding for that bread and butter
You's a stupid motherfucker, You don't know what it is
Now you think you thugged out cause you shooting at kids
Got them cracks in your ass like your ready to bid
Yo you living in them streets cause you can't get a crib
Let that teach your ass a lesson and shape you up
Before them Po-Po come around here and scrape you up
I think that crack gone kill yall before that dust
I came to shed a little light but your mind is stuck
All you talk about now is your nine and truck
Little homie, Keep shining

[Chorus]

[Outro: Digem Tracks, (Cappadonna)]
Hey little homie, Little momma
No matter what you do,You be yourself
(And keep shining) Digem Track Productions
Cappadonna, Peace to the Middle East
We out yall</pre>
