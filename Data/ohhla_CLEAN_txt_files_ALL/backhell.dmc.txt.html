[D.M.C.]
On the lower level where the devils dwell..
Comin from the one, comin back from hell

{*"Back.." - "from the depths of hell" -&gt; scratched by Jay*}

[Run]
Peepin out the window, checkin on the criminals
Out in the yard, it's hard, but you're in
so you do your time and never let the time do ya
He lost his mind that's what the time'll do to ya
A brother in the box screamin find a ciggarette
Niggaz walkin by ain't tryin to hear that
So off to the Day Room, a fight in progress
A brother got sliced and diced over nonsense
D.O.I., Dead On the Island
The life the knife the price, for wigga-wildin
Never a day, I say I'm not leavin
Long as I live in a crib and I'm breathin
Four years done, another one in a cell
Don't need nobody to come, cause I'll be back from hell

[D.M.C.]
Fire and brimstone, sendin 'em home
to the brownstone, and on the streets that he roamed
Before he got locked up, he sewed the whole block up
People would jock, because he cooked the rock
Caught by the cop, he's knocked, and now he's faceless
The spot was hot, he's Scott, that's what his name is
When he was out with clout, people surround him
Now that he's in the pen, niggaz downed him
Wait upstate, for the day, til they free the man
In '98, be straight, and then you'll see him again
Ready to kill, and steal, ill and build
a flyer empire, higher, still runnin the 'ville

[Run]
Boy goin to hell, another day in the dark
The brother wait in the park, blind faded and stalked
Naked, out to die and not movin
He needs a fix by six that means you've been
strung out, your lung out, foamin with your tongue out
Back to hell and well, that's where you hung out
for the past and last year, your acts for cash here
Crash and smash any ass to get a blast yeah
The brother smother his mother, for another one
Then ill and kill, with the other son
For crack as well, the brother black he yell
You just stop and think, he's comin back from hell
