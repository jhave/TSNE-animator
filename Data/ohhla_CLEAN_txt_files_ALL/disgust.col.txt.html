Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told them recognize , Smith and Wesson
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting

Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

Hey, Oh NO
Not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick
If so I take her on a voyage
I like em long legged, Mega Thick
Work it out Ya know employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit
Cuz I keep clogging up the toilet

Coley Cole, Fresh as a Four week old
Not a scratch on me, Hoes ask for me
Niggaz ask bout me, Silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the realest nigga, give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label gave you the deal
You remind 'em of me, Let's see how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggaz and left you out of my will

Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting

Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

'Nuff of that bullshit cake rap
With your childlike scriptures
I'm busting off nigga take that!
Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood said we fuckin with you cole say
And we gon' ride right wit ya
Yeah we know you got college degrees
But we got prior's like Richard
And here we are
Raps is like CPR
Nigga turn on your tv, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like ET
Completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars as if hes speaking of CB4
Need a barrage
A freaky broads, to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minaj's, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods
And yes her ass clappin so that a round of applause
I guess

Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting

Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?</pre>
