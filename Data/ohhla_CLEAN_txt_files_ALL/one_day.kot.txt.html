Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hi, my name is Sky Blue and one day I wish I lived in Disneyland and everybody would be happy
Bye

One day I'll be floating in the sky flying like a bird looking down at you. Wonder why I'm up
Here
And I am not down there and all the people that I miss and the family the ones who really care
Living through my music; living through my voice being loved every time someone grooves it
One day is going to be the last time I hear my voice on the track
Now one day not a worry in the world no stress no nothing just miss my girl
Now you tell me why we got to die if god creates us then he kills us at the same time
Why do I ask myself why one day I'll be dead and gone and miss all the things that I love and
Adore?
I know I hurt when I see you there

One day, one day, people will be walking on water
One day, one day, the human race will never die
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized
One day:one day:one day:

One day I am going to invent a new drug disconnect from the system just unplug
Buy a pop gun; shoot a peace love drop a love bomb and give the world a hug
One day I won't have to fear a cop, or a security guard what a dope beat drop
One day I want to body surf a rainbow, swim through a room of clouds blow an end-o
I want to elevate and unify mankind. Everybody is just walking in the sunshine
One day there'll be a block party for the world and I'll never have to be away from my girl
One day I plan a cherry orgasm infiltrate the atmosphere so everybody has one
Come together, a global climax, just imagine a universal sun splash

One day, one day, people will be walking on water
One day, one day, the human race will never die
One day, one day, we will fly around in flying saucers
One day, one day, freedom will be legalized
One day:one day:one day:

I hope one day people will say I was a good guy and every time they were around me I made them
Smile
But in the close future I hope to raise my family in a society full of suburban noise families
And So I hope one day soon we will make a change and when I'm dead I hope my life I didn't
Live in vain
I know in my heart that I tried to live right and I will fight to the death until freedom is
Legalized
Then I know one day my kids will have a chance to raise children of their own and own their
Own lands
And when this day comes I hope I am still alive to see the dream we envision finally realized
Yes one day I think we'll all recognize the government's a big pain infiltrated with lies
And on this day we need to make a decision: we going to follow the blind or the people with
Vision?</pre>
