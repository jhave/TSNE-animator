Why dont you go into the next room and start getting undressed?
What's your pleasure?

(1st Verse- Violent J)
Fat Sweaty Betty, the bitch ain't nothing new
Her moms used to babysat me back when we was two
We'd go to the playground and to the skating rink
And we'd go under the bleachers and she'd let me hit the stank, well uh
She moved across town and never came back
Until the other day, I seen her at the Chicken Shack
She said her name was Betty, I can't believe this shit
The sexy little girl is now a fat sweaty beeitch
She said, "Hey, J, tell me how you've been?"
She had a piece of chicken gizzard stuck to her chin
I told her, "Hold still," and flicked it off her face and said,
"Betty, oh, Betty, what you say we leave this place?"
I took her back to the crib and hit it all night
I let my fingers run across the rip of cellulite
EWW! It was nasty, but I don't let it bother me
She rolled over, fucking knocked the wind out of me
I couldn't breathe, she wouldn't stop, I'm almost dead
I took the lamp, and bust it on her fucking head
We got dressed, I gave her a little kiss goodbye
Fat Sweaty Betty, My fat sweaty pumpkin pie

(Chorus)
Fat Sweaty Betty
Tell me when you're ready (x2)


(2nd Verse- Shaggy2Dope)
Big fat slop of shit people call Betty
Flabs of fat on her back, her neck...sweaty
Boogers running down her nose all over her lips
Can't tell the difference from her titties to her hips
But fuck all that, 'cuz I wanna see the neden
I had to see the cat, the cheesey cheena cheden
Rode my bike to her house, "Hey yo, Betty lemme in
I'm packing some snack cakes, bitch lemme in."
I can hear her coming down the stairs
She opened up the door in her motherfucking underwears
UUGGHH!! Shit, fuck that I'm turning back
But no, the door shut, and shes going for the cake snacks
I said, "Relax, hoe, I'm here, I'm bu-si-ness
you can have the candy, first you gotta wait a bit
I need a favor, come on, Betty, drop them drawls."
AHH!! I knew it, Betty had balls
Oh, no, here comes that ass
&gt;From the top of the dresser with the yokazuna splash
I wish I never came, oh boy do I wish
See Fat Sweaty Betty, the sweaty fat bitch

(Chorus)

(Violent J)
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I know you like spaghetti

[Fat Sweaty Betty]
Tell me when you're ready
Tell me when you're ready for a cheeseburger, pizza pie, TV dinner, chicken

[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I gets it all, I gets it all for ya, baby
I work at Farmer Jack on the dinner floor, baby
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I bring it home, I cook it in a microwave
I feeds it to ya, just let me get some stanky skins
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
'Cuz I don't care, I wanna hit the cellulite
I hit the cellulite for a turkey meal delight
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
'Cuz I don't care, you know I'm not afraid to cook
Take off your shoes and let me lick your dirty foot
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I'll rub you down, I'll rub you down the right way
I hear a buzzer, apple pie's in the microwave
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
I work at Farmer Jack, I work at A &amp; P
And yes I do, my heavy baby wanna be with me
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
Ya wanna be with me, ya wanna be with me
Ya want some chilli cheese fries in a ???
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You gotta wait, wait 'till the time is right
Let me count the purple bubbles in your cellulite
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Burger King, you want some Hungry Jack
You want some jelly beans, you want a scooby snack
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Dominoes, you want a Milky Way
You gotta kick it to the sugar daddy Violent J
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
You want some Lucky Charms, you want some mashed potatoes
Let me hit the skins now and I'll feed you later
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
Because I know, I know you want a Lunchable
Something crunchable, something munchable
[Fat Sweaty Betty]
How 'bout some Taco Bell, how 'bout a pizza slice
How bout some chicken fingers and a bowl of Minute Rice
