So many... so many, so many questions
So many... so many, so many questions

[Verse 1: MURS]
One of a kind so there's nobody like me
And I guess thats the reason that nobody likes me
Or is it that I don't like anybody else?
Can't quite figure it out so I keep to myself
Too street for the sheltered, underground fan
Too intelligent for play on your FM band
So I thought to crossover, but I left them plans
My resolve's to do me and do the best I can
And yes I am, aware that most of my fans are white
But I'm love em all, scope em, and open 'em when I write
Some may chastize, from the side, crack jokes
Say I'm not black cus I rep with white folks
MAN PLEASE!
I hear the hate in your voice when you say it
So I'ma keep makin music for whoever wants to play it
If I dont go gold, then my people say I flopped
But if I go triple platnum, I'm not Hip-Hop

[Chorus]
So I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you

I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you

{*vocal sample*}
So many... so many, so many questions
So many... so many, so many questions

[MURS]
Man! Motherfuckers always be comin up to me, you know
Askin me how come I dont kick no rhymes for the struggle
Or no conscience, revolutionary raps man...

[Verse 2: MURS]
Look; I'm not your average rapper talkin shit about the government
Its not that I'm lovin it; it's where I live
They tried to bomb the place where I wanna raise my kids
I dont know what everybody seems to think this is
It ain't a game, ther is no reign, they want America crushed
If you don't like Bush, you still dyin with us
And trust I haven't forgotten bout the schemes they been plottin
On my people for centuries, I know that eventually we'll be on top
So what they fightin overseas? Hell, they fightin on my block!
The black sheep of America's family. We are the flock
Gettin lead to the slaughter
Have to work twice as hard to keep our heads above water
And god forbid we start to rise through positive means
They'll send out a whole black operative team
Everytime a black leader steps up, he gets trampled
Do I start makin speeches or just lead by example?

[Chorus]
I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you

I'm damned if I do, and damned if I don't
But I got it in my heart so I'll be damned if I won't
Make my dreams come true, my team come through
Man take it how you feel it; on the real it's on you

{*vocal sample*}
So many... so many, so many questions
So many... so many, so many questions

[MURS]
So many questions. So what man? You hangin with El? You signed to Def Jux? 
How much you get for your advance man?

[Verse 3: MURS]
Off this album right here I probably won't see royalties for 2 years
But shit I'm a straight up hustler! Aint nothin queer in this
Oops! I shouldnt've said that cause it disses on my publicist
I dont give a fuck! Cuz this is one man's view
And with this mic I'ma show what one man can do
I'ma hustler motherfucker like this world has never seen
Could sell Chloroform to a room of Evergreens
Toured around the globe with my legendary team
So I shouldnt have to beg to get a G a show
500 people pay ten bucks, then where does it go?
In the fucking promoter's pocket?!!?
That aint how its supposed to be
Nobody paid to see him; they paid to see me!
I'm not a full-of-myself, arrogant emcee
I'm only askin for a fifth, a measly 20 percent.
Im not tryin to get over, I'm just tryin to pay rent!
Right now I wanna thank ya'll for lettin me vent
And I'ma catch ya next show at the bar gettin bent
Notice I put my heart in every word I meant
Presentin it to y'all with the sincerest intent...
Thank you</pre>
