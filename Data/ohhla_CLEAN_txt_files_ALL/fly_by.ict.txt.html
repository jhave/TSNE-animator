[Intro: Donald D Talking]
One, two in the place to be, I'm MC Donald D 
And in the house Nat the Cat, the Syndicate Mobb boss 
And standing after me, Ice-T the O.G. Gangster
Syndicate is about to jump off on a buckwild freestyle
Ice, drop some dope shit!!

[Ice-T] 
Everybody step back from the mic cause I set it off
All playing the wall, it's time to sweat it off
Anybody with static, awww, please try
I'll do you like Godfather 3 and do a fly by
Time to rip and hit and strangle
I eat Guardian Angels
And toy emcees with their names on the front page
I bury in shallow graves
I don't rap with girls in my LP
I don't beg for pussy, I love the ladies and they love me right back
Now who's the mack?
Mission accomplished
I came to stomp this microphone and leave suckers unconscious
And if you think you got a 'S' in your chest
You better wear two vests
Watch your back, your front, I always hit, don't bunt
Crazy posse when I'm out on a duck hunt
Emcee Ice-T answers to no one
Load my rhymes and cock them like a shotgun
Let off like frags from a pipe bomb
A low stroll and my mic in my right palm
The cops hate me and that's right they oughta
Before my crew gets to their daughters

[Break: Ice-T Talking]
Ha ha ha, yo, Nat the Cat, you're next baby
Yo, why don't you get on this Mic, 
And jump off like suicider off the Brooklyn Bridge, baby?
Yeah, you're a player, kick it

[Nat the Cat]
Do you know me?
Right, that's why carry the mic
I'm not flashing my American Express
I'm playing my cards closed to my vest
My name that you say, what, I'm vesting
Listen up and listen close and listen for the lesson
Black panther resisting that situation 
Executing with tact, jumping exact
Ripping up slack on the tack
86 didn't mack, turn tales and back up at stack the jack
Cause I'm venerish, Nat The Cat, unloading like the million hustler T.N.T 
Yes that's me, you see, you wanna be but can't MC
Cause on the real, the science ???? behind your capacity
The simplicity that's how I say
But I said it, you know you wonder how did he say that anyway
To you it's complex, when I flex for flex flood
Stimulates the opposite sets, and that's dope
Though why you can't cope
I'm throwing you a rope, I'm about to draw you as you don't rock the boat
Or you be back inside, you be hoping this time it won't float
You be stuck on the bottom with other suckers I got them
Sporting to see me, woof, while I'm banking the loot
Just off the end, you travel around the world in a fly silk suit
My style is custom made suede and leather
Down to fly by in any weather

[Donald D]
Donald D the smuggler, go on for the juggler
Firing wild out here, police sirens
What's up? Do you wanna die by?
The Syndicate sniper tonight on a fly by
Swing while I came into the tune that grip ya
Flip ya, trip ya, rip ya, I keep dipping ya
In and out, back and forth, up and down
Me be sleeping with the heat, I can't fuck around
City sounds like a perceive of caution
Teach you that B.S.C.s and never fortune
I'm here to sink your brain, I'll take the thought you think
Make you walk the plank, to watch you sink
The M.O.B needs a hitman
Well here I'm, Uncle Cocaine, pulse your membrane
As the black boss, weaves from the chain
Learn to steal, learn to wheel and deal
With things that hot, caps got peeled
MC's, come on, step with your rhyme
What's up, put your life on the line
I shall robe them, headlock choke them
While you walk them when the Syndicte Sniper get stalk them
Red Beam on target, you can't dodge it
When, where be ya, ABC ya

[Outro: Donald D Talking]
Aww yeah man, that was MC Ice-T
Nat The Cat and Donald D, you know what I'm saying?  
In your face for 1991 and did something
We outta here, for sure, it was a homicidal fly by
So peace to Syndicate's elders</pre>
