[Verse 1]
Listen baby, sometimes I know I be playin
but set aside the bullshit, I'ma grown ass man
Whats to understand that I love to fuck
Can I hit it from the back or put ya ass in a buck?
Screamin Shawty what's up, are we fuckin' are what
We ain't got nothin to discuss I'm simply tryin to bust nuts
The temperatures risin', We reachin the bed
Ya eyes begin to roll in the back of ya head

[Verse 2]
Bangin' Headboards, The loud noise, The sound of you screamin
Turn me on cus it sound like you singin'
Sayin my name constantly, Sayin' daddy keep fuckin me
Get it how you want it long as you keep lovin' me
Put ya thing down
Boom the bedroom do it right
And it jus might be a long night, Alright
Now be Quiet you don't want them to hear us outside
let me get on bottom while you ride

[Chorus]
Bedroom Boom, (Thats whats goin down tonight)
Bedroom Boom, (Let me do ya body right)
My bed will be boomin' for you... (boom boom)
Bedroom boom, (All between the sheets baby)
Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy)
My bed will be boomin for you

[Verse 3 (Avant)]
It feels like heaven when were off in this room together
I Can hear the music playin, then I hear ya voice sayin
"Ohh daddy now jus give it to me right there."
"Ohh baby, Take a handfull of my hair."
Cus you like it rough (rough) can't get enough (nough)
Cus I'm the type of nigga thats gon fill you up, like a cup
And make this love thing overflow
I won't stop until ya body's tellin me so
Sheets gettin' sticky from the strawberries and whipped cream
If these walls could talk they would say this is one hell of a scene
Now you movin ya body jus like a gymnist
From the bed to the dresser, All type a' crazy shit
Case is tellin me stories, Body's hot and so horny
Hittin it from the rear, Wanna wisper somethin in yo ear
"I'm gonna love you all night... I promise."

[Chorus 2]
Bedroom boom, (Bedroom boom!!)
Bedroom boom, (I can hear it baby!)
My bed will be boomin' for you, (We'll be Fuckin all night, yes..)
Bedroom boom, (Hittin yo body!)
Bedroom boom, (Like boom boom boom!)
My bed will be boomin' for you
(My bed will be shakin' til' the screws come loose, while I'm off in it)

[Verse 4]
Boom goes the bedroom, Behind closed doors
And the bedroom depends on how far things go
You move slow or move fast when you off in that ass
But you hittin' that mothafucker like everytime yo last
Spread yo legs like a bald eagle, Work that back
Move like a snake when you do dat dat
Now be quiet, You don't want them to hear us outside
Let me get on bottom while you ride

[Verse 5]
You hotter then the eye on the stove
(Yea) Temptation got ya outta control
(Mmm Hmmm) You tremblin' like you out in the cold
You screamin' you can't take it no more
Beat the pussy so bad we done fell on the flo (Can you believe it?)
Throw our clothes in the kitchen and in the garage
All this love is waitin for you like I'm El DeBarge
See my dick stay hard. (Oh) And its gon stay cocked
(Yes) If a bitch fuck wit me she gettin her cherry popped

[Chorus 3]
Bedroom boom, (This is serious business, Baby)
Bedroom boom, (What goes on in this room, So what baby..)
My bed will be boomin' for you, (Say Boom! boom!)
Bedroom boom, Bedroom boom, (And it feels amazing!)</pre>
