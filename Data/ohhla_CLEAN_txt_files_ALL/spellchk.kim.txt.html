[Lil' Kim]
I'm the L-I-L to the K-I-M
And not B-I-G, R.I.P. ba-by
I, rep BK and the, N.Y.C.
Don't no bitch do it like I D-I-D
And, since nine-six a chick been on TV
Like, MTV and, BET
So T-R-L and, one-oh-six
I'm in heavy R.O. when they play my shit
Momma push whips like BM Dubs
And your B.M. trip when she see me in the club
The man, five-oh, I don't see him in the club
Cause he out in the CT with a dick in his butt
Y'all stay OT while I stay O.C.
That's, out the country with the A-R-A-B's
With my girl M to the O to the E
She ride like a soldier, that's my co-D
I'm "Bella" to that death and, don't ask why
Cause the "Mafia" is P-U-S-S-Y
And I'm more nigga than them bitch-ass guys
Cause they took the stand, on the D.A.'s side

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I'm the B-A-D-D-E-S-T
Chick in the game - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
I keep it G-A-N-G-S-T-A
What more can I say - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
BK's finest, straight out the S-T-U-Y
And the girl stay fly - yo what the fuck I gotta spell it out?
It's the Q-U-double-E-N B-double-E
Hoes wanna be me - what the fuck I gotta spell it out?

[Lil' Kim]
I'm in the Lamb' or the Ferrari when I'm M.I.A.
Take the Spyder down the strip, when I'm in V-A
The game slow, gotta put a little work in D.C.
I ball like I'm WNBA's M.V.P.
On, ESPN or, NBC
I like it raw like my boy the late O.D.B.
Stop pullin out them burners on them DVD's
You gotta body a motherfucker to, impress me
My boys keep the M-A-C in the SUV
And they air somethin out on the, A-V-E
I'm in the B-E-N-Z doin a buck-oh-three
Tearin the clutch down on the B-Q-E
Get at niggaz quick if they try to move me
A.S.A.P. like, T.I.P.
You get chopped and screwed, honeygirl don't play
Nigga we "Ridin' Dirty" like U.G.K.

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
Make a wish when you see me like a falling star
Give a lot of y'all careers, CPR
First lady at the top of, R-A-P
I'm on my T-O-E's gettin that D-O-E
B-I-G, M-O, M-M-A
No info, for the, D.E.A.
Federal agents mad cause I'm flagrant
Tapped the cell, and the phone in my basement
The IRS tryin to take my pay
And plus I'm bein spied on by the C.I.A.
I locks it, I'm toxic like DDT
My flow get'cha high like PCP
I'm number one downloaded on your MP3
I bang on you niggaz like an MPC
I make a nigga nut in his DNG's
Cause no one do it better than the one Q.B.

[Chorus]</pre>
