It's all because of brew
I'm feelin fresh and new
I bless a forty a day
So now I never have to have another sober day
When blessin' 40's I'm a pro
I just thought I'd let you know  
You Can't take my brew away from me...

[Bizzy]
I down my 40 kinda slow; I like to savor it
And while the niggas try to down it
I like to save my shit
See, brew's a must to me, so put your trust in me
Yeah, I'm a stone-cold alcoholic for eternity
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
If you're an alchy and you know it
Takin' a swig will surely show it
If you're an alchy and you know it, take a swig
Now take a muthafuckin' gulp for the Bones, swig it
Hog it, dog it, or just leave that shit alone
I gotta get my buzz on: Olde, Gold, P.M., and Ides
I dip the joint into the brew so I can get high
And well, ya know what they say
I need a swig a day with ?
Down with the brew-swiggers, yeah
We all in the house, and all them real niggas
We bless da 40 ounce! Gotta bless my 40
Or my crew will put me out
My name is Bizzy Bone, I gotta bless da 40 ounce
Who's next to bless da forty?
I don't wanna put you out
So, Krayzie Bone, bless da 40 ounce!

[Krayzie]
Now, I'm takin a sip - Now I'm takin' a sip
Pass the 40, back the fuck up, bitch
You think I spent 2 dollars just to let you slop in my shit?!
And niggas swore I be stiffin', but niggas
Shit you knew the toll is 25 cents for you to swig my brew
I got influenced by foam because it gets me pumped to get a 40
'Cause they love it when me pissy drunk
Yeah, my bitches be trippin' to see the film of my brew, shit
See what I'm a do, is, get rid of you, bitch
I got back to the store to get the St. Ides
I dip the joint into my brew so I can get high
Yeah, I do 'cause I like to get silly wit it
And since I drink St. Ides, yo
A nigga get religious with it
I want short, talls, 40s, and them 64s
I gotta get drunk because I love calling bitches hoes
Drunker than a bitch is how you see me
So nigga (praise the what?) the fuckin' 40 O-Z
I gotta bless my 40 or my crew will put me out
My name is Krayzie Bone
I gotta bless da 40 ounce
Who's next to bless da 40?
I don't wanna put you out
So yo, Wish Bone, my nigga, bless da 40 ounce!

[Wish]
Bone's gettin' drunk and freakin' hoes
I'm chillin' with my niggas as I bless my forty O's
I'm poppin' off the cap, I down my shit and act a fool
You know we always brewed in the morning just for school
And if you have a party with the drink we hit it first, G
I knew I was a drunk when double-A couldn't help me, yeah
Niggas be trippin', ain't gave a sip, but they want a sip
Well, fuck that freebie shit;
You ain't got no money [broke bitch] you broke bitch!
The Bone works hard to get brewed all day
And we don't give a fuck about what sober niggas say
I stumbled into the house and people ask why
I dip the joint into the brew, so I can get high
My nigga Krayzie Bone hooked me with that bomb bud
Now roll me up a huddah, I'm about to hit the bud
Cuz, you know a friend with weed is a friend indeed
But a friend without a doubt is the one that bless da 40 ounce
Gotta bless my 40 or my crew will put me out
My name is Wish Bone; I gotta bless da 40 ounce
Who's next to bless da 40?
I don't wanna put you out
So Layzie Bone, bless da 40 ounce!

[Layzie]
Straight from the muthafuckin thieve land
Where you cop a 40 (you want a 40?)
Ounce for a dollar ninety, even
And drink a brew, I'll be a true nut and a alcoholic
You gotta problem, I gotta problem
But my brew will solve it
Don't try to stop me; I get drunk than a skunk
'Cause I be rollin with the brew in the trunk
So, now you know that I be way past tipsy
Because my lips be steady takin sips, G
So many sips that I be drinkin' till my sud's gone
Because the Bones love to get they buzz on
And I'm a show you how to bless it like this
Hit to the bottom, to the top, and a smooth twist
Now check this:  I'm a drink it 'til a nigga die
I dip the joint into the brew so I can get high and higher
Now I's think it's time a nigga announce that all day
Everyday, we just be blessin' da 40 ounce
Gotta drink da 40 or my crew will put me out
My name is Layzie Bone, so I'm'a bless da 40 ounce
Who's next to bless da 40?
I don't wanna put you out
The Enterpri$e is done; we bless da 40 ounce, bitch!</pre>
