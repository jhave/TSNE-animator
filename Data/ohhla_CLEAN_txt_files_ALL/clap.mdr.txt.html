[Mac Dre]
Listen up I'm about to get doper
They call me Mr. Furly but I'm more like Mr. Roper
Roper smoker
No so fuck a chauffeur
I use my own bow so I can toke the super soaker
Use the post up on the block with my toaster
Now I eat MC's like frozen food from Stouffers
Most these dudes is jokers
Hopeless no focus [no focus]
Underground like gofers
Gettin' stocked like drawers
Hocus Pocus
Abra-Cadabra [Cadabra]
You can put the whistle on a 7-7 Maverick [7-7 Maverick]
Nigga pack a pistol when he ain't scared to blast it [ain't scared to blast it]
Nigga it's official you can catch me in the traffic [in the traffic]
In the Benz on them rims that spin [that spin]
Checkin' chins, fuck friends, stack ends [stack ends]
It's Mac and I'm back and I'm smackin' [Thizz!]
This be the slap and get yo hands clappin'

[Chorus] x2
Mic check one, two [one, two]
Tell you what I'm gon' do [gon' do]
Grab a juice and pop two [pop two]
Then act a mutha fuckin' fool
I'mma fool

[Mac Dre]
I'm a pimp and a playa
My diamonds gleam [bling, bling]
I'm a Giant, a Raider, boy I'm a King [I'm a King]
Totin' the cater under my wing [under my wing]
I'm dumb and don't care nigga what you mean [what you mean]
Pass the heam
Thizz, weed, so I can get started [so I canget started]
Dre that is me
I can get retarded [I can get retarded]
I can get the party crackin' when it's yawnin' [it's yawnin']
And the bitches won't leave 'til six in the mornin'
If you condonin' that bullshit, stop it [stop it]
'fo I unlock it, cock it, and cop it [cop it]
Nigga watch it
You fuckin' wit the Vay boy [Vay boy]
Mac Dre boy all damn day boy [all damn day boy]
Flam-Bay boy
I'll make it sizzle [I'll make it sizzle]
It the wash house
Gone off a thizzle [Gone off a thizzle]
It's trizzle my nizzle [my nizzle]
Come visit the Country Club [the Country Club]
And see what iiiiiis it? [what iiiiis it?]
What iiiiis it?

[Chorus] x2</pre>
