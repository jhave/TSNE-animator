(So fresh)	--&gt; Roxanne Shanté

I'm on the list and, my rhymes are crisp and
Me and ??? are like a ??? and ???
Without fail, everytime I
Get a dope idea for a rhyme I
Choose to save it or scrap it
See Marley for a beat and then rap it
I'm blessed by buddah, I'm not new ta
And sayin rhymes is what I do ta
Pass some of my free time away
Ask me why, and I'ma say
My nickname's MC Brutus
Cause I'm quick to pick up the mic and say, "Yo, let's do this"
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so

(So fresh)

You're too smart to bite a part two
But if you ever get the nerve or heart to
When I find our behind, forget it
If it's a battle you want, I'm with it
1-2-3-4, Marley Marl, a-hi-hit me
Since when a beat he made not fit me
It's a fact too that I attract to
These beats I'm about to get back to
Girls I scoop, parties that I hoop
And I doubt with your rhymes you can hang with me, troop
Even though I, am a pro I
Grab the mic now and then to show I
Have the skill to, plus the will to
Make the jams you can sit back and chill to
I think about the rhymes, then write em
The first chance that you get, you go bite em
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so

(So fresh)

In the, beginning of
Around the time when they thought about the spinning of
Records on two turntables
Before they started callin dookie ropes cables
Even today I, you know the way I
Come across with dope rhymes I say, I
First suggest them, then manifest them
Go to Marley's house and Warner Bros. presses em
We had a touch of, but not much of
The def beats that we now have a clutch of
Understand me, we don't plan, we
And might I say myself, goddamn we
Hate to make a jam that ain't slammin
We make the jams that you wanna keep jammin
The world of hip-hop is so demandin
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so
(So fresh)
I lead the pack because I write the funky rhymes that are so
