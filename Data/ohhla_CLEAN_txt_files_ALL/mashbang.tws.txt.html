(Turtle Banxx)
picture this shit you facing
totalin body and murderous situations against nations we organize like maces
got killers patiently waitin
different places you facing the yellow taping and federal x with graces
we ruinin your reputation
momma in the hospital pacing for every shot you taking
the doctors cant stop the shaking
see faces blazin
like the sun of satan like a gun that gets nathan
what you expect? (say what)
like a neutron on deck (yeah)
nigga you gonna catch rays (ha)
you confess lets get cash and thangs (ugh huh)
smokin flash and range
cause we mash and bang
till the vet we slay (ahhhhhhh)
motherfucker, let it reign

(Bennie Franks)
now they knowing that we mash and bang
texas 380 in this cash for cash and mask
y'all then fucked up now
let the south and west connect
we snatch a soul out ya better chosen swiss cheese your Avirex
whats up now?
me and my nigga Turtle cown(?)
to late to rehearse nigga (shit) thangs looking shitty now
pass ya a Phillie pal
I'm all up in ya now
and when i blast you hear (gunshot)
feeling me now?
what i feel for the opponent
smell the aroma
well come swim with these killa piranhas
sharin heat orders slash g's and fours
street patrollers cant run when the gasket blows
your caskets close
my eyes open
you fuck around and get John Blaze now ya broken
and now I'm hoping you escape before crimes broken braids on the gallery
fat too many calories I'm ghost Mickey and Mallory

(chorus)

all my thugs grab them thangs
cause we gonna mash and bang

(Turtle Banxx)
botherly we and bodies sippin voscie voscily dick the hottie
properly lick a shottie nut up switch a party to a Jason scene
cut up everybody scream "To Shut Up Everybody"
juss means you what up big body?
my association with fornication got me exposin tricks
negotiatin motivation for my disposal
body bog
put the mask on fuck it take the mask off
open fire blast motherfuckers then we mash on
for the change we bang and the thangedest chain
if the nights then the name medallion then blow out his brain
same mobster and baller hit the casino click the revolvers
heat in casinos Turtle Banxx and Bennie Franks
G.O. Deniro fuck Denaro
mash the pedal to the metal
ain't no swashing we heartless bang to this settle
you ain't walking the austin and departing the ghetto carchers(?)
some bledo when when the pistols echo and serve to protect em

(Bennie Franks)
fuck them niggas hollerin heat with they narrow barrels
I got killers that'll bang Jason in math terror
your replacements ask Nicholas Cage where ya face went
fake ass hation hanging butt naked in my basement
dip em in honey hang em hot
y'all adjacent vanilla ounce truce let em fly
that'll erase em
should have ran before we cocked back loaded and aim
Bennie Franks and Turtle Banxx we mash and bang

(chorus)
