[Lil Wayne talking]
Weed and syrup is the combination and the inspiration
As for you pussy niggas, I just realize you can fuck with me
And you never will, bitch ass niggas
Weezy F. Baby believe dat
Haha, yeah

[Lil Wayne]
I got them 24 inches, sittin on them Joe Buddens
And the trunk straight jumpin, bitch I can't hear nothin
And I might do the Spurs, sittin on them Tim Duncan's
And in the lambourgini, I do donuts like dunkin
How come every bad bitch with a pussy, wanna fuck 'em
But I just feed 'em drugs, and watch 'em fuck each other
My neck was 100, and my wrist was another
I make her pussy wet, I leave that bitch with a puddle
I'ma beast, I'ma dog, I should rap with a muzzle
Peyton Manning flow, I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin straight dick, no cuddle
You know I'm out this world, I just bought a space shuttle
I'ma put some D's on that bitch
Man, these hoes starting to get like fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? Who? Nina, she's on my hip
Yellow white diamonds, call 'em cheese on them grits
You niggas aint ballin, real talk, you niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't guard me, you lookin at Jordan
From the side, like Spike at the Garden
I got the hardest bars, call me the Warden, haha
Yeah, excuse me, pardon
I break a bitch down like Tonya Harden
Bitch I'm Cole, not dude off Martin
Pockets just fat, like the Klumps and Norbit
Bitch I'm fly, like a magic carpet
And bitch I'm fresh, like a pack of Orbitz
See, I'ma take it, and go bring it back to New Orleans
And bitch I'ma shine in The Land Of Darkness
And which I'ma grind, 'till my stacks is as tall is my wall is
And I'm high, don't want know how deep the fall is
No I can't come down
And everytime I send my girl out of town, I put some key's on that bitch
I'ma certified gangsta, haters make me nautious
The money makes me anxious
Listen how my words are poetic, like Langston
Dreads down my back, like I come straight from Kingston
But I come from Hollygrove 17 danger, zone
So many c-notes, I can sing a song
T-Top coupe, lookin like a thong
Your girl love my dick, she treats it like a bong
I don't wanna be right, if gettin high is wrong
My eyes so low, it look like I'm from Hong Kong
Boy, I got more green, than the Bishop Don Juan, haha
Okay, I'm not a rookie, I'ma pro
Methazene fiend, make the homies say, ohhh
And make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian, and I only eat beats
Wear a lot of carrots, and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag, just some swishers
And a whole bunch of cans of whoop ass, haha
I'm strapped, like a bookbag
So anyone of ya'll can come on, and get a foot tag
D.O.A.
Ride all night, sleep no way
Sleep when I lay, six feet deep, and until that day
I'ma be living, like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on
I say bitch I been hot, bitch the stove been on
If you don't like it, I roll over and roll alone
Fuck you and the horse, that you rode in on
Yeah, some cool shorts, and my Kobe's on
Lookin slicker than the lane, that you bowling on
If they aint tell you that I'm the shit, they told you wrong
Bitch, I'm bubblin like soda foam
In a styrofoam cup
You what's in my styrofoam, what?
S-Y-R up
That's my car, yup
Vrooommmmm!! Urghhhh!!
I'm gone</pre>
