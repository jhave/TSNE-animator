[Lil' Jon]
Yeeeeeeeah okay
It's about to go down in this muthafucka tonight (uh-huh)
Real niggas put your muthafuckin middle finger up (yeah)
(Uh-huh c'mon)

[Hook] - 2X
Dont wanna fuck wit' us niggas (well, uh-huh)
We click-click on a nigga (well, uh-huh)
We aint scared of you nigga (well, uh-huh)
You just a bitch, my nigga (c'mon)

[D-Roc]
I burn and bang like some bullet-wounds
So when you step in my path, nigga you meet your doom
I'm smackin bitches with gloves, I aint no paper thug
This shit is real from jump, so if you wanna thump
Go play your cards my nigga, and we can get it started
You pulled your gat now bitch, lets see who coward-hearted
Pussy-perpetrators be poppin off, I think they dick-sucker
But Ying-Yang in this thang, we run this muthafucka
A-T-L nucca

[Hook] - 2x
Dont wanna fuck wit' us niggas (well, uh-huh)
We click-click on a nigga (well, uh-huh)
We aint scared of you nigga (well, uh-huh)
You just a bitch, my nigga (c'mon)

[Pastor Troy]
Yeah, y'all already know what time it is
PT representin with them Ying-Yang boys
Make some noise baby, 'cause it's D-S-G-B
Y'all already know

[Pastor Troy]
Ying-Yang, everythang I got, I own
Pastor nigga, down to my fuckin chrome
As long as I'm here (uh-huh)
Uh pussy-nigga, it's gon' be a long year (c'mon)
No fear, I have none (uh-huh)
Why the fuck have fear? I got a gun
And if you run I'ma buss you in your back (uh-huh)
And leave your ass where you're at, like that

[Hook] - 2X
Dont wanna fuck wit' us niggas (well, uh-huh)
We click-click on a nigga (well, uh-huh)
We aint scared of you nigga (well, uh-huh)
You just a bitch, my nigga (c'mon)

[Kaine]
Muthafuckas gon' feel lost
Y'all know that we back on
Nigga didnt thing we'd do it again
But the round we comin with too strong
So you need me to hold your lip bitch
Or find your ass in some bullshit
Some down south shit you cant fuck with
So I know you aint ready for a nigga to click
Better move bitch, 'cause niggas aint playin
Aint no more play in G-A, A-T-L where I stay, so then you better make way
'Cause if a nigga didnt know we keep on comin with hits
We got Lil' John, The Eastside Boys, and Pastor Troy in this bitch

[Hook] - 2X
Dont wanna fuck wit' us niggas (well, uh-huh)
We click-click on a nigga (well, uh-huh)
We aint scared of you nigga (well, uh-huh)
You just a bitch, my nigga (c'mon)

Ah, now look, this the Ying-Yang Twins right
And we done collabed with Lil' John and them Eastside Boys and Pastor Troy
To let y'all know we aint no one-hitter-quitters
Fuck all y'all bullshitters, ahhhhhhh

[Lil' Jon]
Hope I dont bomb you from the ass and...
Wrap the gag and start blastin
Aint gon' ask no questions, have you lyin there dyin
Cryin and bleedin, see you later, I'm leavin
Onto the mist to the midnight creepin
Now you're eternally sleepin
From the A-T-L we gon' ride out
Headed to the underground hideout
We still gon' buss them slugs out
'Cause where I'm from, we thugged out
Keep it real for the nigga that didnt know
Keep it real for the nigga that slang dope
If you got it then buss your fo'-fo'
Where you from nigga? A-T-L ho

[Hook] - 2X
Dont wanna fuck wit' us niggas (well, uh-huh)
We click-click on a nigga (well, uh-huh)
We aint scared of you nigga (well, uh-huh)
You just a bitch, my nigga (c'mon)</pre>
