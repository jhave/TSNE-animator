(Lars you're on in ten minutes, you ready?)
I guess but I still gotta write some lyrics
(Aiight, just remember, it's crunk night)
In case, I guess it won't be a problem

This popular subgenre is brought to you by materialism
We'd like to thank Bentley, Alize champagne and Sean John clothing
We'd like to thank the record industry for
Marketing hip-hop stereotypes to 12-year-olds
And a pop culture that unquestioningly consumes vapid, superficial entertainment

Phrase about my gun (WHAT!), rhyme about my loot (WHAT!)
Phrase about these haters, I sometimes have to shoot (YEEEAH!)
Rhyme about my clothes (WHAT!), props to my hometown (CARMEL VALLEY!)
Lyrics that say nothing cause that's how we get down (YEEEAH!)
Phrase about my click (WHAT!), don't step to me punk (WHAT!)
Gratuitious rhyme, about keeping it crunk (YEEEAH!)
Big ups to our genre, we do it our own way (WHAT!)
It's just too bad our songs don't have anything to say (YEEEAH!)

Generic crunk rap, WHAT, generic crunk rap, YEAH
Generic crunk rap, WHAT, we don't mess around
Generic crunk rap, YEAH, generic crunk rap, WHAT
Generic crunk rap, YEAH, you like our dirty sound, YEAH

Buy cars, GET CRUNK, take shots, GET CRUNK
Have sex, GET CRUNK, spend money, GET CRUNK
Buy cars, GET CRUNK, take shots, GET CRUNK
Have sex, GET CRUNK, spend money, GET CRUNK

Phrase about my car (volvo), rhyme about my crew (WHAT!)
Rap about how much more crunk I am than you
Rhyme about my rims, rhyme about my bling (WHAT!)
Chorus where I scream cause I don't know how to sing (YEAH!)
Rhyme supporting guns, and also drinking 40's
Misogynist rhyme about banging lots of shorties
Rhyme about my doe, and then some made up lyrics
Get off the gas you swinger, check the deuce, yo sabiirit (YEAH!)

Generic crunk rap, WHAT, generic crunk rap, YEAH
Generic crunk rap, WHAT, we don't mess around
Generic crunk rap, YEAH, generic crunk rap, WHAT
Generic crunk rap, YEAH, you like our dirty sound, YEAH

Buy clothes, GET CRUNK, hennesey, GET CRUNK
Escalades, GET CRUNK, spend money, GET CRUNK
Buy cars, GET CRUNK, take shots, GET CRUNK
Have sex, GET CRUNK, spend money, GET CRUNK

Grandmaster flash, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
KRS, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
Run DMC, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
But who can argue with the charts when we're sittin' at the top
Rakim, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
Chuck D, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
De La Soul, I'm sorry but we're killing hip hop
And we're making so much money that we ain't about to stop (YEAH!)
