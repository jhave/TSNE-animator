Devilish rockin' in hell
Mind of a psycho funk I sell
The U-N-H-O-L-Y just as well
I think I gotta buzz from the quart of Champelle
Time to get wicked watch me kick it
And I'm a throw it in your face until your sick of it
You see the radio won't play my music
If I say suck my dick they refuse it
Fuck the radio now what 'cha wanna do
Fuck 107.5 and channel 62
Fuck the new dance show also
"I'm sick of that shit, listen to the hit"
And any motherfucker who doubts me
Close your mouth 'cause you don't know shit about me
I got a whole new attitude, I still get rude
I still kick wicked shit and I ain't changin' shit
Fuck censorship I say suck my dick
Back to back with a ho and a bitch
And all y'all suckas can suck my balls
And if I'm goin' to hell, I'm goin' out sayin' fuck y'all

(CHORUS)(4x)
Yeah I got some last words
Fuck all y'all

Bitches, niggaz, parents, teachers
The radio, the church house, and the preacher
Suck my dick till I die
You think I give a fuck if I make your grandma cry
Bitch get real, 'cause I'm a get ill
Some nigga tryin' to dis me? Now be for real
I got the funk I flow, just to fuck ya ho
And I'm cold gettin' pussy 'cause your bitch said so
Fuck Reverend Night, while I rock the mic
Better lock your doors on devil's night
'Cause I'm a crucafix and let loose the mix
And for the punks who don't like me let loose my dick
Turn the noise up and watch me tear it up
And if ya ain't singin' with me shut the fuck up
I'm gonna make ya holler, while I clock big dollars
While your bitch is cold screamin' my name, yes y'all
For all y'all hopin' for my downfall
Fuck all y'all

(CHORUS)

On your FM band, I get banned off the radio dial
I get buck wild, now I gotta style
That just won't quit
And if you don't like it just suck my dick
The U-N-H-O-L-Y son of a bitch
Cold holdin' my dick 'cause I'm doin' this shit
How this shit be done rappin' son of a gun
You said you saw me with the devil, but I ain't the one
So try to fess me, or even test me
But fuck you and Elvis Presley
I'm sick of that dead motherfucker let him die
Everybody always comin' with an alibi
Now they say he ain't dead, he livin' in Texas
When all the bitches on the planet think I'm sexist
Fuck Elvis Presley he can suck my nuts yes
What he meant to you, I give a fuck less
And I don't care about you, her, or him
It's long, tall, short, fat E-S-H-A-M
And to all the ones that hope for my downfall
It'll never happen so fuck all y'all
