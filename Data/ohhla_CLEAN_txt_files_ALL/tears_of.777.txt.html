[Chorus: Mexicano 777]
Tears of blood are falling
I'm feeling that I will die
Someone come to rescue
The souls that need the light
Suffocation never comes to fill me
What you call temptation
Trying to convince me,
That's when I change the station
And don't you be surprised
When Lucifer stays with the nation (repeat 2X)

As I walk through the streets of the world
I won't fear, no I won't fear, no I won't fear
As I walk through the streets of New York
I won't fear, no I won't fear, no I won't fear
Because me trail turns into this ocean of fear
Filling up a bucket that all full of tears
Stabbing on a heart that was killed with a spear
Looking for a body that was thrown from up here
Trying to survive because he's lacking a beer
And that is all blood becomes a river of tears
Becomes a river of tears

[Chorus]
Tears of blood are falling
I'm feeling that I will die
Someone come to rescue
The souls that need the light
Bullets penetrating my soul
Turns them into gold
And like a slave I am sold
Where's my life I don't know
Someone has to lead the road
To the promise land
And if it's me I shall lead
Breaking chains that make me bleed
And if it's time for me to lead
I will lead in victory
I am the rock of the Lord
God's assassins amore

[Chorus]
Tears of blood are falling
I'm feeling that I will die
Someone come to rescue
The souls that need the light

And when I'm falling
I will look upon the skies
And your name be calling
Hoping for a dream to come true before a moment
I feel that it's upon me and my soul is being stolen
I feel the omen
Something in my body that my spirit is controlling
Hoping for another day or a happy moment
Trying to control myself before my life is stolen

Bullets penetrating my soul
Turns them into gold
And like a slave I am sold
Where's my life I don't know
Someone has to lead the road
To the promise land
And if it's me I shall lead
Breaking chains that make me bleed
And if it's time for me to lead
I will lead in victory
I am the rock of the Lord
God's assassins amore

[Chorus]
Tears of blood are falling
I'm feeling that I will die
Someone come to rescue
The souls that need the light (repeat 2X)

[Flo]
Hey yo I cried tears of blood
For everything there was
Tragedy, catastrophe
Circumstances, floods
We live for life full of never ending buzz
We dyin' to strike pass quarters cause we dug deep
To the quarters sleep itself sheep
Who followed the weep
Down the path of Bleed Street
My pain stays there
My crown stays red
My eyes stays shed
As my face stay red

And when I'm falling
Your name I'll be calling (repeat 4x)

Tears of blood are falling (repeat 7x)</pre>
