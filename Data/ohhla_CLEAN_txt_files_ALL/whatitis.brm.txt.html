[Verse 1]
C'mon - who be the father to this?
Bounce right here niggas be followin this
Modelin bitches be frontin and be swallowin this
Carry on and yellin, screamin, be hollerin this
Flipmode co-signed to be the sponsor for this
What? To conquer this you need to march on for this
What? Ha, bitches just shake it and wiggle
And start to bake and just giggle
And then get naked a little and shit
Sweat drippin off they face and they nipple and shit
Niggas wildin til they be all tired and crippled and shit
Yeah you buggin on how we be doin it to ya
Hit y'all niggas with shit just like bullets was travelin through ya
Now, from right to left with a capital F
So we gon' keep this shit hot to death and we stoppin your breath
Drinkin and buggin and fuckin with them hoes again
But it's nothin cuz y'all niggas KNOW we 'bout to blow again
