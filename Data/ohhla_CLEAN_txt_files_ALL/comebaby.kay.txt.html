Da ding de ding de ding de de de ding ding

(Respect)

(Yeah, yeah)
Move it up (yeah, yeah)
Move it up (yeah, yeah)
Come on

(Bounce, come on bounce, bounce, come on bounce)
(Bounce, come on bounce) 
Seven's always in control, you know what I'm sayin'
(Bounce, come on bounce)

I slam the door (Boom!)
When I come into the bedroom (Wham! Bam!)
'Cause I'm the King of the castle (na na na)
Turn me on turn me loose (come on, come on)
Try to hit it, it's a hassle
Come get some of this, don't forget the innuendo
Play me like Nintendo, never ever let go
Keep it so loud, you'll be hittin' the crescendo
(Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do)

(CHORUS:)
Come baby come baby baby come come
(Come baby come baby baby come come)
When you gotta give me lovin' then you gotta give me some
(You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some)
Come baby come baby baby come come
(Come baby come baby baby come come)
When you gotta give me lovin' then you gotta give me some
(You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some)
Come down

Well, I can hear the (ring ring ring)
The telephone goes ring (hello, hello)
But we're still gettin' busy
(Pom pom pom, hoo!) Now you're gettin' busy
I can slow it down so you can pump it (pump it)
Better move it fast so you can pump it (pump it)
Two balls and a bat (hoo), a pitcher with a hat (ha)
Slidin' into home base, tryin' to hit a home run
Swing batta batta batta batta batta swing!

(CHORUS)

Break it down, break it down, come on

(Bounce) Move it all around, (come on bounce) move it all around, bounce
(Bounce) Pump it up and down, (come on bounce) pump it up and down, bounce
(Bounce) Move it all around, (come on bounce) move it all around, bounce
(Bounce) Pump it up and down, (come on bounce) bounce, bounce

Tell me do you like it? (Yeah, yeah)
Do you want a little more? (Yeah, yeah)
Now tell me do you love it? (Yeah, yeah)
Come on! (Do do you love me?)
I can feel it (hoo baby baby), come on (ha baby baby)
Let it go (hoo baby baby), come on (ha baby baby)
Give it to me (hoo baby baby), come on (ha baby baby)
Give it to me (hoo! Straight up, now tell me)

(Bounce) da ding de ding (come on bounce) de ding de de de ding ding
(Bounce) da ding de ding (come on bounce) de ding de de de ding
(Bounce) da ding de ding (come on bounce) de ding de de de ding ding
(Bounce) de ding de de de ding de ding de de de ding ding

Come baby come baby baby come come
(Come baby come baby baby come come)
(Yeah) da ding de ding de ding de de de (hoo!) ding ding
(You gotta give me lovin' and you gotta give me some)
Come baby come baby baby come come
