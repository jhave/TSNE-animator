Uh! Its that boy Magnificent
AKA Maaagno
The Rookie Of Da Year
Be on the lookout for that solo album coming soon

[Magno]
It's Magnificent, but you can call me Magno
I used to do crime now I'm 'bout my cashflow
Thats the past though, and I don't mean to brag bro
But Magno 'bout to knock off that Jag yo
See everything big in Texas
I used to own a GS, but now I'm thinkin bigger than Lexus
I will call it, crash boards like Ben Wallace
Flow for enough dough for ten wallets
But the way my CD goes, it's rough
But that's no excuse to be broke and cheap like Videos Uncut
All I do is expand my grammar
So I can put my family in that Full House like Danny Tanner
I got love for that Acres Homes
I'm gettin Paul Wall treatment, girls wanna take me home
Might catch Mag sippin a barre
When I'm in the club I put my hoood up like I'm fixin' my car
It's Magno

Hook x 2: (Mike Jones)
Y'all wanna be like Mag but you cant
All hoes faint when they see the Jag paint
Let's make it crystal clear, Mag's the rookie of da year
By this time next year the whole world will be in fear

[Magno]
In this game, can't nobody hold me
Plus I'm 2-piecin niggaz like Charlie Ward did Kobe
I still remember saving them cans
Now I roll down the street, trunk popped up, waving at fans
So why flip a pound of 'caine?
When I can get rich simply making words sound the same
Pound of game, now that Mag found the fame
I'm 'bout to stack bills I really hate the sound of change
My flows be the grittiest, I'm GQ, hoes be the prettiest
Dime piece, hoes never hideous
I walk in casinos slowly
I'm bout to shoot a tennis shoe commercial with Cuttino Mobley
Everytime I walk the world spin
I'm trying to have a 5-way menage with the cast of Girlfriends
My Swishahouse fam stackin cream
Shot callers, got more ballers than Slam magazine

Hook x 2

[Magno]
MC's in this game, I'm evicting them early
Magnificent the landlord like Mr. Furley
I never play games, get brain in a beige Range
And all they gotta know is my stage name
It's like everybody's switchin' to rappin'
And girls don't gold dig no more cuz now, they diggin for platinum
I'm the black Hugh Hefner, got my own penthouse
I had to, I got more chicks than a henhouse
Swishahouse 'bout to stack the numbers
We doing it the legal way instead of showin crack like plumbers
Add the runners , now that we relaxed for summers
Get a home, put chrome on the 'Lacs and Hummers
I'm 'bout to show your gal what stunt means
Like leavin balls in her mouth, and I don't mean the ones on her tongue ring
Refill, they coppin' them slugs
And girls gots tat's on they back that say Property Of
Magno
