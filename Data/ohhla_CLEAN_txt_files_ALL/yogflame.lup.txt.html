Uh, meditate
On the floor, fold your legs, resonate
Breathing speed, regulate
Clear my mind till it levitate
Dhalsim, I beat the game,
Level 8, Hella good
Never great cause God is great
So ain't no G.O.A.T.S., ain't no gates
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep's skate
Brace yourself, teeth straight
Fix your face for Pete's sake
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake
Four-door flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe/my roll make it rain
Not with bills, I make it change
Take that cool shit, make it lame
Take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us make it bang
Yeah, you heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring
Take that ring and make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain
Look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane
Pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains
So I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne
Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty, Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane
I'm not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained
Look how far my pockets hang
That's cause I got pocket change
My net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games
Tell them niggas stop it man
But they cannot stop it man
So, they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and, King without the pauper
and King and I ain't got no drains
Bruce Lee, dishwasher
Cleaning out your pots and pans
These niggas ain't got no stain
Power once I hit them with the powder
Then throw them in the shower
These nigga slower than some dial-up
I be on my broadband
These niggas still downloading
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare, zShare
How long you going to be there?
Damn
FinallyFast.com for you fam
Information super highway
These niggas ain't got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder
Like they pulled you over
I sit in the driver's seat
You sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze
You are Whoopi Goldberg
Cause he was a beast and the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick
Rest in Peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in Peace to Rap, no, rest in peace to wackness
Yeah, nigga, I whacked it
Baby boy with the glasses
Tears like a black rap Zach Galifianakis
Hangover, game over, nigga that's it</pre>
