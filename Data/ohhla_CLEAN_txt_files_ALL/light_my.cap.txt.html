[Snoop]   Capone
[Capone]  Oh!
[Snoop]   It's ya boy, Bigg Snoop Dogg
[Capone]  That's right
[Snoop]   I'm tryin' to find me one right now
[Capone]  Ooohwee
[Snoop]   Little hot one
[Capone]  Yeah
[Snoop]   Know what I mean
[Fingazz] Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
[Capone]  Hot like fire (Fire...)
[Fingazz] Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh ("Fi-fi-fi-Fingazz on the track...")

Chorus: Fingazz
You are my fire (Fire)
You take me higher (Higher)
And I can't deny ya (Deny ya)
Cause you're making
Everything alright
You are my fire (Fire)
You take me higher (Higher)
And I can't deny ya (Deny ya)
You know
I need you in my life, my life, my life

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E (Snoop Dogg in cellphone)]
Early in the morning, wakin' up to the beat
It's a good old day, got a kiss on my cheek {*smooch*}
Feeling like a boss, so I get fresh dressed
Diary of a G, and we ain't having that stress
Movin' like I'm doin', so I'm getting paid
Snoop Dogg called me up, and you know he's on the way (What's crack-a-lackin')
Out my way, so I bounce to the store
With some Don Diego's, what I'm looking for
Party time, are you the fire I desire
Without you, girl
My life would expire
So sing to me, baby, I'm a sing to you
Stay true to me lady, I'll stay true to you
Up at the spot
You elevate my mind
And guess what
You're just my kind
Rain or shine
You always got my back
Take me to cloud nine
Just like that

Repeat Chorus

[Fingazz]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, just light my fire

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bigg Snoop Dogg, here to twist the dro
Put the pedal to the metal, go against the flow
High powered as the label, Mr. Criminal
Capone
Young loc, let me hit that, holmes
Lady Pink
The first lady, D-O-Dub
West coast to the fullest, tryin' to show y'all love
No doubt, Dogg House tryin' to burn one out
If I see a little freak, I'm a turn one out
Get in the Coup
Smash out in my Porshe
Ballin', of course
Next level
Hand on the wheel
Pressin' on the pedal
Do what the pimp say
Baby, caliente
So cool
Way smooth
Check this fool
Stop by, slip by, way fly, on the low
Stole the show, what it do, brand new, deja vu
Me and you, baby boo, what it do

Repeat Chorus

Break: Mr. Capone-E
I need you girl like I need this lighter
Come on, baby, just light my fire
Just light it with me, just light this fire
Come and light it with me, just light this fire
Bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
If you down with the G
I said, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Snoop Dogg and Capone with the E

[Verse 3: Mr. Capone-E]
We stay lit
Just another radio hit
To bump while you twist it
I'm with the business
Oh
We do what we desire
Come on, baby, just light my fire

[Fingazz]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, just light my fire
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, just light my fire
Oooh-woah
Oooh-woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher
Oooh-woah
Oooh-woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, you take me higher</pre>
