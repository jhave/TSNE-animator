[Intro]
Yeah! It's 50!

[Chorus]
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow
Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit

[Verse 1]
And it's on, up and down she like to ride on top
Fast, prayin that the condom pop
That's foul, but fuck it it's all hood to me
Now Hollywood's been real real good to me
Now who gives a fuck if a bitch just ain't shit
In the whip she gives CPR to my dick
You losin 'em baby, get 'em up quick
This role play I'm really gettin into this shit
In the telly om all fours I'm ridin that horse
Screamin WOO HA!!! till my voice is lost
Call me 50 call me daddy you can call me the boss
My dick XXL you can call me The Source
You can lie 'bout my performance and give bad reviews
A quickie suppose to be quick bitch I kept on my shoes
Oh you thought we had a love thing girl you confused
Don't listen to the gossip it's never ever true
They say I do things that I never ever do
On the radio, they say me and you a item
Nas fall in love with hoes me I just like 'em
I can't be your man Paris head game great
And Eve's usin dildos on her sex tape
Ashanti's lil' ass butt naked in the truck
These bitches is poppin off why would I tie myself up
At the Super Bowl Janet Jackson showed me a tit
Other niggaz saw it but I felt she showed me it
Times is hard in the yard baby this is real shit
My record sales slow, I'm a show you my dick

Bridge:
Wait a minute baby hold on, I'm just tryin to fix the camera
You know, relax, ha ha h, I'm comin, yeah
It's on you got the water in the tub
Wanna get in the tub, ha ha ha ha

Chorus:
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow
Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit, and it's on</pre>
