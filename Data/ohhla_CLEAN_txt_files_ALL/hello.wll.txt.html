[Intro]
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
I don't wanna be at home tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
We're burning brighter than the sun tonight
When I'm rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
So everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
I just wanna have fun tonight

With all of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends

[Verse 1]
I'm here with all of my peoples
All of, all of my homies
When I stepped in the place them ladies act like they know me
Yeah, they on me, they on it
I walked in with an army
Made it rain in this motherfucker, now it's storming and storming
Ring the booth, ring the booth, baby, turn up the tune
I can't talk with the tune, give me room, give me room
I got that thing with the banger, get the shit off her hanger
Put your drinks in the air, turn around to a stranger and say

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello
I'm here with all of my friends
All of my friends, with all of my friends
Hello, hello
We're here with all of our friends
With all of our friends, with all our friends

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
I don't wanna be at home tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
We're burning brighter than the sun tonight
When I'm rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
So everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Cause I just wanna have fun tonight

With all of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends

[Verse 2]
I'm here with all of my people
All of, all of my folks
Yeah, we're all looking fly, yeah, we're all looking dope
I got them ladies, them ladies
The ladies calling me baby
I say go call your friend so we can go, go, go crazy
Bring them drink, bring them drink
She said she liked how I think
I said I like how you look, oh my God, she said thanks
I wanna bang her, go bang her, get this club off the hanger
Put your drinks in the air, turn around to a stranger and say

[Pre-Chorus]
Hello, hello
I'm here with all of my friends
All of my friends, with all of my friends
Hello, hello
We're here with all of our friends
With all of our friends, with all our friends

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
I don't wanna be at home tonight
I'll be rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
We're burning brighter than the sun tonight
When I'm rocking with you, rocking with you, rocking with you
So everybody have fun tonight
Everybody have fun tonight
Cause I just wanna have fun tonight

With all of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends
All of my friends, all of my friends</pre>
