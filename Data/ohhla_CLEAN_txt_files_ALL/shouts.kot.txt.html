Song:   Shouts Going Out 
Typed by: InsaneD420@aol.com 

This shout goes out to the most high, 
DJ Rob Harris 
Shouts going out to the next plane of reality 
I know you can hear it 
I know you can feel it 

I'm alone, so I'm a loner 
Smoke weed, so I'm a stoner 
Got that ill sick vibe 
That make you say bye bye bye boner 
Let my pants hang, cuz it ain't no thang 
I'm taggin P-Town Loc, while I'm puffin' Mary Jane 

At the level C, sat out there smokin' dubs 
Saint Dog hangin' deep with those rude boy thugs 
On the m-i-c rippin' shit for the ill love 
So pass me the J, so i can get lit 
Hit.. like a daily occupation 
Hit.. let's form a rotation 
Hit.. now breathe it in and pass it to the left 
Hit.. Kottonmouth is the Best 

Shouts going out to the city where i venture 
It's the city of Placentia 
Living your life ain't never been better 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya to another orbit or another plain 
Living lifestyles, blazin' on the Mary Jane 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya.. right back where you venture 

Now green boards 
Blue sky 
Stress free 
No try 
Green bud 
D dub's call it O.C. life 
Family barbecues, enjoying Sunday afternoons 
Hippies in the parks all trippin' off shrooms 
No drive bys its all about drive-ins 
Hittin' skins in the back of a Mercedes Benz 
And you can rest assured that the herbs always pure 
And the brews that we drink are for sure to make you slur 
Pacific Co., Dragon Stout, Newcastle Brown Ale 
Dark beer Daddy brews in the pound 
O.C. is the place that we're talkin' about 
So O.C. is the place where the shouts go out 

Shouts going out to the city where i venture 
It's the city of Placentia 
Living your life ain't never been better 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya to another orbit or another plane 
Kottonmouth ballers blazin' on the Mary Jane 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya 
Right back to Placentia 

Now the shots be gettin' shot from the left to the right 
Kottonmouth gonna take you on a flight 
Now gettin' you up with that dub that we smoke late night 
I'll be blazin' on that pipe so i can bust on the mic 
Smokin' cloves, bustin' blows where i go 
Saint Dog with that flow comin' out of my soul 
Got that psychadelic flow with that punk rock stroll 
Got the spikes in my hair, I let my pants hang low 
Dog Boy, Humble Gods got my back no doubt 
So to the city where you venture shows go out 

Shouts going out to the city where you venture 
Any city that ya been ta 
Living your life ain't never been better 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya to another orbit or another plane 
Living lifestyles blazin' on the Mary Jane 
Kottonmouth gonna send ya 
Right back to Placentia 
Anywhere that you venture 
Right back to Placentia 

O.C., but its that Riverside in me </pre>
