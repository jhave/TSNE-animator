How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
How - low - can you go? How - low, can you go?
{*sped up*} HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?

[Ludacris - Verse 1ne]
Hahaha, LUDA!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could - Face down - {ASS UP!}
The top of yo' booty jigglin outcho' jeans, baby pull yo' pants up!
I like it when I see you do it, better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground, but HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO?
Lower, than yo', mama's, ever, seen it, in her, life-time
Never, would of i-magined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you, doin it, on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get wit you, "Chick, just show me how to dance" {OHH!!!}
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib, then I'll might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you GOTTA blow
Befo' you make it big, theres just one thing that I gotta know

[Interlude: sped-up Chuck D. sample]
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?
HOW - LOW - CAN YOU GO? HOW - LOW, CAN YOU GO?

[Chorus: Shawnna] (Luda)
I can go looooooow (Go low), lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go loow), l-l-l-lower than you know
Go looooooow (Go looow), l-l-l-lower than you know

[Ludacris - Verse 2wo]
I be like knick, knack, patty, wack 
Oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get 
to the center and let a realla nigga take you home?
I can make this show, {STOP} soon as he hear this fo', {POP}
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo', {BLOCK}
(OHHH!!!) Put the needle on the record 
and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
(Oh!!) 'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla) 
and the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate),
I know that very well (I know that very well)
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces (OH!!)
'Cause I think you a superstar, wit a ass like that you GOTTA blow
Befo' you make it big, theres just one thing that I gotta knoooooow...

[Interlude + Chorus]

[Luda - Verse 3hree]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Dont, stop - {GET IT, GET IT}
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me whatchu workin with, Ill show you some of this bank, roll
Yeah you a superstar, there's just one thing I gotta know
So...

[Interlude + Chorus]</pre>
