NOW HE HOPIN ON THE JET HE AIN'T WASTIN NO TIME
TOLD ME ALL EXPENSE PAID ANYPLACE I COULD FIND
HIT THE ISLANDS IN THE WINTER TRICKIN ALL ON HIS DIME

[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks] (Busta Rhymes)

Everybody talk money everybody gonna run

[Verse 6: Papoose] (Busta Rhymes)
(Get low Papoose!) Five boroughs of death, you don't understand
I got New York City in the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist and let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world with a New York Nemesis (TURN IT UP!!)
I GOT STATEN ISLAND ON MY PINKY QUEENS ON MY DUMB DUDE
THE BRONX ON MY MIDDLE FINGER SCREAMIN FUCK YOU
ROCK ICE IN MANHATTAN SO THERE'S THE RING FINGER
YOU KNOW I HAD TO KEEP BROOKLYN ON THE TRIGGER FINGER

[Verse 7: DMX] (Busta Rhymes)
(Get low X!) Swizz is the monster, X is the beast

Stay off the streets, I'm tired of talkin to y'all niggaz
