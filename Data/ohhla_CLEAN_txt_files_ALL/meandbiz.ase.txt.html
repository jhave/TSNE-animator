[Master Ace]
Awww yeah!  Uh, uh huh
One two, microphone check one two
Microphone check one two, mircophone check one two
Tell you what I'm gonna do

On and on and on is how the beat goes
So sell the British Walkers and cut the afros
And dance till the feeling is gone in your toes
I wear shorts in the summer, Timberlands when it snows
Sometimes I like to chill, sometimes I like to mingle
Sometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single
Sexy young slimmy, but not too young, though
That's because Jimmy might end up on death row
Now this here jam is like a special kind of song
It's not too short, but then again it's not too long
I brought someone with me, someone you might know
He's bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe
All the way up to your last hair folicle

[Biz Markie]
Hey hey hey, it's me the diabolical
Yes, y'all and, it's time for me to fall in
To a funky beat to make you have a ball and
Jump, make you move your rump on the floor and like pump
C'mon don't be a chump, I see four and maybe five
Live party people but the rest did not survive
(Why?) They had a cardiac arrest
Now rocking microphones is something I do daily and
Making people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey, and
People just love it when the Biz starts to play
With my (beatboxing), and by the way
Skeezing with a girl is something I get tricky
And I'm the sneaky type to like slip a girl a Mickey
And I live the type of life that's far from affordable
Standing on the corner calling cuties on the portable
Me and Master Ace is FONKY (Word to Miz)
Yo, who is it Ace?  (It's me and the Biz)

	It's me and the Biz  (Repeat 4x)

[Biz Markie]
Yo Ace, I got an, um, question
Excuse me brother, but can you spare a dime?

[Master Ace]
Naw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme
All I need is a groove that's as smooth as a harp and
I'm ready to talk nuff shit like Al Sharpton
I take the stage and engage in a page and
My name is Master Ace and 22 is the age

[Biz Markie]
Yo, I'm the B-I-Z M and, like a lot of women
Bought a new car because the first one was a lemon
Oochie Louie Findy, me and Sexy Cindy
Riding around the block as if I was in the Indy
Everybody pointing cause I am the joint and
They know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z
Sometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life
Should I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife?
And get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5
Shit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive

[Master Ace]
I'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits
So those that used to diss me in the past are having fits
But I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table
Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable
Or a Cuban Link and (Yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!)
So I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin
M-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and
It sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the Wiz
It's me and the Biz

	It's me and the Biz  (Repeat 4x)

[Master Ace]
I'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and
Pulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth
Wilding, styling, this land is my land
(You're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Riker's Island
A slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto
My name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know
You run your rhymes like a horse and force
Extra booty lyrics on the crowd like you're the boss
I think you'd better keep them to yourself
Do it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf
Now I'm going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E
Cause I know you want to see him

[Biz Markie]
Ah one two, one two, this is what I'm gonna do
Keep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo
If anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can
Peace to Marley Marl, Tagedy, and MC Shan
And my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and
The Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and
EPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and
MC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and
The list goes on and on and on and on
I go to Dapper Dan or Bennaton

Hey hey, I got some shoutouts, I know you all bought my new album
I know everybody in Brooklyn bought it
Everybody in Jersey bought it
Everybody in uptown bought it
Eveerybody in Philidelphia and California and Florida bought my new album
I'm Biz Markie, I'm down with my cousin Cool V, TJ Swan, Marley Marl...</pre>
