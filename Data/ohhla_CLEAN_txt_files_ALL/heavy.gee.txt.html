[10 second news intro]

[KRS-One]
That's right, on any beat we sail
Don't put your money on bail, put it on full scale
Ha hah!  Never fail, KRS

I'd rather have a hundred-thousand true heads by me
Than one million of your fake fanatics behind me
I keep it grimey, chase me, you will never find me
I'll take you out in 2 or 3 minutes, you can time me
You the dopest MC?  I leave that ass sizzlin
I'm givin more rhythm than gang rapes in prison
You small time, you ain't a pro; yeah you kick the raw rhyme
But your show and your flow - that's all mine
Oh silly me, if I call on my lyric ability
I'll bring it right straight to your jaw, free delivery
Get with me, now I spit rap
I represent peace and knowledge, but I will contradict that!
Click-a-click clap, you don't wanna battle me
You wanna scat away - I battle Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Wait, let me check the schedule again, Saturday
I think you oughta follow your squad, they ran that-away
These rappers be played out, spaced out, no format
Now why would you place your money on that?
I drop more bars than Sing-Sing, cha-ching!
Real teachers teach real things!
I brings knowledge and skill, you should try to get with it
Challenging knowledge, only means that you're ignorant
With the sword of justice, your throat I'm stickin it
Gossip and scandal?  I don't put my lips in it
Grow up, I'm movin like a U-Haul truck
You all stuck cause you all suck, duck duck buck buck buck
Forget the curb hops, your luck stops
I bring it to your buttocks, with nuff glocks

[Big Pun]
Yo, my squad is honored it like Elijah Muhammed
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but I'm in the rough, listen up
If you ever see me wit the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitchin us, bitchin us
Unofficialness, everything we are star, you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
to either get big, or leave or let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove; cause we all way on top of the shelf
I'm lockin your wealth, with the master keys freeze
Don't try to breeze, I'ma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You gettin closer to death, reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin shit, holdin ya dick
Now what's the problem?  You ain't nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin your guns and runnin the Island
You was't violent, you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthenics
I'm "Dianetics" combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance, kill my appearance, I'm a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it, cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it, if you can't win you better join 'em
I'm head-annointin niggaz like the Holy Gospel
I'm the only vato loco to smoke you wit fire-blowin nostrils
Watch for the toast, when you see it, you better draw yours
Warlords, callin The Giant, it's all yours

[A.G.]
Went from welfare to Bel Air, and hell yeah, I hold heat
With a license to kill like police, so don't sleep
The sun shines, brighter, than any star
Rap terrorist, bomb mics in the name of Allah
Show &amp; A.G. is who we are, forever terror
All I need is 26 letters and 16 bars
I'll be bomb droppin, verses, that be so depth
Searchin for those who co-slept, 'til there's no left
Curious, how we still around, mysterious
Like a dopefiend clean, never touchin the ground
And you knew it when you heard us, I'm fluent with this
MC's wanna serve us, DJ's are mad nervous
But can't hurt us, they get the dick, I be
G.D. for life, roll with D.I., T.C.
Short for D-I, G-G, I-N
Double it, add the Crates, now they lovin it
No need to cover it, let it shine like the sun do
Now who reflect like us?  None do, but still come through
Humble, even when I play with it
Convey it in a way that sounds so dope
You wanna quote and learn to say it
Underdog for life, ain't commercial enough, to be the favorite
I'm trife, I bite when you bark, so save it
He has to be a Master P, imitation
Cause he ain't "bout it" plus he ain't +TRU+
Show &amp; A the same two
Since we first came through, niggaz yellin
Y'all supposed to rock and blow the spot, I said we aim to
If we don't climax we can't blame you
Told shorty ridin shotgun, ain't that true?
It must have hit her off guard, she wasn't ready
Mind was occupied on gettin sweaty, we lay it "Heavy"</pre>
