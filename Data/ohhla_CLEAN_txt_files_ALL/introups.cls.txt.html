[Verse 1 - Classified]
Damn, another migraine
Vision's blurred, eyes' strained
I need another gel cap
'Cause once this headache hits, it's a sure trip to Hell and back
I got too much on my mind
The lifestyle I lead got my health on decline
I ain't as quick thinkin as I once was
Huh, I guess that's what smokin J's and blunts does
Even my freestyle's gettin worse
I'm losin it, can't connect the missin words
And everybody wanna get a verse
But when I say I got no time, they get their feelings hurt
(Daddy), hey, what's up, baby girl?
You're the only thing that make sense in this crazy world
Through all the madness and the sickness
I know that I can look to you for love and forgiveness
What's your momma doin? Oh, she's cookin dinner?
Well daddy gotta write this song, go on and cook it with her
I'll be in soon, soon as I get finished
And tell your mom I'll get the laundry done and do the dishes
But who we kiddin? I can't even do that right
I mean I can, but my mind's stuck on Halflife
I'm tryin to find somebody I can pass the mic
Who got the drive and will make the same sacrifice
I did, and yeah I signed a couple guys
But I guess I didn't do my job, at least in their eyes
I wasted too much time and some dope beats
But it's back to the grind, same old me
The Sun's shinin again, satisfaction
+Oh...Canada+, it just went platinum
I'm hittin plateaus, I never thought my rap flow would hit
And actually makin real cash flow off this shit
Last year, I felt like I was everywhere
They even heard me from Regis and Kelly's chair
The Olympics, the Juno's, I did it
All of this, all from one song, I'll admit it
Am I a one hit wonder? I don't think I am
But the thought crossed my mind and I erased it
And for the video, we asked everybody out and no black people show
then they call me racist
Maestro told me (stay off the message boards Classy)
Huh, but I'm sick of all these rap geeks, talkin out they ass cheeks
Hangin off every word Class speaks, but anyway that's last week
This week, yo I'm about to move out
I just bought a couple acres and built a new house
Shit it feels good to be doin what I love
And those who hate, fuck you, I earned what I got
I use to think that money changed a man
Now I'm thinkin that it changes those around you
A lot of people wanna hang on and drown you
So I gotta watch the people who surround Luke
I know who my friends are (friends are)
It'll reflect in my memoirs (memoirs)
Life's a trip of joy and challenges
I just gotta learn to live it and balance it (balance it ...)</pre>
