[Kendrick Lamar]
I remember, uh
All my uncles, Sir Smokers
on Alondra, in front of our building
They was my heroes

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crackheads
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in, I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some +keys+
This is crack cocaine, I'm Kurt Cobain
and I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you, I'm an I-V
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop
I said an I-V cause when I be
in the studio, I shot a needle in your vein
Take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on a cold turkey, I hate chickens
but I do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at?
Over the Pyrex where my world at

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and that's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Zs on K. Dot? Uh uh, better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eyedrops
I BIG, I 'Pac, you Chris, I +Rock+
That's Pookie on +New Jack+, head-first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that, I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't on +Higher+, +Learning+
There's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track it's a Reynolds wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat
You could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, I suppose
This is bigger than life
This is probably everybody Illuminatis
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Aw dude, you about to fucking O.D. bro</pre>
