Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You like the way I dance, don't ya?
You like the way I look, don't ya?
You like it when I move closa?
Now I see you lookin, I'm a put on a show

I told her..
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Now you see me lookin, baby put on the show

[Krizz Kaliko]
She smellin' like Dolce &amp; Gabbana
Mama lookin' tasty, Kali a piranha
'Bout to do somethin' bad to somebody' daughter
Thirsty say "Ahhhhh"
Give her more wata
'Cause the way she move is so incredible
Baby lookin' edible
Gotta get at her
Don't know I'm an animal
Hope that she's a cannibal girly fanatic
[?] rosa
She told me come closa
She's lookin' buttered up so I need to be the toasta (Ah-hah...)

Looky, looky, looky
I gave her a smile so she thinkin' I'm a rookie
Abra cadabra, I had to have her with me
Now she live with me? free
Her momma told her..

Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Now you see me lookin, baby put on the show

You like the way I dance, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like the way I look, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like it when I move closa? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
Now I see you lookin, I'm a put on a show

[Krizz Kaliko]
I call her boom BOOOOM!
'Cause in her trunk she got a speaker box
I hear her loud and clear, look at what we've got here
It must be somethin' in the drink I've sipped on
I blame it on the Patron 'cause I won't leave her alone
Wonder if you get her in the sack, will she still do it like that?
Wonder if you pull her off the dance floor, will she dance like a stripper some more?
I told her..

Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Now you see me lookin, baby put on the show

You like the way I dance, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like the way I look, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like it when I move closa? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
Now I see you lookin, I'm a put on a show

[Irv Da Phenom]
Phe-nom!
She got it, she got it, she ready to go!
The way she, bouncing it fast and then winding it slow
If she did, this on the pole she would get all my dough
And I don't, usually dance but I'm gon' hit the floor

'Cause girl I'm diggin' that thang behind ya, that thang behind ya
E'ry nigga in the club wanna stand behind ya
Girl I came to find ya, and aim to slide ya
Back to the crib so I could put my thing inside ya, uh!
My bad if I talk a little slick, I ain't tryna be rude I'm just nasty baby
Plus the way that you do the things you do when you make your booty move's fantastic baby
That's it baby
Keep on bouncin' that thang like it's a bad check
And I keep buildin' up interest like a CD that ain't cashed yet

You off the chain, momma
It ain't a game, momma
Lookin' like a centerfold
Pose for the frame, momma
Dip with it then hit the splits
You know you comin' with it girl
The way you dance ridiculous
Don't stop, get it, get it girl

Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Gi-gi-gi-gi-gi-girl, get it girl. (Uh huh)
Now you see me lookin, baby put on the show

You like the way I dance, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like the way I look, don't ya? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
You like it when I move closa? (Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh!)
Now I see you lookin, I'm a put on a show</pre>
