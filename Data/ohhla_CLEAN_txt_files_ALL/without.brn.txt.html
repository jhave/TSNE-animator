[Intro]
Hoh
Boy can you slow down for a minute
Hoh yeah
I just wanna talk to you baby baby
And let you know what I'm thinking

[Verse 1]
Oh please
Boy I'm done with all the lying
Oh when I said I didn't need you
Boy you know I was just fronting
Fronting oh yaa

But somewhere along the line I lost my way
And I made you pay for the mistakes he made
And I'm sorry baby
Cause it shouldn't be that way

[Chorus]
Hoh oh boy
I really need you
(Yes I do)
I need you in my life
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
Oh no I'm nothing without you
(Without you)
Baby please
I gotta have you
(You)
Without you I just ain't right
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
I don't know what I would do

[Verse 2]
Oh ooh ah boy
I never meant to put you down
You're so much better than that
(Yes you are)
Don't wanna be who I was before
I wanna give you so much more

But somewhere along the line I lost my way
And I made you pay for the mistakes he made
And I'm sorry baby
Cause it shouldn't be that way

[Chorus]
Hoh oh boy
I really need you
(Yes I do)
I need you in my life
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
Oh boy I'm nothing without you
(Without you)
Baby please
I gotta have you
(You)
Without you in my life
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
Oh boy I'm nothing without you ooh ooh
Yeah eh e yeah

[Bridge]
I'm laying it on the line
No more games no more fighting
It's not fair to take it out on you
Oh I'm done hanging my baggage all over your head
Yeah so I'm a let you go
Just thought I should let you know

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh ooh boy
I really need you
(Yes I do)
I need you in my life
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
Oh boy I'm nothing without you
(Without you)
Baby please
I gotta have you
(You)
Without you in my life
Cause oh boy I'm nothing
Oh boy I'm nothing
Without you...</pre>
