Turntable metabolism, watercolory words, and the visions
Respect original graf writer modern day mathematical pattern detracts biters
Hardcore hip-hop in its purest form, only real b-boys can weather the storm
And I'm a b-boy chillin in my b-boy stance
I'm lookin for a b-girl that wants to breakdance

I like psycho circular, so I got no size
At one with the earth, so I gleam worldwide
I reflect cultural duality
My locality is my spirituality
Key Kool sees through the illusions, natural selections, evolution
Rhyme evolution, get the riot gear
You say where, Visionaries right here

Ha, I love hip-hop
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop
You know, Visionaries always rock the spot
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop

No more cold meth, could lose train of thought
Before you realize, lay down in your cof-
Interview who, style is that new
Pen tag, when we do what we do
Who be da headless horseman, swordsman
Smashin pumpkin, dunkin your nuts
Cock riders block, leave hollow in the touch
Lyrics just oppose, joust if I must

Limp dick, encrypted
Zen bitches so they sayin this is
You missed it, make a fist with your fingers realistically sticky like mystic
Leavin ??? statistics, holistic medicine, jettison
For synthetic remedies, remember these lyrical lacerations
Call the paramedics, know that in my context, no contest
Too complex like Braille to a seeing eye pet

Ha, I love hip-hop
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop
You know, Visionaries always rock the spot
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop

Give a ten-string instrument strung
Refreshing as a ripe plum loses hype one
Put in a page, get no answer
From this freelancer contorted like a breakdancer
All over this place, wait, a mikes in his face
Finishing top five in the human race
No narcotic, just our product rushed to market
Dollars in the bulls-eye, charging red carpet
Ole, here to stay until tribulation or rescue me from eternal damnation
You chasing freedom, then clinch your fist
Put 'em cloud bound so opposition can't miss

Ha, I love hip-hop
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop
You know, Visionaries always rock the spot
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop

Ha, I love hip-hop
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop
You know, Visionaries always rock the spot
I don't give a ... cause I love hip-hop
