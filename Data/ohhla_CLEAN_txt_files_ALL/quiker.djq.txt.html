[re-make of ''Eazier-Said-Than-Dunn'' by Eazy E]

My name is Quik yeah this is true 
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do 
Hardcore yo I could never be soft 
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off 
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme 
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time 
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin 
And if you didnt hear me boy I'll tell you again 
My name is Quik or just call me Q 
But It doesn't really matter to you 
Cause I'm the same person 
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin' 
This is for the radio so I better chill 
They won't play it if I co get ill 
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact 
Because the street is where my heart is at 
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope 
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope 
If the rhyme I'm dispayin' 
And the beat thats playin' 
Yo you could try all day 
and you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W. 
Cause Quik's doin it Compton style 
Thats the city and you say you could get some yo 
It's Quik-er Said Than Dunn. 

[Chorus] Wooooooo! Wooooooo! 

They made it easy for me to get my point across 
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost 
I'm not a role model nore a Dr. Seuss 
But i'm not a gangsta and I'm about to get stupid 
I guess its time for the trama 
With the Q-U-I-K comma 
Now thats drama so pay attention 
By the way I must mention I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare 
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there 
With the Q on the Compton tip 
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip 
Cause I'm a destroyer 
My homie Theo is a dj not a lawyer dope fly employer 
On the (static) thats my station 
To get the money, the women, while we dippin round tha nation 
Boy, Mister Quiks of toys 
I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy 
You must be sick or ya lonely 
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me 
(Dj Quik: Blak Tone) (Blak Tone: What sup) 
Get the gat show 'em where it's at and that's just the sound and next time 
I'm peelin ya cap to let ya know where I'm comin' from 
Quik said it and it shall Be Dunn. 

[Chorus] Wooooooo! Wooooooo! 

Creatin dope jams are the part of the cycle 
Quik-er said than dunn yeah thats the title 
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know 
(M.C. Ren: but would if she's ugly) If she come she a ho 
Don't ask to battle me home boy 
what's that you wanna battle me boy 
ya better be strapped cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin' 
[*gun shots*] now that's what I'm sayin' 
Sevy thought that I was born in '73 
now everybody want's to know the A-G-E 
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed 
had everybody thinkin' I was only 15 
The fellaz would annoy me the ladyz would adore me 
and what was I to do I wishin' nothin' ladies do 
cause the ladiez I luv 'em nice and then soft 
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off 
I'm the real Quikster cause others be fakin' 
tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin' 
sayin' on your records you could get some 
Yo home boy its Quik-er Said Than Dunn.

[Chorus] Wooooooo! Wooooooo!</pre>
