[Ganxta Ridd]
Okay Mang This is how it's going to go down
Ganxta Ridd and Short Khop
We're gonna expand
(sniff)
Ya know
L.A., Chicago, Miami, New York, to the Islands
(sniff)
At 13 fava Game is Brutal We're gonna make moves

[Verse Ganxta Ridd]
I gangsta out the border
With Short Khop strapped the 4 chicken and two coldaz
On a run just to feed our sons and daughtaz
The rich get rich the po' get slaughta'd
Nobody cares it's the new world orda
It aint fair look at all the return soldiaz
They all fucked up in the head when they soba
Rabblin to self thinkin the war is ova
Lets take it back to pulp fiction so you can
Paint a betta pikcha of this conversation
It all started back in 89
Chris Blackwell said come to my Island and sign
Headed to New York for tha progress
We said that the nigga that discovered Bob Marley
You know no woman no cry
But we was out there thinkin everythang gon be all right
I'm tired but I'm not tired of livin
Just tired of the bullshit this industry was givin
I'm not the first to complain
I'm just the first to say fuck yall in every which way
I love the music guess the music didnt love me
Oscilatin champs we been bangin since the 80's
If I should die tell the judge just to blame me
I stay a rida aint nobody gonna save me
Starz peneltonz and bandanaz
Represent the gang bangaz cuss words and bad mannaz
I'm smashin 110 on the speed scanna
Fuck the fedz ATF and the chicken hammaz

[chorus]
(tell em ganxta) HEATED
Dippin down burgandy west galeez
Please believe it
When they comin to get us (bang at yo own)
Stackin lettaz takin no feddaz
No one can do it betta
When they comin to get us stackin lettaz takin no
fettaz stay (tell em ganxta)
Heated
Dippin down burgandy west galeez
Please believe it
When they comin to get us (bang at yo own)
Stackin lettaz takin no feddaz
No one can do it betta
When they comin to get us stackin lettaz takin no
fettaz stay (tell em ganxta)

[Short Khop]
Short Khop
You can find him on the front line where they was at
Yall stay away from that
Homies still afraid of that all black raida hat
Where the gangstaz at most of yall lay dere
But from daycare to gray hair they say poppa stay there
With all odds against him this that and some
Lose some win some pop knock you miss him
But ya niggaz just ridiculous sick as a niggaz syphilis
And feelin like you spittin puss fuel to the tip of and you been a par
Big homie ive been a nut run around in pony tailz
Chest poked out pants saggin like a skinny nut
Feelin like I'm big as fuck with the biggest nutz
Run up on em get em up I run up on em stick em up
And I aint even need that heated where my sleeve at
Point where you breath at your gulls and yo teeth at
The holes where you see at oh plz believe that

[Chorus]

[Verse Ganxta Ridd]
We headed for the borda
Khop and Gangxta on slot foe tha chicken holdaz
The industry thought we was ova
Premeditated rockin bc powder to Boo Yaa bouldaz
Senorita pass by I say hola
You know the pisa jose with the corka
She took us to the back and I told her
She made a move foe tha doe so we showed her
Heated when they was comin to get me
Cuz imma West side I know the bitch wouldn't let me
I put it right in it when the bitch try to check me
A str8 G rida from the gawtiest states
They come from all around try to test the strength of the unfaded
And a portrait of pain
Blood its war zone and ya people is in it
Yall betta warn home ganxta'z comin to get it you want it
I betcha cant get it blood I still got it when I
Still pop it in you hit it all you bad bitches
Yall takin pictures cuz you feel me
Nuh uh you takin pictures cuz yo feddiez wanna kill me
