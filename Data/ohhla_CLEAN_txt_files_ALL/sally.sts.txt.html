[Daddy-O] I got a (girl named Sally)
[Delite] And she don't score
[Daddy-O] Or eat pork
[Both] With a spoon or fork
[Daddy-O] But I heard that

[Chorus]
(Some people don't like the way
The way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(Some people don't like the way
They way Sally walk)
(Ahem)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)

[Daddy-O]
This story's funny
I met this girl, and she had money
In vast abundance
Goo-goo gobs, I mean redundance
Her eyes were hazel
Her dress was suede, her voice was nasal
I found her so fly
But for the life of me, I didn't know why

[Chorus]

[Delite]
Now here's what took place
Recooed this jam, she rented the space
Nice place to party
But wouldn't you know, it turned out sorry
It's so confusin'
And sometimes I say it's amusin'
The jam was okay
'Til Sally walked in, 'cause just like I say

[Chorus]

Bridge:
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally hit it)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally hit it)
(girl named Sally)
(girl named Sally)
(1-2-3-4 Hit it!)

[Daddy-O]
You know what? She don't live in Manhatten
Bronx, Queens, or the island of Staten
She's a Brooklyn swinga
So fly, every Friday night I might ring her
Telephone, yo D guess what (What?)
She's all alone (So?)
Stoned to the bone
Her shape's full grown
The kind of girl I'd love to own, ya see 'cause

[Chorus]

[Daddy-O]
I'm still with Sally
Paid and now we're both (feelin' Cali)

[Frukwan]
I think I love her
I know that I think highly of her

[Delite]
Believe it or not
I even thought
of tying the knot

[All Three]
She's opened my nose
And I ignore the story that goes:

[Chorus]
