[Will Smith]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - how your mom an' 'em?

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Mr. Nice Guy, relationship advice guy
Liked on the vices, priceless smile
Look at the eyes, got the look
of a survivor, husband, father
Dissed by Eminem but didn't bother him
Yup well he classy
Big Will just did another 20 mill', walk right past he
I'm a nice guy, why y'all harassin me, huh?
On the radio they be over-exaggeratin
So blase with they lies, they be aggravatin me
Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?

[Chorus: Will Smith]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

[Will Smith]
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Will's a nice guy, why he's so nice I'd
let him date my daughter like he was a white guy
Not like the rest, he's a private polite guy
Why, if I were gay on Friday night I'd...
Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Off, girl, better leave me alone
before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?

[Chorus] - 2X
