Yo it's a lot a tension on this dance floor right now
A lot a thugs
A lot a thugettes
A lot a sets
A lot a projects
A lot a hungry people
I can't take this pressure no more
I gotta scream for the people, man

Ay
Ay

[Chorus]

To my killers in the club wit the burners that be screamin out blow
Ain't no need to shoot tonight
To my ladies that be shakin they ass to that Wyclef sound
We gon get in crunk tonight
To my ballers and my ballettes that be comin to the party high style
Y'all better watch y'all jewels tonight
If you smoke like I smoke in your high life everyday
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Yo you don't wanna beef cause if I pull artillery
You and your man'll be sorry
Cause I ain't come for war
I just came to dance
So grab a shorty
Let's party today
You and I know that you can't win
That's why you standin by the bouncer for protection
Clef ain't the one for the testin
You better off steppin before I clay your section
Anyway
Back to the girls that keep it movin
Teflon keep it groovin
We got you in the mood-n
After the club we can take a ride
I got this new G5 on dubs outside
Yo you can call your crew and I can call my crew and we could do this every weekend
Cause if you party like I party dem niggas call 911 everyday
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

[Chorus]

If you ain't from my hood you get robbed like every day
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, anyway
Now the night is through girl what you wanna do
Like Bubba Sparxxx let's get ugly
You and I know that you want this
So tell your girls follow us in they Lexus
Back to the Delano, the W, the Sheraton, the Mondrian
It's the after party
If you drink like I drink then you drunk like everyday
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Ay yo, Clef, pass dem keys dog
You toe down, baby
Ay
Ay

[Chorus]

If you smoke like I smoke then you high like everyday
I'm talkin bout Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday</pre>
