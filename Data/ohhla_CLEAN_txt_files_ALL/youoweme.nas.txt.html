[Nas]
Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty
Shorty, what up, huh?
Come on

1 - 	[Ginuwine]
	Shorty, say what's your price
	Just to back it up
	You can hold my ice
	Now let's say you owe me something

 	[Nas]
	Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
	Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
	Pay me back when you shake it like that girl

2 -  	[Ginuwine]
	Shorty, say what's your price 
	Just to back it up
	You can hold my ice
	Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 	[Nas]
 	Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
	Owe me back like its money I spent
	Pay me back when you shake it again

The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

Repeat 1

3 -   	[Ginuwine]
	Shorty, say what's your price 
	Just to back it up
	You can hold my ice
	Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 	[Nas]
	Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
	Owe me back like its money I lent
	Pay me back when you shake it again

[Nas]
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Ginuwine] 
I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)
I think you owe me some (You owe me)
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

[Nas]
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

[Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up
(You owe Ginuwine)
You can hold my ice
(You owe Timbaland)
Now let's say you owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh</pre>
