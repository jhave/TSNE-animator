[Prodigy talking]
Aiyyo, you know what I'm saying, yeah
Fuck you bitch-ass niggas you know what I'm saying
Straight like that from the bottom of my heart
Man this is silly 
I ain't got nothing but slugs for you bitch-ass niggas, know what I mean? 
Fuck all y'all niggas, straight like that
What up

[Hook 2x: Bobby Brown](Benzino)
Don't start with me (Benzino, B. Brown, Hangmen 3)
You don't want to see that side of me 
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo, it's war this night and over run up on ya few
Boss niggas dump bullets and get rid of that crew
You gotta bang niggas out
Fuck that shit is serious
Give it to `em niggas, kid show them how real it is
These punk motherfuckers get their head pushed, leds bust
Guns on their friends and they feds dunn yeah dunn
Venalate niggas hear `em out 
Wear niggas out
Get them before they get you
Open up your eyes, true
Look alive, dunn its not a game
Its not thing for you to get body
Thats why we don't play
So where the bags for the fuck back
Before I squeeze more shots and murder more bastards

[Hook 2x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me 
You don't want to see that side of me 
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Benzino]
Yo, swing that, mince that, double bogie, hit that
Big gat, tiger money, holdin one, get that
Forty-cal go and get your burns, spit that
Bring beef where your motherfucking cribs at
Shove knives in your chest where your ribs at
Get money with my Hangmen, split that
Come thick when we show those guns
Doing 1-6-0 on the Autobahn
Ride all night drink cris til dawn
Tonight we don't care, right from wrong
Anybody wanna kick the same old song
Bitch-ass niggas won't last too long, motherfucker

[Hook 2x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me 
You don't want to see that side of me 
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me

[Bobby Brown] 
Meet you overnight
Rest now thats tomorrow
My projects thorough
Tribes with Made Men, now you know
No matter what happened in the barium rocks
Still remain with my pistol in my palm cocked
God damn, country, all shit is sick
Cause shit ain't but a bag full of fucking tricks
Addition and money in my pocket
So I'm a dip into my bag and grab my motherfucking clip
Then I'm a break out the door cause I'm mad like fuck
And I'm pissed off and like get your ass and stick you up
No hold barred and its time to get paid over
I'm broke, ain't nuttin funny I need money

[Bobby Brown &amp; Benzino] (Bobby Brown)
Fuckers want to try and change the game (I did that)
Try throw dirt on my name (You got that)
Storm them for their fortune and fame (You want that)
Twenty karats on my neck, wrist and brain (I flaunt that)

[Hook 6x: Bobby Brown]
Don't start with me 
You don't want to see that side of me 
I don't really care how hard ya be
I just know you don't want a war with me
So don't fuck with me</pre>
