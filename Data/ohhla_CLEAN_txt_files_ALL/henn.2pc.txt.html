Hahah! Yeah nigga fuck that gin &amp; juice (Hennessy)
Just pour me a glass of that dark shit
That's right
[Obie] Ay pour me some of that too baby!

[Chorus]
[2Pac] They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
[Obie] Yo what's our motherfuckin motto nigga?  Hennessy
[2Pac] They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
[Obie] You know our motherfuckin motto (Hennessy)
[2Pac] Hahaha, y'all niggaz can't fuck with this ol' thug shit
[2Pac] Hennessy

[Obie] That's what you sippin on, now what's your name nigga?
[2Pac] Big ballin-ass nigga named 'Pac

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now I was born in the gutter facin life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
to try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggaz fry
Hey, remember me?  Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me procede
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm tryin to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dyin days
Ain't nuttin wrong with gettin paid, so nigga blaze
Cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin through the streets wearin jewels, breakin niggaz makin moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
when they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

[Chorus]

[Obie] That's what I'm sippin on, now let me tell 'em who I be
[2Pac] Big ballin-ass nigga named Trice

[Verse Two: Obie Trice]
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's West
Troubled child comin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, them niggaz was ballin
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggaz breakin the law
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P-Funk got it pumpin, he had the connects
Threw the sack to his lil' niggaz workin the set
And if you got it you gettin wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit
Detroit niggaz off shit

[2Pac] Robbin niggaz in the do'ways
[Obie] That's right
[2Pac] With my four-four, that's the sure way

And this your road days, "All Eyez on Me"
We was loonie I suppose, you could

[2Pac] Die homie

O. Trice always rep his block
Pass the Henn and that ice, I'm on a track with 'Pac nigga

[Chorus]

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, ay 'Pac, 'Pac, nigga Detroit love you boy
You put it down out here, I mean, y'know
Me and my family, my friends, nigga we ride for you always
"2Pacalypse Now" 'til infinity boy, forever
Shady Records, Afeni Shakur, whattup?  Yeah
Obie Trice, pour out a lil' liquor nigga
