(MC Ren)
I be the one that they be pullin' off that fool on the flow
After we be goin' toe to toe
I holds mine, never do I be talkin' no shit
Cause niggaz that be talkin' that shit, always get it
Punk ass niggaz go face down in a river
Other niggaz deliver, fuck when then buck
They give a damn about you and your mamma
So get the fuck up outta here nigga and take the drama
Back to your set, back to your hood
To your kickin' spot, your street or your block
Your crib or your rest, your mamma's address
Niggaz gives a fuck, still I catch two to the chest
And then it'll be on like some after school shit
Fuck a gun, a got to knuckles sayin' I'm getting one
My niggaz say I clown too much
When I'm layin' phat shit with my nigga hutch

(Cold 187um)
Say what? It's like that nigga
(MC Ren)
Yeah, it's like that nigga
(Cold 187um)
What? It's like that nigga
(MC Ren)
Yeah it's like that nigga
(Cold 187um)
Say what? It's like that nigga
(MC Ren)
You know it's like that nigga
(Cold 187um)[follows this pattern of vocalist]
Let them playa hatin' fools know the real how you feel
It's like that nigga
Yeah, it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
Yeah it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
You know it's like that nigga
Yo, well big Rocc step up and show em why you don't give a fuck

(Bigg Rocc)
So it's on, I told my niggaz to grab the chrome
Fuckin' with Rocc ya catch shots to your dome
Cause I don't give a fuck, that's the feelin'
Scoop up the Villain, it's time to do some motherfuckin' killin'
Cause I be kickin' shit, I'm thinkin' back in the days
When we used to scrap at the Compton Parades
I be throwin' vicious blows like Mike Tyson
Rocc greatest hits, nigga I'm the shit
Make the wrong move, then it's fucked up results
Niggaz can't cope, yo them shots he provoked
Comin' with that G style, make you hoes wild
Got my criminal record locked up in Rockford Files
Hank at the shack, yo I call my Ponderosa
Clockin' mo' dollars than a Cali Stock Broker
You can call me you're all around nigga
I loot, I shoot, if I how I kill a crew
So pass me a hog like a King in the clutch
Fuckin' up shit with my nigga Ren and hutch
And it's like that

Bigg Rocc represent, uh, It's like that nigga
Yeah, it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
Yeah it's like that nigga
Hell yeah, it's like that nigga
Yeah it's like that nigga
So MC Ren make the move to just come again

(MC Ren)
I be that nigga that put Compton on the map
So you bitch made niggaz step the fuck back
My throne is a corner wherever I lay my hat
Police always show up wherever they say I'm at
They say real niggaz don't die but niggaz be dyin' everyday
Them devils be screamin' on niggaz 
And niggaz be actin' like hoes in every way
But I'm a God damn soldier it's my time to rule
Callin' hits like the mafia, nigga from a bar stool
Hit after hit, every record is the same
Still getting mine out here in the rap game
Not a black Caesar, more like a black Pharoh
The gorilla killa devil in a double barrel
Uh, sawed off and hauled off here I come again
Peace to all my people in the pen, cause Ren
Will keep all my shit comin' phat
So whack fools take this it's like that

Yeah, it's like that nigga
Yeah, it's like that nigga
Hell yeah It's like that nigga
Yeah it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
You know it's like that nigga
Yeah, let them playa hatin' fools know the real, how you feel
It's like that nigga
Damn, it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
Yeah it's like that nigga
Say what? It's like that nigga
The shit is like that nigga
So all you bitches better duck 
Cause we really don't give a fuck

In the 95, in the 95
