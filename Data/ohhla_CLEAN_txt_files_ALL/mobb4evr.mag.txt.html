Say Magic bruh, we got the click in here.
We goin represent.

We goin mobb forever nigga we goin mobb forever.
TRU niggas.

Chorus
[C-Murder]
I'm a mobb with my niggas forever
I'm a mobb with my niggas forever
[Magic]
I hope ya niggas feel me......
[C-Murder]
I'm a mobb with my niggas forever
I'm a mobb with my niggas forever
[Magic]
Until you bitches kill me

[Magic]
Been in this motherfuckin game too long to let any nigga get the best of me
Niggas that be testin me never fulfill they destiny
Bustin for the fuck of it so run for cover
Thuggin from the beginning cause I was destined for hustle
Untouchable, a made man
Check the piece on my neck and see I'm a paid man
A TRU nigga, picture I'm on the winning team
Niggas start shiverin soon as No Limit hit the scene
So what you scared for, you niggas acting like you don't know
I brought my whole fuckin click nigga, what the fuck you came for
I'm a ride with ya, or die with ya
Fuck it, we came this far, I ain't leavin without ya
Mr. Magic ain't changable
I rearrange your whole click and make em tameable
Cause I'm a soldier, that's why they put me on the front line
Mr. Magic, the most nutorious of all times nigga

Chorus

[New 9]
Nigga a motherfuckin rhymes you know they bustin shots
I seen it with my own two eyes, never rat to the cops
Tied like dreadlocks, uzi's and glocks are what we pack
Fuck limited straps, I know they comin they got my back
Only bust shots and rhymes with niggas that I fuck with
See some run with this click, these busters cant get with
And if you just met me then forget me, you can't come get me
I ride with niggas and bitches that been with me

[Glock]
It's a million motherfuckers lovin and hate it when we bust
But off your future self and stop when we be up in that blood
I shine on my tank be touched, M-O-B and TRU we trust
All the side ??? all the ready to get that ass bust
I holler why cause I mobb for ever
Type of nigga that get's cloud without spittin the dust
Interriagtion, naaah, never, I ain't missin a one

[KLC]
???? and watch a nigga that I'm hangin with go get em and split em
And if a nigga don't forget em leave em bust wide open
Leave a spot lookin like the red ocean I ain't bullshittin
Head splittin, pass me sound ????, boy written
The Prime's sounds can never be bitten, it was written
And if you really wanna come and try to make that quest
You better have a bulletproof body vest, yes

Chorus

[Magic]
Fiend, it's your turn
[Fiend]
Fiend get his nuts off, No Limit shottie gettin his bust off
Dust off, leave a smoker spinnin my fuck off
Gotta dust off the fingerprints, that can cause evidence
And never catch me hesitant in the process of presidents
I'm a TNT and M-O-B
Mr. F-I-E-N to the D
B-A double D-S to the T
??? the barrel is chrome
Cause your ass ain't makin it home
We goin mobb forever

[Uzi]
I'm a mobb with my niggas no matter the mission
Just point a finger at the picture and I'm a get em this issue
Father forgive me for my sins, but these are my rhymes
And if a nigga fuck with me best believe he's goin die
I'm protected by a mobb of crazy motherfuckers
Who believe in busting shots to protect one another
And if you fuck with one then all fifty goin come
Strapped up, vest tight, ready to murder someone

[TRU Survivors]
Some man in the world got a bullet with my name on it
Willing to die for my niggas, I put my brains on it
Back to back, we goin out in a gunfight
Lord forgive me, If I gotta I'm a die tonight
With my thugs, no love pullin them triggers
Till I see blood face down in the mud with slugs
I'm a mobb

[Melchior]
I'm a mobb with my niggas for eternity
Fuck unity, I hope you motherfuckers feelin me
I'm layin my rules with these TRU niggas
We totin semi automatic triggers
Now step up nigga
We bustin slugs until we go
Strike up the teflon protectin me death for any nigga wanna see us go

[Lil Gotti]
I'm a mobb with my TRU niggas forever
Bustin through stormy weather with nine milla berrettas
Chrome just for the setters
Hard times got me taking drastic measures
I let ya, bitch I bet ya I wet ya
Me and my family we swore we die
Then we die together
And if we rise then we rise together
So we chasing up the bloody cheddar
And I'm a ride with my TRU niggas forever

[C-Murder]
Nigga M-O-B motherfucker, we hard hitters
My whole click has been to jail for drug dealin
We get rowdy and tear the fuckin club up
Cause ain't none of my niggas ever gave a fuck
And uh, we goin ride on our my enemies
Cause only TRU niggas can be a friend of me
And only thug niggas feel my pain
I'm down with M-O-B and I'm TRU to the game
Real niggas don't talk shit
And if you run up wrong boy you might get your wig split
I make moves with my tank dawgs
No Limit soldier for life and to them haters, fuck all yall
Nigga!</pre>
