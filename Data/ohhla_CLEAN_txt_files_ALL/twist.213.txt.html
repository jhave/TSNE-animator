[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! It's the motherfucking 213
Blasting off on your ass
Something funky funtabolous
Can you dig it my bobble?
Check this out one time, woo!

[Chorus - Nate Dogg] (Snoop Dogg)
Since we're talking about it baby
Let me twist ya body like it's supposed to
(Twist something, twist something, twist something)
Stretch ya out and lay you sideways
Pull ya hair and twist ya body ike I'm supposed to
(Twist something, twist something, twist something)

[Snoop Dogg]
We hit the club like whatever's clever
Snoop Dogg without a dime piece? Never ever
Gators for the haters step to being devil real big
like the VIP session shut down
Then I spin on 'em, watch me twist ya bitch
Slugs twist a bitch, nigga watch you sleep in a ditch
Pow-pow boogie to the big bang-bang
Lil' mama wanna swang with the 213 gang (Number one boss playa)
Hefner like Hugh, now she's evidence
Splash the heffer with goo; got to do it
I break a bitch, make a bitch get something
Go out and twist something, come on

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
Twist ya body, baby, kiss me, by the way, you drive me crazy
Ain't nothing else that I can say
Drunk as fuck, smoking a blunt
Trying to focus on what you working with in the front
Certain to set it off, she twurking it for the boss
So positive I can hit, my niggaz is in the house
Can't stop 'til I'm paid bitch, I just can't quit
But look at this, I'm on the same shit, ain't it bitch?
You niggaz talk a lot of shit
but walk a straight line and don't fuck with the clique
Bitch get out my bidness
You won't witness ass niggaz get it twisted
This the wrong shit to get hit with

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg] (Snoop Dogg)
Say hey lil' lady from around the way
No bullshit, there's a party today
We came, it's motherfucking 213
The lights might come on, but we don't leave
Say hey lil' lady why you doing your thang?
Slide over here, let me shoot you some game
Go insane, when hear some music that bangs
We'll get the party started while you're shaking that thang

Nobody.... (nobody, nobody)
Does it better... (213, 213)

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
213
Another classic hit
Yeah woo
Hi-Tek did that
Goodnighty
Hahax
Get at 'em, peace!</pre>
