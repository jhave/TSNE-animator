Song:   Be a Model
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
She was on World Star butt naked
Had to be 18 or older just to check it
She got baby oil on in her bedroom
Bunch of dirty laundry all across her bed dude
The head rude, super dome
She backstage but she ain't no groupie homes
Now you know that's a lie, she ready for whatever
She'll fuck you good and if you pay her, she'll fuck you better
I'm a dog, bitch - can you take a bone
She on Model Mayhem with too much makeup on
Her and a girl, 2 going at once, plural
We in the hotel and I'm making it rain euros
She stop giving me head and said "What's these?"
I said "My bad, bitch. I just came back from overseas."
And while she out here tryna fuck for a buck
I got this other bitch tryna fuck for a truck

[Chorus: x2]
Shawty wanna be a model
She on the internet going full throttle
Shawty wanna be a model
She on the internet going full throttle

[Verse 2]
Bad bitch from Brazil, spoke Portuguese
She might even let you crack her if you worth some cheese
Out in Ibiza, we smoking trees
Ain't paying for that ho pussy, paying that ho to leave
Don't get me misunderstood, yes the pimping is good
Got a bitch in the 'burbs, got a bitch in the hood
Legs up, hit it from the front door
Gave her a encore and she still want more
This bitch talking 'bout take her out to eat on me
My Cali bitches got that EBT, they eat for free
Ain't nothing better than good food and crazy dome
She said fuck that R&amp;B, go throw that Jay-Z on
Long as her hair together, long as her purse is Lou
Nighttime stripper, daytime nursing school
She put her favorite song on and ripped them clothes off
Told her girl to film on the iPhone while she goes off

[Chorus x2]</pre>
