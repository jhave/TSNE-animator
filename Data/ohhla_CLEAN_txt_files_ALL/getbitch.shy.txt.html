[Intro: Shyheim]
Whatyousaying? Why don't we hang?
Need the names for what you gon' get it for

Take 'em for everything they got
Bitch-ass niggaz! Uh, yeah, yeah (BITCH!)

[Shyheim]
He said he hella rich, he ready to flood ya wrist
And take you son some trips, well ge-ge-get it bitch

He said it's all your's, well ge-ge-get it bitch

[IMF Blue Steele]
He said he like ya style, he even like ya child

[Shyheim]
I got a Bentley, sitting on twinkees
Wet mixed with mint leaves, but you can't hit it bitch

[Caniven]
She like the viper chrome, she know I pipe it long
She tried to price her home, but you can't get it bitch

[IMF Blue Steele]
I've got a Benzo sitting on Lorenzo's
With Lambourghini doors, but you can't lift it bitch

[Shyheim]
She said she writing raps, she wanna do a track

[Caniven]
Let's do a video, we got the stripper pole
Right in the studio, well ge-ge-get it bitch

[IMF Blue Steele]
I said "I'll suck ya tit", she said "I'll suck ya dick"
Well I could fuck with this, let's ge-ge-get it bitch
When you bitches get it, don't stop
When you bitches get it, don't stop
When you bitches get it, don't stop, ge-ge-get it bitch
When you bitches get it, don't stop
When you bitches get it, don't stop
When you bitches get it, don't stop, ge-ge-get it bitch
Ya get that money, bitch, get that money, bitch
Get that money, bitch, ge-ge-get it bitch</pre>
