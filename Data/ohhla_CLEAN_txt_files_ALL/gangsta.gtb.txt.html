[Scarface]

They Love me

They say now pass the ganga to the left hand side
filppin in the Range Rover blowing past the one times. 
Hit me with the (whoop whoop)
bubble gum flashing in my rear view
spraying freshener trying to steer too
Throwin out my herbs on the passenger side
Got the windows rolled down, airing out the ride
got a loaded 45 inside
that keep for protection when I'm riding by
My Smith and Wesson got a scope too
and I may have caught a body on it
for those who get just know somebody want it
They only ?????
To know that you ain't done shit
but still you got them haters in your business
I'm paraniod she's blowing my high
and she knew that I was buzzin from the red in my eye
Got my license and my papers, Showed me my picture on The Source
Then what the fuck you stopping me for?
and she said

[Chorus]
Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sata put me down
Now, Ow

[scarface]

So I gave her my cellular number and told her call me up
Beating on my dashboard hot than a fuck
Cause I done chunked a half a square thinkin 5-0 jocking trying to jam me up
I continue on my mission to my Grandma''s house
Hollering at my homeboy who just got out
What's up let's roll
Get you some clothes
Take you to the club so you can get with some hoes.
Lets go
Made to the mall hoes thick
Listenting to Pac saying that's the shit. 
Getting geared when this woman appeared up out the blue
Telling me she like what I do
And the hoe was like

[Chorus]

[Willie-D]

Willie D's rollin on these 
in a drop top A-Z-U-R-E
With the knock, knock banging listening
 to a song my nigga Face singing
Eardurms just a ringing, my homey brining
A couple of honies to the hideaway
we gone fuck these hoes and straight ride away
Gotta pack confirmed tickets get some sleep
we rolling to the Baby Johnson fight a 100 niggas deep
ain't bringing sand to beach
I got my eyes on some freak ass broads
and menage-a-trois
never kiss and tell I keeps em horney as hell
and take my dick inside that pussy put it under a spell
got more mail than the post office let me remind you
don't stare at my diamonds too hard they might blind you
Freaky Deaky, Fready Deaky Deaky
when you see me rolling past all you got to do is ask

[Chorus X3]</pre>
