Yeah
Word
No doubt
Yo... yo...

Verse One: Ghostface

Wally champ so amazin, the suede shoelacin
up in the Sheraton, just got hit for five years probation
I got a dental appointment at two o'clock there go my gold ring
Much later catch a flick or go hoeing
Yo there's somethin heavy on my mind from last night's crime
Spoonface shot Gel in the back with Kiv's nine
It was two men, tighter than a hiker with Tims
Like blood brothers, problem was they lust each other woman
For instance, Gel seen Spoon in DeMoore
He wet his whiz(tle), got his seed an headin towards the door
They came out of eye, face to face, they embraced
Gel blew a kiss and looked Spoon girl in the face
Her face lit up, and grinned with a smile like what?
That sneaky f--k, same bitch that got my man hit up
Out in Brownsville, where the thug life live to kill
Where bodies is worth two for five cause it's real
Fast life...

        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know

Verse Two: Andre Rison

Yo my man got more power than gunpowder with ammunition
Blowin up the fireworks and the n----z ambitions
On the come up, she gettin done up, behind closed doors
Doin freaky s--t, on elevator floors
I want her, like Sonny wanted Cher
She was his diamond piece, sex wasn't for lease
Rest in peace, somebody came up deceased
R.I.P. on that grave of the slave of infatuated ways
God couldn't save
F-A-K-E, L-O-V-E
Fake love you see
Never lasting through eternity
Living life in the fast lane
The fast life... it's the fast life
Fast life

        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know 
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast life, that's the only thing I know
        Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
        Fast Life, that's the only life I know
