[Talking]
Shoutout to Fam-Lay
Ughhhhhh

[Chorus]
When you think of boss niggas think of me
Cause if there's a stressin ain't no question at his side (spitta)
Altough I conceal my identity
Beneath the Louie V. scarf, niggas only see my eyes
They know that nigga stuntin
He be gettin money
They know that nigga ballin
The hoes he all fuckin
They know that nigga famous
They know that nigga blingin
And they know the niggas I be with is too dangerous (fly society)
Ughhhh

[Verse 1]
Nigga skip all the bull shit
Red and black jordan number 1's, I'm on my bulls shit
Hustle like grocery carts, you push it
Nigga spend good money on it if it's good shit
I'm on the set with young roddy on this hood shit
Chillin like a villain, hope the popo don't ruin it
Chicks dig what I spit, tell me to keep doin it
Chicks whipped by the dick, want me to keep doin it
Can't get what I get, I cop kicks numerous
Limited editions, spitta shop for exclusiveness
Fuck fuckin with fuck boys and they fuckin foolishness
Got ya homies watchin ya back like a big booty bitch
Cause ya can't maneuver the mat without losin it
Jack boys screamin on ya, makin ya move ya shit
I might see two, but they don't reach in my cooler slick
Try to catch a cold, ya catch an uzi clip
Yeaaaaaa

[Chorus]
When you think of boss niggas think of me
Cause if there's a stressin ain't no question at his side (spitta)
Altough I conceal my identity
Beneath the Louie V. scarf, niggas only see my eyes
They know that nigga stuntin
He be gettin money
They know that nigga ballin
The hoes he off fuckin
They know that nigga famous
They know that nigga blingin
And they know the niggas I be with is too dangerous
Ughhhh

There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
Spitter spitta
Ughhhh

[Verse 2]
The band on my watch is ceramic
Bezzle got the same rocks that dropped the titanic
People talk about him, word of mouth is gigantic
Rappers gettin worried, they just startin to panic
Hope ya didn't blow ya advance, you better manage
The few cents you got left, cause that's ya last chips
Hot spitta no longer next, I am the present
Ya girl ask santa for me, cause I'm her present
Telescope on the balcony, watching the planets
Telephone ringin, I'm too high to answer it
Tell my homie bring me a pack of them ziz zags'
Gonna be a high time like the fuckin magazine
If ya song wack, I'll heal the cut, I'm bandaged
Cluckers say one time, and the dope boys vanished
Like the joint I'm smokin right now, after the last hit
I'm toasted like a quiznos sandwich
Spitta

[Chorus]
When you think of boss niggas think of me
Cause if there's a stressin ain't no question at his side (spitta)
Altough I conceal my identity
Beneath the Louie V. scarf, niggas only see my eyes
They know that nigga stuntin
He be gettin money
They know that nigga ballin
The hoes he off fuckin
They know that nigga famous
They know that nigga blingin
And they know the niggas I be with is too dangerous
Ughhhh

There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
There go the airplane... schwooosh...
Uh uh ughhhh [echoes]</pre>
