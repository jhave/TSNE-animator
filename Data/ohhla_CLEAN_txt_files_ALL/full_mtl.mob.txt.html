Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A$AP- Guess who just came up
From the land of milk and honey, where the thing bust
Spray the mac 11 till a nigga sprang up
And it's snakes in the grass but the bitch ain't cut
That lean nÄô that tussin be up in my cup
Slanging that drugs, there's no stretching no cut
Four gold chains, same color was the slugs
And a chain with a plate saying "Don't give a fuck"

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I be on that block, be on that stoop trying to get cash for the coop
Get cash for the coop, got Da$h in the loop
Might spaz on your troop cause that's what I do
More Fashionable with a bad bitch or two
All of my tools, all of my jewels, man I'm awfully cool
All of these dudes watching all of our moves, I'm off'n these fools

[Verse 3: Da$h]
Henny in my cup, half a blunt in my jaws
Said fuck court, now I'm running from the law
Paid the attorney, I give a fuck about the charge
Think the ho's Matlock, way to get a nigga off
Feeling like Kurt Cobain, black bitch love cocaine
Learn my tricks from the dope game
Young and high die trying to get rich
R. Kelly really think that I can fly in this bitch?

[Verse 4: A$AP Ant]
Blow in her nose got crack on the stove
House full of girls, who know my flow
Real ass nigga keep the burner in my draws
Pussy ass niggas get the full clip yall
Rich ass nigga house got 8 dogs
2 Times Four Broads thats 8 broads
Fly young nigga with the Black Scale on
She loving my music, she singing my songs

[Verse 5: A$AP Ferg]
Bam, get Halle Berry when I spray them
Dump em in the garbage I would "Losing Issiah" em, "ah damn"
Young Fergy turn into a satan, got you laying dead motherfucker
Better say your prayers, AK them
Braaap In that dirt you be laying
Mama got me crying, won't you hear that preacher singing
He be singing like, welcome to the crossroads
Bang them, pull the trigger, middle finger when you hear them shots spraying

[Verse 6: A$AP Nast]
Just bought new shoes, that's Prada
New crib out in Cali smoking maui with my niggas, like I oughta
ASAP remember that, now my niggas about to blow, like propane
Yeah I talk about raf like I talk about rap but it's only cause I'm flossing
Take it up another notch
See they like our sound, it's so amazing
They say it costs to be the boss, we done earned our spot
Ya'll niggas tryna take it
Jock a little bit of steez from the set, but it's cool
Probably thought I wouldn't say shit
It's a recession in the hood, I ain't going back home
Every dollar, I'mma make it
Won't stop 'til we ball like the Lakers, bitch </pre>
