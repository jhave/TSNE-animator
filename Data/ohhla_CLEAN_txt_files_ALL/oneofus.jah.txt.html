(One of us) Yeah, Rule
(One uf us) Yeah, nigga
If God were one of us
(One of us) What about that?
What if he was?
What if he was me?
(One of us) What the fuck would I do?

Lord, when I die pacify, crucify me
I rock a Devil cross, one's for the soul one's for the body
If I'm built then God dies, I wanna see God cry
Real tears from a burned out life in ten years
I sware I got the Devil in me, with no fear
If I hear I can't see, if I see I can't hear
It's the eerie little thing between deathness and blindness
Weakness and kindness, rejects and primaz
I'm on this when I'm hollerin', "Dear Lord, take me" (One of us) 
(Baby) 'Cuz I ain't really happy here, can you blame me?
This game done changed me, made me an animal
I can't even laugh no more, my kids smile for me now
I'm the one-and-only, my momma's only child
Lord, save me before I go crazy
'Cuz if you, live through the strain 
just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

[Chorus]
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he sin and love to lie? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he freakin' live his life? I wanna know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he use his name in vain? I need to know
If God were one of us (One of us)
Would he believe that he could breathe again?

Yo, yo
Now let's look at things through my right hand
What if you was that man?
Would you run wit me? Gun wit me?
Would you understand the husstlin', the struggeling
Live amongst dope heads, raisin' your kids and runnin' from the Feds
We'd be bound to bump heads, 'cuz you livin' my life
All righteous, and you said livin' righteous was right
But there's two sides to life - one dark, one light
If you lighten up forever you can dig to the night
Wrap them guns over there, and bring 'em on ova' here (One of us)
'Cuz my God is bigger down your god down here
Now we ride jet sled baby, bubble in Ba-Namb
'Cuz Rule and the Lord got it goin' on
Been, known to do bad shit, I'm so heavenly, but so devilish
If, you, live through the strain just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

[Chorus]

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yo
Let's trade places, Rule be Spirit, God be flesh
And let's see just how, weak the flesh gets
Now you call on me, "Every night bend your knee"
Until your start to realize I ain't answerin'
Now you hang up the phone, Lord, pick up the chrome, Lord
Can I blame you, Lord, for needin'a feed what's yours?
Got a wife that you love, yet you still lust whores
And I'm supposted to judge you, on earth where it's ugly
You might as well aim at the sky, slug me (One of us)
'Cuz I ain't bein' a Fair God, when life is so hard
I know what'chu goin' through, every move you make
Every crime committed every little mistake
I still got love for ya, fair is fair
As long as you repent you'll be good up here (Baby)
'Cuz if you, live through the strain 
just to die from the pain, tell me
Would you believe that you could breathe again?

[Chorus x4]

Yeah, uhh
Yeah, uhh, yeah, c'mon, tell me
Uhh, man, c'mon tell me
One of us, heheahah
If God were one of us

Would he believe that he could breathe again?
