Song:   Get Your Groove On 
Typed by: dalyricalmaster@tupac.com

(Chorus) 
This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 
(A-get your groove on)
Come and get your groove on 
(A-get your groove on)

(Pras)
Refugee Camp, uh-huh
Navy Seals, All-stars, come on, come on, come on 

(Pras)
Yo, yo, yo, so you wanna be startin somethin
Not for nothin, but yo, Pras is only good for, steady pumpin 
I go bust I'm inflammable yeah, you disgust me 
Your flow is horrible, see your man gotta carry you
Hyper water balls say no more your words are too cheap 
Too affordable, you incapable of runnin your label
Goin against my crew is very irrational, improbable 
unthinkable, yeah quite impossible
So what's your motive, tell me, what's your agenda?
Try to slide under my name is all proper beginner 
Tackle the crime, run out of time, in the wrong state of the mind 
Is a sign of the time, you was quick like Cower Marie
Type a kid, slowly for what, his birth
I'll drink you like a bloody Mary
Why try, you die, black eye, you rough guys 
Try to light my fire you get burnt with smoke eyes 

(Chorus)
This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
Come and get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
And tell my people that's rowdy bout it 
In the click about it, about it 
Let me see ya scream and shout, a-get your thug on 
(Get your thug on)
Come on and get your thug on (come on, come on, come on)
Everybody come on 

Where you been, on tour, niggas get no dumber
It's scary; I know exactly what you did last summer 
nothin, chilled low (low), do you feel dough? (dough)
I mean that real dough (dough) bitches still real slow (slow)
You got show dough, go in, split that
We'll be gone till November, when y'all niggas get back 
Ah, did y'all ever go, ever flow, guess we'll never know
A lot of cats talk about it, hoes screamin, whether shows

Yo it's crunch time, ya want mine, you hardly know me 
But when we blow, you'll catch them off guard like Kobe 
Now we did star as Rodies, point shamper would not 
Lauryn, we know Tone, with the camper would not 
I'm not Puff, but I can stop, best you know
Test the flow don't do it, be the next to blow
Nigga check your seen my style is fly 
Better get her, I'm on point like, Alan Nigh 

(Chorus)
This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
Come and get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
And tell my people that's rowdy bout it 
In the click about it, about it 
Let me see ya scream and shout, a-get your thug on 
Come on and get your thug on 
(Come on, come on, come on)
Everybody come on

See cats real clever like me bringin the strong 
Had a deal for a year, can't write one song
Been side too long, your advance picked up 
I'm like Kane in 88, I'ma tear sh up 
Spitter, six flows average dudes can't stand me 
I'm nice and ease state, bringin heat like Miami 
You never got to let me flow I still kick it 
Never got to light my six, I still whip it
Tell your chick not to see me no more, I still hit it 
She tossed and committed, player the shot did it 
And Mr. Dibbs in it, then leave it alone 
Watch me floss all night, no, get your own, what

(Chorus)
This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
Come and get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
And tell my people that's rowdy bout it 
In the click about it, about it 
Let me see ya scream and shout, a-get your thug on 
(Get your thug on)
Come on and get your thug on 
Everybody come on

(Pras)
Yo, yo, yo a lot of people thought I left welcome me back like Carter
Play these cats with a vengeance watch them die harder
You play your sound; we'll play our louder
And stop askin me who the hell the baby's father 
Dirty cash countin, my crew never loosin 
Shorty on standby, chief four, jet fuelin 
Who is to say (say), how many AK's (K)
Spread your way, what price you wanna pay?
Prices cut, iced seeds, sprinkle on my Rolo
Triple threat trio, you take us in the Limo, dig
I'm the safest ride I hear, next to the Volvo 
Six double-o while you lacin a Pinto
No one isn't safe, many had, carry ways
I'm fully irate, most ghettos don't want to gate 
We play Grammy's you play Ricki Lake
Baptizin sinners at the Salt Lake City baby 

(Chorus)
This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
Come and get your groove on 
(Get your groove on)
And tell my people that's rowdy bout it 
In the click about it, about it 
Let me see ya scream and shout, a-get your thug on 
(Get your thug on)
Come on and get your thug on (get your thug on)
Everybody come on

(Pras)
Uh, yeah, come on, stop it, stop it 

This goes out to all of y'all females and males 
Without it, with a job, a-get your groove on 

(Pras)
To all-them niggas locked down
All them real niggas nahmean? </pre>
