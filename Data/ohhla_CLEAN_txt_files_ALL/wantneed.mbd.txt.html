[Mac]
What, Mo B. Dick , Mr. Mac.
All I Need, check it.

From the start you was my heart
Cuddle with you in the dark
And at night we light sparks, for the hell of it
And if I'm out if town, you remain cellar bitch
Ya girl saw me with a female, now she jealounous
Look, never let em play you dead nigga like Mac is scandalous
Be real if what you feel is real, when it come to this
I keep it real, so look, chill

[Mo B. Dick]
Girl you are my fantasy
My number one, not two or three
You make me feel like a little boy
At christmas time, playin' wit a brand new toy
Is it real or just a dream
Cause I can't believe your love has captured me
Girl I've never been this deep in love before
And the things you do makes me want you more and more

Chorus
Girl your all I want
Girl your all I need
You'll never be alone
You can count on me
To have you as my own is my fantasy
Cuz girl your all I want
Girl your all I need

What it is, I don't know
Cuz somethin' you did baby opened up my nose
You have your bliss like a woman should
When ever I'm around you baby you make me feel good
I'm so glad that you are mine
Cause a woman like you is so hard to find
My search is over baby cause here you are
I'll be your soldier baby ready to go to war

Chorus

[Mac]
Big Mac, Mo B. Dick.
No Limit Soldier.
Send this spot to all the soldieretts out there.
