[Chorus: U-God]
I'm sorry, Jenny, I made you cry, I tried
I'm sorry, Jenny, all the pain inside, I lied
I'm sorry, Jenny, I made you cry, I tried
I'm sorry, Jenny, for all the pain inside...

[U-God]
We started as friends, you had a boyfriend
I took you from your man, that's the way we began
I didn't think it would come back to me in the end
That wasn't part of the plan, you had my heart in your hands
I guess broken wings, are hard on a man
You ran back to scrams, had me stuck in a jam
I didn't understand, where we went wrong
I tried to block you out, but you call on the phone
I want to, bad to the bone, all to myself, all alone
You sighed on the line, then I heard a dial tone

[Chorus]

[U-God]
Yo, I stayed up so late, just, thinking of you
I wish that I can take back, all the pain we been through
On the path by myself, my back's on the wall
Sometimes I want that I shouldn't have met you at all
I told you if you just, leave the man you was with
I'll take you back in my life, and we'll seek happiness
Then you finally did, I took your heart for a ride
I didn't tell how, I had a chick on the side
It's been a couple of months, in this triangle of love
I didn't realize, she was the one that I want

[Chorus]

[U-God]
Now was I young, was I dumb? Was I wrong?
I had thought we had a special bond
Come back, run, come back, run
I thought we was tight as a blood
What is love? What is love?
