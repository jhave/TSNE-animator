[Verse 1 - J-Live]
Rock with me through the waves on the TV screen
Flash back the dream sequence yo whatever it means
Escape from the present time date and mindstate
Rewind to a clean slate and a full plate
106th where they maintain the wall of fame
Middle School showed me everything before was lame
Girls and basketball, my approach was the same
Couldn't score had no game but had fun playing
Picture being the 12th man on championship teams
From Bucks Tournament down to Asphalt Greens
In between Rufford Towers and Metro North
Struggling without hardships to not go soft
Found what I really wanted but I didn't need
I realized it galvanized my identity
It makes strangers out of old friends and enemies
But gave them brand new reasons to remember me
Especially when...

[Chorus - Pigeon John]
The last sunshine is about to fade
The leaves in the trees turn red and sway
Telling me it's almost yesterday
I just wanna tell you I miss you
Hope and wish you would stay for a little while
It's dark and I can't even see you smile
A cold old man that was once a child
I just want to tell you I miss you

[Verse 2 - Pigeon John]
I miss those days we would skate from Hawthorne to Ingle
Wood under my feet remember every single crack
In the concrete makes my neck tingle in fact
This track gotta a nigga thinking way back in time
Way before I made a dime out of writing a rhyme
Go to Magic Mountain and cut in all the lines
Getting numbers let's see who got the most and find
It wasn't me but the brother named B and we
Would love to sneak in movies for free
Watching Goonies ducking low in our seats
Then hit the streets on our skateboards again the Summer never ended
A skin hit the wind the young and the splendid
7-11 heavenly parking lot laughs in the night
Grinning and spending time with the bitty that I liked/loved
Hot chocolate, Denny's in the twilight buzz
Waiting for your train to arrive cause

[Chorus]
The last sunshine is about to fade
The leaves in the trees turn red and sway
Telling me it's almost yesterday
I just wanna tell you I miss you
Hope and wish you would stay for a little while
It's dark and I can't even see you smile
A cold old man that was once a child
I just want to tell you I miss you

[Verse 3 - Pigeon John]
Shots rang out in the night we stood still
Found out it was just a car then chilled
Hated going to the liquor store for some milk
Cause the Bloods in '88 stayed hot like grills
I miss the simple and plain, my very first kiss
Stained with pangs I reminisce about my innocence changed
On my first tour gazing out my window in the rain
Sparked a flame and my heart was the propane

[Verse 4 - J-Live]
I remember so called friends calling me out like Paul Simon
To fighthing with fools for mispronouncing my name
To making my own niche in this rap game
To thinking that this is something that's never gonna change
Simultaneous riding the chain riding the train
Wondering when I'm gonna stay above ground for a change
Not enough knowing that I'm never gonna beg for a change
Doing my thing I need more to just maintain or stay the same when...

[Chorus]
The last sunshine is about to fade
The leaves in the trees turn red and sway
Telling me it's almost yesterday
I just wanna tell you I miss you
Hope and wish you would stay for a little while
It's dark and I can't even see you smile
A cold old man that was once a child
I just want to tell you I miss you

I just want to tell you I miss you
I just want to tell you...</pre>
