[Intro: Dr. Dre as The Vice President]
Gentlemen!! ~ We have a problem 
That hath the potential; to become a very serious problem!
The Eastcoast and Westcoast seperation
Is exactly the weapon our enemies need to destroy our empire (*Echoes*)
So what we need to do! ~ is bring together
Some of the biggest, strongest and smartest fustiest in the millennium
And this will be the begining of The Aftermath! (*Echoes*)

[Duet chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan

[Interlude #1: RBX]
The Mighty mighty Aftermath, hath now just forced to rise
Ha ha ha ha ha, indeed, indeed

[Verse One: RBX]
While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts 
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti
And this one is a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyata driven
True and living, driving with the gat
Uhh.. pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush whack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diesel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic
The Aftermath

[Duet chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust this shit, let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsack, yo, I stay focused
Beefing without skills seeking will only weaken
The artist speaking over beats and.. you be cheating
Cause half of these non-talent rappers 
Claiming a coast over instrumentals
And got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher Hip-Hopping you correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to attempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rapping causing lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Cause your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion, weak metaphoric style you be using
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out your mouth
What you think this is? ~ KRS-One from the Bronx kid!

[Interlude #2: Dr. Dre] 
Paranoidly giggling

[Duet chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan

[Interlude #3: Quote from unknown movie]
Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constitutional rights had been suspended

[Verse Three: B-Real]
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast tripping going on through out the business
East Coast/West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from, I'ma Killa, Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool, I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my glock
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killing in the highrise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them Rap niggaz, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggaz bringing the skill
Mad caps get peeled, if you opposed the Hill

[Interlude #4: RBX]
Yeah, that's right fool, you know who 
The mighty Group Therapy, the mighty mighty Aftermath brigade
Letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!

[Duet chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan

[Verse Forth: Nas]
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on, running your spot, hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, are merging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatching whores up, my flow's up
When the fucking world blows up (*Explosion*)
Throw your hands up, it's a holdup
Fronting like you down for the real; to make a meal
But when plan fold, nigga, you squeal like Heavy Heel 

[RBX:] Kill that Noise!! 
[Nas:] But what's the fucking deal?
[Real] Anybody killer!!

[Duet chorus: Dr. Dre &amp; Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
KILL THAT NOISE!! ---&gt; MC Shan
