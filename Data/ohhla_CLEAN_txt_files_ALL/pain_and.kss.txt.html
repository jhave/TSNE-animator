(Intro)
Yeah niggas! HAHAHA HEEE!!
So this is what it all boils down to huh? HUH?
This is what it comes to huh? HUH?
PLAYOFFS!?!
Yo Poofs fuck that we back baby

[Jadakiss]
I ain't ask you to fear it
Mandatory you think about it after you hear it
And it's the evil that's gon' make you have to compare it
You know me I swing back thru it
See who got hit after I air it
But it ain't about shit
Niggas mumble about my outfits
But I'm humble, I keep my mouth shut
Lacin' em well, it was destined for Jason to sell
I can make you a reservation to hell
Then blow you out of the water
I'm out of your order
Me versus any rapper is slaughter
Somethin' like a poet and a author
The only difference is that I make slick talk wit pain &amp; torture

(Hook) 2x
One false move will cost ya
These lames will cross ya
Don't let the game extort ya
Try to learn from what the game has taught ya
I'm the author of slick talk, pain &amp; torture

[Jadakiss]
Yo, I'ma take the responsibility for bring it back
They rappin' wit hostility meanin' they wack
But then again I feel 'em
Knowin' that they up against a nigga just like myself that'll kill 'em
Gotta spend a buck at the dealer for suede ceilings
Lotta bodies drop because of betrayed feelings
What other rappers you know made it and stayed dealin'?
Smart niggas just felt back and they save millions
These are pedestrian bars for the civilians
Shoes is Italian, handgun Brazilian
Open it up and see what Kiss brought ya
Slick talk, pain &amp; torture

(Hook) 2x

[Jadakiss]
Yo, I flip words around sorta like birds and pounds
Rub shoulders in the industry wit nerds and clowns
Give it to whoeva deserve the rounds
Hollow tips move organs and nerves around
Get money, fuck riffin'
I'm definitely cut different, I twist hunnies, puff piffin'
Get my insight from an OG wit a good job and all that but he loves sniffin'
Shit talker, Playboy British Walker
Rappers be home like "God, please get 'em off us"
After the sunshine it gets darker
Yeah, slick talk, pain &amp; torture

(Hook) 2x</pre>
