[Chorus: J.V.] 
We Got, 
Mo' hoes (mo' hoes) mo' dank (mo' dank) 
Mo' cheese in the bank, mo' rank 
My dawgs on dubs, yours aint 
My dawgs do whateva, yours cain't 

[J.V.] 
That's right (that's right) that's us 
Trina, JV, Trina, Tre+ 
Hit the club, slide through on dubs 
Back to back ride through like what 
Still goin, po'in hennessey 
The best thing showin, blowin, remember me? 
J to the dot straight to the top 
We the shit for real other niggas play hot 

[Money Mark] 
To all the young hoes, I love ya fo' 
Who let me take 'em to the house, get 'em loose, let 'em go 
On the ??? so I guess I gotta love 'em though 
But I'm a P i m p, so you know I dont love these hoes 
And I, don't see 'em, (don't see 'em), won't be 'em 
Won't be buyin' no hoes Benz's or Benz 
No mo' diggin in Money Mark ??? 
I'm a Slip-N-Slide nigga and i straight dont see 'em 

[Chorus 2X] 

[Trick Daddy] 
Yo T-double D doin' amazing thangs 
And have you bitches around sayin', Why you say them things? 
Cuz I'm a T-H-U double G-G 
Wherever I go, you bitches you love me 
Whether an LP, uh, a remix 
The only thing I'm a spit is G' shit 
Specialize in fuckin' and gettin' head 
??? wanna pay for riches for head 
Of a, ass hoe, that mack hoe 
The truth of the matter fact, a slapped hoe 
Beaten back ??? and hoodrat hoes 
I like them slim and po' 
No fat hoes 
If I, had a penny for every bitch I get 
I'd be a young raw nigga with a platinum dick 
Ride around town with the platinum shit 
Spittin' all these gangsta platinum hits 

[Chorus 2X] 

[Trina] 
Ms. Trina, Ms. Drama 
Diamond princesses got the mama 
Stacken that bread, plenty dolla's 
Drop it, pop it, Fendi colla's 
Chart toppin', hit droppin' 
Ain't no stoppin' the champane from poppin' 
I'm finna bring a Grammy home to Miami 
Purple see ok, drop candy 
Twenty Inches, dipped in the chrome 
Lil mama thick to the bone 
When the last time you seen a bitch like this 
Come into the game and get rich like this 
A bitch that make hit after hit like this 
Icy from a anklet to the wrist with 
Mo' mansions, mo' yachts 
Slip-N-Slide got the bottom on lock 

[Chorus 2X] </pre>
