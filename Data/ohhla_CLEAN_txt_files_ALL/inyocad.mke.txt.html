I'm jammin' SwishaHouse and Big Wheel inside my cadillac
I'm grippin' wood in my fleetwood wit my Tv's fall flat
I gotta DTS, DHS, and a couple of ESV's
I got 22's crawlin' on all cars and SUV's
I'm Mike Jones, who? - Mike Jones, Jones
They stay grindin' and stay shinin' in that cadillac on chrome
I hit the boulevard lookin' like a mack
Jammin' screw in my cadillac
Trunk blew, tipped cracked hate to do it but it's like that
I payed the cost to be the boss
so now I shine when I floss
I put 5,000 in my mouth
the next to blow up down south
Who Mike Jones comin' soon
Just bought a lac off show-room floor
Lettin' you know I'm the realest on this hoe
281-330-8004, that's my cellphone number hit me up on the low
My album, Who Is Mike Jones? comin' soon
