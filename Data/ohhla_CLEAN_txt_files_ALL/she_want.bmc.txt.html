She say she wanna it's the remix
She say she wanna it's the remix

[Chorus]
So she say she wanna thug (say she wanna thug)
Cause her man ain't beatin it up (cause her man ain't beatin it up)
So I'm a come and put it down (I'm a come and put it down)
Get your body wen no one's around (wen no one's around)
So she say she wanna thug (say she wanna thug)
Cause her man ain't beatin it up (cause her man ain't beatin it up)
So I'm a come and put it down (I'm a come and put it down)
Get your body wen no one's around (wen no one's around)

[Verse 1]
