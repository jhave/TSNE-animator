[Fat Joe]
Fat Joe, Joe Crack, shit's all the same
Old rusty ass block from which I came
Fat boy big dreams, Mac-10, the vest
When Mac-10 shoot teams try to shoot up the set
But I'm a G nigga, I'll loosen the Tec
Wet the whole block, sip Grey Goose in the jet
Pzhooom... back to the Boogie
Backpack rappers they should have a plaque in the Boogie
of me~!!! You know why? Number one hustler
I opened up the floodgates, my "Flow Joe" customers
{*laughing*} We all about the gunplay
but still take time out to pray every Sunday

[Chorus: various samples scratched]

[Fat Joe]
The watch is sick, the chain is Alaska
Whip so many +P's+ now they callin me the +Master+
UNGHHHH! Thank God for that white
I've been slingin it all day, we cookin it all night
It's on with the don, never let shit slide
Have your ass wear a patch like Slick Rick's side
Talk money, there's so much money, I can't even count
Gotta put it on a scale, ten grand weigh a ounce
Same corner all week, got the scene closed off
Should be draft in the league the way I pass those off
Coca! Now you know it's me
I was always G, you a sometimes thug
You fake hustle in your hustle and you sometimes drug
You ask if a nigga kill yeah I sometimes does, CRACK!

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Primo whattup my nigga, ha ha
We had to touch it again you heard me
"Shit Is Real" you heard me
Shit on these fuck-boys, you heard me?
Thank God for that whiiiiiiiite
Crack! Coca! Krillz-mania
Macho whattup nigga?
(Big L rest in peace...)</pre>
