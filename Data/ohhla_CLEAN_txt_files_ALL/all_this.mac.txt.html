Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And it's all so funny
Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for... worse

I'm looking out the window
The kid's stayin' lit like a Zippo
You hatin' I don't trip bro
It's gravy cause your bitch know
Cup of Henny, I sip slow
The spins, yo
Hit the stage to bust a rhyme call me flip mode
This, that the other rhymer make it happen
Travel all around the country in a station wagon
Take it back you reminiscin' all your favorite classics
My words play more than madlibs
I got plenty lyrics
They got plenty adlibs
Want a holy spirit
My father's on some rap shit
Listenin' to trap, getting high puffin' loud
See some people ridin' by
Come outside say what up
I ain't nothing like a star
I'm chilling, layin' back
Travel round the whole world
Enjoying everywhere I'm at
Meeting different people
Eating different food
No one like a gourmet meal
More than you

We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And it's all so funny
Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for... worse

They feel like they jealous
Everybody be thinkin' that they was cool
Getting money since my mommy was dropping me off at school
Now I got a whip to cruise in
You the Pirates so you losin'
I'm in the news, you let them bring your news in
I bowl strikes you always leavin' a few pins
I do me you keeping up with them new trends
I got fam you worried about makin' new friends
I'm in my pj's you had to wear your suit in
Thinkin' without doing, where, how, why me
Relax myself kick it like Ti chi
You could find me, only where I'm at
There ain't no other me's
They be checkin' on my stats
Hi cat, find them up in a tree
Homie may be spittin' bars they ain't fuckin' with me
I'm just turning up the heat to 100 degrees
Spittin' like I got a razor blade stuck in my teeth

We spending all this money
Spending all this shine
Feeling all this high
Spending all this time
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for
All this money
Spending all this shine
And it's all so funny
Cause it's all just fine
I'm feeling better than ever before
This my life for... better... or for... worse</pre>
