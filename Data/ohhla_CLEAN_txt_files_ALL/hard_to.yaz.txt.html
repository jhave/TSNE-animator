(*talking*)
It ain't as easy as it seem, gon put it down though
Know I'm saying, holding our head up steady getting fed up
19-9-8 Laf-Tex Records, Boss Hog Corleone take one

[Hook: (Big Moe) - 2x]
Man it's so hard, to survive in the game (it's so hard)
When these trials and tribulations, man it's fucking with my brain
If I could rearrange, every damn thang (it's so hard)
My skin is my sins, so this shit'll never change

[Mike D]
They say it's hard but fair, chopped off welfare
Expect us not to sell dope, you tell me what's fair
This judicial system, is modernized slavery
And Uncle Tom niggaz getting pimped, on the daily
Seems to me, why you got the situation under control
But if we stay fed up, we can't hold our head up
Without focus one faith move, and you lose
Feel my blues, cause many niggaz know my shoes
I just ask the Lord, to forgive me of my sins
And when I make it to the gates, make sho' that he deal me in
Reel me in feel me yeah, so I can reunite
With Fat Pat, Michael Price and my boy Pat Lemon
See these niggaz, got the rules of the game all wrong
I'm that Don Corleone, and I'm a hog till I'm gone
Gotta be strong just to hold on, can't fold homes
Through the struggle we got to roll on, on the realer

[Hook - 2x]

[Mike D]
Why everytime a young nigga, trying to have it and shine
Fucked up situations occur, to bring you right back down
That's why I hustle like it's legal, and pray on trying
Stanging my licks out of town, sliding my bricks through Greyhound
See I'm a young self made nigga, out to get it
I'm hungrier than a pit, that been starving a million minutes
To them smidget digit hustlers, pan hustling on the streets
Trying to say they on ass, by bringing cool niggaz heat
But I'ma point you out, cause you's a snitch bitch
And all my G's that's round me, need to know about flow about
Show about, cause you's a fake G
Trying to be something you not, like that boy Mike D
But I be moving on, because it's hard in these streets
And if you don't work, you don't eat
I break concrete, like I split down them ki's on a daily basis
Counting my big faces, going different places

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
See I'm caught up in this game, on my quest for pocket change
Where attitude is the golden rule, if you wanna maintain
My distribution of cocaine, that's getting me worldwide fame
So sit back and let me explain, how I mastered this thang
This dirty game now who's to blame, for all these trials and tribulations
Jealousy and envy, only adds to frustration
Law confrontations plus player hating, and this white man's legislation
Leads to racial segregation, with less of than occupations
More complications ain't gon help, to fulfill my needs
I want it all so I could ball, to contain my greed
Oh yes indeed smoe plenty weed, as I aim to succeed
Gotta have paper mayn, must feed my brother's seed
As you can see it's up to me, to utilize my strategy
And be all I can be, and put it down for P-A-T
Now feel me and see, that I keep up my guards
From the fakes and frauds, and these scandalous broads life is hard
