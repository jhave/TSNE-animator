Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Eve, I like that, you got 'em callin' my name
Oh she bad bad, you know she that bad
Potluck Push, dip your hand in my grab bag
Matte black Benz, perfect for my black ass
Only know who's in it when I open the back half
Hot as a backdraft, they know he on fire
Any nigga deny it, you call his mother a liar
Only hit him with spire, if she like it I buy it
Trynna take her ghetto chic and put her up on designer
She don't fuck with the buyers, all she know is suppliers
How to wash the drug money, hide it under the dryers
Oh she bad bad, so fly she jet lagged
Eve let 'em go, we both know that the best last

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Eve]
Yeah, thats right, Im badder than them
E-V-E, the cataclysm
Blow 'em out the fucking water
Kill em dead, called a slaughter
Aint my fault, I had it built up
Had to get it out my system
Now Im back
Forget about them other chicks, man, you wont miss em
Yeah, E-V-E hungry like a lion
I aint never easy
Never scared, why you tryin'?
Your gimmick make me sicky
What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'
Man, I live up at the top so you keep climbin'
No they can never catch-a
Me, Im the chick that keep em under pressure
And every nigga smell her wanna sex her
They say they won't protect her
But really they just want kiss and caress her
Now sit your ass down
Cause class is now in session

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Juicy J]
Rollin' papers and rollin' swishers
Gettin' high as a light fixture
In the club with a bag of money
Gettin' becky from a white stripper
Watch cold as a igloo, chain cold as a icicle
You might think I'm ballin' out
But this how I live my life, nigga
You say that's your wife, not tonight nigga
I'll go spend a night with her, stick this pipe to her
When she leave she say my name
Juicy J he did his thing
I'm leavin' with her best friend
She know what's up, we trippy mane
She want a hustler on his job, not you foo-foo niggas
She want a hustler on his job, I got [?]
All across the nation, take your chick on vacation
I'm gettin' dome while I'm in a foreign racer

[Chorus]</pre>
