Chorus:

Our world is hopeless, and we have no where to go
Our children are hungry, and we can't feed the poor
Were really hopeless, spread some love before
And love that and hold in
Lord I really miss my friends
Lord please help us

[C-Murder]
Now as I walk through the streets I see many people under pressure
Cause uh life ain't easy and you know this world gon' test ya
My daddy told me C one day you gon' be faced with this problem
And you and only you must find the knowledge to solve it
My momma said Lord gives us tests to measure our faith
And if you really believe in God, then you shall smile on judgement day
Cause at the crossroads ain't no hunger, and every man the same color
And when it's my time to open 'em gates cause uh
I really miss my brother
And you the only man that can judge me
So please guide me to the right direction
And why can't I put this gun up and use my Bible for protection
And it's an everyday struggle, don't expect nothing to change in a week
But Lord help us in this hopeless world
Cause I don't wanna die in the streets

Chorus

[C-Murder]
Now I done been stop shedding tears, now my eyes bleed when they cry
And I never understand why, everybody gotta die
And everything that's born gotta go, and I really think that's a shame
And I'm so tired of reminiscin'
Trying to put a face to a name
You put my grandfather in my life, and then you took him away
Yeah, big daddy used to drink but uh, he gave me a place to stay
And many kids starving overseas, and even right here on my block
My auntie told me in the year 2000 that the world was gon' stop
Now I don't wanna question you Lord, but is violence really the answer
And if not, then how come so many innocent people diein' of the cancer
Now revolations say the world gon' end, but the world ain't over yet
And it's up to us to move on, but in our hearts we'll never forget

Chorus

[C-Murder]
They say God created man, and put man on this earth
And then came woman from there, and from there, there was birth
And ever since Eve gave Adam the apple, the bible's like the spell
And introduced mankind, not only to Heaven, but a place called Hell
Even though we try to repent, it's too many gangstas taking us down
My cousin tried to leave the streets, and now he laying in the ground
And Jesus died for our sins, but I wonder if he wasted his time
Cause it's 1999, and this world is still blind
Now I don't wanna lose my freedom, cause I'm this close to making it big
Now I don't know if I'm a make a difference
But I just wanna be there for my kids
Now that's a hopeless situation, when will it end, I don't know
But Lord help cause your children, ain't got no where else to go
