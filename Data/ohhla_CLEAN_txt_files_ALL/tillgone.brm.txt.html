[Busta Rhymes - talking]
Hey yo, yo ..
Yo, hey, yo, yo ..
Hey yo ..
Hey yo yo

[Chorus # 1 - Male voice]
You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone

[Busta Rhymes]
Hey ya ya yo yo ya ya yo
It was the first sign, on the day of my birth I entered the earth blind
Vulnerable to everythin I would first find
Condition of bein niggaz having the worst mind
Becomin weak like we scavengers of the worst kind
From havin nothin to plot and makin the earth mine, makin the earth mine
That's kinda big aspirations for a nigga thats just kinda got on his first grind
But it's aight cause I'm blowin whole on my first shine
Kinda gas quicker than spaz ready to burst mine
And though it seems like obstacles come at the worst time
Goin from being successful to commitin the worst crimes
So quick like a bitch massagin ya whole dick
And bust a nut, and it's over sabotagin ya own shit
We always good when we get it and then abuse
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it
That's what my mother used to tell me

[Chorus # 2 - Busta Rhymes] (Male voice)
(You don't know what you got until it's ..)
See they ain't knowin though
(They say you don't know what you got until it's gone)
That's what my mother used to always tell me
(You don't know what you got until it's..)
Hey yo I peep that they ain't knowin though
(They say you don't know what you got until it's gone)
That's what my mother used to always tell me

[Busta Rhymes]
See in a flash they could take it from you like hocus pocus
So count your blessings and baby I hope you stay in focus
Wide awake like I'm drinkin them Capuccino Mochas
Takin on more stress and get to becomin smokers
HA, like the shit they setup just straight provoke us
And fall victim to the shit till it stifle and choke us
I promise you'll find the truth when you done diggin it out
Stop the shiverin nigga I think I just figured it out
You see we thug physically and mentally soft
Kept lyin to yourself, so that your worth and your value is lost
Sometime the feelin of the city is wrong
Why we appreciate 'em all now that Tupac and Biggie is gone
Somehow I'm seein it clear
I would have rather this value them just as much when both them niggaz is here
Yeah, we always good when we get it and then abuse it
Then regret it, cause as quick as we get it we fuckin lose it, listen

[Chorus  # 2]

[Busta Rhymes]
Extend your hand for the worried and bless 'em if they need you
Don't ever take life for granted and bite the hand that feeds you
Be cautious how you treat people and how the people feel you
Respect niggaz or else the karma is coming to kill you
You got it good baby, just get your shit together
Before you lose it and it's over and gone forever
Dress for the stormy weather
Feel the songs, for everyone is personal like I was just writin myself a letter
A lot of niggaz be wilin, callin a name
With disrespect, cashin and blightin, throwin salt in the game
I'm sayin, I'm dealin with logic I hope you ain't thinkin I'm rude
But stop ruin the greatest thing thats been given us food
Clothin and shelter when it's cold we be staying warm
Imagine if they just took the music and rap was gone
We always good when we get it and then abuse it
I won't let it cause it's precious and I ain't ready to lose it, listen

[Chorus # 2] - 2X

You don't know what you got until it's ..
They say you don't know what you got until it's gone
(*long pause*)
You don't know what you got until it's gone</pre>
