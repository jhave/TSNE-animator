Aiyyo good morning America, good morning to Erika
Who gave me good head while watching Good Morning America
Good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood lookin for good yay to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always called it good vibes
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a bad guy with the lies what they're liable to try
You know that old sayin, what they say about good guys
I guess that's why I went bad, needed all my chicks bad
Fiends needed hits bad, so they hittin licks bad
Had to get that work off, before that shit went bad
If not it gets bad, and things'll only get bad
So now I'm gettin bad scans, and I got that bad jam
Tellin me them bad sense, songs catch them bad breaks
Caught a bad rate on the whip, with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly and my pain's ugly and my chain's ugly
Things became ugly cause my ugly rugby
got a stain and it's musty, wakin up lookin crusty
And Ms. Thang who's ugly is sayin to me don't touch me
I went from Pretty Willie to pretty silly without the pretty gully
So you know things'll still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly

[Chorus: Consequence]
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
They said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me

[Kanye West]
Good morning to umm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a cent for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
To bust clowns and look for bust downs to bust down
If she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin, she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone, cause she was bad to the bone
She from a badder home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my # to peep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
That new time cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise, she said I ain't bonin you
with them two long shoes, and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So I'ma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said 'Ye, you don't love me?
I told her there was good it's too bad it got ugly

[Chorus: Kanye West]
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me

Aiyyo good morning to Queens, the Northside is my scene
And when it comes down to it I'ma ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but these bills'll make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, 'til a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcin and it's ugly
Now my mindstate is ugly, when blind dates are ugly
And I'm ready turn it up in these streets, and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Ugly's with these sisters that was ugly
And these bitches used to bum me to the point it made me ugly
And say things that was ugly then leave the bar, abruptly
But I took it all back, cause God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin my bad words and say that's a bad burn
I left it on bad terms with a chick with a bad perm
Who case took a bad turn, her face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about the bitch is bad and 'bout it
But the pussy smelled bad so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad luck, our son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad luck
And once you get bad, it be bad for good
And that's bad meanin bad not bad meanin good
But I agree that it's good, when you leave with the goods
It's all good in the hood I call good cause it's good
Now I'm havin some good nights, livin this good life
Got me a good girl that I'ma make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
cause my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came offa good, offa good behavior
Spittin that good game so what's good with this paper
Cause this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly

[Chorus: Consequence]
Aiyyo we showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
They said get your money ain't no tellin they gon' love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, know they really wanna slug me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this is for the hood, you got, to love me</pre>
