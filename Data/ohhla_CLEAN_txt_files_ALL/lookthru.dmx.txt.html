Song:   Look Thru My Eyes
Typed by: Rebel-I-Outlaw@juno.com

Judge not, less you be judged first
Die nigga, die nigga

[Chorus]
Look thru my eyes, see what, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

[DMX]
Burnin in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin, robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', a 129
Up the school street cuz I come through mine
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga
Arf arf arf, get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Then come for the star 
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[DMX]
I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
Cuz I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart cuz it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play raps and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch, didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you get mud
Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

[Chorus]

[DMX]
I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first I'm sold an eight, then told it's not an eight
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, cuz now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy
For real
Arf arf, arf arf arf</pre>
