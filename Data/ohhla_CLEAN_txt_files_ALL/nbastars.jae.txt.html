[Introduction]

(Let's Go) It's the N.B.A!
(YEA) They cheerin for me
(Huh it's me) And now (captain of the team)
(I love you too) (Alright let's go) Startin at
(I love you too!)All 5 positions (ha-ha)
Straight from Harlem N.Y.C
(Lights out for me) it's Jae Millz
Ownin on the beat...it's the N.B.A!
UHUHH!

[Chorus]
We up and down the court
Back and forth
Save the talk for the post-game
It's time to ball
It's the N (n) B (b) A (a)
N (n) B (b) A (a)!!
I'm shootin, I'm dishin
I'm dippin, I'm dunkin!
Nobody lazy on my team
Playa we all runnin
It's the N (n) B (b) A (a)
N (n) B (b) A (a)!!

[Verse 1]
Homie I'm too fast for an instant replay
You gotta freeze that, speed back
The defender ain't even see that
Guardin me is like the ref. tryin to D' Shaq
Or seein a citizen tryin to guard T-Mac
Don't even reach haters
I'm like B. Davis
One dribble (LOOK)
Now I'm past three playas
No matter who you ask (ask)
I'm the main topic
Roll it better than Gerve
Not even Yao can block it
When I'm heatin up
There's no way to stop it
Perform like LeBron

Dribble up stop and pop it
I'm like Jermaine O'Neal
K.B    K.G
Fresh outta high school
Playa don't hate me
Get the roc and switch speed fast like Steve Nash
And get my Jason Kidd on and dish off a sweet pass
And just when you think the lane to the basket is empty
I finish it off with an oop like Finely OH!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I'm tough in the zone
Can nobody stop me? (Nobody)
And I love this game
It's not just recreation or a hobby
No point-guard
But my no-look is swifter than Vlade's
And my young energetic defense is like Omarie's
So don't drive down my lane
Cuz like Artest
I won't just lock you up
I'll rap you in chains
And in offense
Who you gon get to get me
When I'm movin' through the D swiftly
Rainin on 'em like Nowitzki
Droppin trips like Stojakovic
My shot fierce like Paul Pierce
I barely acknowledge picks
Put your best man on me
Put your whole camp on me
I'll leap over your team like Vincanity
Or Shawn Marion cause I be jumpin
But my game is big
Like T.I.M Duncan
My heart is huge like Iverson's
And if you ever guard me, like Marbury
I'm invitin 'em and slicin 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I doubt you find anyone as smooth as this
I'm a Vet like Erving
Whether it's Johnson or Julius
The court is where my heart beat
You can't guard me
I'm a beast on the court
Like Lenny B. and Barkley
If I want I can glide like Clyde
Or drain three's in your eyes
Like Byrd from any side
I could, lace up my sneaks
And leap like Dominique
Or I, could give your team flashbacks
Of Pistol Pete point blank
Gettin the win for my team is the job
That's why, on the court
I'm the King like Bernard
All in above the rim like Daryl Dawkins
Or flat our single handedly
Disgracing your team like Jordan
Either way I'm puttin it down
Playa I been had games
Since I've checked
The Mack-a-Do was around
You ain't gotta ask
You know how I'm built
Drop three digits on your team
Alone like Wilt
You know what it is
YEAA!

[Chorus]</pre>
