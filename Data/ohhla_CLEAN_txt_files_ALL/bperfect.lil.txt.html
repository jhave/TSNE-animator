"The BasedGod Is Perfect"

[Intro]
They call me Lil B man. I made history
I'm still making history, walking history
Yeah just take a look at me real fast, you feel me?
Take a look at Lil B take a look at somebody the knows
the BasedGod I know the BasedGod personally, you feel me? Lets go

[Verse 1]
Most niggas hate cause they used to getting paper
Told the niggas I ain't leaving here to stay girl
Believe it I dreamed it in night for your comfort
Company when I need something I can hug on
Believe I love you and nobody knows that
All my hundreds is somewhere in Stockton
Believe me baby we more than a option
I ain't gotta hustle hard just to see when you clockin'
Because you love me I can tell how we divided
Because the light shining we make a fire
I ain't made faces slapped a face on them dollars
Presidents man they couldn't be copied
A lot of people try to cheat when you focused without it
A lot of niggas scared of money try to get dough about it
I'm tryna get it a couple rings and some houses
Paying rent when it's due, buying grapes by the ounces

[Interlude]
I want you to be my girl
I want you to pay me baby, you know what I'm saying?
Lets get money ho, lets get money ho
I want you to pay me baby, I want you to pay me
Lets get money ho, Let's get money ho

[Verse 2]
How you gonna hate me when she really want to date me
She know I won't date her so she hate me
Money got me feeling like a safety
Made rules on the field still safety
Still counting money for the days I was aching
Get my money I donate it to the world, people just take it
I don't deserve it, disconnected from all the pain
Wanna fly away with my bitch jump into a pull full of diamonds
Niggas don't understand it
I don't understand the world you should post a review
Lucky if you get out them.. debts too
Girls paying off my bills cause I'm tired
Niggas keep it focused roam the streets in a wire
Tryna piece up my paradise bitches sucking dick
I'm getting money Lil b know that for sure
Still baggin' up a ho
I'm baggin' up all that dough
It's Lil b

[Outro]
I need you baby, I need the money, I need bitches

I'm flexing on these niggas everyday man
Anybody want it lets go man
Basedworld Paradise nigga I got niggas in the front line
Lil B on the front line BasedGod right behind me
Niggas can't fuck with that Lil B killing off everything
and if anything ever happens to my young gunner
I got BasedGod right behind me niggas can't fuck with him he perfect
We rocking till the motherfucker, fuck it</pre>
