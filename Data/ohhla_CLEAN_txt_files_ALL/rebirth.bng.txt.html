[Intro]
Yah, uh huh
There comes that time, when you gotta give 'em truth
And truth is light
So just know that if I die tonight
I left you with something
I left you with truth
Yah, yah

[Verse 1]
Been a dreamer, cloud reacher
Aspirations of lavishing living, mackin' kicking my feet up
On dat road to the riches, bangin' keepin' my heat tucked
Must of got the wrong map, them riches never come
Or never came, not in this crack game
Had to switch plans, maybe my name
Develop a flow as addictive as that cocaine
Highly flammable down right explosive, propane
Dreams of celebration' wit my homies like we on man
The ones who been ridin' like, are we there yet?
You ain't got da answers for 'em, it ain't clear yet
Done hit a fork in da road, now you feeling near death
Politics, road blocks, all you want is success
Clock ticking failure, not an option you can live with
Only reason still makes sense why you in this

[Hook 1: X2]
Say Henni by the 5th, Newport to the Brownsville
That rebirth of ill, them other niggas sound real
They real life don't match up, that audio track

[Verse 2]
Say they never had a friend like me, call it jealousy
Why these niggas switched up, think about it sensibly
Maybe more fame, more opportunity
Look me in the eye homie, you see the truth in me
It was us till them wheels fell off
Positions of power, trump that, here comes double cross
On Allah, I hold no malice, paybacks this mirror that I paint, clear canvas
Reflection you can't look at, cot dammit
Shed light on these bastards, so underhanded
Plotting my demise, like you could crucify
A poor righteous teacher, box with the God
Go head, roll your sleeves up, these lies exposed
Davinci Code, white Jesus, never say die
Live by, lease believe it, for the hopeless and heavy hearted
People who really need this, I breath it
Nigga I bleed It, integrity I keep it
Lost my way for minute, like a scandalized deacon
Repent that, I ain't preaching
Die on my feet instead of living on my knees and
Been a soldier Since Mack was a threat
And Pistol Pete was on street making T-shirts wet
Opposite side of the color line, my right been left
Crip my right been left

[Hook 2: X2]
Say Henni by the 5th, Newport to the Brownsville
That rebirth of ill, them other niggas sound real
They real life don't match up, that audio track</pre>
