[Intro/Chorus: Jizzleman - 2X]
Do it how you wanna, slow it up, do the Matrix
Do it how you wanna- do it, do it how you wanna, slow it
Do it how you wanna, slow it up, do the Matrix
Play with it, play with it, play with it...

[Unk]
Yo, yo
Smoke mo' kush I'm fucked up, I bounce, then I stop pop and I lean
I'm on deck, knahmean, DJ Unk, it goes like the weed
You can bend, yo' knees, then rock yo' hips and do it a lil' slow
Now freeze, I think, I'm straight, let's roll
They do it on they tiptoes, snap yo' fingers as the beat goes
{You-you can Screw it} You can Screw it, slow it up now check that hoe
Now bring it back (now bring it back) now do yo' thang (now do yo' thang)
It's Big Ooomp bitch, Southern style it ain't gon' change (it ain't gon' change)
You can blow that hazzzzzee, high like you in space
Montay on that bass, I speak that shit that make you rock away
It's DJ Unk, slow it up, shorty known for actin a donkey
You can do it how you wanna, but it's gotta be funky - yup

[Chorus]

[Unk]
Okay! Soon as I hit the stage, they seem amazed
Diamonds glistenin with the Gucci shades
Lean to the left while I smoke the haze
Nigga please~! I'm gettin paid
Get like me, wanna be like me, slow it up, sip some Hennessy
Smoke some kush, is you feelin me? Montay make me another beat
I rock the club, then I'ma rock the streets, Bread Street down at V-103
Dirty Boys, J. Nitti, C.T., Club Chocolate, Hershey
By the tap, yep, the Blue Flame, Magic City, let's get it mayne
Play wit deez, straight get it mayne, do it how you wanna, I'ma make it rain
Red or blue, pop you one, slow it up, nigga have some fun
You can bounce, you can lean, it's all on you however it seems
A-T-L, watch me do it, slow it up, let's get into it
Big Oomp Records know how we do it, burn it down, now go and Screw it

[Chorus] - repeat to end with ad libs</pre>
