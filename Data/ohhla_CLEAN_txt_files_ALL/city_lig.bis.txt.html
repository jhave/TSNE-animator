[Verse One]
Ayyyyye
I like the bitches that make ya bounce
Ayyyyye
I love my money in large amounts
Ayyyyye
I'm on my way
Life's a big sandbox bitch, who wanna play?
? in a hot drop, jewels in a wrist watch
Bitches on my jizzock, that's how it's rollin' with the Doc
Aftermath, I ain't even have to say it
Khalil on the track, Bishop rap, they gon' play it
Emperor to your rappers, I'm not similar
.40 cal, my rap style, blaow, I'll cripple ya
Hot now
Burnin' like the sun temperature
You either blessed or hexed if I mention ya
I'm screw face, you two face, get you erased
I'm through with snakes, see through the fakes, get through the lakes
And cement nights
Turn off your lights
You fuck with me
It's only right

[Chorus] [The New Royals]
This city lights
They burn so bright
I watch from skyline to paradise
Out of control
And out of desire
Fall out of me
Fall out of me
And into this fire

[Verse Two]
Live for lake shores and condominiums in the Caribbean
Gettin' rid of ? and Rachael, she cinnamon
Like my Timberlands
Fuck her till she tremblin' 
Dick her, kick her out, got more bitches, yeah send 'em in
Ayyyyyye
X-Rated, my life, evasive angles
Closed off, cameras on, get in here record me
My life's thrill, surreal, Brazil big butt orgy
My life real, no reel, you rap niggas corny
I got an army, tanks like Tiananmen Square
You go to war with me, I blow your hood up in the air
Yeah, heavy metal make you Fall Out Boy
Rock and roll, lock and load, spray your whole convoy
Ayyyyyye
I put that Iraq in my rap
Bout two rounds in your back
Fuck around and you'll get clapped
I don't fuckin' battle rap
I send killers where you at
Hit your momma with the gat
Your lady, your baby, I'm crazy, fuck rap

[Chorus] [The New Royals]
This city lights
They burn so bright
I watch from skyline to paradise
Out of control
And out of desire
Fall out of me
Fall out of me
And into this fire

[Verse Three]
Intermission
Intuition
Into position, let's begin mission
Slave to ambition
Fame the addiction
I quit cold turkey, the money my prescription
Broke, nope, never goin' back that's ammunition
Money hungry, stomach growlin', hear it if you listen
Pay attention
A boss is talkin'
See that's why these other rappers can't compare
They rap bout money, I'm really a millionaire
They rap about foreign trips, I really go there
Ayyyyye
You a rap star
I'm a rock star
You a snitch, might as well drive a cop car
The o-zone gettin' thinner, my pockets gettin' fatter
The world might end, I'm rich bitch, it don't matter
On Judgment Day I'm blinged out in a wife beater
Still get through them pearly gates, I'll just pay off Peter

[Chorus] [The New Royals]
This city lights
They burn so bright
I watch from skyline to paradise
Out of control
And out of desire
Fall out of me
Fall out of me
And into this fire</pre>
