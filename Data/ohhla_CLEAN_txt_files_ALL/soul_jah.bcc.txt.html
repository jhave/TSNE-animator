[Hook-Steele w/vocal sample]
"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
One for all and all for one
It's all for all, it's all or none
"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
Stand for something or fall for whatever
When we ride out, we ride together, let's get busy

[Verse 1-Steele]
Yeah, I'm a Boot Camp soldier 'til I D-O-A
'Til I'm in a gunfight and my heat don't spray
Some of you believe all I do is smoke weed all day
But I stay military, mine sharp like a stingray
I'm a Boot Camp soldier 'cause I rep the streets
This means that I'll go to war for my beliefs
And I owe it to my peeps, know that helpin' 'em reach
Another level in this rap game where niggaz can eat

[Verse 2-Buckshot]
I'm a soldier like a political prisoner
This is a all-out war so you can load up your Dillingers
You willing to step up and play the front? So
First you gotta show 'em how your gun blow, aight though?
Don't go bailin' on me now, or gun failin' on me now
On the real, just hold me down, then
If I take aim, you take aim
If I bust, you bust, it's simple, do the same thing
Be a soldier, I told ya, it's all in the mind frame
They ain't ready for war, when it come they like "Ah, man"
This ain't a fashion statement
When they bash your face in, then it's back to the basics

[Hook-Steele w/vocal sample]
"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
One for all and all for one
It's all for all, it's all or none
"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
Stand for something or fall for whatever
When we ride out, we ride together, let's get busy

[Verse 3-Rock]
I always been a Boot Camp soldier, even though I went AWOL
It's family, when they call, I bang all
At your whole team, though, the 'Wild Boy' is back, I'm Steve-O
Without the leopard thong all in the crack (Nah)
Everything is logical, ain't no emotions here
Cut you, you dyin' fool, I'm Spock without the pointy ears
I'm goin' there, you ain't goin' where we goin', clear
The fuck outta gear, the whole in your rear, we soldier's here

[Verse 4-Sean Price]
Freak soldier, heat holder, Green Beret
Johnny Rambo, nigga, make my day
Your ass is frontin', don't make the God blast at somethin'
Sean Price is the weapon of mass destruction
Captain Black America, strapped with the gat, darin' ya
Pop two shots at your knot with the black Deringer
Sean's a soldier, see the stripe on my arm
How you wanna do it, knife or the chron's? Really, though

"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
One for all and all for one
It's all for all, it's all or none
"Do you remember me? I'm a Soul Jah"
Stand for something or fall for whatever
When we ride out, we ride together, let's get busy

[Verse 5-Starang Wondah]
You hear my voice, you got no choice but feel the presence
And in the underground, BCC is still legends
Now I'm back smarter, but a little older
Niggaz in my hood said that it was over
Hit the block, Ruck, Rock, black-on-block Rover
Like "Hate to say I told you so, but nigga, I told ya"
I'm the beast, a Savage like the Macho Man
Niggaz take your cheese like you the Nacho Man
And I'm not yo man, y'all niggaz so phony
You owe me, got dope for me, show me

[Verse 6-Top Dog]
Do you remember, my Boots and my troops?
My troops in those suits, we world wide
And I still rep BCC
And I'm still Top D-O-G 'cause I'm a soldier
Fatigued up, some days I'm jeaned up
My two soldiers at home keep me serene and cleaned up
So don't make me call my team up
Just ease up, see my name in them books, you wanna read up?

[Verse 7-Louieville Sluggah]
Chumps at ease, put it on freeze
Henny's in your presence, I'm about cheese
'Bout that Play-Doh, haters fuck with mines
Replace your fitted with a halo
Boot Camp's stompin' through my veins
We are, Sacman street hustlers, ain't shit change
Respect is everything and I gotta shine
Suck dick for yours, but I'll die for mines, you know

[Verse 8-Tek]
Please take a look at my battle scars
Realize it's a miracle how I survive
My Brooklyn Vietnam
I was always trained first to bomb
The element of surprise 'll put your foes on they heels
Tags on they toes, it's kill or be killed
Should I show you blueprints to a murder?
Nobody no case, you could be the murder
Confidently move, leave no trace
Consequently, the DA 'll have no case
You could take it how you want it, this is just a tip
But don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shh...
