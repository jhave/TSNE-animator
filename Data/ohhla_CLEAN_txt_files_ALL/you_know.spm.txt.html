Song:   You Know My Name
Typed by: Stupid4318@aol.com

I'm SPM you know my name
I'm the one that came about the dope game
I've payed my dues and kept my cool
I'm the one that told your kid to stay in school
I'm from the streets thank god for rap
I creep through my hood in the smoke gray 'llac
Contridiction on my chest, versace on my clothes
I got too many too many heh YO
I'm shakin bakin cookies turnin rookies into vets
I used to see my dreams through a foggy pyrex
My lex is outside plus I got a 64
But my benz is wrapped up around a telephone pole
I'm drippin candy wet and I'm swangin 84s
Nothin but the screw bangin in my radio
I'm blowin this mary and im sippin on sherry
Give my homies mama money for his convisary
My name is..

*chorus*
sssss ppppp mmmmm
south park mexican

heh yo pass the green of weed tweedle lee tweedle la
livin like a king fill the steam in my spa
before I walk I gotta teach myself to crawl
I started off small now I'm stronger than the law
you know my name I'm SPM
in this rap game I'm the creme a la cram
I tell you what it is
and ill tell you what it was
exotic foreign minx and imported asian rugs
police at my door fedaralis on my phone
I guess im makin too much money with my microphone
I did my time no sunshine
it seems like they only wanna handcuff mine

*chorus*

Uh I used to be a shoe shina 
now I sip aunt jamima
I go to sleep in europe and wake back up in china
I take em break em down represent that H-Town
I'm Los el Mehicano in english Charlie Brown
my top is on drop and my trunk is on pop
my girl is snow white in the form of a rock
my hot block is in this in this rap I break againas
blowin indo rollin 20 dolla pinnas
dances with the wolves in my southern side hood
got seven brick houses all made out of wood
I'm either at the park where my homies shootin jumpas
or in the limosuine gettin freaked by head huntas
you name my name

*chorus*</pre>
