I am not a human being

[Verse 1]
Re-re-reporting from another world
Look up in the sky and see me courting with a cover girl
She know that inspite, after I'm through then it's another girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother off
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip hop, it must be meat hawk
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf tree top
I make that nina sing like shooty do wee op
Them other fags daddy?, well I truly do me, pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker cause we not
Yeah, you bitches better run til your feet stop
And I'm so fed up with street cops, I'm colder than a ski shop
I'm holding onto the top
And even if I let go, I still won't drop

[Chorus]
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank god that I am not basic

Ow!
I am not a human being

[Verse 2]
Haha, rockstar baby
Now come to my suite and get lock jaw baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off baby
News flash, your boyfriend a knock off baby
Okay, real shit, he can get knocked off baby
And I'm like a champagne top, I'm ready to pop off baby
You really lucky I don't kill if it's not for baby
Got so much money, I know it gets the cops all crazy
Rockstar shit from my rockstar ass
Got a tub full of money, that's a rockstar bath
Then I use more money to wipe my rockstar ass
Then I throw it in the garbage, that's rockstar trash
I wouldn't try you, I wouldn't lie you
I'm only sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Big B bitch, I'm so motherfuckin' domu
Staring at a mountain like bitch I will climb you
I stand tall like a motherfuckin' nine too
I scream mother fuck you and whoever designed you
And if you think you hot, then obviously you are lied to
And we don't die, we multiply and then we come divide you

[Chorus]
I thank god that I am not basic
I am not a human being

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I'm rockstar bad
With my rockstar glasses and my rockstar plaid
This the school of hard rock, I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids are bout to have a rockstar dad
I'm not gonna let them teddys bounce like rison glass
And if you do, I'll probably call you like shots off glass
Don't jump into my water cause you not gonna last
I swear I'mma be like a shark that's not gonna pass
Rockstar life, rockstar bright
And in the mosh pit is how a rockstar fight
So jump up in this bitch and catch a rockstar right
And the cops could never violate a rockstar's rights
Yeah, now I'm back on my grizz
And y'alls a bunch of squares like a motherfucking grid
And everybody get it, well me, I get rid
Of he who say he get it and then I get his
No marquee but this is big biz
And I scream fuck it whoever it is
Ain't no motherfucker deeper than me, bitch dig
And I thank god everyday that my children are rich kids

[Chorus]
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I am not a human being</pre>
