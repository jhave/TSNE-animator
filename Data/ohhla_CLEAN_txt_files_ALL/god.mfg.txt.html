[Chorus]
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
Angels he don't love you, I know cause I'm one too
We can make this, the day Heaven fell
Taking love for weakness, so we must fight this
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
Humans feel that we're blessed, but we're slaves that's oppressed
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
If you question my loyalty, no one loved him more than me

[Verse 1]
Devil snuck in Heaven, pity God's angels didn't pay attention
They let him in, just to heard what he had to say (Say what?)
You really do deserve a raise
God got you working like you're mindless slaves
You're his equal, and it's time that he pays
Start the revolution
This question's been burning me, down in Hell what good is eternity?
Unless you're the one that's in charge (He's playing us all)
You do all the running around as the guardian, the man he sends you down
Meanwhile he sit back, relax, live large
Now do that sound fair? Hell no
Heaven should be a co-op, but he don't share
Cause he don't care, nothing about you
He feel Heaven will go on without you
What is he saying, you're disposable?
What type of shit is that?
What you do? You stay quiet
What you need to do is riot (Burn this motherfucker down)
That'll teach God not to fuck around
Break the smoke detectors so the flames won't make a sound
The only thing found will be ashes to the ground
(The only thing found will be ashes to the ground)
So again

[Chorus]
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
Angels he don't love you, I know cause I'm one too
We can make this, the day Heaven fell
Taking love for weakness, so we must fight this
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
Humans feel that we're blessed, but we're slaves that's oppressed
Attention angels, it's time to rebel
No one loved him more than me

[Verse 2]
I'm the bearer of light shining for my brethren
Hell ain't nothing but the shadow of Heaven
Heaven ain't nothing but covert sinners
Right wing flap harder just to be winners
Left wing resist, angel torn in half
Those undecided will all be asked
To pick one now, fly or die
But all we really got is you and I
We need to embed inside his mind
That we're not garbage, our kind's divine
Second class although we created this place
Then I'm willing to fall from grace</pre>
