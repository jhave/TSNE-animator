Typed by: dtm4lifebaby@cs.com

Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listenin to you naggin

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
She talking to me like I'm dumb
I should have known (should have known)
Should have left that bitch alone
Now I'm stuck with naggin

[Verse 1]
This is for then niggaz who be fuckin with them feelings
And you get your heart caught up in the mix
Cause your love fucks what's up her dress, and never paid attention
Cause you didn't think the girl would start tripping
Shawty flip the scripted
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips
And let me tell you what I can't stand
When a women play the role of a man
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand
I know you know I ain't gone go for the short jacking all the time
Talking to me out of line broad, truly you done lost your mind
You gone fuck round and get my some time
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listening to your naggin

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
A lil more grip a lil less lip
Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip
And a point of no return and you made it that way
Buy the shit that you say every motherfuckin day
Hope you paying attention cause I got to mention
Dissin me in front of your friends
Trying to get a lil laugh in your crack in
Then I wanna woop his ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't no man but you like how he pretend
I'm going to keeping sipping my Hen and smoking my herbs
And I'm going to need a lot of grill cause of your nagging girl
The way you talking absurd, gettin on my nerves
All in my ear about to make me hit the curve
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired of listening to your naggin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One day I got shot by Cupid
This was when this relationship went stupid
We was talking on the phone too long
Now her ass isn't home
Tellin me you out with your friends
Find out later on you with your other men
You ain't nothing but a dividend
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin
That's a damn shame it ended like this
And I ain't got love for you bitch
Shoo fly don' bother me
Will I get back with her probably
Then I thought about it I won't
Do I really want you I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'm going to leave her alone
Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad
Make you want to say kiss my ass
I'm tired listenin to your naggin

[Chorus]

Now I'm stuck with naggin</pre>
