[Intro]
  Welcome to Starblocks
It's Young Dirty
  Who's this?
It's Young Dirty!
  Oh okay, what you need?
Let me get them new Ones mayne
  How many pair you need?
Two of 'em, give me two
  I got you, pull on around to the window pimp
Aight shorty
  Ay ay ay Joc! {Whattup Pak Man}
  Shorty out here say he need two fresh pair
{Oh yea he want two of 'em?}
  Yeah the new ones {Aight}
  Ay Joc {Whattup?} You know the motto! {Yo}
Hustle by any means~!

[Chorus]
First I take they order like the coffee shop (HEY)
Then I steam it up and cook it like the coffee shop (HEY)
And then I sevre it out the window like the coffee shop (HEY)
(Got the work comin in, got my rims sittin real big)
And it ain't no returns at the coffee shop (HEY)
Man I make that paper stack up at my coffee shop (HEY)
One hit and they'll be back to the coffee shop (HEY)
(Got the work comin in, got my rims sittin real big)

[Yung Joc]
Hey hey, ayyy, okay
It's just another day at the coffee shop
We sellin everything, down to the shoes and watch
And for the right price meet me in the parking lot
I got a sale on them old school Chevy drops
No knock cause we only serve the best
Oh yeah my coffee shop is cheaper than the rest~!
I'm takin orders, tell me who's next
Only cash, no credit, no checks
When your car stop, welcome to Starblocks
You wanna triple your knot? Invest in our stock
And now we doin numbers, just like the close-out
Make sure to shop with me, before it's sold out

[Chorus]

[Gorilla Zoe]
Steppin on the scene as I tilt my hat
Black Pat Sajak, bring anything back
I'm a hustler (a hustler) I'm just looking for a customer
I'ma get it whether rain sleet or snowin bruh
And for that cash flow your boy moves rapido
Ice latte, you don't see that boy go
You need anything, you can call Gorilla Zoe
Yeah they get it and go, I tell 'em vamanos
It's not a phone #, but I got 7 digits
Got so many whips, they call me whipalicious
I rock expensive shirts, and thousand dollar britches
I get them Star-bucks at the coffee shop, get it? 

[Chorus]

[Yung Joc]
Ha, ah-ha, okay
Everybody on the block know my nickname
Grade A pimp game, you can call me Been Framed
And all my money get counted when the shifts change
Then get 211 t-shirt wit'cho picture framed
If you need the number 1-800-Starblocks
Coca latte, damned to make yo' heart stop
And now the haters hot, so they run and tell the cops
So they shut this down, we'll set up shop on another block

[Chorus]

[Outro: Yung Joc]
Ay Pat (pimp whattup)
In the South where they can find this at
(You ought know - coffee shop)
When we on the West coast where they gon' find us at
(At the - coffee shop)
What about up top shorty, where they gon' find us at
(At the - coffee shop)
Ay kids, please don't do drugs</pre>
