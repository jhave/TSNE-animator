A message from the Church
Brothers and sisters, we gathered here today
For today's topic - Hard niggaz
Not real Hard niggaz, but your fake hard niggaz
You'll know them when you see them
When they got that tight Khakis suit on
With them open toes sandals, with no socks on
HAH! UMMMM.. You'll know them when you see them
When the video director yells CUT!
And they pull their pants up
HAH! - You'll know, you'll know when you see them
When they got Bandannas on, with rhinestones and glitter
In the wrong pocket HAH! Oh Lord!..
You'll know when you see them
When they got cornrows in their hair, and they ain't from no where
HAH! awww.. y'all don't hear me this morning..
Awww No!.. y'all don't hear me..
I ain't talking about.. REAL HARD! niggaz
But I'm talking about.. FAKE HARD! niggaz</pre>
