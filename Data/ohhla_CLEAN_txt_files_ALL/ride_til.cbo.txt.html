(C-BO)
I keep a four with a trunk full a pumps that'll jump
Fat heat under the seat and I dunk
With the craziest nigga the shadiest nigga the ????
Fuck some crystal we on the yak in the bug
With a strap full of slugs nigga
Any one of you niggas try to jack
Get capped in your mug nigga
Its the loca for show
I go for broke with the loaded 44 revolver
Aimed at your throat

(W.C.)
I gotta pain vain just as shady as a game
Three lick again 40 bitches on my cain
Slanging that lolo smoking that dojo
Back for more dough
Packing that desert eagle it's me and my nigga C-BO
Keep the lethal  illegal channel we trying to see more
Trunk full of kilos in back of the regal
Twin evil ditching the brews so kicking the jews
With 2 raw commercial niggas with nothing to lose

(Chorus)
(C-BO)
We gonna ride till we die 
Stay high to the sky
(W.C.)
Gulf ass chucks, t-shirts and levis
(C-BO)
Cheese getter, heat winner,burn cheddar
(W.C.)
To all the g's serving the second or third letter

REPEAT 2X

(W.C.)
Look in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
No it's me Dub-C letting my bandana swang
Watching them all walkin my dance
With rocks in my pants
Glokking my cant's
Chuck Taylor's and contra pants
All my booth flanel my lolo my ammo scheam ass for the scandal
Cuz niggas be in your court sayin hes a soprano
But dead niggas can't talk, fuck the DA
It's C-BO and dub on this criminal replay

(C-BO)
Fuck toning shit down I'm fit to bone a bitch down
Me and dub in the rag ??? hoppin through the town
Crip walkin to the party like WESTSIDE!! 
Grab the mike and show them how the west ride
Fo banging ,hoes hanging, zone stanging
Gets no love from the dub we got the infared aiming
Hes flaming,we banging, seat claiming
Give a fuck till we die these niggas aint changing

(CHORUS) 
2X
(C-BO)
Dub C plug me,slug me, with some game
(W.C.)
Let it rain,let it drip,hit the switch make it bang
(C-BO)
What you claim?
(W.C.)
Got affiliated mad circle game, thangs celebrate, better feel the flame
(C-BO)
Two hoes will never change creased kahkis and chucks and t-shirt
Bandana on swang,rather it rain, all in the same game
Shit I got the gravy and the sack, yo cuz, call that shady nigga back

(W.C.)
What you mean?What you mean nigga
I got the bomb ass tweed nigga
And dirty choppers that I'll make them retrieve nigga
All scandalous,I got it on lock 
And C-BO show them how you be banging the guard and block

(C-BO)
I blow chronic by the pee's nigga
And stay behind it like steam nigga
And keep something up your sleeve nigga
Many 14 2-2-3's 
In my hood we stay jumping out of trees nigga

(CHORUS 2X)
