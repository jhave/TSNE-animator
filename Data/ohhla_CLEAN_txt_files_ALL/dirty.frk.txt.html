Chorus
[Oooh, he's got a dirty mouth!]
[Freak NASTY!]

Verse 1
Freak Nasty, X-rated from the goddamn start
I was born to freak, so you know it's in my heart
So put that ice in your mouth and bitch, start suckin'
Damn conversation, hoe; it's all about fuckin'
I'm nastier than a porno flick freak
I'm fuckin' project hoes 7 days a week
I'm leavin' used rubbers on the mattress, hoe
My boy Reggie Rej said, "Nigga you fuckin' some mo'?"
If you ain't freeeeeeakin',
I ain't speeeeeeakin', yeah
If you ain't fuuuuuuuuuckin',
Keep on truuuuuuuuuckin', you know why?
'Cause I ain't got no time for shenanigans
Just serve me up that pussy like you're workin' at Bennigan's
Freak Nasty, a nasty freak from the South
If they not down for fuckin', put that dick in they mouth!

Chorus

Verse 2
Oh-oh, I got ya mouth hangin' wide open
Is it 'cause you're scared?  Aw bitch, you're just chokin'
Or should I say gaggin', girl, I wanna see
'Cause your lips look so damn good to me
I got your head bobbin', girl, like you're fightin' Mike Tyson
Ooh, ooh, oh, here it comes, vanilla icin'
Spread it all around like you're rubbin' on lotion
Don't be afraid, it's just my love potion
If you ain't freeeeeeakin',
I ain't speeeeeeakin', yeah
If you ain't fuuuuuuuuuckin',
Keep on truuuuuuuuuckin', you know why?
'Cause I'm a real freak, girl, don't you know?
I lick you from your head down to your fuckin' toes
Freak Nasty, a nasty freak from the South
Now what you niggas know about my dirty mouth?
BITCH!  HOE.  SLUT!  SKANK.
FUCK YOU, YOU STUPID HOE!
YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK AND LICK MY ASS, HOE.
I TALK THE WAY I WANNA TALK, BITCH!
YOU CAN SUCK THIS FUCKIN' FAT-ASS DICK!
Yeah, see I talk the way I wanna talk!  I ain't started this shit.
Ya might leave if you got a problem like this, ya hoe!
