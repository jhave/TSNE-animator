[Talib Kweli]
Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

[Common]
Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see em
My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em
Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em
Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...

[Sadat X]*in background during sample*
Check it out, everyday ha yeah
This how we gon' do it for y'all
Common Sense, Sadat X puttin something in your ear
Something for you to grab
For the whole world, yaknowimsayin, but it ain't free
It's a fee, check it out

You squirm wit this coughin, whippin cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'ma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the place I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm tellin you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
Cuz I'm the dead eye, wit the red eye, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me?
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top cuz I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress
You know I'm still...

[Common]
Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder tellin me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child
Searchin for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony
Lyrically I put a hit on em, cuz I'm the style-Nitty
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Tryin to get a chick to kick it wit me till the tilt
Told her my Chamber's like Wilt
Built wit her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was givin me neck, yo I'm still gettin mine...
