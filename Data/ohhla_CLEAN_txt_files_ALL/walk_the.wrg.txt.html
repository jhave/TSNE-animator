[Warren G]
I make music for block pushers and go-getters
From gators, to house slippers, and Mo' sippers
The old, and new school, the hard hitters
And fuck whoever that don't roll with us
This here is international player
Fuck the Senator's daughter and have lunch with the Mayor
I'm in a league all by myself
Everything I done I did for me - by myself
Walked away from bullshit and called the inner circle
Had to get my head right (fuck Universal)
I took the time to be free again - grinding
I finally feel like me again

[Raphael Saadiq - chorus]
I gotta walk these streets again
I'm gonna roll on with my friends
I'll talke my time, I'll read the signs, I'll be just fine
Mo sipping with my chicks
So hold my telephone cards
I'ma just keep doing my thing, stocking this game, stacking my change

[Warren G]
A range meeting with lawyers and stock brokers
Then back to the block pouring liquor with shirt soakers
When it come to the dough, I'm about my cheddar
50 Cent ain't the first off to pop Berattas
I'ma walk this road and G here forever
Born and raised, addicted to this Cali weather
It feels good to be me right about now
If my moms could see me now she'd be proud

[Raphael Saadiq - chorus]

[Warren G]
All across the globe they know me
I regulate, international G
It ain't nobody as fly as, fly as who
Warren G and Raphael Saadiq, stop acting all edgy
Mentally it's cut already
Bet you won't bet me that your pussy ain't ready
I'm on track on my back, the monkey ain't heavy
Rock on with the mic gangsta beat rock steady
If music should die before I wake I pray the lord my soul to take
Dedicated to hits, and that's showbizz
Can't eat, can't live, can't no busters alive fuck with this
I ain't gone miss, I'm gone ride, put it down that's on my kids

[Raphael Saadiq - chorus]

[Rapheal Saadiq]
Walk these cold streets again
Walk these cold streets agaaaain
Walk these streets again
