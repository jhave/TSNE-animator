Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Happy Birthday Duriel!
From me and Lauren!
My name is Mac Lethal
(But I'm gonna spit some paler and faster fucking lyrics)
Let's go!
Oh hi!
My name's Mac
ecstasy, cocaine and crack
none of that
I just smoke green
while Chinese people eat your cat
Roll by on a low-ride Huffy
Simpsons on and my beer is Duff see
cuff rolled up to my cap
cash out the ass cuz I wrote a couple raps with Puffy
Gotta be the one to bite the bullet
I'm a sinner but I bet I could have been a better man
I wanna be Zen but I go sipping on some medicine
instead of meditation but I get it while I can
I don't wanna wind up in the gutter
with a bottle malt liquor bitter cuz I never got a call
But who the fuck drink malt liquor anymore?
Give me vodka now and start sucking on my balls!
Motherfuckers wanna have another personal epiphany
I'm coming with a symphony eliminating everybody/anybody
roll up like a cannibal and bite em like a peanut butter apple in a minute
I'mma nibble on a pentagram and every single bitter lamb
is getting so offended I don't give a damn if anything
A mental plan is coming with a visually-integrated entity
And everybody's gonna get the guillotine
I'm getting cinematic in a matter of a minute
Every milligram is devilish the Vatican will kill it DEAD
Gonna kill it til it's dead, I'mma try to hit'em in the head, corn-fed
Midwestern whore bred. She looks so thick and juicy give it to me
in the booty shorts then you gotta get up in the morning n get out
(Let's speed it up â big breath)
Never been a counterfeit of nothing
I am just an elevated entity
I'm coming and giving it back
then pumping dump on every instrument with increments of sentiments
and syllables
I lunge I'm livid again
I'm sticking it in their muffins
make a couple million I'm hoping to I'm going to
so gimme another reason I should
sit around an not experience
benefits of getting down when all
the drivel that they're spitting
is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness!</pre>
