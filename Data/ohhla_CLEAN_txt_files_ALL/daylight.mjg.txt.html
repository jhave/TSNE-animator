Yeah, uhh uhh uhh, yeah
Space Age forever, knawhatimsayin?
Space Age forever, Space Age baby, yeah

[Eightball]
The name of the game is get no sleep
Mash on niggas and always roll deep
Non stop hustle means all profits double
Young nigga tryin to see rocks like Barney Rubble
Vampire, circulate when the moon rise
Do dirt when most people got closed eyes
Rollin, livin off garbage and scraps
Niggas wouldn't even fuck with me if I had rap
Thinkin 'bout that man thats just another trap
Another nigga dead from another niggas strap
Space Aging every thought and everything I write
Livin for today, a nigga might die tonight   
Just because a nigga think I'm a celebrity
They want to rob and jack and try to bury me
Forced entry embedded in my memory
Fightin sleep like Freddie Kruger tryin to get me
In the midst I wanna see it not hear about it
If a nigga wanna see it gotta be up out it
Can't do without it sayin 'til my life end
Everynight they like "catch me up again"

Chorus:
You say like daylight, its gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when I'm just gettin in
Gonna catch me up, gonna catch me up again

[MJG]
I look up, I can't see the forest full of trees
Destined to make it through, regardless of the seas
Of evil that been planted sproutin concrete walls
So everybody have sex 'til its after all
You playin wrong, now you havin to climb so you can make it
Got the whole roll block and too thick for you to brake it
Don't fake it, you know its ??? hard for you to shake it
The camels tellin you to come on, you had to cake it
Mr. Mistake it, Mr. Do Nothing, uncle give me something
You mouth tellin me love, but I ain't feelin none
Stealin some, same positions I've been facin for years
Now I'm about to put some steak in this meal
Inflatin my bills, excusin you ho's who want fame
Using you ho's for one thang, fuck how you changed bitch
Its funny why you stayed around
And patience how you laid me down
Now you exspectin the crown
I'm full time, respectin the game
Checkin out the girls in change
A turd in the hand is far worst than a turd in ???
Let that shit float on, 'cause that shit get old

Chorus:
It seems that daylight is gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me, gonna catch me up again
Some people like gettin up when I'm just gettin in
Gonna catch me, gonna catch me up again
Well well...
