[U-God]
Yo, Yo, the average man couldn't last that long
She like to work out, run marathons
She wear tight skirts with no panties on
She's a six foot one bronze Amazon
Say it, complaining all the good men is gone
I'm from Babylon, she reads the Qur'an
Visits all the jails and the nail salons
Rock Coco Chanel, her smell was strong
With skin like velvet she rocked my bed
Buffed my helmet, sipping Long Island Red
She spread eagle at the tip of the bed
I rubbed on her legs this is what I said

[Chorus: U-God]
That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, what's up honey dip
That's how I like my chicks, heavy on the hips
Jump up, bounce with me, come up over here

[U-God]
She's a thing of beauty, she's so mean
Heavy in them jeans, every man's dream
As real as it may seem I approach you with calm speech
I'm form New York, honey from Long Beach
She's intelligent, the President's arm piece
But that's irrelevant, I'm in like Flint
She nicknamed her breastesses the Wonder Twins
She went to the exorcist it's under skin
She loved grown men, she loved the thrills
She jumped out the Benz with the buns of steel
She's the trend setter on the cover of Maxim
Secluded in the cabin in the hills of Aspen
Life's always boring, she needed some action
She had passion with Louis Vuitton hand bags
She didn't like the chronic but she loved my swag
She loved giving head when she's on the rag

[Chorus]

[U-God]
She did her dip, almost broke my hip
That girl, she was, getting down
Told her to go home, told her to leave me alone
Look at that girl, she kept, getting down, down, down

[Chorus]</pre>
