[DMC]
As I walk through the corners of Cooley High
I gotta be thankful that I'm still alive
I have a lot of thoughts like who the hell am I
What is the truth and what is a lie?
But I think about my life and everything is okay
I gotta pave the way to a brighter day
Cause it's really plain and simple when it came to me
There's a lot of people just like me (like me)
There's a whole lot just like me (like me)

[Chorus: Sarah Mclachlan]
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin home, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then

[DMC]
1964, uhh! Here we go, aiyyo
The child was born it was a beautiful day
It was 1964, the 31st of May
The girl gave birth to a baby boy
He's not a burden, he's a bundle of joy
She was just a young girl in her youth
And her parents tried real hard to hide the truth
Is there a chance for the baby to live?
That is a chance that you gotta give {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[DMC]
It was 9 whole months inside of the womb
Another long month in the hospital room
Facin doom in a tomb cause the kid is alone
But somebody came along and they took the kid home
He came into the world like we all do
But he never ever knew how he came through
Do the best you can do if this happen to you
And understand all the words that I'm rappin to you {*2X*}

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Father is, the mother and the father is..
Yo, the mother and the father is all that he knows
They give him lots of love and you know that it shows
He's livin really well he has all that he needs
He came into the world and he's gonna succeed
It is a blessing to live in the light
If nothing is wrong then something is right
They say that life is a mystery
And I just wanna know my history
Understand that life is good to me
That's the way it is so (let it be)
My life is complete, everything is alright
Life is good to me, I'm in paradise
Understand when I'm rappin, no pain and sorrow
I just want you to know, yo yo {*2X*}
I'm alright ma
I'm alright pa.. na na na

[Chorus] - 4X to fade</pre>
