Yeah

[Verse 1 - Classified]
They might say I lead a simple life, the type that don't excite
And yes I like to smoke more than light 'til night
I realize I got a problem, I'm high way too often
And only seem to acknowledge it after I indulge in it
Pull in my driveway, walk through my front door
Then make a bowl of cereal to conquer my hunger
See I like to eat before I slumber
Brushin my teeth and gettin clean, helps me to find my comfort
Jump in my bed and turn the TV back on
I feel like I was just here, the day don't ever last long
I feel like everyday's a cycle, I've learned to accept it
There's a lot of scenes to see, I need to learn to direct it
I turn the TV off and start brainstormin
Try to figure what I'm gonna do in the mornin
I know what it brings, I wonder what's in store though
I wonder what the hell I'm gonna do for tomorrow (do for tomorrow ...)

[Male Narrator's Voice]
Goodnight, we'll see you tomorrow</pre>
