(Intro: Roscoe &amp; Kurupt)

(Chorus)
This goes out to all y'all tellin' my bitch what you saw
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
Thinkin' I won't check shit (whaaat?!) or these mouths on records
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
Talkin' shit on T.V. but bitch up when you see me, nigga
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!

Well Uh-Uh, Uh
(Say what?!)
Uh-Uh
(Say what?!)
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!

(1st Verse: Kurupt)
Early mornin'
I just awoke
Just took a sip and just took a smoke
The phone rang
Niggas spittin' game
The same ol'
Same ol'
Same ol' thang
Talkin' 'bout life
Talkin' 'bout bitches
Talkin' 'bout money...
Cars...
And switches
And all of a sudden he switched talkin' about some kill shit
'Bout this bitch ass nigga talkin' some real shit

(Chorus)
This goes out to all y'all tellin' my bitch what you saw
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
Thinkin' I won't check shit or these mouths on records
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
Talkin' shit on T.V. but bitch up when you see me, nigga
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!

Well Uh-Uh, Uh
Well Uh-Uh, Uh

Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!

(2nd Verse: Kurupt)
You know I'm chip-toothed, motherfucker
You about to get slapped like a motherfuckin' bitch for that
(Say what?!)
You got a lot of rap homie, not to know a nigga
Don't talk a nigga, show a nigga
Don't think it nigga, live it, nigga
Don't run it, nigga
Gun it, nigga
(Man, fuck that!)
Don't fake niggas, quake niggas
I ain't no bitch nigga
(I ain't none)
So don't play me like a bitch nigga
You lil' bitch nigga
Change the switch nigga
Wanna get rich nigga
(Nigga!)
Fuck and make a motherfuckin' nigga dick itch, nigga
Why you mad at me?
(Why you mad homie?)
Walk without
Talkin' 'bout what you talkin' 'bout
You must be that Madd Rapper (hehe)
Puffy and them was talkin' about
Nigga put a dick in yo mouth
And shut the fuck up!
(Nigga!)
You lil' bitch!
(Bitch!)
I hear you talkin' but you ain't sayin shit!

(Chorus)
Now this goes out to all y'all (all y'all!) tellin' my bitch what you saw
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!
(Snitch ass niggas!)
They thinkin' I won't check shit or these mouths on records
Hell naw I can't let that sliiiide!

(3rd Verse: Roscoe)
If you gonna rob with us, nigga rooob!
If you gonna mash with us, nigga maaash!
Instead we be dumpin' on cowards and bonin' out with the cash
So when a nigga run up on you
In a blue ski mask
(Run nigga!  Run!)
'Cause I come (Heeeey!) murda yo
Drawin' skits
It's like bustin' a orange
You get terminated
Our rhymes is esquisite
Explicit, and R-Rated
You askin' why I'm laughing 'cause it's kinda funny to me
You really think you gonna come and take my money from me?
Well, I can't let that slide
I'm fittin' to trip
Pop my Olde English and get into some gangsta shhh!
What's my name?

And what we do:

And can't let... that slide!  that slide!
Nigga... What?!
