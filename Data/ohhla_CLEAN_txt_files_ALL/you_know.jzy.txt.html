[Intro: Shwaty Redd]
Ay bruh, I'ma tell you on some real shit homie
You know what I'm sayin', you can't let this shit get to you dog
Know what I'm sayin', it aint no pressure out there my nigga
Everybody fucks wit' you cause of what you do my nigga
What you say, what you speak on these motherfuckin' beats nigga
Only thing I can motherfuckin' tell you on some real G shit
Is to stay focused and let these niggaz know you still the...

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Realest nigga alive
You could see it in my eyes
I aint playin wit 'em homie
Yeah I'm strapp't when I ride
You real nigga yeah he keep it way hood
To govern a bitch, I make Georgia look good
Those a hundred proof nigga tell you differet, he a liar
Drop 1 album, set the world on fire
I will not stop and I wont retire
You niggaz smoke good, but I stay higher
Take 'em back to the white lex bubble
Could of told back then that dem boys was in trouble
Trend setter like the boy Don Can
I started makin' dollars then it started makin' cents
I used to share my room with the roaches and the rats
My lil' cousin Paul and my uncle, Po' Slick
Used to get 'em by the hunderds nigga, you can ask Slick
Bet Jeezy pack the dough homie just like Vick
You Know What It Is...

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I can't even lie
A day like this
Hey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so fly
Ya eyes don't lie
You fukin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what It is
I can't even lie
A day like this
Hey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so high
My eyes don't lie
You fuckin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what It is

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I gave 'em my heart, they lent me they ears
This is the best gangsta shit that you've heard in years
I try to told dem niggaz keep one in the plastic
July 26, ya boy delivered a classic
I walk through the fire, gasoline doors
I dun seen everything nigga, and i dun sold it all
New whips every month, nigga i dun drove it all
Pocket full of bread, nigga bet i blow it all
And then we go to jail, and think about it all
Nuthin else to do, so we ball till' we fall
Baby on the way, I'm just waitn on the call
Told her bring her her friends, we gon run through 'em all
Lets get it, she know what it is...

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
I can't even lie
A day like this
Hey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so fly
Ya eyes don't lie
You fukin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what It is
I can't even lie
A day like this
Yey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so high
My eyes don't lie
You fuckin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what It is

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
I'm ya hoods last hopes
I'm the El' Capi'tan
Ask about me in the city
I'm the motherfuckin' man
Head above water, we call it 10 toes down
We hustle right here, work 10 doors down
Live life like a lottery, I call it the big game
Invesignate it for me, I call it the big change
I sleep when I'm gone, yeah I'm tryna get to it
It's like a Nike campagne the way ya' boy just do it
Aye!, the paper keeps coming
yeah, it flows like fluid
Get a 50 pack and we run right through it
Make dem boys tuck it in cause I'm all iced out
87-32 yeah, you know what I'm about
HA HA, you know what it is...

[Corus (fade out): Young Jeezy]
I can't even lie
A day like this
Hey, it's gonna be a hell of a night
Homie you know what it is
Cause I'm so fly
Ya eyes don't lie
You fukin wit a gangsta tonight
Baby, you know what it is...</pre>
