[Rodney]
Darkchild, uh, uh
Keith Sweat, Da Brat
I like that
Who the one who put you on girl?
I'm the one that put you on
Who the one who put you on girl?
I'm the one that put you on, come on

[Keith]
It's funny how you do forget
Where you were before we met
I gave you things you could not dream
Like the 5-0-6 with the Greenwood Range, yeah
Now girl I'd showed you
Life without jewelry
While I loved you
Gave you all of me
Now you act like
Act like you don't know babe
I'm trying to show you
You were the only one

1 - [Keith]
      How can you keep buggin'?
     When you were poor and struggling
     Girl I'm the one that put you on
     Girl I took you shopping
     When you didn't have nothing
     Girl I'm the one that put you on

[Keith] (Rodney)
(Second verse)
Upgraded you to first class flights
And hit you off with so much ice
I had you wearing the finest clothes
Not every guy wants to creep on the low, oh
I thought I told you
You could never find
A love that's better
Better girl then mine
But now you're forcing
It is all because of me
Act like you know
Cause girl I put you on

Repeat 1

[Da Brat]
I tried to tell my nigga not to put you on
Cause I seen your stanky ass around here before
He said that you adored him
But I knew it was fake
You wasn't in love with him
You wanted the money and fame
So he gave you a slash of the good life
Most hood rats wanna do more than see what it looks like
I shook dice, bet ten g's that you were just for one night
And not for keeps, then I saw you in the car with Keith
At the mall, in the club at the bar with Keith
And didn't nobody know you was a homie but me
My homie put you in the dopest clothes and fresh sneakers
And now you wanna showboat and ask if did he
You ain't pretty bitch
You just popular cause them niggaz done hit it
If it wasn't for him icing you down from ear to ankles
Wouldn't nobody check for you?
So you should thank him

Repeat 1

[Keith] (Da Brat)
Let me tell you girl, oh
You rocking ice because of me
You got a jeep because of me
You're looking fly because of me
You got a Benz because of me
You got a house because of me
You got it all because of me
You got minks because of me
I put you on (yeah, yeah)
I put you on (who is put this on? Darkchild)
I put you on (who is on this? Da Brat)
I put you on (Keith Sweat, it's like that)
I put you on (You know Rodney Jerkins is dopest)
I put you on (1999)
I put you on (You know how we do)
I put you on (To the two to the two)
I put you on (Like that from all of my crew)
