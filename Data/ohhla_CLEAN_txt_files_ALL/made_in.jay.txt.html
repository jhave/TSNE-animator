[Frank Ocean]
It'll bring you out the, out the darkness

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet King Martin, sweet Queen Coretta
Sweet Brother Malcolm, sweet Queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet Father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America

[Interlude: Frank Ocean]
Sweet Baby Jesus, oooooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
Oh sweet Baby Jesus, we made it America
Sweet Baby Jesus, oooooh
Oh sweet Baby Jesus, we made it America
Ahh, yes we did

[Kanye West]
I told my momma I was on the come up
She said, "You goin to school, I'll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later she drivin a Hummer
Niggaz hustle every day for a beat from 'Ye
What I do? Turn around give them beats to Jay
And I'm rappin on the beats they was s'posed to buy
I guess I'm gettin high on my own supply
Downtown mixin fabrics tryin to find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic
Uh, a million hits and the web crashes
Damn, South Park had 'em all laughin
Now all my niggaz designin and we all swaggin
Uh, ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker we live it

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance, uh, to my grandma
for that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Uh, our apple pie was supplied through Arm &amp; Hammer
Uh, straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake Nana
Uh, built a republic, uh, that still stands
I'm tryna lead a nation to leave to my little mans
Uh, or my daughter, so I'm boilin this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restorin order
Hold up, here comes Grandma, uh, what's up YaYa?
Uh, what's that smell? Oh I'm just boilin some agua
Uh, no papa, uh, bad Santa
Uh, the streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
Uh, I got my liberty, uh, choppin grams up
Uh, street justice, I pray God understand us
Uh, I pledge allegiance, uh, to all the scramblers
Uh.. this is the Star Spangled Banner

[Chorus]
