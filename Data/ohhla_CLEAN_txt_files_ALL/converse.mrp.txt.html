[Hook]
They're playing basketball
(Who you wit, who you wit, who you wit repeated throughtout)
We love that basketball
(Converse, No Limit repeated throughout the hook in background)
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball
They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

[Master P]
Converse the shoes that everybody love
And I like to wear my Chucks when I step in the club
See the new hitting shoe, it makes me wanna fly
And a fresh pair of Dr. J's make me jump high
And the new MP's come in every color
With some tight soldier gear, now man that's butter
Now see, Converse the shoes that make you look smooth
But our motto is TRU, say no to drugs and stay in school

[Hook]

With some tight soldier gear, man now that's butter
Now see, Converse the shoes that make you look smooth
But our motto stay TRU, just say no and stay in school
