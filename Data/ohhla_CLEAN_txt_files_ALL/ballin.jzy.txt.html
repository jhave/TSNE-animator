[Intro] (Wayne)
Ballin, ballin
Ballin, ballin
(Cut the music off...)
Ballin, ballin
{Yeeaaaaaaaaah, Lil' Lody on the track~!}
(YEAH!)

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
You think you ballin 'cause you got a BLOCK? (WHAAAT?)
He think he ballin 'cause he got a BLOCK? (WHAAAT?)
You know these hoes came to see me ball (WHAAAT?)
You know these hoes love to see me ball (LET'S GOOOO!)
You think you ballin 'cause you got a BLOCK? (WHAAAT?)
He think he ballin 'cause he got a BLOCK? (WHAAAT?)
You know these hoes love to see me ball (WHAAAT?)
You know these hoes came to see me ball (LET'S GOOOO!)

[Young Jeezy]
Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone (Ballin!)
...Think I forgot to put my roof on (Whaaaaaaat?)
Said, "Fuck it, buy another car"
Hopped out the Lamb', said, "Fuck it," bought another car (Yeaaaaaaaaah!)
..I bought the Phantom just to say it's black
..I bought the Phantom just to take a nap (Whaaaaaaat?)
I'm gettin head in the backseat
I'm iced out, I'm standin tall like an athlete
I'm ballin hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home (Ha-haaaaah~!)
I'm on them Diddys', spendin +Dirty Money+
I'm on that Jizzle, spendin birdy money (Woooooooo!)

[Chorus]

[Young Jeezy]
Still ballin like a muh'fucker, tell 'em that!
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques (WOO!)
Ain't got nuttin gold but some gold chains
Say "Jizzle, what's the goal?" Move the whole thang (Ballin!)
..My celly bumpin like a chat line
He bought a five hunnid, man he need a halftime
If yo' job ain't ballin hard, then you need to quit
You need a 18 hard, then you need a split (Yeaaaaaaah!)
Summer's mine (summer's mine), winter too (winter too)
I'm poppin bottles in the club, that's what winners do
..They claimin bitches, them my old hoes
...They claim they ballin, them my old flows

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
....These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggaz think they seein me, they hallucinatin
Bitch I'm ballin, ballin like a mudduh-fucker
12 gauge, bitch I got a dozen of 'em
Nigga broke, actin like they got it doe
I'm wit' a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fuckin - adios!
So many cars I'm like "eeny, meeny, miny, moe"
So many colors in the diamonds -- Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hunnid million dollars flat
Run in ya house, get to poppin at ya shower cap
My homies got them +Firebirds+ like Pontiac
And if them bitches don't sell, we'll buy 'em back (WOOOO!)
