Album:  .. and the Valley of the Jeep Beats
Song:   The Blues
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	I sing the BLUES in the hull of a ship
	beneath the sting of a slavemaster's whip
	I sing the BLUES on a ship anchored to dock
	my family being sold on a slave block
	I sing the BLUES being torn from my first born
	and hung my head and cried
	when my wife took his life
	and then commited suicide
	I sing the BLUES on a slavemaster's plantation
	helpin him build his free nation
	I sing the BLUES in the cotton field
	hustlin to make the daily yield
	I sing the BLUES when he forced my woman to bed
	lawd KNOWS how I wish he was dead
	I sing the BLUES on the run.. {*fades out*}

[Andreas 13]
{It-it-it, it takes, it-it ta-it
 It takes..} solitude, to contemplate a dope rhyme
Drop the bass as I go for mine
13, and I'm chillin with the X Man
I choose to spews the blues, so you can understand
I'm harder than the steel forged in a hot fire
The Prince of Power, the ink of desire
Engagin Andreas in the muck or the mire
I got a storm - and she is a live one
Singin in the background, promisin the stars the moon
and the sun sayin, "Dre' I got a new life
and I've just begun, a rerun might be fun"
Now I play to win the game, to be put on
This is what, gives me the blues, word is bond
So now I'm gone..

	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I sing the blues..}

[Andreas 13]
Now, it's the blues, so don't snooze, check out how I kick it
A def beat that's dope wild and wicked
A mad brother, that is God gifted
So tell me why am I another statistic
Payin all my bills and still bein evicted
Slum lord brought a rate height and I ripped it
Broken lights, and no hot water
You got nerve in here, beggin for a quarter
Burn this bitch down, is what I oughta do
and that's comin from the workin man's point of view
The first of the month and all my bills are due
I pay the light bill and pay the phone bill do
because if I don't, my po' ass is through
My po' ass is through

	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I..}

[Andreas 13]
I got a job - workin and smirkin for Apartheid County
It takes two weeks to step collect my bounty
and damn, I can't believe the way they tax me
A third of my pay G?  Exactly!
Yeah they think they got me, sweatin for a paycheck
Hearin my boss riff with empty threats
But I don't worry, and I don't fret
Just daydream about regrets
Would I do it all over again?  No words
Cause workin everyday, and still bein broke..
.. is strictly to the curb!

	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I sing the blues..}

[Andreas 13]
Now my girl, I tell her that I love her
She says if you do, you must suffer - SUCKA
So she moves in with another - brother
Claimin to me, she needs two lovers
One for the sex, and one for the money
You know which one I was, but not to be funny
Let me tell you all about this sourpuss honey
Was she slick, and was she crummy
cause I believed her when she said she loved me
Oh boy, what a dummy
because behind the back, everyone ain't true
You see I live with someone, and scummy does too
She said, "It's good for me.. if it's good for you"

	{That's why I sing the blues..}
	{That's why I, I have to sing the blues..}
	{Ahhh-hahhh, that's why I.. that's why I..}
	{That's why I got to sing the blues..}
	{ooooh-hooooooooo..}

	{*continues in background w/ variations}

	I sing the BLUES in church on Sunday

	abused on Wednesday, accuased on Thursday
	fried alive on Friday, and died on Saturday
