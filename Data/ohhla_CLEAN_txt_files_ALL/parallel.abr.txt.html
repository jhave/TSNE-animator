[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
When I picture gardens
All I see is squares
I ain't the maddest son
Cuz tragedy impaired
My ability to hurt
And pain makes power
I grew up on a roof across the street from burnin towers
Now it's flowers that I see
On the ground in devotion
Can't stop to smell the roses
Not since my nose is broken
I ain't close to jokin
This ain't no bogus moment
I don't need some hocus pocus
Give a fuck about opponents
On this road I am the quotient
The vision I got is potent
Good riddance to my atonement
Arrogance would write an opus
But I'm not, I'm writin this
I am just a rodent deserting a sinking ship
The water is a bonus
Now the liquid is ubiquitous
I'm drowning as I'm floatin
So my mission is duplicitous
My instrument's the ocean
My attitude is parallel to carousels
Reeling round, feelin grounded on a parasail

[Hook]
Find me gliding
On parallels
You can find me gliding
On parallels

[Verse 2: Emilio Rojas]
I be, I be on some shit again
ABC, BBC, feel the blend
Improving the design like Nicki did with Lil Kim
And nowadays ain't no one movin me a little bit
Their music got me stiller than Riddlin
I'm instilled with a little bit of Nasir and Jay and Em
I'm rappin the hottest and I can tackle the topic like Texas A&amp;M
And I'm a lay the rest of the rumors and the quiet talking
Cuz when they pass the baton it's from the riot squadron
I be lying off in far away lands
On a beautiful beach front
This ain't no Rockaway sand
Pay for everything in cash and dollars out of my hands
Now I only write for money like a government grant
Ain't nothing but bad hoes, bad hoes and bad hoes
Bitch as flat as a flat toe
Ain't that so
I can't help but to act like an asshole
My attitude is parallel to my cashflow
Yeah

[Hook]
Find me gliding
On parallels
You can find me gliding
On parallels

[Bridge]
Hey kid, you're goin somewhere
Concrete and sunshine is out there
Hey kid, you're goin somewhere
So bright, so far and so clear
It's your life, it's your life; it's not theirs
It's your life, it's your life; it's not theirs

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
I put thank you's in a bank
You do what you can while I do what you can't do
I pay dues when they ain't due
So much cash under the mattress springs break like it's Cancun
But I don't measure money in dollars
Instead I barter with honor
It's so much harder to launder actual bills
My thrills come to me in the form of blessings
Every day I'm feeling lucky
And the more that I am Jesse
Then the less that I am stressing
Confession
These recessions don't cause me to feel depression
What's essential is ascension
So what's possessions?
I play positions
I write scripts like physicians
Listen
I'm overboard
Go to war
Shake a spear (William)
No overlords know the score's four to four (million)
Goin door to door
There's no remorse in my vocal chords
My attitude is parallel to gratitude more and more

[Hook]
Find me gliding
On parallels
You can find me gliding
On parallels</pre>
