Hey lil mama let me holla in your ear
Tell you things that I know you wanna hear
You wanna fell good then hit me here (so I can put it on you)
Even though I talk that talk
I swear to you I can walk that walk
You don't believe me then come to my house so (so I can put it on you)
Yo top is hot them jeans is tight
But seeing you naked is a whole another sight
I see you smiling cause you know I'm right girl (girl I can out it on you)

I want you bad I can't even lie
So if you wanna moan and groan hit up my phone

[MH] &amp; (Mike Jones)
Ain't never been a man wanting anything much as I want you (yea)
The sun don't come up til' mornin' so tonight there's no excuse
Just like the rain outside I'll make your love come down so baby now it's time
Just can't wait no more (just can't wait no more)

And if you tell me yes I'll lay you down

We'll do it like we never done before so go and lock that door
Baby don't worry Cause I'll be gentle

[Chorus: MH]
Come on baby turn the lights off let's get naked (ooh come on)
Come on babygirl you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)

[MH] &amp; (Mike Jones)
I know you want this girl I see it in your eyes (yea)

[Mike Jones]
Now we at the house and we all alone
Nobody but us know what's going on
So lets fill the crib up with candle lights
Gotta do it right cause to night the night
It's going down and I can't wait
