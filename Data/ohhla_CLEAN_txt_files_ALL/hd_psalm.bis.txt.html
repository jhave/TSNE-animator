[Verse One]
Man, fuck anybody against me
Either in these streets or this fake ass industry
I said I was gonna make it, but y'all wasn't feelin' me
Niggas said I was just dreamin', oh yeah, well pinch me
Cause these money stacks look hella real
Every time I count it up I know how paper cuts feel
You're ain't supposed to feel pain in a dream are you?
That's right, it's real life bitch, I'm a star
That's why my T's stay extra crispy
They so white, niggas might try to sniff me
Bought some new jeans, ball cap, keep it simple
Shoes clean, my closet look like a mall window
Little bit of Foot Locker, little bit of Men's Land
Whole lot of swap meet and half of Lids man
I got the game rigged, you niggas can't win
Don't make my gun joyride and take you for a spin

[Chorus]
Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no evil to my very last breath
So motherfuckers
Don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
I put that on my momma and my father
Nigga, run up and I'll bomb ya
It's my time to shine
I'm doin' my thing
So haters bow down and crown me king
Ain't nobody hotter
So don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
Amen

[Verse Two]
Not a knife, not a gun, not a tank, not a nuclear bomb
Not a whole army, not a nigga, not no one
Invincible
I'm super nigga
Be sensible cadets
Salute me niggas
Respect your superior
Drivin' by, value high
German engineerin', the Benz, I call it The Fuhrer
So you niggas know the rims is killer
Wooo, take a look inside
Feel that interior
The leather tighter shit than Eddie was wearin'
I gotta floss
Keep them haters and bitches starin'
I'm not N.W.A.
I'm a Nigga Wit Acres
Swiss bankers and private plane hangers
While you broke
Pretend to be gang bangers
Stay in the mirror, perfecting your mean faces
I poke porno bitches
Real gang bangers
I never had to fake and look, I'm still famous

[Chorus]
Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no evil to my very last breath
So motherfuckers
Don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
I put that on my momma and my father
Nigga, run up and I'll bomb ya
It's my time to shine
I'm doin' my thing
So haters bow down and crown me king
Ain't nobody hotter
So don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
Amen

[Verse Three]
My career on steroids
I keep gettin' bigger
Once they put you in the tabloids you done made it nigga
Right between the Loch Ness Monster and Chupacabra
My Hustle &amp; Flow gonna get me an Oscar
Oh I think they like me
You really like me
The bitches visit suck Bishop on the nightly
All the niceties? I ain't fooled
People only kind to me cause I'm signed to dude
To get here, I prayed, slaved, hustled, struggled, balled
If this was overnight, I'd be over tomorrow
I'm still gonna be here
When you ain't here
This a message for you haters to hear
Close your eyes motherfucker if you hate to see me shine
You niggas know you love it, send me a Valentine
I used to be skinny, gap toothed and not a dime
Now I'm rich and buff and I got Invisaline

[Chorus]
Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I feel no evil to my very last breath
So motherfuckers
Don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
I put that on my momma and my father
Nigga, run up and I'll bomb ya
It's my time to shine
I'm doin' my thing
So haters bow down and crown me king
Ain't nobody hotter
So don't bother
No weapon for niggas we shall prosper
Amen</pre>
