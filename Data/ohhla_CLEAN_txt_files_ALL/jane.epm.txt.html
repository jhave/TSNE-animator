Yo, what's up PMD?

[PMD]
Ayo coolin man, done with this album, about to take it up to Leon
Wills, see what they say.

[E] Hold up man, we ain't bringing nothing up until I diss this girl, man.
[P] Aw, you ain't going to go into that Jane thing again?
[E] You know I had to diss her!  I told her don't mess with me, you know?
[P] But why you gotta be bothering with that skeezer?  That was way back
    in 1986!
[E] Let me tell you how it went anyway

[E] Hanging out late drinking a couple of brews
[P] Turn on the radio put the shit on snooze
[E] So when it's time to get up, the radio comes on
[P] Blasting in my ear with the hip-hop song
[E] Five minutes later I hear someone knocking
[P] Yo outside yo, my stereo's rocking
[E] Saying in my mind "Who can it be?"
[P] It was me, the P double E M D
[E] I said yo
[P] I said yo
[E] What's up trooper? I have a girl and she wants me to duke her
[P] Why didn't you?
[E] I woulda have been, only thing she brung along a friend
    So PMD (Yo?) Why don't you do me a favor?
    Chill with the bitch and I'll hook you up later
    She's fly, haircut like Anita Baker
[P] Looked up and down and said "Hmm, I'll take her"
    She came in, I said "Hi my name is P"
    She said "Hello my name is J-A-N-E"
    I said "Jane, oh, what a nice name"
    It reminds me of a high school flame
[E] She came behind me and then she rubbed my back
    She started moaning and said "Yo, let's hit the sack"
    Went to my room because she was kinda bossy
    Girl broke buckwild
[P] And started playing horsey
[E] She showed pain but inside she felt joy
[P] Ayo she broke wild and said "Ride em cowboy!"
[E] Three o'clock on the dot
[P] Tired of busting her
[E] Woke up in the morning to my record "You're a Customer"
    She left me a note, she called me the medicine
    Said next time you have to be better
[P] Bigger
[E] Stronger and much faster
[P] And you don't quit, EPMD rock double
[E] To the funky shit!</pre>
