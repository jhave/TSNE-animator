CHORUS
SPEED DREAMIN SWITCHIN IN THE FAST LANE
SPEED DREAMIN ON IN OVER DRIVE
SPEED DREAMIN GOT IT IN CRUSE CONTROL
TRYING TO GET BACK TO WHERE I SHOULDA BEEN BY KNOW
CADILACS STAND TO THE TREE LINE I MAKING THEN BE LIKE

PULL UP TO A HALT BUT THEN IM THINKING SOMEWHAT OLD

I got funk for all yall from me to the bid dogs
Get your asses up pass the blunt
smoke sum, after this go and poke some
Um excuse me warren I got something about substance abuse

To the bone marrow and soke n linen apparel talkin the double barrel

Atomic dogg knee deep, in the fast lane
With the 454 engine block burnin' rubber for a block cycle like a Hich Cock flik

SUPERCALAFRAGALOCUS you could quote this off that purple

I keep the pedal to the medal speed dreamin
slidin' dip n glidin' chocolate tide eye
com on jump in lets ride hop in the mother ship
and dip with Mista Grimm and Warren G
grap that shiznit

CHORUS

George Clinton

Heres to that someone who cant take the puressure
Mercy for that poor fu who made the news
Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men
cant take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse
It ain't worth the sorrows to cuase the death ......all men
Hes a discrase to the species in to his face with some feacies
Big nose mothafucka got it comin'
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucka
How many days you have to be before you get absent
Warren G with the P you beta step asside I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass
The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin'
Stomp stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with
Warren G stepin' hard but it ain't as hard as it goN get</pre>
