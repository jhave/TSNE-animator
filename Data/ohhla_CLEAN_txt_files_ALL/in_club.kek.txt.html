(*talking*)
Ok, we gon walk up in the set the club
You know, ay check it
We gon do this in the club, when the place is blazing
Packed wall to wall, man the joint amazing
Naw ok we gon do it right here, here we go right here

[Hook - 2x]
We gon do this in the club, when the place is blazing
Packed wall to wall, man the joint amazing
Get your roll on, then light up the tree
You can catch me and my click, in the V.I.P.

[Lil' Keke]
We in the back of the club, and the hoes is shaking
No time for faking, strictly heart breaking
Get another Henn, take it straight to the dome
Where them bad lil' mamas, with that tight shit on
We up in Max's, and my click is repping
Tell the freaks, if they ain't fucking keep stepping
After the club, you know we hit the hot spot
Do it again next week, shit why not
That's the way it go down, time to slow it down
Full of that shit mayn, my body to' down
On the for real, it's all air tight
Make sure you check us, in the fucking club tonight what

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
It's three in the morning, at the after hour
The 4-30 Lex, still running with power
Snatch me some grafas,a nd hit the highway
Baby on my side, and she doing it my way
That's the fly way, constantly smoking
Fresh Afaghan, got these youngsters choking
I know she hoping, we make it happen
I stick to rapping, and I'm not capping
The chick was Latin, speaking Spanish
Had a lil' partna, I called her Manish
Now we flipping, constantly tripping
Fo' deep in the drop, and we steadily dipping
C.M.G., you know we do what we like
We gon head for the club, when the midnight strike
Hit the do' by one, and it's all you see
Is my click headed straight, for the V.I.P. yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Lil' Keke]
Alright let's do it, cause it ain't nothing to it
Stay right up in the mix, cause a nigga use to it
Balling out of control, 24's on swoll
Park that in valet, when it's time to hold
Take the glock out the stash, heavy cocked and loaded
Sit it straight up on my lap, cause I love to tote it
When we up I-10, and I love to roll
Keep the game on hush, cause the game is sold
Yeah the game is cold, when I'm touching the mic
And I'm wrecking on the stage, at the club tonight
This for y'all, from that Don Keke
Get your roll on baby, then light up the tree
