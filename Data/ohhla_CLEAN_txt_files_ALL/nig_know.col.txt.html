These niggaz know

[Verse 1]
Armed and dangerous, call the law
Stick to the script, no audible
Country ass nigga with an Audemars
Can't spell the shit but I order more
French hoes treat me like Charles De Gaulle
Get good head on the Autobahn
Hit hood hoes out in Baltimore
Pack the shows like wall to wall, my God
Five steps like Dru Hill
Came home from the first tour, with
Bad credit and a school bill
Middle finger to the bursar
Finally famous but
Ain't too much really change with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us notorious, that was 9-7
Saw my old teacher and she asked how I'm livin'
You ain't know my shit drop bitch? 9-11
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Gettin' more hoes than that nigga John Legend
Nigga you should too, if you knew
What this game would do to you
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Better me than you

[Bridge]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came on home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggaz know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggaz know

[Verse 2]
These niggaz know, boo-ya nigga?
Came through the door like who y'all niggaz?
Stole a nigga flow, I could sue y'all niggaz
Better yet put a hot one through y'all niggaz
Nah, let me stop frontin' for y'all niggaz but
Don't let the college shit fool y'all niggaz
Ain't the hardest nigga in the land
But a grown ass man, and I will step to y'all niggaz
Like what's the problem?
Ain't gettin' paper, nigga here's a loan
My shit long, need a hair salon
Get it cut, shut the fuck up
And wipe your face with my money 'til your tears is gone
No cryin' ass, lyin' ass
Can't afford a whip, but you buyin' ass
This Fresh Prince nigga, I ain't Jazz
Fucked yo bitch, nigga I ain't ask
She pitched it to me like Sosa (Oh God)
What the fuck was I s'posed do?
Deny that, rather try that, but I never fly that,
Keep hoes bi-coastal
And they buy postals, ain't shit for free
Dick the only thing that they get from me
Sit VIP, get a sip for free
Later on she'll be sippin' me, literally
Picture me at the tip-top
With your bitch lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
This B.I.G. nigga, this Pac
Minus six shots, but it's still this hot
Thirty grand and that's just for the wristwatch
Hate to brag but backpackin', that's hip hop
Write my life and make sure that the script hot
And pray the kids watch, if not
These niggaz know
If not, these niggaz know

[Bridge (x2)]
I must confess, I copped the chains
I hit the club, I made it rain
I hit the road, I made a name
I came on home, I ain't the same
I ain't the same
I ain't the same

[Hook]
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggaz know
Made a mil' off the flow, make sure these niggaz know</pre>
