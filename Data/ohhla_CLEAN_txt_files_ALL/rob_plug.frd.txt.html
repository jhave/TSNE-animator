[Intro]
Fredo Kruger!

[Chorus x2: Fredo Santana]
I'm abouta rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm abouta rob my plug
I'm abouta rob my plug (my plug)

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Trapper of the year, bitch I can't stop trappin'
Weed so stanky, you can smell it through the pack
Put it in the pot, then I pack it in the plastic
Crack doing numbers clucka say I got magic
But if you run up on me then, it's gonna be a tragic
Them bullets get to flyin', couple bodies and a casket
A fiend for that money, I swear I'm an addict
Wherever it's at, when I see it, I just grab it
The 30 that I'm packin', rob me, it ain't happen
Now you on the news for this.40 that I'm blastin'
My plug, he be taxin', but I'm a set him up
Have my killas in his house, whoever they see, they wettin' up

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
My trap don't slow up, supplyin' 'til they stop us
Hop out, nigga, we ain't servin', unless your car parked
Bitches see me starstruck, niggas wanna play tough
Actin' like they want war, this 'K will tear your face off
Last week robbed the kush man, this week rob the dope man
Heard you holdin' work man, get your ass poked, fam
Thinkin' this is your fam, then I kick your door in
Everybody on the ground - Ballout bring them ropes in!
Kush smoke, kush smoke - all I do is kush smoke!
Disrespect my set, then you fuck around and get smoked!
[?] with your wife, ask my shooters what they in for
Fed ass niggas - snitching, giving info!

[Chorus]</pre>
