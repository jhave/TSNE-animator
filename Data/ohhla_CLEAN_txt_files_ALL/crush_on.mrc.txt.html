[Mr. Cheeks]
Take it from the top with nothin but the hot shit
I told 'em we got shit and it smells (definitely)
Mario, what's the verdict?
Hey yo, Mr. Cheeks, I know ya heard it
The way we move (make it happen), spaz out on who?
Boo c'mon, that's how we do it
This one's for you, c'mon

I did it like the Elements and wrote a song for ya
No kiddin, where my billins gettin strong for ya
And if I really had a chance I'ma pick you
You got plans and finesse, you dress sick too
I'ma holla at you everytime ya pass by
And if I don't get you now this ain't the last try
You play hard to get, I like steppin up ma
Like bend over, yeah we both got enough time
And yousa don, so take this where ya go
Anywhere you at you'll always hear the call
In ya ear, in ya heart, until I gets through
And that's my word, I'm not stoppin till I get you
I know your pretty ass for years but don't know ya know ya 
We get Manola and I feel like I got some things to show ya
I've done traveled through the world
Balled out at clubs and coughed hurl
Got weed, now I need me a girl

[Mario Winans]
I've got a crush on you, my baby
So let's put a rush on us, sweet lady
Maybe we can share our love with things we got from (???)
Cuz I got a crush on you, my baby

[Mr. Cheeks]
Come back, I'ma keep this Mo' on show for ya
Imagine if you felt the same way I feel for ya
Yeah, you see, that would be something
This thing we can have together, but you be frontin
Take your time though, I don't really mind
Anytime I'ma make your pretty ass mine
So keep doin what you doin till you ready for a
Big nigga like me cuz I'm ready for ya
Yeah, holla back shorty I'm waitin
Ready and willing, anticipatin
Whenever you call I'll be there in a double
If you need me for love or you in some trouble
It don't matter what it is, I'm there
Baby girl, open up, listen I'm here
Tell me if there's anything I could bring for ya
Chicken wing though a nigga got a thing for ya

[Mario Winans]
I've got a crush on you, my baby
So let's put a rush on us, sweet lady
Maybe we can share our love with things we got from (???)
Cuz I got a crush on you, my baby

[Mr. Cheeks]
Listen, last but not least, before I go
There's something else that you should know
I'm your number one man when I add you to my plans
I mean when your brain lands
Delicate like a flower, I'ma love you with all my power
Think about you every minute of the hour
All I need is a number and a chance
Save me the last dance

[Mario Winans]
I've got a crush on you, my baby
So let's put a rush on us, sweet lady
Maybe we can share our love with things we got from (???)
Cuz I got a crush on you, my baby

Ohhhh, ohhhhh
I got a crush on you, ohhhhh yes I do
Ohhhh, ohhhhh
I got a crush on you, my baby baby baby baby baby

I've got a crush on you, my baby
So let's put a rush on us, sweet lady
Maybe we can share our love with things we got from (???)
Cuz I got a crush on you, my baby

[Mr. Cheeks]
Baby we can hang out later on
I can sing this song</pre>
