Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
My bitch bad I think I like her
Aw thats my shawty she really really down for me
She do whatever I say, she gone hold the weight
And if she catch a case she ain't gone' say a thing
Thats my shawty she really really down for me
Thats my shawty she really really down for me
My bitch bad I think I like her
Aw thats my shawty she really really down for me

[Verse 1]
Yeah she down for me when no one is around for me
When shit get fucked up when shit get ugly
I swear she one bitch I can count on
And on her phone "Rob My Plug" her ringtone
[plays Rob My Plug ringtone]
I swear man I think that I'm falling for her
I swear man I think I'm 'bout to spoil her
And all you broke niggas can't afford her
She got her own man I swear I can't ignore her
And when she hit me up, she got some money for me
She know I'm whipped I ain't like them other dummies

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I can't fuck with chu if you ain't got your money up
Broke bitches they be on some funny stuff
Only wanna hang cause' I got my money up
But I only want some head while I'm off this double cup
When I give away she make sure it double up
I swear man I can't find no other one
I swear to god my bitch is super down for me
She even go to Cali to get them pounds for me
And if you try to rob us she got that thing on her
That bitch gives me a finesse you can't ? on her

[Chorus]</pre>
