[Verse 1]
I can hear it happenin' again
Frequencies form the outer limits tappin' in
To my brain implants
Telling me it's time for impact
Gotta start smashin' shit
Immo turn the whole city to a vacant lot
The mothership's comin' and it needs a landing spot
A building collapsed while I'm still spittin' raps
I get chills from the thrill of the kill and then still
In the back of my mind, I hear my conscious call
My woman and child, that;s where my conflict starts
I'm too connected to take them away
So I'll keep them protected, but no one else is safe
I know that it's selfish and everyone else will be helpless
When I go into overkill
And start loosing control of my motor skills
'Cause soon, Immo be remote controlled by them
It's gone be ulgy

[Hook]
This is the new danger
Bizarre behavior fueled by my anger
And it's gettin' more live-er
Fire
Devastation let loose from my chamber
When the cannon bangin' out bangers, you'll testify you ain't seen nothin' stranger
And in the end you'll see standing right there
Staring at you with a glare
This is the new danger
Bizarre behavior fueled by my anger
And it's gettin' more live-er
Fire
Devastation let loose from my chamber
And yes heads are gone fly
So many people are gone die
And in end I'll still be standing right there
You can't prepare for this heavenly nightmare

[Verse 2]
I can feel this energy within me to fuck up anything in my path
It's a sudden thirst for destruction I wish I could hold back, but can't fight the wrath
I can't control my emotion
My mind done swung off the chain
I'm unstable
The rage that I had contained has spilled over
Painted my landscape with pain
This only means the end fast approaches
There's no way to brace for the impact, explosion
Every direction I look turns to fire
My humanity was so quick to expire
I'm wired
And you will be grabbing ya seats when the thrashing of beats meets gnashing of teeth
And actually
I ain't behaved this way since the last time I smashed me a planet to pieces
It's over

[Hook]
