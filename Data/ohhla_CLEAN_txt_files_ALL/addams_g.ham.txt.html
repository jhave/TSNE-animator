*they do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and the slap a friend
The addams family

Now I was cold coolin', you know (maxin' and relaxin')
Just kickin' it around the house (oaktown kicking' it)
When a knock, a knock, a knock and a voice yo!
Can hammer come out? (what's up?)
Now I don't mind (mind) being a friend
And showin' a little bit of flava (flava)
But wednesday, pugsley, gomez, fester (oh man)
Man, them some strange neighbours

*

I remember the day I needed to borrow
A little of pepper (for my chicken)
The next thing you know, comin' at me
Was a hand with the fingers high steppin' (I'm witcha)
Now I tried to play it along (you know)
And act like I was havin' a ball (ha ha)
But what do I see (yo) a perm with feet (cousin it)
Standin' about three feet tall (I'm outta here)

*

Speakin' and thinkin' about the addams
You know the hammer is with it (I'm with it)
Act a fool, no bones, swooop, goofy and randy
You know we kick it (the posse)
Now is the time to get in your mind
It's ok to be yourself (be yourself)
Take foolish pride and put it aside
Like the addams, yo! they def (that's a family!)

*

(addams) too legit
(addams) too legit
(addams) too legit (who's too legit?)
(the addams family)
(you know what I'm saying, the addams)
(addams) too legit (oh yeah)
(addams) too legit (talkin' 'bout the addams now)
(addams) too legit (I'm saying it's the addams now)

They dok what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend
(the addams family)

I'm tellin' you I saw the hand

They do what they wanna do, say what they wanna say
Live how they wanna live, play how they wanna play
Dance how they wanna dance, kick and they slap a friend

Thank you, thank you, now check this out</pre>
