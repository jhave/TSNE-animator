Mm hmm
Ok, Ok
Yeah
Y'all thought I lost it

[Verse One: Cee-Lo]
In no fashion have I lost my passion for the pen
It's just that lately life has been a lost less inspirin
To tell you the truth trials and tribulations is very tirin
I gotta play a little game of gimmick and gunfirin
I'm not aspirin to be any lower or higher than,
I get equal as in eye to eye again
I'm the truth, I'm complicated I'm all ready but try again
I've got to die once to never ever die again
And what I believe within I engrave within my skin
And one thang that I ain't is a saint without a sin
How could there be a now if there never was a then?
That is unbalanced just like the yang without the yen
I am distinguishably deeper as opposed to the paper-thin
And I breathe oxygen, and you rhymin bout rocks again
You stagnant, standing still enough to feel the world spin
I'm beginning to smell the end in the path of the blowing wind
Hopefully I'm fortunate enough to spend forever with a friend
I'm slow dancing with destiny every day until then
When I first got my big break I said that I would never bend
And discredit my character to keep up or contend
And my belief beat baseline secrete such a special blend
I am not like them at all and I cannot pretend
I am not like you at all and I cannot pretend.

[Hook]
DAMN
That shit was funky
You heard that nigga?

DAMN
Shawty Lo
(yup, c'mon)

[Verse Two: Cee-Lo]
I get off on an extension or compare comprehension
I'm in a classroom of my own, I'm too far gone for competition
Yet I'm never obnoxious with my obvious ambition
Perfectly imperfect is my dimension's definition
I engage my pen pierces the page so that it bleeds my intention
With honorable mention of God's divine intervention
I'm incredible I'm inevitable and there's no possible prevention
I'll hardly (have to) scream my dream and I'll have your undivided attention
The powers that be will be beaten into submission
And you will be able to see my revolution on television
You'll get an aneurysm fuckin around with my head on collision
With the power to get you dead and half the dead risen
I remember when my development was arrested
I was doin time on my mind misguided and misdirected
I was sick, so sick if I spoke to you you'd be infected
Then my conscience was cleared of all charges and I came out corrected
Reinvented, refined, replenished and well rested
On a mission for a medium to manifest the thoughts I collected
After that everything I breathed upon, I blessed it
I committed crimes of passion and my soul was suspected
But it was thrown out of court because of course the Creator and I connected
He told me, "fear not for thou art protected. Your life is being requested
And you are being tested, so make every attempt you can to expect the unexpected."

[Hook]

Mm mm mm
Boy that Lo boy

DAMN
Oh Lawd
Cee-Lo why you do it like that?
You aint have to bustin all like that, man
Makin these lil rappers feel like they can't rap

DAMN
I got some more, I got some more if you want some.

[Verse Three: Cee-Lo]
I am internally evolving entirely
Extensive eclectic expression eloquently
Instantly innovative, Courageously creative
I'm driven, this God given gift it comes naturally to the native
Not a need for the dramatics or the systematic
Simplicities, strictly science and mathematics
The mastermind of the mighty mystical and magical moves
And metaphors manifests masterpieces
Thoroughly fury through the inner mind's eye establishes this syn-thesis
Of these innermost, insightful, intriguing interpretations of extreme intelligence
My commonsense is no co-incidence
Caution: competitors approach carefully
I'm able to see
Rare ranges of distance, I expect respect
There's no tolerance for negligence, never
You'll forever
Feel the wrath of the pure and powerful poetry, permanently
Pre-meditative, political, critical, compellin, story-tellin
Defining desire, faith fuelin the fire
Brilliance, ?? philosophical, psychological willingly waging warfare,
Withstandin, commandin, demandin the listening ears to hear what God's forcin
Instead endorsin education. Equality, not hate
Just revolution of the mind state
Note mere words but emotions
Which is essential, influential provin my people's potential
Militancy, innocence, insight, listen to God then write
Since my birth date I been tight!
Shit

[Hook]

Now I don't want never hear nobody else say
goddamn a nigga from the South can't rhyme
NEVER!

DAMN
Hehehe...Now can I do my shit??</pre>
