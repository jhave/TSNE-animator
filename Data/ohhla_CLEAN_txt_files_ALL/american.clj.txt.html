March... {*4X*}
Boomdizzle baby
Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have these chicks
Some kind of slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic
Man, American girls are somethin to see
I bet Thomas Jefferson would love BET
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marchin band
Uncle L, I love the heartland
South Carolina, they're lookin so tan
Out in Kansas, they're so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know what'cha after
Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin to gas ya
American girl, no doubt who the best are
I get harder faster than a car from NASCAR
Make Paul Revere wanna ride again
The red coats are comin, fuck it, let 'em in
The King of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone
Teeny bikini, red white and blue
A-merican girl, I salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the midwest, as sweet as dessert be

[Chorus]
I see you out there dancin; looks like you need romancin
You're my American girl, A-merican girl
You know I wanna hold you; here's somethin you can roll to
You're my American girl, A-merican girl (march ladies!)
Left, left, left-right-left (march ladies!)
Right, right, right-left-right (march ladies!)
Left, left, left-right-left (march ladies!
Right, right, right-left-right (march ladies~!)

[LL Cool J]
I'm so glad that French helped us out
Now you free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers would've been hot and bothered
Watch boomdizzle, you know what I'm talkin about
From Philadelphia to Illinois
St. Louis, Alabama, country grammar
Queens, New York, Detroit to Montana
Today's your day girl, let's raise the banner
Benjamin Franklin, I so wanna thank him
Take a look at these girls, they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes, redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl
Champagne corks were burstin in the air
Gave prove through the night, my girls were still there
I'm a drum major, leadin you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake what'cha momma gave ya
Oh, oh, say can you see
by the dawn's early light
Par-ty with me every night
Let down your hands, alright
Whatever you do, don't lose this all fast
I'ma have to fly my flag at half mast
You go girl, you make me wanna holla
I'd take George off and put your boobs on the dollar

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
I'm the master of the ceremony go 'head yell
Put your hands in the air ring the Liberty Bell
I give you the John Hancock if you don't tell
Let's have the Boston Tea party, what the hell!
Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double D's never troubled me
Thank God that Columbus made that discovery
The Queen of Spain spent some change
Now Paris Hilton, is pushin the Range
Stars ride by while the chauffeurs drive
But all you girls with 9-to-5's dance with pride
This is the USA, great to be alive
Great watch the video with them big ol' thighs
Brown and blue, green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize
Any shape or size, all different types of vibes
Around the way girls, ready to ride
Farmer's daughter on the John Deere with pride
Conservative blue bloods, intelligent minds
with them Girls Next Door, they put me under a spell
I'm on top of the world, I'ma screamin to tell
I love the USA girls
Almost as much as when the Giants beat Green Bay, girl

[Chorus]</pre>
