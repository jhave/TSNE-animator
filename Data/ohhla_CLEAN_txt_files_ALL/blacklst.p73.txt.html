In the beginning it's good..

[Chorus: MF Doom &amp; Aesop Rock]
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the tracklist
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis

[MF Doom]
I can stop anytime I want to
Famous last words that came back to haunt you
All your life like permanent dry tears
Some cats get it like no bright ideas
He caught the reckonin vow
Said he couldn't do it without the crowd
For crying out loud
Even took the time to contaminate the rhyme scene
And drop a line before he was out in the time machine
A lot of rappers is drama queens
Fuddy duddy when it comes to the mic
I'm a fiend that's buddy buddy
Fuck around and get your title took, cut and dry
He doesn't lie even like who and where, what and why??
Hold it like a cube button
Buttonfly poom poom
Once he leave the room, they be like DOOM, DOOM, DOOM
Its no use blessed the design
Then the Villain has left the buildin, dressed to the nines
Like I'mma do mines and ya'll do ya'lls
He stay reppin the game like Lou Rawls
The Super MF Villain feel 'em like two balls
For the microphone he jonesed like two falls
We will see after these scrimmages who falls
A lot of ya'll image is reminiscent of Rupaul
Gall to brawl and we'll be needing new drawers
JAWS the one twos that run through walls

[Chorus: MF Doom &amp; Aesop Rock]
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the tracklist
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis

[Aesop Rock]
All in it together now (Now)
Some of the misadventures of a father crop
My provider chop's flashin'
See, I'm a stop that gut reaction
Bound to tackles when a battle runs in circles
Like rodeo clowns with paddles
Poked in the belly by petty sarcasm
Gentlemen, start your laugh tracks
Push pins for the lab rat breed
All I wanna be is a fat cat sleeping 40 nights (nights)
In hopes that when I rise
The hacker mass will have seen there's more to life
Let's recreate a perfect service rooted in labor lust
And a discipline prisoner
I don't work a thick antithesis
Parallel park your burning prod adjacent
To the flagrant iron ego valve
Let us study a weaker outlet
I bound thieves (I bound thieves)
I bound thieves that tap me on the shoulder
Asking where's the case's war and how to make it sleep
I pointed toward the exact place my sneakers met the creedence
Said If I could answer questions (who), I would be relief.
Now classify don't got em shook by exposing the skeletons
Yeah I sorta stick to a more murky-hurt development
Some of these kids are spittin just a bit too delicate a thesis
If only--Yeah, but holy jumpin Jesus!
I get torn swiftly from a planet while it tilts, twenty-three
Look buddy, we've gotta talk
God made me a fine instrument of style
Zig-zag Zeus fist
Don't make me hurl these great bolts blindly until your mood shifts
Now here comes forty acres of congruency pistons
Equipped with skeleton community systems
Aw, it'll be something incredible
See, I know the limit (Limit)
That's why I do my best to stay quiet
Whenever I ain't spittin the gimmick

[Chorus: MF Doom &amp; Aesop Rock]
Keep in mind this flow is used for practice
Even so still top choice off the tracklist
Far as I know we've been blacklist
For as long as the earth rotate on a 23 degree axis</pre>
