[Big Boi]
Nigga wanna think these boys don't blow
Hoe you see them snortin them coke
Chaos still don't give you a hoe
Maybe you think the music is low
Maybe you say, the niggaz is wack
If he asks, want some crack
If you do that, you never come back
Back to life, reality black
Pump pump pump pump pump the brakes
Analyze shit got down to stakes
Take a shortcut tryin to win the race
Whatchu gonna do when you step in the place?
At a player's place, nigga takin my time
What he gon' say when I freak the rhyme?
How you gon' feel when I skeet the 9?
Buck buck buck nigga on the run
Niggafied cause we still on the grind in the trap for the dope boys
Speedballin freefallin in my own moon and my own zone
Boy life is short gonna suck it up
Arsty-fartsy nigga fuck it up
Down in the trenches, press your luck
Assed out like you in the butt, nigga what?

  My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!
  I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!
  I can't help myself, I'm on fire!
  Ha ha ha ha
  My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!
  I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!
  I can't help myself, I'm on fire! I'm on fire!
  Ahh good God!
  My soul is burnin, about to catch fire!
  I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!
  I can't help myself, I'm on fire!
..Ah good Lord, my soul is burnin, about to catch fire!
  I'm overheated, about to catch fire-hah!
  I can't help myself, I'm on fire!
  I'm on fire!  {*music fades out*}</pre>
