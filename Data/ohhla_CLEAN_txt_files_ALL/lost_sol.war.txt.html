[Warcloud]
The yard was full of Elephant Men, I kicked the jukebox
Strangled you in a park that night, I came with two glocks
Clapping through, loop shots, sling shot and bust them
Get that ass, bust sterling gat never mistrust them
It's like Lou Gehrig's disease, he pulled the gun out
A mind quite seriously the falling stone uniform
Stomp the upper toilet, dawn firing range of rage
Roid rage, gat bust, act up you will get smacked up
Power will be arise to Lexington to one of the British
A defeated Washington retreats across to Delaware
Never in my heart congress markets that's legal
Meet Trembling Eagle, two Desert Eagles in war paint
Homemade by war heads, pharmaceutical numeral
Your famous funeral, air fortress fearless
Frontiers sauna from the facility of the flesh fossils
And folklores of flexible, fluorescent, furious future
Forgive fatal Foot Soldier's flag force
Faculty fade away, first class Faberge fabric
Fanatic foes in formula flow
Forever force freaks fancy foreigners
Afford to fall behind is to fall asleep, fierce fiery flight fleet
Bludgeon flawlessly ferociously fluctuates frightening fantasy
Unforgiven forbidden fugitive's flamboyant flashback fiasco
Fathom 4th of July fable, his worst thought, final photosynthesis
Folk of the feedback board
The skill of sword or fighting with the fist
Flossy, flashy, festering far fog mount face breaker
Flaming flying famous Frankenstein factory, vocals on coastal</pre>
