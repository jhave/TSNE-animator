[Drake]
I'm more than just an option (hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it takin over

[Chorus: Drake]
I better find yo' lovin, I better find yo' heart
I better find yo' lovin, I better find yo' heart
I better find yo' lovin, I better find yo' heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart

[Drake]
I'm more than just a number (hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember, and

[Chorus]

[Drake]
It's more than just a mission (hey, hey, hey)
You hear but you don't listen (hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missin

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Too many times, I've been wrong
I guess bein right, takes too long
I'm done waitin, there's nothin left to do
but give all I have to you and
I better find yo' lovin (find yo' lovin)
I better find yo' heart (better find yo' heart)
I better find yo' lovin (find yo' lovin)
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart (tear us apart)
...
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart (tear us apart)</pre>
