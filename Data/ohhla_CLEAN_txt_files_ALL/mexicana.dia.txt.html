[Diamonique]
Uhhhhh-uh
Uh
Yeah
Diamonique
Yeah
Icky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky (Gettin' hot in here, baby)

[Chorus 2X: Diamonique]
Soy una Mexicana, cana
Y me gusta fumar marijuana, juana
Passa la yesca, yesca
Y toca la yesca, yesca

[Verse 1]
Diamonique stay smokin' on the trees
Brought a cumbia flow, mixed in with a little street
I'm hot, ready to set it on fire
Passa la because I wanna get higher
I say
No to droga, I zig
Zag the douja, I'm a
Lil' loca out
Pass on the coca, got that
Purple kush
By the bush
Shake that tush
Give it a poof
I'm the head chiefa, always hittin' the reifer
Glad to meet ya, the queen mamacita
Uh
Somebody put a blunt to the sky
For this Mexican mami cause I like to get high

[Chorus] - 2X

[Hook: Diamonique]
Prende lo
Passa el lleno y prende lo (Icky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky)
Subelo
Dile a DJ, subelo (Icky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky-ficky)

[Verse 2]
Passa la yesca
I'm from the west side
Don't mess with this esa, na
I won't let ya
Bout ya if I don't smoke
On some hydro
Puts me in the zone, blown
Damn, I'm so gone
These, they pumpin' blunts like nothin'
Homeless up in here, E-Dubb is keepin' it subbin'
Fingazz on my right
This is Street Light
Passin' yesca, I'm as high as a kite

Repeat Hook

[Chorus] - 2X

[Diamonique]
All my papis say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey
All my mamis say
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
