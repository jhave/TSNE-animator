What what
For my family, nigga
This for my family, nigga
H-World in here (Yeah)
All Out in here (Yeah)
Bad Boy in here (Yeah)
Some nigga's don't never learn
Don't never learn, uh

You know we used to see eye to eye, now it's just hi and goodbye
You gon' go against the fam', damn, why you wanna die?
I know where you reside right there on the East Side
Street wise, I don't just roll alone we ride
Loon all smoked up, Meeno wanna rob you
J might feel you, Hud wanna kill you
Mase wanna let it slide, Stase wanna get you high
And walk you in that wrong building
Now you at the wrong place, and it's at the wrong time
You got a long face cuz now you see this long Nine
But whatchu lookin' scared for, nigga?
You only in some things you ain't prepared for
It ain't that you not my man, but Mase my man more
And family is the only thing I stand for
Blinky Blink, yo, I know alotta nigga's tell you this, dog
But I would die for you nigga

 	Blood is thicker than all this here
	Don't be worrying 'bout the cars, the clothes
	The money or these hoes
	Blood is thicker than all this here
	Cuz anything you love in life
	You can't take it when you go

	Blood is thicker than all this here
	Don't be worrying 'bout the cars, the clothes
	The money or these hoes
	You know blood is thicker than all this here
	You heard me, blood is thicker than all this 
	Blood is thicker than all this, blood is thicker than all this

I'll be whatever you call this 
I'm Cash Money like them Hot Boys in New Orleans
That thin vest you got on, slugs'll go through all this
And burn, so when you see me salute and fall in
I'm real and only the real would understand me
Got love for my nigga's that's why the chicken's can't stand me
Wasn't for your mami I woulda got the grammy
But that's what nigga's get goin' against they family
Know a boy dealin' with Stase, get dealt with manly
Whatchu think the cops could do, come and can me
Bell was Plan A, nigga's go wit Plan B and end no where
Cuda Love or Cardan, bein what about Dre
That's my nigga, going against Stase I clap my nigga 
When money involved it get solved with automatics
You don't mess wit' me, you mess wit' Hud and there you have it

Repeat 1

And truthfully a nigga can't do nuthin' to me
On the real you know my nigga B.I.G. used to school me
Said never do a show for less than a QT
If a nigga get to you, he gon' get through me
And if a mugger move wrong I put one in his coffee
If a nigga shoot at you, you know he gotta shoot at me
More then less, my mother used to warn me for the best
Said Mase, nigga's gon' love you, nigga, long as you fresh
Long as you hot, long as you cop
Long as you not that nigga who be doin' never come through the block 
But think about it now Mase, who wouldn't love you alot
You take nigga's around the world with girls suckin they cock
But just because a nigga ride witchu, fly witchu, high witchu
That don't mean when bullets come he gon' die witchu
It be them niggas you be knowing that long 
You be killed, run up the block with your new Rolley on
Don't be quick to flip a nigga brick and spend what's on
Cuz if they recognize you stole them pots, bring the war
Now you could skate now or stick around
But don't be afraid to call the name when this all go down
You feelin' me now?
Cuz if I'm showing you something that you never seen
Then you gon' shake when you see this dusty M-16 come off the shelf
I know we kill for what but what they brought
Nigga we came to kill you, got the gun put in sto'
And what about the block nigga's, can't get nuthin' in his coat
Cuz them the same nigga's we took 'em on, they wanted to smoke
So leave them niggas there
