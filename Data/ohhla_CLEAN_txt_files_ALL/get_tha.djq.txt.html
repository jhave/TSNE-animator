Ay check this out Quik
Ay man this shit tripped me out one day man
My Uncle told me man right, I asked him for a dollar right?
He said man - any of them lil' girls at yo' school?
Do they say they love you? Do they say they'll do anything for you?
I said yeah man, all the time - right?
He looked at me dog.. {*laughing*}
.. and he said, man some of 'em wasn't playin

[Suga Free]
Straight from my momma hoe, she said boy you betta tell that bitch to kick
Forget about the dick, get, turn a trick, then yell GERONIMO!
Suga Free, I keep it V.I.
If lovin the pimpin is wrong Pimpin, I don't wanna be right!
She said her childhood was bad - grind, tellin the pimpin
She got molested by her dad - all she want is attention
Now you want somethin else to feel though? Nigga you mean to tell me
you'd rather settle for apple instead of a peach?
Man a square bitch instead of a real hoe? Huh? What, she cool?
Yeah trick as long as you pay for that cocina you the motherfuckin fool
"Hey Suga Free man, you still the shit!" Ah yeah man
That's cause I cracks my whip a lil' bit
and fuck 'em real hard without givin 'em no dick
What the hell fo'? Like you really give a fuck about this dick
And if you did get a lil' bit you'll get lazy and let the pussy sell slow
*tchk* Oh brother, nine-one-one's mortician and the other
But fuck her, she came to pay not to stay so get another

"Oh my gosh!"  "Lil' bitch."  "Make the money hoe!"
  "On!"  "Ugly-ass bitch!"  "Yes honey, 
  you sho' take me to work in style!"
"Oh my gosh!"  "Lil' bitch."  "Make the money hoe!"
  "On!"  "Tell me some of that old lies of yours,
  and make me stop thinkin about the truth!"

[Suga Free]
Here I go!  Yo!
Shit they finally let the pimpin out the pen, HERE I GO!
Bitch what you mean wait?  Yo
Now didn't waitin make the motherfuckin bread break?
And didn't fuckin that bitch make you predictable?
And when you woke up in the mornin, wasn't you still broke?
She loves her pimp, stays dapper for him
If she got any dreams, you want them too
Take her to the county, fill out that CH-7 form
Nigga I ain't the motherfuckin sucker
I pop my collar everytime I swaller, wholeness
Rippin the linin up out that motherfucker!
Bitch-ass niggaz hatin sayin, "I don't see how he do it"
That's cause they scared of the rules
Lookin for naps and no backbone to put into it
If I hang around NINE, MO', MOTHERFUCKERS, JUST, LIKE, YOU
I WOULD BE THE TENTH!
"Why don't you straighten up and get a job?"

"Oh my gosh!"  "Lil' bitch."  "Make the money hoe!"
  "On!"  "Ugly-ass bitch!"  "Yes honey, 
  you sho' take me to work in style!"
"Oh my gosh!"  "Lil' bitch."  "Make the money hoe!"
  "On!"  "Tell me some of that old lies of yours,
  and make me stop thinkin about the truth!"</pre>
