Intro: Raekwon the Chef 

Yeah yeah, that's us 
Hit me hit me hit me, I ain't got nothin to do with none of that 
Besides, whatever 
Louis Rich Diamonds (yeah) 
12 O'Clock, Gambinos 
Those crazy boneyard boys is back once again 

Verse One: 12 O'Clock 

It's nine-six I'ma bang you with some hits 
In two-thousand six I got my son makin hits 
A nine to five it's a job to survive 
F--k the lies and connives and all them company bribes 
I'm Family Ties for my seeds I'd die 
I want the whole f--kin pie save them slice for eighty-fives 
And besides, see I never had a million 
Got beefs that got millions and in buy-outs worth billions 
Knotty n-gga with a plan platinum jam 
Found a million fans in the Lexus to the Lands 
So whose the cat in the comfy black Ac? 
As a matter of fact, I sick/six fingers I'm from fat 
My projects be the livest that it gets 
Watch me ---- back Tex and do murders in the backsteps 
I want that b---h with a Lex, a house out in New Mex 
She disrespect, she buys a Rolex 
12 O'Clock sells you stock business 
Drive in Benzes, see my dog were tremendous 
In case I didn't mention 
I'm killin your whole startin team and all them n----z on the benches 
So please play your distance 
I'm givin a sentence that pull more pain than a dentist 
Most def, I'm professional 
Twenty G's a show, Germany to Tokyo 
Show me lies, suck my beach 
I got fans in Puerto Rico that love what I throw 

Chorus: Raekwon 

Introducing these nasty immigrants 
Who want to flinch, move on him he got bank like Merill/Lynch 
Styles recorded like a porcelain swordsman 
So let RaZAh rip across your face, you're frosting 

Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 

Push this s--t out like nine months 
Rock Swahali and suede fronts, get paid from n----z 
lifestyle, like a knife in a child 
Mail the brick out, Israel, mistrial, blowin like fish scale 
Wu, dominate s--t majorly, flavorly 
Jubilant cats they keep pagin me 
Peace what's the signs ock? 
Fruit of life like the apricot 
Cocktails tossin em at cops on blocks 
Park Hillian, drug hillbillies made billions 
Get a gun, kidnap, eight nine Jimmyians 
Yo, he had about this amount in his Swiss account 
Gunnin this out we reminesces on this b---h's house 
Back in time, was a bad fiend 
Now I flex mad green get cream seven-fifty n----l gleam 
Say hi to chocolate t--i f----d lives 
Stop and analyze in eighty-five Hawaiian c--e flex three lives 
Caesar Halfmoon, pardon my scalp 
Buildin and breathin 
You front I'll leave your ass bleedin and sweetened
