Intro:
Yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
This is for only certain people (word up)
This is for all my peoples in the struggle
All my peoples in jail
All my peoples dyin' to live

Verse One:
On my way home alone I took the shoertcut through the danger zone
Ran into alligator looking Jerome
I jumped out the truck all drunk
Nuts hanging out the car like "what?"
Nigga, I gives a fuck
He said "what up" I said "what up"
He said "I need to be up"
I went in my nuts hit him with a 100 yo
He gave me a glare with sparklin' gold teeth
And said
Yo Keith, your product is always peace
Yo son, you know I just got released
I was on the block and got bagged by pussy police
And they the reason why Calvin is deceased 
The bullshit will never cease but dough is comin' at least
I gave him a pound and a hug
Told him "hold it down thug"
Peace
I'm a fleece cuz its hotter than fish grease
We was high as a kite
Feelin' kinda petro
I metroed
My way back to the Montero
Before I even made it to the car door
I was rushed by 2 jakes 
and then 2 more
so here wew are fightin' through all the excitement I ask
What you lockin' me up for?
One said Secret Indictment

Chorus: (2x)
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
The gates are locked 
And you are trapped inside

Verse Two:
Starin' at the face of the judge
With the identical image of a true thug
I shoulda smuggled in a shotty (word up)
Cuz they tryin' to treat me like I killed somebody
And what the D.A. had to say
Wasn't justice in no kinda way
Under the doc number 284389
We the people recommend upstate time
I said your honor
I can't even see that far
That's when my lawyer started droppin' the repetoir
He said your honor
These allegations against my client are very undefient
Toward the contrary
The judge said
Mr. Murray didn't I tell you if you in my courtroom again 
Your ass is gone a long time
Then he presumed
Plus your a member
Of the notorius gang
the Legion of Doom
He said look at me
Thought he shook me
I turn around and the bastard 
Through the book at me
I hope this teaches you a lesson
A half a million dollar bail
Boom
This court is in session

Verse Three:
I reach the tear visions of pair
Remind me I'm locked up
So I got no chance but not to give a fuck
Check out my perspective as it dropped
A lock across ya chest
And bust ya snotbox
Technicalites make me wanna bust chops and cops
And murder flocks in all actualities
That's a necessity in my recipe
Plus it was a black cop that framed me
And if it ain't one thing
It's another ask my brother
Went in jail for one thing
Stayed in for another
So here I am frustrated
Sittin' in jail
Thinkin' bout all my unfinished business left in the world
I hopped on the jack connect with my connect
Told him what I was up against
Plus they found a Tech
Get the cash together
Put up the car and the house
We on the jail phone
So watch what come out ya mouth
In 24 hours I was out
But the situation's never ended
Cuz the case is pended
