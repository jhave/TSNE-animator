Don't stop I'm not finished yet
you ain't doin' it right until ya hands get wet
Remix, check this uhh come on.
Don't stop I'm not finished yet
you ain't doin' it right until ya hands get wet
T-Boz rock on Richie Rich come on

<rr>
Get it straight a player don't hate he congratulate (say what)
while you demonstrate you givin' yo N-I-G a break
I let ya fingers be the reason that I stay out late
when double R come home
ya touchin' teasin' like Case (don't stop)
bringin' the shakes plus joy like Anita Bake
all the way from the O to the ATL it ain't safe
Playas check yo game swole ballers check nuts
and if ya scared go to church 'cause the remix hurts

<t-boz>
Every night I get away
I don't need nobody baby but you you
I ain't afraid to touch myself
I don't need nobody else but you you yeah

<rr>
A splash in the pool
come home ridin' duals
triple gold game sold not told (yeah yeah)
Fuck wit' that nigga all hundred G stacks
kamikaze but yet and still I can't lock down my bazy
due to the jack, ask myself who's the mack
on the bed shakin' damn who bringin' home the bacon (me)
thought it was my nigga who was stealin' the guts
Richie Rich bangin' hard but she ain't gettin' enough
Let me watch nigga 'cause you my boo for shoo (yeah)
goin' brown in the town what the fuck I got to do
spend a gang of loot hella Benzes on the fluke
I'm a catcher tell me when it's time to shoot (Don't stop don't stop)

Chorus
I won't be afraid to touch myself
It's alright I said it's alright hey
I don't think it's wrong to touch yourself
'Cause ain't nothin' wrong with makin' it feel good

<t-boz>
Every night I get away
I don't need nobody baby but you you
I ain't afraid to touch myself
I don't need nobody else but you you yeah

<rr>
Who hooked it that nigga Jermaine Dupri
Who hooked it uhh T-B-O-Z
Who hooked it the D-U double B-L-E
and if ya scared go to church 'cause the remix hurts
(Repeat)

<t-boz>
Every night I get away
I don't need nobody baby but you you
I ain't afraid to touch myself
I don't need nobody else but you you yeah

<jd>
I hope ya think of me when ya touchin' ya self
I hope ya think of me when ya rubbin' yo' body
(Repeat)
Don't stop I'm not finished yet
