	"No static at alllllll..."

[MC Serch]
Beef not needed to waste one
cause trouble don't feed the bass drum
Some so feeble, so play the hoodlum
A humdrum liver in bedlam
Bet your last buck, you don't laugh to this
Your horse came last behind the cactus
Back so strong, you thought wrong a fallacy
The groove will whip and flip cause it has to be
in there, like Belvedere in his underwear
on the new year, my dear, so make it clear
I'm gonna ask do you wanna live small?
Static?  Nah troop, none at all

[Pete Nice]
Why meddle in the middle of a ruckus
? sip slowly on Snapple in hand
Not these hands of mine holdin clippers
Slip and clip your flat-top to ceasar
Ease your ego, I go toe to toe
Throw my voice like I throw my yo-yo
And ho ho ho, on the mic is life support
and toward a crumb static ain't my sport
I swing to this, Serch swings to that
And as you noticed, they always wear hats
Boots and loops produced by Prince Paul
Slaps ya skull, no static at all

..

[MC Serch]
Static mixed in but it don't cling
to a fat rope dope Gucci link or an earring
Hand now gropin for ?
but the hand is used to get skins
Skim the cream but it seems you still rise
For some who lives more, now life lifesize
All are lepers in my swingdom
Groups and troops get friends and they bring them
In goes props so pop til the mornin
Home to the young, pop still snorin
Wake up you blackhead and heed the call
Aiyyo, no static at all

[Pete Nice]
I flip on kicks, my DJ tricks
The a.k.a code name Richie Rich
	"Daddy Rich, you never watch him on TV?"
Straight no takes, the iron had Eastbridge
full on 1210's flippin the beats
	*Richie Rich cuts more*
Some bust nuts, Daddy Rich bust cuts
Such transform over rhythms on dust
I rush this rhythm, hold like Mingus
I swing this joint, no static to sting this
	*Richie Rich cuts more*

[Nice]	A bitch's brew, who ?? gyro
[Serch]	Scabs can't craft what only the fly knows
[Nice]	Got skins all in on scheamin
[Serch]	Scandalous hooks grab on to what's gleamin
[Nice]	I'm seemin vexed in my rhymin texts
[Serch]	Opened up shop to chop off the head, next
[Nice]	I put off punks like junk so sporadic
[Serch]	Stashed away like old drawers in my attic
[Nice]	Or drawers on my legs, figures what I says
[Serch]	Snack on Jolly Rancher or Orange Pez
[Nice]	Yep this ain't no collect call
[Serch]	So peace, yo Pete
[Nice]	No static at all
[Serch]	True!</pre>
