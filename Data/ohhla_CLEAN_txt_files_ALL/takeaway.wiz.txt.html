[Intro]
Uh-uh
Yeah bitch! Haha
That's what I like to call...
My type of shit!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, forward progression niggas got it backwards
I'm relevant but nothing like you other rappers
You see I fuck with trap niggas because really, I'm the only one rappin'
Get it how you live, survival of the fittest you should know the code
All I got is what I give until they overload
Nigga, I'm the shit overflowed
And I grab a blunt split it like a chromosome
Uh, I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phonin' home
We done blown the whole oak gettin' our stoner on
Ain't gotta say shit, I know you don't
See my chain, make the same face from Home Alone
All this good weed that I'm puffin' got me feelin' like there ain't a place I can't go
Ain't a thing I won't do
And I'm awake so I guess my dream's come true

[Chorus]
And the game gave me a feeling that no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doin' shows oh no one can take away from me
I get a feelin' that no... one... can take away

[Verse 2]
Uh...
Down to take a trip my nigga what's the ticket hittin' for?
I got some hoes that wanna roll too (Haha)
And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team
and tired of the background so you make your own scene
I'll hit you up when I roll through
Yeah, California weed keep ya pissed off in your mind state
Hard to get it on it so my niggas boost the crime rate
It's obvious I'm ghetto so they love me like I'm Kid Rock
Try your luck with what's around my neck and get ya wig chopped
Fuckin' with I can get you so much cash, or nowhere fast
I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class
Or had the driver get her bags

[Chorus]</pre>
