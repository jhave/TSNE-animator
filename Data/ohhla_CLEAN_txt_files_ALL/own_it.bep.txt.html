[will.i.am]
All my dreamers
All my believers, tomorrow leaders
If you've been dreamin for all your life
This is your chance...
Everybody is a star
It don't matter who you are, no
Keep on reachin for your dreams
Cause it ain't crazy as it seems
We are callin all the dreamers
We are callin the believers
Lookin for the big achievers
Keep on reachin for your dreams
Hey, say

[Chorus]
I wanna own it, wanna wanna own it
I wanna own it, wanna wanna own it
I wanna own it, wanna wanna own it
I wanna own it, wanna own it
I wanna own, that's the way I want it
The way I want it, that's the way I want it
I wanna own, that's the way I want it
I wanna own it
This is your chance to own it
This is your chance, your moment
This is your chance, don't blow it
Go out and own it, oh-own it

[will.i.am]
Anybody could be famous
It don't matter what'cha name is
It's your moment baby claim it
Go out and own it, ho out and own it
Will I make it is what I wonder?
I want the top and not the under
I wanna do it big like Oprah
I wanna own it, I wanna oh-own oh-own it
Hey

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
Uh-huh {*5X*}
Oh go out and own it
Go out and own it
Cause I'm a dreamer
I'm a believer, a tomorrow leader
And I've been dreamin for all my life
And this is my chance</pre>
