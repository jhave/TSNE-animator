[Will Smith]
Whoo!
What? What?
Can you feel me baby?
I can feel you
No doubt, known to make it happen

[Will Smith]
I see you wanna dance huh
With your girls and your friends huh
What about me and my menz huh
Roll through in the Range and the Benz huh
Wanna jam on the dance floor till it ends huh
Tight buttocks get a lot of attention
I see y'all looking like a Prada convention
Can't stop staring, you're fine as hell
Got my shades on though I ain't playin' myself
Mad dudes with doughs, clock your flows
No X and O's just sexy clothes
Got your dudes with the Lex and the Roves
Striking a pose
But everybody knows you want me
Come get me, here I be
In the V-I, V-I waiting for the
Yo something in your wait, go through it
Pretend you got a swoosh in ya baby
Just do it

Can you feel me baby?
(Hell yeah mama, hell yeah)
Do you like it sugar?
(No doubt, no doubt)
Do you want me honey?
(You Eve baby, yo Eve)
Are you liking what you see?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Eve]
Uh, come on
So you wanna bill papa
I don't buy it, say heart stopper
Cause I move fast in the club
Where you at huh?
Big Willie Style when your dogs play the back
I like the fact that you're so low-key
But play it any lower and you won't know me
Cause I'm out the door for sure approach me
Wave your hand to come over trying to coach me (what?)
Why you in the V-I, E-V-E too fly to drop by
Get up off your clothes and cruise by
Shades high, nothing while you're with bluffing your team
Every time I'm with you blushing, your smile gleam
You don't think I know you noticing me
Come on get closer to be
Be bold take a dose of the Eve
If you're ready for your part
Cause I'm bout to depart
I'm your life for the rest of the night
I'm breaking hearts
[Will Smith]
Yo get your hot self over here
[Eve]
No, get your body up off your chair
[Will Smith]
What? I ball too hard for that
[Eve]
Hold up baby act like I ain't balling back
[Will Smith]
Look I ain't trying to play no games
[Eve]
Oh yeah well I ain't no regular dame
[Will Smith]
Alright, look let's meet half way
[Eve]
Well if you're getting up daddy make it all the way
[Will Smith]
Alright

(Hell yeah mama, hell yeah)
Do you like it sugar?
(Come on playboy, come on)
Do you want me honey?
(No doubt baby, no doubt)
Are you liking what you see?
(Uh come on, come on, come on)

My friend if you're feeling me
Come get it
There's no time to waste
Come on stop playing games with me

[Will Smith]
Playing me like I'm on E! or somethin'
The big dawg like some flea or something
What? Hard to get, don't get got
Even when you're sizzling hot
[Eve]

Stunting in the club got ya betting huh?

Guess you'll never know
Ten seconds before I bounce baby
Then I gotta go
