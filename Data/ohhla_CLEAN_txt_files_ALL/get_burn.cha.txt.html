[Intro - Chamillionaire] (Male voice)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
(Get ya burners out)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
(Get ya burners out)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
(Get ya burners out)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
(You know who run the south)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Get ya burners
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Get ya burners
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Get ya burners
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Here he come again
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Here he come again
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Here he come again
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Here he come again
(Mixtape Messiah Part 3!)
Get ya burners, get ya burners
Here he come again

[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
Take a look into the sky, you can see it's goin down tonight 
(it's goin down tonight, yeah)
Let 'em know that it's the time for the "Victory", who down to ride?
(let me know if you down to ride, yeah)
You know rap will never die, it's gon' live as long as I'm alive 
(as long as I'm alive, yeah)
It's the Mixtape Messiah, it's the Mixtape Messiah
It's the Mixtape Messiah, tell them haters that it's time to hide

[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
Man don't try to diss and then patch it up
Yeah, they tried to hate but I'm platinum plus
I just bought a building and snatched the bus
They still actin like they dough matchin up
That's what's up and yeah that's enough to make me make you look like your dumb
Ain't gotta call you an idiot, cause you make yourself look like your one (one)
Ask me if I made some money, I told her that I made a little
Jacked the track from Play-N-Skillz, go get ya burners and pay your bills
And to that company in Houston that bootleg what I come with
I got $2 million to drop on ya in court costs if you touch this
On the CD or I can CPR, heard the music ran out of breath
Rap game, still alive cause I snatched the music up outta death (death)
I don't really mean disrespect to none of y'all, but I confess
Don't compare me to another artist that's rappin now because I'm the best

[Break - Chamillionaire] (Male voice)
(Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best)
I hear them burners now
(Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best)
I hear them burners now
(Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best)
I hear them burners now
(Y'all know how run the internet)
I hear them burners now

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
You couldn't even bring a camera and you mad and you confused
Scratch your head and wonderin how we all got in here with tools
Wanna know who break the rules, then you should know that I'm the dude
My promotion game is smooth, so my control will be on cruise
You could be the biggest journalist, I'll probably look at you 
like you crazy if you ask about me about 50 in the interviews
Cause I'm 'bout me and I don't really care about what others do
If it ain't about me then take the question and adjust the question to
I am sure not the rapper that a label can abuse
You could be the biggest bumblebee, my buzz get big as you
It's part 3, I had to come again, I just released Part 2
It's drainin me, but it's still goin down like water in a pool
Yeah, that's a quarter, add a penny, count it up and you have to 
realize that we the guys with more 26's than your couch do
I'm not him and I'm not him, so watch who you talkin that mouth to
Cause if it's money, I run harder than y'all boys in my house shoes

[Hook]

"Get ya burners" - repeated until the end

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking]
Remember the promise you gave me on Part 2 
You promised your gonna go get my album
A real copy, don't download it, don't bootleg it
With this one, you can put this in the streets, download it, give it to your friends
Give it to your partners, whatever
I'm still in the streets, knee deep, Mixtape Messiah Part 3 is what it is
Chamillitary is the label and I'm still an artist that will lyrically slay you

Here he come again ...</pre>
