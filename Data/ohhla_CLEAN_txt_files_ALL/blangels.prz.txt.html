Dirty Cash *echoes*

Yeah, uhh

[singers] Uhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!

Yo, yo, yo
Yo it's the ghetto diplo', bridgin like the Tri-Boro
Victory is endless cause we all want a hero
Blazing Saddles so stop horsing around
From sunup to sundown, it's the world renowned
It's hard to be real when them cats are make believe
Stop it please, come run wit deez
If you can't feel me, then get up and leave
Cause I'm automated life flyin, Fate is on her knees
Locate the object, pinpoint my movin target
Pray for them, and bless em, like Sister Margaret
Got more alumni than the grad school of Harvard
Beat Street the movie was my all time favorite
So can you stand the smell of a black powder
My B.I. is 700, horsepower
Burnin rubber, break you off somethin proper
Love it or not, I'm the man of the hour, yeah

[singers]
Just when you thought my shine was burnin out
Them cats were down and out, in the heat of the night
There ain't no problems baby we can't get through
You gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you
Uhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!

Yo.. yo, yo, yo
Yo she was hot to death, like the story Macbeth
When your marked for death it's a matter of life or death
I'ma cherish and nourish every single breath
When there's no one left, I'ma carry your footprints
step by step, walkin through the, twentieth
century, eyes on me
When the dogs start barkin you must set them free
Go in-Between the Sheets just like the Isley's
I'ma kill em precisely, indirectly
Choose my women wisely, Charlie's Angels got my back
as if I was Bosley, bout to get rowdy
So pray to Mother Mary, you think this is easy?
Be a cold day in Hell before I let you come and get me
So stop actin frowsy, that's the one-fifty
Holler if you hear me make your move if you ready
Dirty Cash, Navy Seals, reppin through your city, what?

[singers]
Just when you thought my shine was burnin out
Them cats were down and out, in the heat of the night
There ain't no problems baby we can't get through
You gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you
Uhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!

Yo.. yeah, yo, yo
Hey yo the way I feel now you cats can drop dead
Jump up and spread then take off them threads
You heard what I said, don't be misled
Navy Seals what?  Running over chickenheads
Run like I'm a caca, act like a bobaka
My ears shoot the street, just to take out the impostor
Tomorrow never dies when she reveals her eyes
Keep your eyes on the prize, for Pras is the prize
Tough guys get penalized, cut down to size
It's the one that be witchu that be the true spies
Never say never when we can make it together
ReFugees are tougher than ever, what?

[singers]
Just when you thought my shine was burnin out
Them cats were down and out, in the heat of the night
There ain't no problems baby we can't get through
You gotta believe in me, and I'll believe in you
Uhhh! Blue Angels, Blue Angels, Blue Angels!

Just when you thought my shine was burnin out
