[AMG]
Uh uhh!  Yeah, uhh
Uh, uhh, uhh
One time for you mind
Uh, uhh, uhh
Youse a.. sucka..
Yeah, yes

I once met a nigga who was cool and shit
So what?  So I let him hang with my click
Said he pimped hoes, and he knew how to make ends
Said he even had a Benz
And a house in Atlanta, G-A, and in L.A.
and he fucked different hoes every day-ah
I said, "Nigga since we all in the same game
might as well let our motherfuckin nuts hang"
But shit got funny when it came down to makin money
Found out he was a dummy
And the pussy made him sway
And it wasn't no different hoe each and every day
But trip, that ain't it, he went out like a bitch
Sayin my shit was his shit (nah)
Now he's on the way to player's court
Gettin charged for fakin the funk
You little punk, youse a sucka

[Chorus]
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (nigga youse a sucka)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (punk youse a sucka)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (check this out)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love..

[AMG]
I got a homey who calls me a captain
cause I get a lot of hoes from the rappin
But I ain't no trick, I'm into hoe hoppin
But guess who I see in the mall shoppin?
Diggin way down deep in them Kani sweats
Spendin dough on a hoe that he ain't bumped yet
And he don't wanna see me, but I make it known
Cause the hoe that he with I already boned
And the bitch actin like she don't know a brother
And this nigga holdin on to her like he love her
I looked him dead in the face and said, "Whassup Trace?
(Nigga) Ask you girl how my dick taste"
And he wanted to fight, talkin bout I ain't right
(Nigga please) Nigga flyin like a kite
Now he got two babies by her and he still
callin me a liar, she's his wife and he's a sucka for life

[Chorus]
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (nigga youse a sucka for life)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (sucka youse a sucka for life)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love (for life)
Nigga youse a sucka for love .. (for life)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love (and y'all hoes out there..)
Nigga youse a sucka for love..

[AMG]
Now in ninety-fo', hoes gettin lucky
like a four leaf clover, but I'm still a Rover (woof)
And it's kinda strange, when you see 'em rollin in the Range
with a coach bag full of cash
Wearin Donna Karan but I ain't sharin my money witcha freak
You can call me cheap
or you can call me crazy, whatcha gonna do
when your ass get fat and lazy, house full of babies
And don't blame it on your baby's daddy (uh uhh)
Cause you let him buy ya, then you let him try ya
And when he left you was broker than a joke (uh uhh)
Lookin for another, so you can pucker
up your lips, and kiss him on the thang thang
Whip it on him real good, and it's the same game
So who you tryin to fool and clown
I'ma hound from my head to the ground
Beitch, so bitch get a sucka

[Chorus]
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Nigga youse a sucka for love (you better get a sucka)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love (hoe)
Nigga youse a sucka for love (bitch get a sucka)
Bitch, youse a sucka for love
Bitch youse a sucka for love (uhh)
Nigga, youse a sucka for love
Bitch youse a sucka for love..

[AMG]
Aoww, niggaz out there, playin trick or treat
And hoes out there
Tryin to rob a nigga for his ends
Eat a dick up..
Yeah, cause nigga youse a sucka for love
If you're fallin for that
Yeah..
Yeah, welcome to the A.M. y'all
Uhh..
And no can do hoe
Bitch, get a sucka for love</pre>
