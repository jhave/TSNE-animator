{"Say it"}

[Joell Ortiz]
You say it you did it, you didn't then they did it to you
You couldn't wake up and hustle, you had to get approval
And become a big dog but stay a little poodle
Hatin like, "That's word to my mother, I knew that nigga boo-boo"
Take a look at this game y'all, this shit is doo-doo
Niggaz say what they don't do, smoke what they don't know
It's a circus not a zoo, they say they walk where they don't go
Ask about them in they hood nobody knows who they are
Cause all they did was play they window and steady R
Way of life and write it on they paper nice
So you could lie and say you played the strip late at night
But I'd know when I had to hit the ave I used to take your bike
You was always that lil' dude that the neighbors like
Your face move, you ain't never been in a razor fight
So when you say what you did make sure you say it right
Cause I ain't gon' only break your jaw, I'ma break your mike

[Termanology]
I pledge allegience to beatin the shit outta every beat
and then greet it with immediately me and Sheek
and Joell might as well be Rakim, Kane and LL
I puff a L and stuff a shell up in the borough
{"Say it"} if you really want the hammer
The cannon'll blow your grandma, make it hotter than Atlanta
They call me Tony Montana, the van that handled grammar{?}
Fuck a police scanner, I'm standin up on a grand and just
{"Say it"} and we come through deep
Bunch of crazy Puerto Ricans and we all got heat
Give a fuck about a hater cause we all got beef
I do songs with Bun B, Saigon and Free
For free, that says a lot for me
I get respect from the rappers that you dyin to meet
Monday's Murder Mass, Tuesday's out in Philly
Wednesday's pour heart then back to N.Y.C., c'mon

[Bun B]
{"Say it"} To my face if you got the testes
Don't try to test these, you better bounce like jetskis
Cause we body beats, and this one I'ma murder that
This UGK for life {"c'mon"} I know you heard of that
{"Say it"} like a murder rap, buddy I'ma body boys
Leave lines leakin on loose leaf and probably scarred
I don't talk to fakes so don't try to polly god
They find you stankin in Frisco at the trolley yard
Lord, have mercy, have grace
Have the decency to get the fuck up out of my face
I ain't down with the braggin, ya dumb so ya convo is laggin
And really {"c'mon"} you got the dragon
We melt mikes G, but not like that
I'ma run and grab you some Colgate and be right back
Now that's real, just keepin it trill
You wanna be the big will like J Dill'?
{"C'mon"} Then motherfucker just {"say it"}
Fuck the radio, internet play it
NahRight.com, yo it's time to S.K. it
Let the hood okay it, no way it could lose
R.I.P. to my dude, Pimp and J Dilla too
Two of the best that was keepin it true
And if you miss 'em both like I do
Then let me hear you just {"say it"}

[Saigon]
I mastered my zone, that's why I'm in a class of my own
This was '93 I'd probably be blastin the chrome
Y'all'll be sittin ya asses at home
And you was a telephone thug, who only talk trash on the jones
Now in the booth, you this bullet-proof certified murderer
This {?} truth, why nobody never heard of ya?
You only known for rap, nigga, bumpin your gum
Nobody seen none of this crack, that you dumped in the slum, bum
Nobody seen you bustin your gun, you wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
(Shit) Your pussy lips too tight
Man, I'll you 'bout a kid named Divine
Live by the thirty-eight {"c'mon"} and die by the nine {"say it"}
What's it gon' take to make niggaz stop lyin in they rhyme?
Is this what you gotta do to shine?
Who give a fuck if radio say it's a hit?
Real niggaz consider it miscellaneous shit
Nah, we ain't the ones to play with (play with) we slay shit (slay shit)
You wan' rhyme with the big boys then nigga just {"say it"}

[Freeway]
Who the only nigga that drop
thirty-one songs in a row and they all hot?
Y'all niggaz drop songs and they all flop
Killin me, I gun ya all down, thirty shots in a row, yeah
{"Say it"} Me and Term' spit fire burn, we'll burn
Drop bombs like Vietnam, send you home missin arm
Missin leg, I'm the plague, I'm a renegade
Hundred-fifty boys come, hundred-fifty boys laid
out, sprayed out with their brain out
Nigga said he spittin fire, Freezer put the flame out
Freezer needed money so Freezer put the 'caine out
'09's mines, clear the lane out 'fore I drain out
the 11th letter, that's the K for you stupid fools
Make memorials out your hangout
I am Destiny's Child, all you gotta do is +Say My Name+ out
loud, fuck the crowd, pull the thang out
