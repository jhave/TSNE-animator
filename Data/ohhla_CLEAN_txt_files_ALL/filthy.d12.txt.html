Fucks fat ass {*cough*} nasty dirty niggaz, uhhh
FILTH, shit!  Fuckin filth!  Yeahh
LA LA LA, la la la la, la LA!

[Proof]
Aiyyo - my style bust holes in the earth, crush the crust
by the dirtiest, heathen specialize in stoppin breathin
My legion'll bleed man - what do you believe in?
(Heaven and Hell) Make your grill swell, it ain't hard to tell
I work spells, all wicked like Gargamel
Put (?) hand first, the red bursts another victim

[Bizarre] Nah man, let the morgue pick 'em

[Eminem]
Cancel the hash shit, I'm fillin my glands full of acid
Two hands full of ass dancin with Angela Bassett
Make plans for the casket, your head lands in a basket
A dead man's in the plastic, I got red hands and the mask fits
(Yeahhh Em) Fuckin rap pervert, I serve dirt
My sick thoughts get all mixed up like rainbow sherbert
Get every nerve hurt - spot a mic and walk toward it
My whole click'll beat yo' fuckin ass and camcord it

[Bizarre]
Somebody hide me, too many hoes on my dick
Smoked all your "Hay," who wants to start the Crucial Conflict?
I'm the big daddy smokin blunts in Cali
Ill enough to do a driveby on a stay in school rally
Stop stop knockin cause ain't nobody there
Hoes with AIDS - I still fuck BARE!
Cause I, I just don't care
Ill enough to fuck up, all yo' dental care
When Bizarre kid comes through, you better yell mayday
While you was havin "Good Times," I +dyno-mite+ Kujo and J.J.

[Kon Artis]
HAHA, yeah yeah bitch!
I get helmet from stank crackheads
And read my kids horror stories when I lay 'em to bed
Ridin bikes butt-naked, gettin frisked by policemen
FUCK Christmas - this is take your gift season
Beatin kids up for no reason, take lunch boxes and all 
Gettin high off mushrooms and play, "A Friendly Game of Dodgeball"

BITCH! YEAH!  Aiyyo..

[repeat to fade]
You're battlin the Dirty Dozen, that don't pay
You god damn right punk, stay outta my way</pre>
