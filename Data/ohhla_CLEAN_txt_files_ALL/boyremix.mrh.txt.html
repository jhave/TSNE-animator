Feels so good, oh baby

	[Cam'Ron]
Killer, uh, yo
I see my mami-mi
In Waikiki
With the Malibu slippers
I, KeKe
It's Mary Poppins in a Harry Winston and the
World ain't ready for ya the pearl the teddy
And I'm twirlin heavy
Can't keep a nigga but it's well
How you got veil ? and a pail
Shack on her tour and Shacks on her feet
Lounge on the shore max on the beach
(SIREN) on the streets, (SIREN) on the block
Back on my feet, Cam's on the clock
Army with two liners but it's you shinin
Why you need pink you got blue dollars

	[Mariah]
I can't help it when I'm not around you
Cos all I ever seem to do is drift away
In dreams about you
Cos with or without you
It always seems like part of me is missing baby

	[Mariah]
Sometimes I don't call like I don't care at all
But secretly you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy all you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really seem so bad at all

	[Mariah]
I need you
Adore you (oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love (get my love)
Baby anything you want
Be around you
Fiendin' for ya
Just waitin' on ya (oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up (ahh)
Inside my love
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy

	[Juelz Santana / Jimmy Jones]
Who else you know got the world behind her
It's the (boy) and your girl Mariah
The whole world's Mariah's
It's the one and only girl that you girls admire
So just carry along
And please no fussing no fighting no carrying on
Just leave, you could have everything
But my bitch or Mariah Carey CDs
Carry the breeze wit ya (boy)
It's the (boy) told ya (boy) yeah
That I was here with a princess
She just another name that appears on my hit list
Girl I won't miss ..
We got the people askin
Cos we done seen seen it aspins
In the pool house and hot tub
And steam relaxing
Leap that action my creams are stacking
DipSet, our girl, it's on the dream we laughing

	[Mariah] (Cam'Ron)
I (what) need (who) you (aha, aha)
I wanna feel your touch (why wouldn't you)
So come and get my love (shorty, now sing)
I (what) need (who) you (aha, aha)
I'm gonna wrap you up (wrap me up)
And never let you go boy (never let me go)

	[Freeway]
That's how we put it on the one-sixteen I'm gone (boy, boy)
I turned sixteen what went wrong
Cops came from everywhere
And I couldn't run a block too long
But now I'm in here and the block too short
My tongue too long
But they can't break me
My crowd too strong
Got peoples on the outside looking up
But no looking and the war's too strong
Mean you out there without me it just ain't right at once
Only said something about me
It just ain't right
Naughty little women low as the doe
Moving the snap we could go I just roll night
Now I'm freakin the led on the pistol tryna fly you a kite
Yeah, It's Mariah and Free, Just Blaze beats
Only different Free in the cling
And I'll be home but for now all I do is call
Trackin down a letter just to tell ya bank holla!

	[Mariah]
I need you
Adore you
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love
Baby anything you want
Be around you
Fiendin' for ya
Just waitin' on ya
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy</pre>
