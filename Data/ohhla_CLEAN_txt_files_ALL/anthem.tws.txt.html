                      Yeah we gonna do it like this
                 Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this
			 Speedknot Mobsters
 Verse 1:

My click been strugglin half a lifetime tryin to get our shit on
got no G's to sit on, even so niggas sell packs to get on 
but let me take you to a place 
where these niggaz learn to better pain and stress
look a murderer in the face, comin up with a wilder range you're blitzed

1, 2, 3, and to the 44, the good, the bad, and the ugly sticken you
fleein through the front door, and we gotta do one more
even though dealer watchin me like the lottery
we can still fulfill this westside oddessy mobster prophecy

Well mobbin what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?
hangin off 20 G's cause you got more money to scoop
lives a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
constantly eyed by neighbors, who do the Feds favors?
it aint no major dough, what this lady yeya blow 
as long as its payin me for my occupation criminal
pullin up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the absence of a mobsters presence
is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, it rolls, the pearl white O's
mobile, shit im a ride high til i die, get killed
smoke like fields, forever dodgin blue shields,
we're blue steel i got full proof escape skills
we're paper chasin leavin trails of shell cases 
and chasin to the part of your body
where the bloods wasted, on the life taken
Chicago aint a city its a nation
its all this my foundation within the mobster organization

Chorus:

If its gonna be shakin it up, if its gonna be cookin it up
if it aint hustlin and we got some skunk we gonna be smokin it up
(well I'm a payin mobster for life, caught with gold and ice)
(Speedknots roll two shots too cold to die, know im a get high)
its an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang
callin cops for thangs, readin to squab or bang
takin your riches, cause we know we snatchin your bitches
the wish I reign my family gotta maintain , its a mobster thang

Verse 2:

Im a fat booty fuckin, love gettin the sucks in and bustin
givin niggers punkin heads for nothin, while bumpin, handle my functions
my pistles pumpin, got hoes jumpin, a mobstas always into somethin

I can feel Killuminati lookin over my shoulder
somethin keeps tellin me to get mine before its over
smokin on plenty of buddahs, the brand to get blessed, with forgiveness
for the last time I'm sent on the survivin quest
from hustlin 24-7 to makin niggas get undressed 
The mobster in me got to be obsessed 
with lucci and success, so I can care less
if I gotta be lootin and woopin, 
I'm sick of beggin niggas for rides
id rather be the one thats scoopin
cause in these last days its day to day hustlin for me, i wont rest here 
everyday
fat ass chain and 3 blades, 
trippin on that 2 faced, that nigga sweatin dick
while i rock the stage, 
like these bitches is just tryin to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
like I can use it for turnin tricks 
or either for hittin licks and then rap about the shit
in one the mobster's greastest hits,
 and when we come to your town(?)then raise it
finest skunk we just can roll it up and blaze it

Chorus (2x)

Im gonna make it through this New World Order if i gotta be rappin and robbin
you cant stop the Speedknot from mobbin and if you try we squabin
we waitin for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up
when these shots how niggas roll, cause we dont believe in goin head up

On this week 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs
hit me wit love, black gloves, red eyes (?)
t-shirt up on my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the 380, 
got a grip that was steady adrenaline 
rushin po-feddy, while lives is rolled with Sisqo
may we rock the tightest flows but tinto up with the clips though
gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo, cause i aint that scummie
mother fuck (?) got no time for rockin, 
choppin in the car stoppin with a stack ofpacked money
but you trustin me, then I cup this shit, 
snatch all of your luxury, try touchin me
actin tough as shit, my moms is a bust for me
fuckin me or make me hate you, 
permanently sedate you, when the bullet penetrate
you its goin straight for your face you, unless we chase you
when we escape through your pockets 
by all means neccesary the rest is secondary
comin for back til my flesh is buried, the test is carried for me to survive
and hope we still will be thick, with a trilogy click but now seven 
mobstability shit

Chorus(2x)

Ha, I just take a pull in the hail, 
thinkin about my niggas thats locked up in jail
my mind dwells on crime sales, we wipin off mad shells
only time will tell if we gotta use em'  
aint lookin for stack , but if we got into it
we gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life</pre>
