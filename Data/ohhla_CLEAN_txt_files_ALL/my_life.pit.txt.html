[Pitbull]
Drop that beat, it's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

[Jason Derulo] 
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Pitbull] 
All I know is the hustle and grind
And all you want is some quality time but
I can't give it to you due to the life that I chose
My heart is so cold to the point that my blood it froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I needs mine
There I go again being selfish
And here you go again in love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby, you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more, you or the booth
These are just some things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel all I can give you is sex I'm sorry

[Jason Derulo] 
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Pitbull] 
I ain't gon' lie baby, this life is addicting
The fame, the money, especially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen 'em ball
I've seen 'em fall, go broke and lose it all
That's why I work hard 365, 24/7 baby this my life
I breathe, I bleed, I eat, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list
Baby, I know it's hard to understand
But it's out of my hands, baby this is Gods plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apologize but this game made me a monster I'm sorry

[Jason Derulo] 
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

[Jason Derulo &amp; Pitbull]
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (you live and you learn girl)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This the struggle)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done some
Right (from nothing to something)
In my life, I've done some wrong, I've done
Some right (This all I know)

[Jason Derulo] 
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
I've had my ups, my downs, I've paid my dues
Earned my stripes (earned my stripes)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)

Done some wrong and some right
Derulo, Pitbull, this how we do

[Jason Derulo] 
I've had all the women you could possibly
Imagine in my life (in my life)
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the
Money in my life (in my life)
But nothing compares to the love I have for you (have for you)</pre>
