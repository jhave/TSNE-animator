Party

Party

I've been wasting all my time
And I've been drinkin all that wine
And I've been drinkin all that beer
And I've been sheddin all these tears
I can't go and you can't stay
Your not gonna take me out that way

Because you can't take me
I said you can't take me
No you can't take me anywhere, I don't wanna go

I've been down this road before
And I just can not care no more
I can't see, what you can see
I'm too busy bein me
See I can't go and you can't stay
Your not gonna take me out that way

Because you can't take me
I said you can't take me
No you can't take me anywhere, I don't wanna go

I don't need to save no face
And I can't wait to leave this place
I've been fooled by lesser things
And I don't care what tomorrow brings
See I can go and you can't stay
Your not gonna take me out that way
Because you can't take me
I said you can't take me
No you can't take me anywhere, I don't wanna go

No you can't take me anywhere, I don't wanna go
