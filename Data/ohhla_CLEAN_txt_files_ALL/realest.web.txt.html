You're the realest I ever met
Realest that I've ever seen
And your body's so picturesque
You belong in a magazine
You're the realest, what's realer?
You're the realest, what's realer?
I've been all around the world searching and I can't find nobody else realer than you

Shit much I can tell you're the best around
Not just around 
I mean all around
Man really everyone you be shuttin' 'em down
You just mess around
We done messed around
So I know they know me Muhammad Ali
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee
Bounce that ass up and go and hang like a g
I got a bad bitch team you the MVP
The leader I might treat you different
Lay around with you
Squeeze you
Please you
Jungle fever
Done did all that can't no one see you
Real stones no cubic zirconia
You soft like Just like a boss like
And you know your boy like
To go all night like porch lights
When the kush don't last I ain't even gone cry
You can take my heart I ain't even gone die
Shit will still be sweet like I'm eating on pie
Ever take my lick probably sleep for round nine
Imma leave her alone now
'Cause I can see you gone by
Naw I ain't trying to run you off
Not at all hot girl
I ain't even gone lie

You're the realest I ever met
Realest that I've ever seen
And your body's so picturesque
You belong in a magazine
You're the realest, what's realer?
You're the realest, what's realer?
I've been all around the world searching and I can't find nobody else realer than you

I done spent my love you done sold your patience
Hell I didn't know it was gone take this long 
But you still kept waiting
Then they start imitating, Translating, perpetrating
And you ain't see none of that shit
'Cause you know the real deal
I'm the one they tracing
Girl you feel what I'm saying
And I can feel your heart basing
Can't nobody amplify your body like me baby
You know you love it when you ride me
And I drive you crazy
Been letting these chauffeurs ride me round
I ain't been driving lately
I don't know how I get so trill
You know the streets made me
Street lights and boulevards
Fuck round and had a baby
And I'm growing up and I'm showing up and I'm blowing up
And every time I make her bust 
She say the same stuff

You're the realest I ever met
Realest that I've ever seen
And your body's so picturesque
You belong in a magazine
You're the realest, what's realer?
You're the realest, what's realer?
I've been all around the world searching and I can't find nobody else realer than you</pre>
