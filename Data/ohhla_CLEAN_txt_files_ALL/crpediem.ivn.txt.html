Yeah,
Ivan Ives
2Mex
Here we go..

Leggo my ego, the mic stand the easel
Paint words lethal, tough like cheap wool
Snuff film b-roll, fuck til she know
Ivan so ill, I'm illegal
And no, when it comes to flow, we're not equal
I never miss, like God shooting free throws
I won't fall off the bike like Evil Kanievel
And I won't fall off the mic like Beanie Segal
Hip Hop is dead? Nah, I don't think so
I'm Russian Red, not a Pinko
My aims is lofty, I never think low,
Cats try to copy, like they was Kinkos
God is hidden, he won't let me see him,
But the Devil will shake my hand, so Carpe Diem
I murder without noticin, herder with doubt hopin and,
I be a word merger with stout motioning

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[2Mex]
2Mex
Los Angeles lyrical lottery
Don't bother me when it comes to dissin common camaraderie
Me and Ivan Ives we straight roll off
Like my homie Daniel and Ivan Koloff
Making these weak motherfuckers just straight hold off
We doing it big, taking your girls coat off
So very often I have the option to coughing on your coffin
You're soft and known for straight sobbing
Bobbin and weaving believe me
These fools with bobby pins in their weave don't believe em
Their happy to be still breathing
Another reason this rap game is so fucking uneven
Heaving these fools out the house like Jazzy Jeff
Stab em in the back cause he was wack as he left
I'm FRESH to death
Even in Moscow
2Mex and Ivan Ives we rock stars and we all style

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!

[Ivan Ives]
We grew up on Hip Hop, you threw up on Hip Hop
Stay away from the mic if your name is Rick Ross
It's kind of on some oh shit, don't front, open, your lungs
Smokin, those blunts
Of course I'm good at Tetris and Chess,
I'm Russian, what the fuck you expect?
I been bustin' my ass, now I'm here to collect
Ivan Ives and 2Mex, protect your neck, uh

[Chorus]
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin all the places with the
Blaow! Blaow! Shoot em in the face with the
Blaow! Blaow! Rockin every place with that
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!
