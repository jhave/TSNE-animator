Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Try it, breath in baby and I'ma hold those bun's sturdy Stevie Stone and Bleed say one puff'll make you come dirty

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
First 30 minutes it ain't been no hit
30 more I'm plopping in your shit yeah
Plop is the sound it makes
Plop plop plop till the ground breaks
I'm ground breaking when I fuck I pound great
And she ain't got no stoppers
No bra
No stockings nigga no gown nothing
I made that frown straighten around 8 she sound fake but I hound make her go down like she found Satan
I know you thinking that she ain't do it
Cause with you, ya hella boring so she ain't fluid
But when she with me equivalent to straight sewage
Dirty
Like they call you in the St. Louis

[Chorus]
Won't you come dirty?, won't you come, won't you come dirty? won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Won't you come, won't you come, won't you come dirty? won't you come, won't you come dirty?
Dont bring miss goodie goodie round me, won't you come dirty?, just let that booty booty drown me
Won't you come dirty?, Hey, won't you come, won't you come, won't you come dirty? Hey, won't you come

[Verse 2: Young Bleed]
I'm a black Jim Morrison
Peep the game from a far away glimpse
If I get it
I got it
I'm going in
I'm on some bitch
I'm far in
Strange lane I could hardly win
Strange Chain Jenny car we in
My chain hang through the hearts of men
It's the same thing at the bar again
Strange Land more women than men
Strange hands they be giving me gin
My plane land about a quarter to ten
My game grand
Living this sin again and again
Bottles in hand
Chop the hair off my chinny chin chin
We are wild in there
Wild with friends
I'm going to drop the top of the beam on my benz
My team in my hands
Hustling ends
I'm along with you
I'm about to go in
On the phone with you
Like the back of a 4 10
It's on with you
From the beginning to the end
You look like some twins
But really some tens
I keep them clean blowing smoke in the wind
I'm a post the kin
And that's pimp the kin
Mr. Snoop my pimping friend

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Stevie Stone]
Well she come then she eager for the front stroke back stroke
Deep throat strap in the camel toe swoll
Getting dirty as a model
Baby girl looking like a model
Very hard act to follow
Got a new shift kick with that throttle
She swabs
Baby got a mouthpiece swabs
Girls girls they swab
Got them and done them since Carolina Colorado
Feeling like I won the lotto
That bad bitch is Mulatto
Baby come drown me
Squirt on me today and tomorrow
I'll take that
And when I pull your hair you take that
And I'm a smack that ass you take that
Start cumming in your legs
Get shaken and shaking
Callin' her a sexual addict a fanatic
In the pussy enthusiastic
Gotta have it

[Chorus]

[OUTRO]
Too drugged out
Now I'm bummed out</pre>
