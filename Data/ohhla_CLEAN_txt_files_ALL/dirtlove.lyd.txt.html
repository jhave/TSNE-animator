Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I see you walking with a halo
Cover it up, yeah, cover it up
My baby

No need to try and be a hero
I've had enough
Yeah, I've had enough, my baby

You got a little bit of Tarzan
Let it all out, yeah let it all out
My baby

You see the thrill is in the chase
I wanna find out, I wanna find out
My baby

You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah, I'm getting bored

So sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

You wanna treat me like a lady
Don't even try, no, don't even try
My baby

Ain't gotta say that you need me
Keep it inside, yeah, keep it inside
My baby

I know I sound a little twisted
And maybe I am, or maybe I'm not
But baby
Playing the game is so addictive
Don't want it to stop, don't want it to stop
My baby

You're always so nice, I'm getting bored
You say the right things, I'm getting bored
And you always call first, I'm getting bored
Yeah, I'm getting bored

So sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

Yeah
When you put your clothes back on
Something always feels so wrong

Baby, all I'm thinking of
Is I want your dirty love

So sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love

So sick of the good boys, I need a wild boy
Something unpredictable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love
No time for the right one, I need the wrong one
Something unreliable
Go ahead and be a caveman
Give me all your dirty love</pre>
