[Superb]  Aiyyo, this a perv, yo
[Cormega] Yo, son there's bitches in there?
[Raekwon] Yeah, yeah, the coaches, aiight then

[Hook: Superb]
Jump up in the party like [what!]
Where my niggas at? [what!]
Where my bitches at? [what!]
Bartender where the liquor at?

[Raekwon]
Aiyyo, seven thick ribs nigga, check out my man
He got braids and with bread break ape on your grave
We from the gutta niggas, chest sputta what up
Fuckin with us or get you cut up, matta fact get'cha mutha
Cause I ain't fo real fo real, don't play games and I'm ill
I'm just a business man who love getting niggas killed
Smell my satiate smell keys, that shit's like deodorant, daddy
I like maglees for other reasons  
Run with niggas that love paper
We let the youngest niggas get rich and mow them like makeup
You can lex 'Zino and Benzino together
That's priceless to put our pay together, niggas by Lexus
Straight out the ghetto niggas is pussy 
To even fuck with us that'll be the day a white nigga mush me
Straight up, two-thousand is mine
Heavy lines, heavy guns, big-ass Chevy's, we make niggas shine

[Hook: Superb]
Jump up in the party like [what!]
Where my niggas at? [what!]
Where my bitches at? [what!]
Bartender where the liquor at?
Jump up in the party like [what!]
Where my niggas at? [what!]

[Benzino]
Black shells, scuba style, sonar, I go deep
Rip lungs outta jaws, flawless, I don't sleep
The fast and furious, Yokohama twin jets
Black and white bagettes, I'm duckin feds
Hydro-plane, hydro-foil blow hydro
Smooth gotho, Ray, its aiight I got those
I got this, son I spotless
Frozen watches, belts wit the notches
Bitches topless, three-way manages, Motorola holder
Break bread with Motola, take advice colder [aiight!]
Kedar knock-areano, Motown soldier
I thought I told ya lil' double Ray'll ghost ya
Double row, parvin, three-sixty rubber band
Ice me Apalla then three shave frozen hand
Dark shadow, my shit gleam in the shade
Watch `Zino flow, fuck the Macy's parade

[Hook 2x: Superb]
Jump up in the party like [what!]
Where my niggas at? [what!]
Where my bitches at? [what!]
Bartender where the liquor at?

[Cormega]
Yo, broke far from it, coke, sold a lot of it
Flow off the meter, let me know if y'all want it
Son, the life of problems and guns, so silence her, son
Bugs Bunny Icebergs and Air Force One's
I paint a picture listen up you become part of the song
When I slow my first young a new saga begun
Unaware, I would become a nemesis for livin in this
Drug dealin life, smoked niggas and bitches with plugs
Never been a snitch, I'm not built like that
I'm real, that's why we not feelin you like that
I'm the ghetto manifested in words
When I die, niggas'll point a valuable lesson I learn
Whether OG or adolescent in the presence ashurn 
OT or O-key handlin birds 
Like Dominique I feel I deserve respect I earn
Mega is a word we all protect with words, holla

[Hook 2x: Superb]
Jump up in the party like [what!]
Where my niggas at? [what!]
Where my bitches at? [what!]
Bartender where the liquor at?</pre>
