[Tonedeff]
F-F-First I sprinkle the -- awww, fuck it, I'm reluctant
to Spit another cameo verse, Cause, ain't I said enough shit?
Instead I'd rather stuff this, roster the fuck up with
Lots of assumptions and roughly half of the rapping public
I'll handle production, Y'all make sure your verse catches the drum kick
The odds of getting off are decent with 80 niggaz and 1 chick
Shit, I'll even put my momma on it...(MOM: "Yo, Bust it..")
I'd tell ya girl, but she'd get confused if I told her to come spit

[Breez Evahflowin]
Partna, This ain't my posse, Still I'm known to carry a scroll
Like Samuel Jackson in various roles
Accomplished, artist with intuitive mind
Other rappers like actors overdoin they lines
Ain't no fearing this, I could care less who's hearing this
I'm out to set a record for the most guest appearances
Hence, another rhyme orgy
Recording me ain't cheap, Tone, this verse is gonna cost you that beat

[Deacon the Villain]
yooooooooooo it's deacon, I'm only on this shit cause I was asked
drove from kentucky, so who the fuck is paying for my gas
tone harassed me "heeeeey, it's only 8 bars
do it for QN5 guy, cause we're that company that makes stars
Man, I could've been at home on my PlayStation
can you believe for this shit that I used my vacation
but O-NO! E Famm needs me
to spit a fuckin 20 second verse on their EP

[Mecca]
Well, deac at least you knew you was getting suped up
Why didn't you tell me Tonedeff was such a ruthless producer
I ain't come in this bitch with loose lips
I came here on some cool shit, Packed for the beach, expecting a crew trip
But Tone is like, You spit, come on, bro, this really needs your flow
Do it or your album's out the door, Yo
A fast one and I can't pull it faster
Aight you scheming bastard...that's 8...now can I have my master?

[Kno]
Yo, I hate posse cuts, this isn't challenging
I'd rather collab with my other 8 personalities
Think you can fuck with me?
Thats automatically suspect like seeing R Kelly at Chuck E Cheese
K-N-O the venomous gringo with intricate lingo
witcha gramma playin bingo
Blah blah blah punchline
Why am I trying? Tonedeff's on this track...I'm just gonna get shined!

[iCONtheMicKing]
They wanna do the hook before and after me I said it's blasphemy
it's just none of them want their rhyme compared to this masterpiece
But really though, I don't wanna flow with you jerks
Talking all this, I'm gonna kill it, but won't show me your verse
I'm getting my outshine on, y'all want to syphon rays
Writing they verses, thinking..."Hmmmm, what would iCON say"
You only getting 8, buy my shit if you wanting more
I had to rewrite twice, I better be paid for 24

[GMS]
Yo, how many cats on this track? Man, that's wack
Should've been me, Tone, Pack and that girl in the back
I hate these long ass underground tapes
You gotta wait, wait, wait, and then you only spit 8
Gimme a break! What a waste of time!
Here's a couple of freetyle lines so I don't have to waste a rhyme
I'm not getting paid for this bitch?
This your basic everyday flow, don't expect no amazing shit

[KAMEEL-YEN]
Now since they said I only got eight I aint no time
this song is helpin my career as much as puff did shine
and they lucky the beat's hot otherwise what'd be the use
of me sweatin my ass off in this little sound booth
what am I the token chick with these dicks in a sword fight
i don't even know half these cats/ is this a song or an open mic
you wrong if you think I'll leave with no check in hand
and if I don't I'll file a lawsuit (FUCK E-FAM !!!)

[PackFM]
Word? Well FUCK YOU TOO! I'll show you how we do this properly
We dont need a posse cut *why?* Efamm is a posse
Dont need the cedibility *why?* 'Cause nopbody can doubt mine
Let's do We Are the World, thats more heads for me to outshine
Tone was like *Come on this is exessively long*
Like after hearing my verse you care about the rest of the song
*CD skipping forward* Is all you hear til you get to my part
'Cause my 8 bars alone make this a standout by far!

[Pumpkinhead]
I can't believe I'm here to spit in booth
I got the flu cold sweats plus a chip in my tooth
am I even gettin paid for this dedication
the least qn5 can do is pay for my medication
seriously I could have been home in a zone
do yourself a favor and don't to close to the microphone
cause you might catch a germ this mic you should be burned
so if ya ass get sick that's not my concern

[Elite]
Fuck a posse cut, I don't know half of these people
We shouldn't even make this like movies after the sequel
Oh man.what a splendid plan
It's extended famm featuring it's extended famm
Let's just make sure there's no hook/ Or at least a bad one ...like
Ahh fuck it, I thought I had one
The obligatory setup line!
You were expecting a punchline here.weren't you!

[Poison Pen]
This is the song that never ends
eF@mm, Poison Pen &amp; a bunch of ballchinians
And it goes on &amp; on my friend
I Just came to the lab for a beat-tape
I had to hit the track off with something
My flow glows...I traded in my tonsils for tungsten
Ain't no problem spittin on this shit
Just try to get us all together...just to perform this shit

[Substantial]
Now you goddamn well I barely show up to shows
What made you think I want to be with yall kicking flows
Splitting doe like umpteenth ways with these bozos
W ould've said a number but there is always no shows
Probably be the one they predict to go solo
And when I blow yo these same cats with no doe
Who once were dick riders are now haters so check it
They're the reason why there won't be posses cuts on my record!

[Squijee]
Ayo, it's squijee, you know I'm always up in the mix
Did you think that I wasn't gonna spit 8 bars up in this bitch!?
Fuck y'all motherfuckers, I keep it street, B
Squijee.I got the biggest dick in my speices
So, what I'm 2 feet tall and look like a raccoon
That's tall enough to reach your girls pussy and ass too
I'm gully son...I'm done with the subject
Cause I just hit 8 bars, and I still ain't fuckin' drunk yet</pre>
