[Intro - Loon - talking]
Ma I tried so many years
But it seems like, all I brought you is tears
I tried to eliminate, all of your fears
But its conflict
Yeah, check it out, uh, yo, aiyyo

[Verse 1 - Loon]
The game keep callin, niggaz in the streets is ballin
Try to creep, just to keep from fallin, but the block keep hollerin
Yellin my government name, I tried to stop but the love of the game
They got my girl in a frenzy, my niggaz used to be friendly
'Til they seen me and Puff in the Bentley
Now, forced to stay, forces use force and spray
Coffins lay, when I'm forced to play
Like a animal, dog if I put my hand on you, I'ma handle you
Like I'm "Hannibal," the motherfuckin cannibal
All plans is through, dreams and goals
The block hot but why this shit seem so cold
This shit seems so old, tryna redeem my soul
The Feds roll and my team done fold
Like a bad hand of poker, even ya man'll smoke ya
For these crushed up leaves of copa, now

[Chorus - Joe Hooker]
I, can't talk through to you
The way, I used to
You don't understand why I
Feel the way, that I do

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Yo, check it out
It's been four years and you ain't shed no tears
And through the course of that, I lost four pairs
That's why I smoke more blunts, drink more beers
You never consider it, like you just don't care
The pain I feel inside you just don't share
When I share my deepest thought, you just don't hear
Well aware of my fears of me losin my life
I'm well aware of my fears of me losin my wife
That's why I stay usin my gun and usin my knife
Gotta deal with this shit, 'til my music get right
I buy you pretty things just to see you wear it
You sayin I ain't shit, tryna break my spirit
I try to change my life but you just don't hear it
Guess I gotta find another girl to spend four years with
Damn, all that time got wasted, but I guess I gotta face it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Loon]
Uh, yo, uh, aiyyo
The cops don't like me, they always eager to fight me
Even though I know they wanna be like me, cause they see a nigga icy
Doin a buck in the white V, twizzy gettin busy with wifey
Gettin head on the highway, I'm gettin money the fly away
Pull me over just to fuck up my Friday, what could I say?
Nothin, still they be frontin
Throw a brick in the trunk and try to make up somethin
But I'm not with the bullshit, that's why I roll with a full clip
Flint cock the hammer and pull quick
Don't care about your uniform, or that bullshit you be on
Now who gon' really mourn when you be gone?
One in your head like a unicorn. you movin on, your favorite suit is on
Moms singing that stupid song, "my baby ain't blast nobody"
But he still got smoked at Bay Bay's party
That's why ..

[Chorus] - 2X

(*long pause*)
