[Young Noble]
Aint nothin but hoes in here
I guarantee when they leave they don' say Young Noble was here
All the little homies postin' near
Thug walkin' to the dance floor while I'm chokin' a beer
I got a little hot mama with a lot of dollaz
She can spend that shit on me
Instead of mines up
Bringin' it back to the days when it first started
Bringin' it back to the ways that were cold-hearted
Noble farted like my shit dont stink
I like her mouth real wet
Her pussy real pink
So holla at cha dog
Just make sure you swallow it all
And when you cuttin' up bottle it all
Yo I fuck with all souljahs
All around souljahs
All access souljahs
Straight back shot souljahs
What's poppin mama?
Uhu... and when you get here nigga
It's poppin'... holla

[Chorus: Edi]
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's poppin'?
Outlawz if you ready to ride
Let a muthafucka know if you down tonight
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's crackin'?
Ladies if you down tonight
Let a muthafucka know if you can crush in the ride

[Napoleon]
I woke up this mornin' feelin' kinda dead
Cause the bitch last night
Wouldn't give me no head
Imma playa round here
So I keep it cocked
And my game ???? move me up a notch
Im from  ??? Jerzey
Told her come to Cali
Fucked in a alley
In a ???
Listen up ya
I spend money on pussy before
I'll do it again if the girl was broke
Imma street wise nigga
You flipped the prize nigga
Fo'Fo' five cause my bank account bigger
You could look in my eyes
You'll be scaring yo-self
Cause aint nothin' worse then a World Wide Mobb Figga
I blew this hoe from San Juan, Puerto Rico
Put her up in eco, you know
Let me say no more
Im down in Mexico
Gettin' hoes ???

[Chorus: Edi]
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's poppin'?
Outlawz if you ready to ride
Let a muthafucka know if you down tonight
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's crackin'?
Ladies if you down tonight
Let a muthafucka know if you can crush in the ride

[Edi]
Imma straight playa
Type to hata-hata
Type to kick back if the shack blow evader
Type to bump yo hoe then I'll let her keep ho'in
Type to see the law then I just keep going
Im a Outlaw baby, now you after that
Awo.. She fuck ?? to  fuckin' with that
I dont sniff no coke
I dont pop no pills
I dont shoot shit in my veins
But I shoot shit to kill
Lately, I got cha gone off the Red Bull &amp; Vodka
Now ya own ya knees
Im like ohh weeee
True me, it's the California way
You got 2 more homies?
I'm on my way
Life as a rap star shouldn't be so rough
They gon' find you buried in the backyard
Keep talkin' bout us
Outlawz if you ready to ride
Let a muthafucka know if you down tonight
C'mon

[Chorus: Edi + Young Noble]
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's poppin'?
Outlawz if you ready to ride
Let yo homeboy know if you down tonight
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's crackin' ladies? (uhu)
What's crackin' ladies?
Yea yea yea yea
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's crackin'?
Outlawz if you ready to ride
Let a muthafucka know if you down tonight
We aint stoppin' til we get enough
What's crackin' ladies?
What's crackin' ladies?</pre>
