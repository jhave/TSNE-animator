Hey Hey!
This is Diabolical BizMarkie

        [Female Voice]
	I'm in heaven
Who you wit' baby?
        With my boyfriend my laughing boyfriend
	There's no beginning and there is no end
	Time isn't present in that dimension
	He'll take my arm
	When we're walking, rolling and rocking
	It's one time I'm glad I'm not a man
	Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping
                (scratching)
	Who needs a beat when your feet just go?
	        (scratching)
	Who needs a beat when your feet just go?

The Biz the Biz the Biz
Its the Biz the Biz the Biz
