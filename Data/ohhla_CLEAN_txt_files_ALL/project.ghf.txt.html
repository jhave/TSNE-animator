[Chorus 1.5X: Trife Da God]
This world is full of shockers, and project soap operas
Episodes of drama, never ending sagas

[Trife Da God]
You know Pudgie, who rock the old rugby, kinda chubby
Timbs always muddy, and his wiz is kinda ugly
Him and his man Dudley got killed in an accident
Late last night, when they was driving down Castleton
The whip was badly crashed, come on, you do the math
They probably smoked a bag, no seatbelts, they flew through the dash
The forecast was foggy, light drizzle, sky; cloudy
Lost control at the wheel, a front pole wrapped they Audi
It was televised, at the scene live, on Channel Seven
Newsflash story, this just in, around eleven
Yellow tape scenery, barricaded the block
Patrol cars and EMS, all invaded the spot
It was tragic, they swerved out of control to a wood traffic
Hopped the curb, tired flatted, glass shattered
Witnesses said they heard a big bang and loud screetches
And Tamika said police found drugs in Pudgie speaker
Plus son had an open case, for dope and base
Jake rushed his moms lab, he got bagged in Ocean Lake

[Chorus: Tommy Whispers]

Oh lord, two shots just went off on Broad
I ran out the building, seen my man on the floor
Children running frantic, with fear, all I saw
Was a four door Explorer, made a uey, then pulled off
Miss Gloria screaming, nobody seen him by the store
Beanie and Jamal, freaking on the lawn
Told me, if they get you, call Ruck with the rental
My mental went rushing, who the fuck was buzzing
Was it them niggaz that we stuck for them hundreds
Or did that bitch that we ran a train on, tell her husband
Moving fast, hoping that my man don't past
Heart pumping, eyes closing, yo, he might not last
EMS please hurry, nervous and worried
He's only 19, he's too young to be buried
Got a life ahead of him, Georgia Tech just accepted him
Point guard, but at this point, God
It was heaven and Allah opening gates for the star
It was hard, I couldn't believe, he stopped breathing
Stopped from achieving his dream, now he leaving
Thugs grieve, aiyo, he never slinged a thing
And died over drug beef, it's a ghetto soap opera
Living on these bugged streets, streets, streets

[Chorus: Tommy Whispers]

[Chorus: Trife Da God]

[Tommy Whispers]
Now Barbara need to stop
Always at the kitchen table, lighting up the rocks
While her daughter sit and watch
Cuz her bathroom out of order, gotta knock on Uncle Kevin's door
But it's really scary, cuz he live way on the seventh floor
And she was out on 2, the older brother still in school
But she had to stay home cuz of the flu
Only six, but she more advanced than other little kids
Always wondering, what's going on, outside the crib
So she stepped into the hall, pressed the elevator button
Bumped into this kid, making a sale, it wasn't nothing
So cool, little and frail, but she knew what he was pumping
At the store, he would walk to mommy, and hand her something
And she always gave her money, few minutes after they got back home
She acting funny, attitude getting ugly
So she took the ride up, five floors, knocked on the door quick
Didn't even speak, she just headed for the toilet
After she was done, he told her go to the store, the milk spoiled
Plus we needed some bread and some tin foil
Little girl heart was loyal, so she ran downstairs
Knocked on the door, to get Barbara, but she could not hear
Now she at the corner with nobody to cross her, red light changing
And up come a speeding Explorer..
