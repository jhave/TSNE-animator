(Spice 1)
Livin' in a world, hard and cold, niggas be dumpin' on they foes
Catchin' cases, high speed chases, forty G's for two ki loads
Give me evr'thing (evr'thing!!), cause I ain't all what it seems
Seen too much motherfuckin' gangsta shit done soaked up the game
Times are savage, my hardcore players not your average
Trunk full of triple beams, hella schemes for cream and cabbage
Niggas die for dead presidents on a green piece of paper
Put the smash down for the cash niggas whose in my blooded nature
Try to skyball, fuck half the world, I WANT IT ALL!!!
But I'm bustin' at you niggas with my back against the WALL!!!
Fuck you trick-ass-niggas (trick-ass-niggas), little bitch-ass-niggas (bitch-ass-niggas)
Make my name up in your mouth taste like shit-ass-niggas
See myself a smokin' pistol, when I look in the mirror
It's like a hologram picture, of a tatted up thug nigga, haha (punk-ass-motherfuckers)
You never really, really know the game
Cause everytime a nigga look up, the shit'll change

(Chorus: Spice 1)
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game

(Spook Thee Man)
It's time to make it happen, get paid, it's the nigga S-Y-the-S-K
Tag teamin' four house green placin' the eights
I stack - stay slangin' all day until the paper is pocket
Is it me? Back on the ground, face down, break the sound
Don't fuck around you'll get sprayed
And get away with the 2-11 AK for unmarked paper leavin' vapors with the vapors
Like loadin' pistols to they faces
I told my family as soon as I get the dough (dough) I'm on my way back home (home)
Shit across the border like Hard Drove, sound like +Noreaga+ the Money Maker
Scot-free across the sea, sippin' Con-Whisky with the million g's tall-red fantasies
Butter, bacon, kick back floatin' across the ocean like the Black Lapper
Truth or dees or Mack, slangin' these nippies like kiddies and Crack
Laughin' for opportunitites, cause I'm nigga - seeds and scratch
Layin' for keeps, addicted to gettin' it for puttin' like a junkie high fiend

(Chorus: Spice 1)
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game

(Spice 1)
I'm tryin' to do some Crack and Mack cause I ain't gettin' no younger (younger)
And these motherfuckin' po-po's they ain't gettin' no dumber (dumber)
Roll a hummer for the summer (summer), Rat Caddy in a fog (fog)
Keep my mind on my money, platinum plaques on the wall
You niggas know I don't be fuckin' around, I'm about the cash
I hope you know I'm all about action and down to blast (Blaow!!)
What the fuck you think? My homies is killers and drug dealers
You're spitters for silencers, crash arms and dome niggas

(Spook Thee Man)
Break bones and stone niggas when you had to be silencered
Dump, dump you gone niggas cause whole fo's rolled up
(Cop chrome) it's on, feelin' the realer niggas gettin' tolled up
This livin' is keepin' niggas twisted and funked up
(On a mission for the cash, can't be stoppin' we mash
Better put the money figure with that little narrow triggers)
City under siege, robbin' the storey because of hords of killers
Don't nobody pay, drugs and fucked a tatted up nigga in the game

(Chorus: Spice 1)
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game
Nigga I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Stick the needle in my vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money, fuck the fame
Tryin' to make it happen motherfucker, cause we too deep in the game

(Chorus: Spice 1)
See I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Take a dose to the vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money and the fame
Tryin' to make it happen ease the pain, cause we too deep in the game
See I wake up every morning with a hustle to gain
Take a dose to the vain, lethal injectin' the game
Tatted up, thugged out, get the money and the fame
Tryin' to make it happen ease the pain, cause we too deep in the game</pre>
