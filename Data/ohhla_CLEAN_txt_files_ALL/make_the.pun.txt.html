[Verse 1: Big Pun]

Yo
To whom it may concern, fuck you
I tear the cushion out the turnbuckle
And pow above you on your face until it turn purple
I hurt you and make shit messy like Kevin Nash
I'm big and sexy, but I relent your ass, bitch test me
Police arrest me on a daily basis, X's on scary faces
To them we all look the same like a pair of races
Instead of races, and where the slaves?
Still searching for better days
Don't feel sorry for me, that's the little things
Don't be afraid kid I know it's hard
Just remember to roll with God
And try not to kill yourself, like Owen Hart
No disrespect I know you miss a bet
But it's just some shit I rhyme about nigga so don't flip on some wrestler shit
Cause I'm a lover and a fighter
A punisher, a rider, Big Punisher one of the last survivors
So pass the highest levels, still ignoring the humble
Won't avoid me in the jungle cause my niggas roar when they rumble

[Hook: Armageddon]

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]

They call me Joe the God
A true warrior like Owen Hart
Smash the face off your neck, rip you to broken parts
You niggas know the squad
Over-flood your whole facade
Just like a scene straight out of Noah's Ark
So who's next for the death flock
Give me your best shot
Hit you with some shit that leave your breath stopped
Respect Crack, I'm the best that done it
One of the the lest confront it
It seems like none of these wrestlers want it
I'm like Hollywood without the Hogan
I'm like Conan without the slogan
Don't make me bust you open
I'll leave you frozen from the cheek down
Hang you up beat down
Then spit in your face, how the cheeks now?
We can meet now, or save it for the full brawl
However you want, I never front, I'm all yours
And the God know the Coliseum
Watch me hop off the Mausoleum
And drop so hard, y'all can barely see him

[Hook: Armageddon]

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war

We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Make the crowd roar 'til they askin for more
We gonna break, rumble, crash, brawl
Terror Squad, we gonna take 'em to war</pre>
