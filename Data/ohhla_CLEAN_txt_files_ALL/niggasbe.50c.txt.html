[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse One: Kidd Kidd]
Mad niggaz wan' do me dirty, I'm fresh out the tub
You move like a snail you deserve to catch a slug
Man I wake up huggin my bitch
One with the extended clip, not the one that I'm with (uh)
If you all made men then you know shit real
They got change on the mic, I ain't tryin to see 'em killed
I told 'em that's my cuz, I don't wanna see nothin happen to him
Cuase when I start spittin at him I ain't rappin to him
Yeah I'm jumpin in that water like a diver
Six shot survivors, school of hard knock scholars
These niggaz ain't riders, they hiders, they cowards
I feel like 50, hold +Power of a Dollar+
I told my nigga give me one of them bullet-proof trucks
I want you dumb enough to try and shoot it up
I'm lookin at the nigga lettin off
Wait until you finish the clip, laugh then pulled off
Huh~!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It sounds like a nightmare, I graduated from fightin
Play the projects faster than the third of two man indictments
See my baby blue Ferrari make 'em feel like the virus
In they stomach, I keep it one hundred I make 'em vomit
I got a code name for straps, the sacks in the trumpet
I get the blowin, ya ears will ring for days when I dump it
My bullet wounds call them beauty marks and my hole we don't talk to narcs
So the first forty eight the clock tickin the plot thickens
The charge cocaine possession I'm creepin with a firearm
The D's don't even wanna see me, with a firearm
Before I go back again I'm a let it off
They ain't got to pop first, fuck that I'm a set it off
I need a mental eval, something's wrong with my brainwaves
I'm rich as a motherfucker still ridin with a AK 
Picture me comin through lettin a nigga play me
When I got all this bread, bitch it's off with ya head...asap!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin  

[Verse Three: Kidd Kidd]
I had to be slippin to let this clown hit me up
Now I got to walk around with this shit bag for months
Now I don't give a fuck 'bout a bitch or a nigga
Startin to treat my own brothers like they just another nigga
My click got smaller and my clips got bigger
Condom on my heart, motherfuck your feelings
They call me Superman see I ain't 'posed to walk
Better watch how you talk or get popped like a cork, off

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
See they ain't real as they seem and they schemin
They fiendin and dreamin, they geekin and creepin
They hear tires screechin, infrared beamin
Niggaz head leakin, what the fuck was he thinkin?
Sounds of police, momma signin new leases
You know you got to relocate her when you beefin
I guess you're here for a real reason
Rah got hit like he got hit but he ain't fuckin breathin, uhh!

[Chorus: 50 Cent] (Kidd Kidd)
Niggas be schemin, fiendin
They cut your jooks, they off the hook, I come through there look how they look
I'm ridin leanin, they dreamin they do me dirty
If they could I'm lookin like I wish you would
(Try me, go 'head, try me) Niggas be schemin, dreamin
(Try me have you hooked to I-V) Niggas be schemin, dreamin</pre>
