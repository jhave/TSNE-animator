5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have a lift off
Turn up, turn up, turn up
Eskimo
Yeah, The coolest DJ
Space cadets nigga
Astronaut
DJ X ray nigga

We're so space cadets
Came to strictly dance
Shake on the downer speaker side
On my face
Show respect
I'm a rock star
Yeah nigga, outer space
I'm a rock star
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of space

I'm a rock star
Outer space
Penthouse
Had a way
Found blue
Getaway
King of Dallas
Boy I lay
Yeah
Fill this window who we want to play
3 bad A 1 OBG
Man we glory ate
Yeah we selling print a coke
Have a drink
Have a toast
Nigga we don't brag a boss
So good, Rolls Royce
Never keen the door
Suicide
Open up
You bag now
Your casket closed
I'm in NASA
Out of here
3 karats in my ear
I can make it disappear
Drape like a chandelier
Astronaut when I slip
Racks on
Racks now
Understanding crystal clear

We're so space cadets
Came to strictly dance
Shake on the downer speaker side
On my face
Show respect
I'm a rock star
Yeah nigga, outer space
I'm a rock star
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of space

We're so space cadets
Came to strictly dance
Shake on the downer speaker side
On my face
Show respect
I'm a rock star
Yeah nigga, outer space
I'm a rock star
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of space

I'm drinking all dirty
Our wrist cost the thirty
My chain in the ocean
I'm floating and rolling
Skeletons on my arm
Skeletons on my back
Andrew Williams on my tats
Benjamin's in my rags
Go spice up my comforts
Cause I'm a phrase on my eye
She clanking on movies now
So media they no surprised
Started in crack houses
Not really mansions
We're the finesse gang
We going to spend it
I talked to a crazy chick
I keep me a dog chick
I got me a combination
Bitches want freaky sex
A black and a white girl
Can mimic a cipher
Banged them 
Something spectacular
There's a place to dance
People strictly dance

We're so space cadets
Came to strictly dance
Shake on the downer speaker side
On my face
Show respect
I'm a rock star
Yeah nigga, outer space
I'm a rock star
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of space

We're so space cadets
Came to strictly dance
Shake on the downer speaker side
On my face
Show respect
I'm a rock star
Yeah nigga, outer space
I'm a rock star
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of space

Future, astronaut status
Turn your time nigga </pre>
