Song:   Last Chance
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In this lifetime no one's guaranteed tomorrow
So you make today the best day you can make it
One life one chance

[Chorus]
This will be our last chance
Our dying breath
Last chance before the end
Last chance our dying dayz
Last chance to change our ways
Last chance to overcome
Last chance for everyone
Last chance to save our souls
Last chance before we fall

So never count me out cats cool laid back when I'm down
'Til my last breath pull it with the Zig Zag born with the game face
Copped an attitude always watch my back
Grew up and learned a lot from the old school
Be my last chance to ever get to make a difference
Ever get to make a change everybody's got opinions
Until my dying dayz now I'm fine with the feeling
Going out with a bang pride and the people give thanks

I got a huge sack of the best of the best
You know who I am it's Richter I don't settle for less
'Cause I love to get high yes I love to smoke weed
And I love to drink beer plus I love the ladies
I'm gonna have a good time with life while I'm living
And I hate to drive but I'm definitely driven
I thank the powers that be for blessing me
With this gift of speech so I relay it lyrically

[Chorus]

Now I've got one day to live tomorrow I gonna die
Call my Pop's up on the cell phone wish him goodbye
Call my Mother and my sister tell them both I love them
Call my both my little brother's then E-Loc my cousin
Then go get my girlfriend and grab her by the hands
Yo look her in the eyes and tell her stick to the plan
We going out blasting so you better get the money
I love you baby this time around it ain't funny

This will be my last chance to make a change
My last chance I'm gonna change today
Because tomorrow I ain't gonna be the same
Last chance I'm 'a' change today
I said who wants to go through a life that amounts to shit
Not me the saddest thing in life is wasting talent
And with that said yo it's time for me to leave
With my last chance I'll change the world indeed

[Chorus]

Tomorrow may never come
That's why I live my life always on the run
You never know when you're gonna be looking down the barrel of a gun
Point blank
Point blank you can put that in the bank
It's guaranteed money like a pound of dank
High test yes life is a test
Until you're in the grave ain't no time to rest
'Cause it's war time the time is now
Take back freedom and make a vow
Take a stand now and fight the power
Rage against the system until the final hour
It's a last chance to make a stand
Open up their minds help them understand
'Cause if not it might be too late
When the whole world engulfed by greed and hate

[Chorus]

'Cause I've seen many friends die way to young
This is your life your chance
You make a difference
You make your reality what you want your reality to be
You go big or don't go at all
'Cause what goes up is bound to fall
So you got to keep your game solid
True, honest, faith and respect are words to live by</pre>
