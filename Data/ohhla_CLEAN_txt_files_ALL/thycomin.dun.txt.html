Here's some shit make ya go "Hmmmm"
Have you ever wondered why the world hates you?
Maybe it's because you is a child of God?
Hmmm

They come (they come) 
Yeah, You best be done ready becausec they come (they come)
Better hold your straps ready because they come (they come)
Your mens better not be spaghetti because they come (they come)
You turn your pocket into grafitti yeah they come (they come)
Nigga you ain't ready but they come (they come)
You better hold your straps ready because they come (they come)
Yeah they come (they come)
Yeah They come (they come)
Now here they come

They say the sound of revelation takin em off while your occupation
Now we all computers puttin cheques by sharp shooters
You cruise world, one nation undivided but deliver me from evil
And these crazy people all across the world
All out warfare mentally, physically, spiritually, emotionally
Fulfullin, you ain't doin no killin
Cause I ain't scared
I got friends comin to my house 
And I gonna put you on your place
By the grace of god
Because I don't really think you ball that hard
That's what your mouth said

(Chorus)

It's like the whole damn world is caught
Now y'all whole motherfuckers is just rotten
Like the CIA, the IRS, the DEA, the FBI and whoever else with three letters in they names
You think you quick on the draw puttin them ten times is mo better
We got all the superstitions they got all the cheddar 
You don't own nothin
You bought from them we might as well say we just leasin
Ain't no reason then why the preacher and his false teachins
Keepin hot coals over your heads
Yeah when I looked into your eyes I will see that

(Chorus X2)
