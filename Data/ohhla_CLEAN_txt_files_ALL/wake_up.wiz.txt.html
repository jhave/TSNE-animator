Song:   Wake Up
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Wake up, wake up, I don't wanna wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up, I don't wanna wake up, wake up.

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well but it's like a dream
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
I don't wanna wake up from

Ohh, long days, but I know hard work pays
so the money getting long too
And the kush smell strong too,
that's that good an the chick with me she the bomb too
one thing I know is go hard young, make fake niggas know this
blowing money 'cause you dyin if you don't live
that's how you know I was fly when I wrote this
first class tax or maybe I'm the first 'cause it's my first class swag
used to say that I was trippin' so a nigga bought expensive ass bags

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well but it's like a dream
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
I don't wanna wake up from

Go hard young, go hard they let you in the game better play your part
Go hard young, go hard and if you win the game might as well play smart
'cause I've seen niggas fall like paper, got money seen friends turn haters
Got money minor league turn major, got money white people turn neighbors
Meet a girl teach her how to roll papers, six months three whips so player
run my town like the mayor I run my town bitch I'm like the mayor

[Chorus]
Yeah I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep but it's like a dream
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
I don't wanna wake up from

[Chorus 2]
I can take you up higher than you ever know
let you touch what you want hit it once and you wont let go, hell no
let you lean back inhale smoke

[2x Chorus]
Yeah, I'm straight never switch lanes on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep but it's like a dream
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from</pre>
