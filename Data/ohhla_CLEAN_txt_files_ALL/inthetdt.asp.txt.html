You know that feeling... Looking down from the plane...
Floating above the city... It's indescribable

In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go!
In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go! 

Temperature rising barbeque vibing
Phallic symbol defining my horizon
Windows down got my family riding
Tuned in buzz bigger than a beehive
And then then then, roadtrip to megacity
To the home of mixed and match jibbys
We don't say our kicks are so crispy
Yea we Still Fly', I love this damn city 
We are the home of the famous
Everyone's a rapper, model or a singer
Friday night get wild as Caribana
Pardon my French - got canadian grammar
Club scene popping,  Aspektz got next
Starting from Scratch now its nothing but Wristpect
One Love Toronto tee across my torso
I'll be your tour guide - show you how things go when you're 

In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go!
In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go! 

In the TDot, In the TDot
We make it clap like
We make it clap like... 

Let's go take a stroll, got something I want to show you
One of one shoes Blue Jays fitted old school
Screwface Capital really nothing but love here
Any single night get it popping like braziers
Shorty shotgun said she's ready to go
Turn it up til the speakers look ready to blow
Hungry? You're in luck, can't say I never told you
Worldwide cuisine inside the golden horseshoe
Condo living and women in fine linens and
Grinning while I'm sinning with women that's named Cinnamon
TDot steez, Jaguar or the Lexus
Rewind selectah, Play De Play de Record
Going to get mashed get crunk get throwed
Jetpack take my city to the top of the globe
Polarbear playboy make you scream Ayo!
Let me let me know next time you're in the TDot 

In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go!
In the TDot in the TDot-Oh!
Windows down let the whole block know!
Been around the globe ain't no place like home!
TDot-Oh! C'mon now let's go! 

Whoo!  It's Aspektz  baby!  The feeling is back
I've been everywhere and nothings the same.  Down south, out east
I love this city man.  And I might roam, but my heart will always be home</pre>
