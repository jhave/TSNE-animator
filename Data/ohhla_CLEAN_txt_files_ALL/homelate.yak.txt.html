[2Pac]
To the end, to the end
To the end my friend

I give, I give a holla to my niggaz

[Sting Sample]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on, Hold on

[2Pac]
To the end my friend

Starin at the world through my rearview
Scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly (Perfect blunt)

Starin at the world through my rearview
Scream to God
I give a holla to my niggaz
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
One love from a thug nigga
Nigga Kadafi!

[Verse 1 - Yaki Kadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin I learned
In school, on some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
by young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rear view

[Chorus: 2Pac](x2)
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

[Sting Sample]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on, Hold on

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
See you been gone my whole life, like a game a cee-lo
fulfilling your dreams on the streets like nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
and me and momma surviving depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
Narcotics is mastered, seen them niggaz you blasted
wanting me in a casket, on the grind I'm faster
Yea nigga I heard, lil' moo gave me word
you get paroled on the 3rd,ill roll up we get served
We out here frontin, still don't care about nothin
rollin in my double r and Im trying to see somethin' we ain't never had
came from a life of living, learn the tricks of the trade
shit shoulda been taught by dad
But learned through the crew, that's just between me and you
and once we lock this shit down, ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I'll stay waiting by the phone
hoping I'll get the call, telling a nigga that you home

[2Pac]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin I'm comin back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone

[Chorus: 2Pac]
And all my motherfuckers
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly

[Sting Sample]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, Hold on

[Verse 3: Yaki Kadafi]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers

Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly </pre>
