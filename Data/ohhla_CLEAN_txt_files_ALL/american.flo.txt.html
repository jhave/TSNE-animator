[Flo Rida]
Heavy metal for them boys, pleny petals for them gals
Gotta appetite for destruction, you can call me ???
Ask me bout what a nigga done done
Ask me bout what a nigga do well
Ask me bout where them bricks come from 
Thats what a snitch nigga do, they tell
I don't want nothin to do wit that there
If its a lick then I'm bringin them shells
Only position for me is a player
Thats rite player, betta get it right player
Might have to be an emergency
Lucky for you I'm up blowin my trees
Calmin my nerves, no regular weed
Or somebodys shorty wit me, on her knees
I'm ready if its a problem, she sexy, Flo Rida hotter
Come test me get that revolver, Ya messy just like a mobster
My broads deserve lobster, you're flawed, deserve choppers
Get served like Jimmy Hoffa, American showstoppa

[Lil Wayne] *ad-libs
*Young Mulaa Babayyyyy!*
I got money on money on money on money
On top of more money, on top of my shit like FLIES
Open that Ferrari F-5 like EYES
Bumpin down Ocean Drive
Jumpin out that maybach wit a bitch, went back to tease them thighs
She gotta tattoo on her booty and it said 305
DJ Khaled say its a movie now don't forget yo lines
Cuz you don't want me to edit, before we roll them credits
Bitch give me my credit, I'm so energetic
I'm fuckin like a rabbit, smokin on lettuce
Whatever I want i get it, i meant it if I said
And I say I keep a pump, and I ain't talkin unleaded
If you want it come get it, cuz boy I'm ready
I get that fast 'fetti, they should call me Tom Petty
Got two bitches, one peanut butter one jelly
I'm a american gangsta, already
And I'ma (american superstarrr)
