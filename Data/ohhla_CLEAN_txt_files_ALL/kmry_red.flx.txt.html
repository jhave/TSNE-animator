	[Funkmaster Flex cuts and scratches "Live up in this piece"]
Live up in this piece
I'ma set off like this, check me out
Now who's these crazy niggaz, drinkin
crazy, pussy, out of crazy straw
Thinkin they crazy hardcore, crazy metaphor
Matter of fact I think them niggaz is gay
Always having a party with no DJ
	[Protect Ya Neck instrumental comes on]
When I rap competition be like "What Squad be on it like that?"
Man, pssct, fuck that
We stay with the lethal dosage
Click on the mic MC's run like roaches
Now they got me up in England my jewels be dangling
While my single be singling
I come with the hardcore
Redman please come off the wall with some more

(Redman)
Yes y'all I come down with the ruckus
Don't y'all know I be the nigga jammin y'all like Smuckers
Freeze, come consecutively like EPMD LP's
Robbin y'all for cheese, now yes y'all whaddIdo
Fuck you and you drink the Olde E brew
Down with Funkmaster Flex yes who's next
To get they whole set burnt like Waco, Tex
Now, I comes down with the sound
Def Squad represent, yes we extra swift
We comes with the boogie, fuck all you rookies
We some tough cookies on the mic dynamite

(Keith Murray)
We here to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
And let our balls hang like we on the toilet takin a shit
Styles is all that, and a big bag of chips with the dip
So fuck all that sensuous shit
I represent intellectual violence
And leave your click holier than the ten commandments
Like Redman I shift with the Ruck
If your if was a spliff we'd be ALL fucked up
No need to ask who is he so we get busy
Scuff our Tims on the boulevard of MANY rough cities
I'll have to Norman Bate ya I love to hate ya
Cuz youse a freak by nate
Can't make the face ya brain erasure
Drink your lyrics down straight with no chaser
My verbal combat's like a mini-Mac to your back
As soon as one of you niggaz try to overreact
The L.O.D. love good confrontation of amp
Break your motivation murder your camp
For the jealous, overzealous, we top sellers fellas
Blow the spot like Branford Marsalis
Niggaz comin through and acting wild
Redman smack the smile off that kid

(Redman)
The Funk Doctor Spock pumps a thousand watts in your vest
Watch, what level next, I'ma take this ghettoness
A little something for the wicked and beyond
Trapper John can't find the sickness in this song
So I bomb ALL these hyper MC's
These Def Squad mentalities, leave your ass calm
Smoke the chalm I got alms like Vietnam
I bought a bag of herb from Ricardo Montalban
To fulfill all these fantasies on the island
To come back home wildin with chrome cash and diamonds
In fact I keep you half-stashed in the seat
Plus you boo boo kept shit locked down on the streets
Peep, how I get funky with techniques
This bass I rock, this bizness I rock, make crack junkies respect me
Then commence to beat an instrumental
With pads and pencils and MC's go incidential
Motherfucker keep the fuckin beat on deck!
While we wreck his whole fuckin set!
[Flex mixes into the Zulu War Chant]</pre>
