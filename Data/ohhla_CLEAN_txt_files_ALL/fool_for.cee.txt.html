[Cee-Lo Green]
Yeahhhhhhhhhh, ayyy yeahhhhhhhh
Well - that real, that deep, that burning
That amazing, unconditional insufferable love
That feel like forever, that always emotional
but still exceptional love
Can't nobody tell me nothin, it is what it is - annnd
Any mistake you make I I just may forgive, ohhh!
Right now right now at this very moment
Still love her like I loved her then
Ohh I love her in and out then up and down
and round and round and, over and over again
So rare they swear that YOU~! just don't exist - annnd
There's only one person I can think of make me feel like this

And I'm a fool, such a foooooool, for you...

Well - that deep, that sweet, that soft and that wet
That fire that's the funky stuff
Ah that up and that down, that front and that back
Baby I can't seem to get enough
Ohhh, baby let me do it, let me do it 'til I'm satisfied - ahhh
Oww baby now please baby I ain't got no more pride
Ohhh! Sweet sugar I surrender
I don't want no other woman, ohh baby you win
And you ain't never got to worry, ever got to worry
You'll never been alone again
There's nothin there's nothin that OOH~! that I wouldn't do
Ahh-ohh, I wrote a song 'bout it momma
Everybody know who I'm talkin to, mmmmmmmmmmmm

And I'm a fool, such a foooooool, for you...

Yeah, yeah, yeah-hah-yeah
