[Talib Kweli]
Yes, original rhythm, the drum beater
Hi-Tek in the house, Kweli in the house
Yo!

[Chorus: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
Yeah, New York to California
The way we do it is fluid just like water
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
Life got a way of sneaking up on ya
The way we do it is fluid just like water

C'mon, beat on the drum like bang-bang and tryna maintain
the same frame of mind while the game change
I know you sick of the same thing, we're different so
stop sticking the needle up in the same vein
The definition of insane, my theory is Big Bang
We hunting for big game, the quick changeover
got the rappers confused, Tek back on the board
Kweli is back in the booth, let's go!

[Chorus: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again
You can say that again

It's independent hustle, it got me on my grind
I flex my pen like a muscle and write a battle rhyme
I got to exercise, I got to get the ghosts out
I got to testify, the legend never die
I'm connected to the struggle, got a little light
and this little light of mine I'm bout to let it shine
I get better with time
So right when you about to say something real slick you like never mind
I stay grounded like airplanes that never fly
I still never come down, I'm forever high
My addiction is American as Devil's Pie
We stay where the snitches live and the rebels die
Men and women might try, numbers never lie
But I'm too fluid, there's no unit that I'm measured by
The nighttime when the ghetto come alive
and the artificial die like Yellow No. 5

[Chorus: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again

Don't it sound African how the voice and the track just blend
The hands get to clapping and, the feet get to tapping and
The power I'm tapping into, it never was accidental
In fact, what a rap ascension to what make Hip Hop so special
You check my Hip Hop credentials, I'm on like I'm rap's potential
It's what I've been sent to do, the task is monumental
These wack emcees make me laugh like Comedy Central
Rappers be acting gassed, it's really not a big issue
They'll lose their bodily tissue, cause something hot just hit you
Just for waving off the nigga tryna politic with you
He's like I gotta get him, I'll try to politic with him
Man he tried to front, that's what he want when these shots hit him
Bet you he change his mind, better learn how to read the danger signs
Try to take my spot, get a number, wait in line
Try to skip, no, get to the back again
Yeah, we back again, you can like rap again, word

[Chorus: Talib Kweli] + (Res)
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again, word
(No matter where you're from
 I will always be in your corner)
That's right, we back again
You can like rap again
You can say that again</pre>
