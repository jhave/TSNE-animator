[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right For The Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista set +Get It Wet+
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS..

[Lil Jon]
STOP! IT'S THA MUTHAFUCKIN' REMIX!!

[beat changes to Lil Jon's version]

[Farnsworth Bentley]
B-E-N-T-L-E-Y
Yee ain't know, you betta ask somebody
What we gonna do is twirk that body
All day at they fitness party
Lock them doors, don't tell nobody
Gentlemens in the Gentlemen's Club
And hitting them with an interesting dub
It's upside down that for the A-Town
What...y'all...sayin?
F.J. Bentley caught misbehaving
Yes I'm the captain and I'm saving, all my money
Yes I'm just gonna...stand...and watch you dance from over here
Matter fact pass the Couvorsier
But I will walk you to your car my dear
Cheers..

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) 4x
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)
