Welcome to my sex room
Sex room, room, ohh, ohh, ohhh
Welcome to my sex room, room

[Ludacris]
Hah, welcome to my little sanctuary
You been lookin so good all day 
and you really got a nigga pretty anxious ba-by
Better call yo' boss, tell him that yo' daddy's home
Take a couple days off and take it off 
and leave nothin but yo' T-shirt and yo' panties on
Feelin high but I'm hung real low lookin sorta like a tri-pod
So power down yo' cell phone, and power up yo' iPod
Power down yo' inhibitions, and power up yo' inner freak
(Yes, yeah fuck!) Is the only words that you finna speak
It's about to get real X-rated, can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
But enough about me, let me think should I be worryin about if I can handle you?
Damn RIGHT I'ma get that thang, and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thang, Allstate better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my firecracker, my tongue finna spark you up
Get ready for blast-off, waterfalls gon' splash off
You might lose around four or five pounds so get ready to SWEAT yo' ass off

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
Welcome to my sex room, where yo' body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it
In my sex room, candles and the pole
Sex your body to your soul, from the bed down to the flo'
Sex room, mirrors in the headboard
Even got a camcord', baby won't you dance
In my sex room, where yo' body meets my body
It's our private afterparty, if you want it girl I got it
In my sex room

[Ludacris]
Let the candles burn, I'ma turn these lights down
And when your body gets hot it'll get you licked up, and iced down
Nipples hard as ROCKS, lips as soft as cotton
You the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten
I'ma get my video camera, let's make a movie baby
You the star so as soon as I press record you gots to do me baby
You could stare all in the mirror, take a peak at how good you lookin
I'ma have your body SMOKIN, take a look at what Luda's cookin
My arm underneath your leg, legs all behind your head is how I gots to getcha
Right hand, left hand on red in the bed like we been playin Twister
Now I got you tangled up, and you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose? Nah, I think I'll get the blindfold instead
You better get a couple towels baby, cause we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or a saddle, I'ma give you this dick to ride
I'ma grant yo' every wish, and fulfill yo' fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room, it's only you and me
Woo!

[Chorus] - minus last line

[Trey Songz]
Listenin to what your body say, we can do it every other kind of way
Hit it in the sun, up in the shade, tell me what it is I got you babe
Baby let's hop up in the shower, baby let me snatch up off that towel
Let me get a vowel, I-O-U, so I-E-U mean I eat you
(To my sex.. to my sex..) Come into this room
(To my sex.. to my sex..) You know what I'ma do
(To my sex.. to my sex..) Grab my body tight, don't let me go (go)
How you wanna ride just let me know!
In my sex room (ohh) room, room, ohh, ohh, ohhh
Know that I want it, legs in the air!
(To my sex.. to my sex..) With your toooooes pointed
So baby welcome to my sex room

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Trey Songz]
Sex room, room, ohh, ohh, ohhh
I got it right here
In my sex room
Sex room, room, ohh, ohh, ohhh</pre>
