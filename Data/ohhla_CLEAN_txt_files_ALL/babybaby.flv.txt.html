[Flavor Flav - singing]
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)
You can't see what you doin to me, ohhhh
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)
You've got me walkin with nowhere to goooooo
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)

(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
I got your back, all the time
I'll never do anything to HURT YOU~!
(And don't you know my love is true now)
Even at our worst times, baby girl I will SALUTE YOU~!
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Nothing they can say to me, will never convince me to LEAVE YOU~!
(And don't you know my love is true now)
Long as you keep, tellin the truth
I will always have a reason to BELIEVE YOU~!
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)

Baby, baby, baby...

Baby, baby, baby...

(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
(And don't you know my love is true now)
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
(And don't you know my love is true now)
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
(And don't you know my love is true now)
(And don't you know that I'll be home to you)
Baby, baby, baby...
