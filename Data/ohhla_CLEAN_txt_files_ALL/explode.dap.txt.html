Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's not a science, now
It's just a way it goes
You spin me all around
No gravity, no ground
My world is your snow globe
You turn me upside down
You know I like the shake
You make my heart quake

You speak and I'm grumbling
You move and I'm fluttering
Slowly I'm losing control

I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one could save me
No drug could fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh,
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode

You're looking in my face and I can't keep it down
I let the words escape I've gone and shout it out
No I can't help myself, I can't control it babe, I feel it building up
You got me blown away

You speak and I'm grumbling
You move and I'm fluttering
Slowly I'm losing control

I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one could save me
No drug could fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode

[Dappy:]
I'm the daddy and you know that
You know once you go Dap you never go back
Should be on my shhh
Even though she got a man at home
Three words whipped Indiana Jones
I'm gonna take a back seat
But only if you get in front
Body smoking she loves it when I'm being blunt
Sun kissed skin straight from the Caribbean
You a good girl pretty bad news
See that you ain't in for the moolah
Don't think cause you're hot I won't throw you in the cooler
You know you're my bad b, so hold that
I won't look into your eyes till they roll back
Put it, put it down on me baby do it nice and slow
If you ain't like them others show me something that I don't know
If you're a time bomb then I'm gonna make you blow
Just leave them high heels on and turn them lights down low

I feel it banging
Got me vibrating
You got me and I'm falling, so don't let me go
No one can save me
No drug can fix me
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode
It hit me now, I feel like I'm going to explode</pre>
