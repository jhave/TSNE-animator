Here we come here we come, here we come through the do'
Here we come here we come, they can't stop us no mo'
Two thugs bout to explode, dropping low
We the shit huh, somebody blunt you come on

[Slim Thug]
I'm nineteen on 20's, every time I floss
I'm nineteen in the clean, quarter million dollar house
I hit the club and pour mo', like the drank don't cost
Got smart left the House, just so I could be boss
I wasn't hating I just know, I can do what Watts do
Probably not dropping screwed, but I can lead my own crew
Sign a contract with who, for what, and why
I wanna be a CEO, and I got enough cash to try
If I fail oh well, I'm still gon make mail
Cause tapes, CD's and LP's, ain't the only thing that sell
When niggaz capping I don't shut up, I can add to that
Not Lil Troy but Slim Thug, gon stay sitting fat
I'm a underground Hogg, you better ask somebody
I'm a young Hogg that ball, you better ask somebody
When its time to get my grind on, I grind
But when its time to get my shine on, I shine

[Hook - 2x]

[E.S.G.]
Now who really the best, since Pac ain't here
Must be E.S.G., so when I drop this year
Now Lil D I bring fear, and my drop sitting low
I'm on my twins on swoll, like Scottie Pippen hoes
While we stepping on some toes, we keep the contract
Don't give a damn where I'm at, I can tote a label on my back
Somebody say we too young, to do our own thang
Ain't no ways to get paid, we bout to raise some hair mayn
Hey the world swanging man, I'm a bad actor dog
This year I'm a Boss Hogg, better check my catalog
Went gold with Master P, on Down South Hustlers
Two hundred thousand independent, Sailing the South little busta
Up to the park what's crunk, I was Shining and Grinding
Dirty Third, sitting emcees got no need for reminding
Who's the man, cause this is my year cuz
Can't get with it, better get some bullet proof filled blood
