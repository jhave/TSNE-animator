[Chorus: Nelly]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
I was thinkin 'bout her, thinkin 'bout me
Thinkin 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dreeeeeeeam
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dreeeeeeeam

[Nelly]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowin somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
When I be ridin man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin to get my Usher on but I can't let it +Burn+
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missin, wishin she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
