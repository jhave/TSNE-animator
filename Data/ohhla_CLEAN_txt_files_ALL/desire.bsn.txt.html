Song:   Desire, Want, Need
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Got goals, got dreams, I'm infatuated with nice things
I love money, it might seem
This is my desire want and need

[Verse 1]
All I do is eat shit and think about success
Cause man, I done have enough stress
But I beat every obstacle they put up
I'm back against the wall like a stove so I cook up
I've always been the best at every single thing I took up
So I feel extra bad for the challenges they hooked up
(D-Town)Come and make a visit to the (West Side) if I need to be specific
If I ever up in court best believe I plead the fifth and they headed to the club bartender bring a 50
These niggaz bitches swear to god the p-to-missing
I'm just chillin with my family, Mr. Peter Griffin
And my girl look better than yours
And I'm the only thing lookin better than her
Yeah, and I'm just tryin to make a million off recordin
Psychic read my fortune, said Id be worth a fortune

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
I learned at a young age you gotta grind for it
We been waitin all day n night for it
It seems like weve been waiting all our life for it
Some niggaz'll take a life for it
But I'm a say it I did it all legitamate then put my niggaz on it just to say I was considerate
Race to success and I'm like where the competition went?
The musics runnin bitch and it never tore a ligament
Niggaz comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon
B-I-G, but how much is you chargin?
Runnin up to me for they buzz like a barber
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder
And I'm a live this life till I'm gone
Only people that could give you life is a judge and God
But the only one that judge me is my God
So I'm a live life like fuck what you thought

[Chorus x2]

This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I live for
This is what I die for
This is what I stayed up every single night for
This is what I waited my whole life for
This is what I waited my whole life for

[Chorus x2]</pre>
