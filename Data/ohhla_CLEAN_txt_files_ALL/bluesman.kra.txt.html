Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hey What 'chu tryin' to do
Why you tryin' to see through me baby
It's way too hazy
Hey I'm still feelin' the same
So don't go tryin' to change me baby
You can't save me
So many people try to bring me down
They wouldn't last a second in my town

[Chorus]
Hey I've always been a blues man
Hey I little rhythm and blues man
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose
I said Hey I've always been a blues man
Hey a little rhythm and blues man
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight

You stem so far from the truth
You hide inside all your talkin' papers
Flashin' statements
You never put your money down
And watched a big wheel go around and take it
And in remake it
All you do is follow me around
Then you go ahead and ride it down

[Repeat Chorus]

Don't try walkin' inside my shoes
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose
I said don't try walkin' inside my shoes baby baby
I said Hey I've always been a blues man
Hey a little rhythm and blues man
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes
Unless your puttin' up somethin' to lose
I said Hey I've always been a blues man
Hey A little rhythm and blues man
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes
Unless your unless your unless your
Hey I've always been a blues man
Hey A little rhythm and blues man
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight</pre>
