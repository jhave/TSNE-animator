Uh, uh, uh, uh, OWW!
It's like a walk in the park
She even fuck with a nigga in the dark
She been fuckin with a nigga from the start
Cause she fucked with a nigga from the heart
Man, it don't get no realer
See her fuckin with another nigga I'll kill her!
Huh, that's how much I feel her
It's like I'm the fiend and she's the dealer
BUT - that's my baby
She's the only one that, make me crazy
Ain't no maybes, never act shady
And at the end of the day she STILL my lady!

[Chorus: Tyrese]
Say what you want, that's my baby
Only one that drives me crazy
End of the day she's still my lady
She got my back, I got HERRRRS {*4X*}

[DMX] Bigger than words~!

[DMX] + (Tyrese)
Hey, HEY! Somethin special about her
And it ain't even the pussy, I just can't live without her
Independent chick, yeah she work
Strong, but if I do wrong, then yeah she hurt
HEY! We all got feelings
What we feel is so real, it's straight to the ceiling
After a long day of robbin and stealin
A nigga come home for some (sexual healin)
Yeah, that's my boo
Only she understand what I been through (ooh babe)
She got my heart, let it do what it do
Said, "I love you baby!" I love you too (sexual healin)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[DMX] Bigger than words~!

[Tyrese]
Say, say, say what you will
Say what you want, say what you see

[DMX]
Man, I went to school with her
Since 14 I was fool with her
To see her bent over, I shot pool with her
Bitch was so bad didn't know what to do with her
In the hood she was that chick
And I was that nigga who with that bitch
And if I went and lost my life
I'd die knowin she was my wife
I'll rest in peace

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[DMX] More than words~!
