[Chamillionaire]
Welcome to the evening news, I thank you all for tuning in
Yes, I'm your host and your journalist, Chamillionaire, so let the news begin
Our helicopters out in the streets look at the screen, an' let's zoom it in
'cause Cashis is live at the scene, hey Cashis how are you my friend?
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews)
No time to trip don't be confused, cause this type of news depends on interviews
Got no time for no interviews (go-got no time for no interviews)
You know I keep my ear to the streets so it's up to me to bring you the truth
I saw a movie were George Bush had a bearded man on his squad
So much power from oil money that poor folks can't sit by him
No problem, Osama, Bin Laden, Been hidin'
So long that them pictures all starting to look like him on them milk cartons
Don Imus made comments that made everybody forget about him
That's him, Anna Nicole got pregnant and had kids by him
Rest in peace to Virgina Tech, too many innocent kids dyin'
Well let's just blame hip-hop and act like that's the big problem

[HOOK]
Now I would give you news about Katrina
but you know I can't talk about Katrina
'Cause every time I talk about Katrina
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
George Bush is playing golf, everybody hush, he's about to putt

[CHORUS]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning
Dropout rate rising, so what are they learning?
Sending the troops in the war so I turn it
To today's evening news
And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

I know you take offense to certain words
I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya'
They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, never mind Kramer
The Crocodile Hunter got stung, and the lion turned on the lion tamer
We keep sending troops to Iraq, I figured that we must like danger
Little kids don't learn in school they go to school to go spray a gun
If you a parent, then be a parent, get off the couch and go raise your son
Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81
Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him
OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive
It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die
Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high
But I'm not going to read that, 'cause we all know that that's a lie

[CHORUS]
Gas prices raises, the money keeps burning

And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
This is your evening news

We still haven't found Pac's killer, still haven't found Biggie's either
30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather
Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he gets a new subpoena
Innocent when murder was the case so the prosecution got a middle finger
Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading
Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating
If you don't like it on the radio or the television then switch the station
Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating
Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that
The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black
9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack
He gave a speech on CNN, "They bombed us, now we're bombing back"
Where the heck is Osama at?

[HOOK]
Now I would give you news about Katrina
but you know I can't talk about Katrina
'Cause every time I talk about Katrina
they look at me like it's a misdemeanor
Anyways, there's way more important stuff that we can discuss
N'SYNC makin the band and Milli Vanilli have broken up

[CHORUS]

As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow)
