Ya feel me ?
So all the ladies that wanna get wit us
Ya got to be special

Um
Goodness grief it's Snoop and Keith
Sweat , a double dose of this triplethreat
Yep , more wet white star in the glass
Here's a toast to the fool who let you slip in with no pass
All night sess , you can jump and a-test
When we through par-laying
You dig what i'm saying ?
You look good girl
But you'd look better if you was with me
Get in where you fit in
Let's do this V-I-P

(Keith Sweat)                           (Snoop Dogg)
Look a here shorty
You really got it going on               You really got it going on
I like the way you move it girl
When the DJ play's you're song
You looking real good to me , so good to me
Sitting in a V-I-P                       Holla at me , holla at me
You really need to get with me , c-mon



Chrystal blowing , blowing
Body still glowing , still glowing
Eyes looking everywhere , but i still have to stop and stare
Cause you're looking real good to me , so good
Sitting in the V-I-P                     Holla at me , holla at me
You really need to get with me           What's happening baby
Ohh yeah baby

(chorus)
So come and get with me , come get with me babe

Come and get with me , come get with me babe

(chorus 2)
Come spend the night tonight , i've got what you need

(Keith Sweat)                             (Snoop Dogg)

Yeh , yeh , yeh , yeh
Tell me what you wanna do                 What you wanna do , huh ?

(chorus 1)

(Snoop Dogg)
Now , i've seen alot of girls
But none like you
You red , boned and thick , got it going on , ooh
She in the next room
I slid by the rest room
And all i heard was Zoom , Zoom , Zoom
I see ya peeking
But you ain't speaking
Put your drink down , think now , stop tweaking
A once in a lifetime experience
Come get with me , it'll be luxurious , i'm serious
And curious
To find out what turns you on
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg
With the doggy bone
Hanging with Keith Sweat in his V-I-P section
Trying to give you more than the average affection
Type of mood , that i'll close the doors when it's going down
You never thought that Keith Sweat would hook up with the Dogg Pound
Gangsta's finest
Take time to listen , come get with me
Cause we on a mission
