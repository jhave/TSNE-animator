[Intro]
YEAH! YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!

[Chorus]
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
WHOA!!! WAVE!!! WHOA!!! WAVE!!!
I wave the heat deep, with my right to speak
Leave the clip y'all, and talk shit y'all
WHOA!!! WAVE!!! WHOA!!! WAVE!!!

[Verse One]
I'm not tellin you to shoot somebody, but if somebody try to shoot you shoot 'em
Don't waste time, lil' nigga just do it
Any nigga out of order, must be serviced
See now now you hesitatin boy you makin me nervous
The Feds know I clap heat felonies on my rap sheet
Front on me try to run from me hollows be up your back b!
Pistol pop, dime for dime, burn baby burn
Revolver spinnin again and again you niggas never learn
Got a itchy itchy itchy itchy trigger finger nigga
So if you hit me and you get me I'll be back to get ya
Man I might bring the homies in that's if it's necessary
See you might not be worried, but I think you should worry
Them bullets come in flurrie, next thing you know you're buried
YEAH!!! I do away with nine niggas in nine days
My nine sprays, which it don't go my way
Hold it sideways, fuck around cause a crimewave

[Chorus]
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
WHOA!!! WAVE!!! WHOA!!! WAVE!!!
I wave the heat deep, with my right to speak
Leave the clip y'all, and talk shit y'all
WHOA!!! WAVE!!! WHOA!!! WAVE!!!

[Verse Two]
I talk about my arsenal, I rap about my infantry
Them crackers they be scared of me, the hood man, they into me

Louie V. napsack filled up with G-stacks

Go 'head fuck with the kid, see it's just what I said
See the stash, I'm makin double makin kilos bubble
{?} stop, boy I cut you til' your ma don't know you
See when we play them +Warriors+ come out to play
You wanna play? Get your ass laid out today
See I'm back on the shit I was on before
So if a nigga try to stunt, we gon' take 'em to war

[Chorus]
When the strap out, you know what that 'bout
We do it my way, cause a crime wave
WHOA!!! WAVE!!! WHOA!!! WAVE!!!
I wave the heat deep, with my right to speak
