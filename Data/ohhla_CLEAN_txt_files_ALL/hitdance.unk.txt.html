[Unk]
Go 'head you got it momma, this right here yo' time to shine
Grab your girl, hit the floor, I see you stayin on your grind
I watch you twerk it baby, drop that thang to the flo'
Now tell a friend that this yo' song, girl bend your back low
She keep her hair fixex, she keep her nails done
She goin by the bar, she throw a thousand ones
She rock the stunna shades, Jazze she a stunna man
Oh she see a stunna man, yeah Unk I'm the man
Now brush your shoulders off, make that money let 'em hate
Why you all in V.I.P. them other broads sit and wait
I see you came to party, Big Oomp we be off the ave
Smoke exotic kush, hypnotic girl did it with no hands
I like the way she drop it, wobble and shake it
Make make me wanna get naked, you wet it, do it, don't fake it
Now break it down (break it down) girl throw yo' back at it
Do your dance on the flo' and make 'em throw a stack at it

[Chorus]

[Unk]
You gotta love it baby, you as fly as the sky
Now work that Tinkerbell for that M-O-N-E-Y
I see it in your eyes, dancin yeah she got the glare
The baddest chick up in the club that's why they stop and stare
The party's over here, yeah the party's over there
The women representin and my niggaz everywhere
The club jumpin, DJ tell 'em hit the dance flo'
Got DJ Montay on the beat now watch the speakers blow
Yea baby girl, make 'em see a show
Just pop it, drop it, down down to the flo'
Your boy Unk representin, I do this for the people
Got Big Oomp on my chain, she see my diamonds lethal
I see she shakin plenty, cause she's a money maker
Do this one for your boi, shake your salt shaker
So go on and get your crew, and meet me on the flo'
If you ain't here to party, you can hit the do'

[Chorus]

Now get low, get low, get low, get low (I see you got it girl)
Get low, get low, get low, get low (I see you got it girl)
Get low, get low, get low, get low (I see you got it girl)
Get low, get low, get low, get low (I see you got it)

Ay bend your back low, now stop pop and roll (I see you got it girl)
Ay bend your back low, ay bend your back low
