Verse One:

Police all on my dick like I shot somebody
Cause of these big ass lips and I rock my locks knotty
Life is getting hectic Tupac got shot in the nuts
You saw cops was corrupt when Rodney King got fucked up
With friends like these who needs enemies
Constantly harassing, filling up my nuts like a Klansman
Snatching up a nigga for nuttin I heard bad guys wear black
So I guess I'm the motherfucking villain
Under pressure they got me under pressure
What's your name your address and phone number
Your occupation come down to the station
There's been a robbery they claim a nigga fit the description
It can't be, so I slides out on em
In ninety-five you gotta catch a nigga, if you want him
One to three, and five to ten
Bullies in blue suits Son with automatic weapons
I'm stressed, ready to blow up somethin
The beast keep frontin, invasion

Verse Two:

I was forced into a life of crime
Career criminal, now my career is crime
My mind is in a fucked up state
A brainwashed state, is the black man's fate, in the ground
or locked down upstate, when I was young I used to shoot for the stars
but got shot down by demons in patrol cars
Stars good cop, bad cop, stick up the crack spot
The ave won't get hot til one of their crew gets shot
Ask, Larry Davis, how much they took
Cops and crooks, but who's the crooks?
Take a nigga to jail, make bail, guilty or innocent
The system gets ten percent
Frontin like you're doin somethin
But you ain't sayin nothin, invasion

Verse Three:

Come up in my cipher best believe I'ma dip on that ass
Beast-boy I'm professional heart of the ghetto
raised, in the ways of thugs
Dodgin slugs, takin slugs, driving stolen automobiles
skills fantastical
Living life on the edge it's dramatic, mad drama
I'm a fanatic, adrenalin addict
Getaway car, stick shit or automatic
Where's my crew at, you got your crew scopin
for a nigga up and down the Ave, it makes me laugh
Eat my nuts, eat my dust
I won't spend the night locked up or in handcuffs
Cuz in the conrete jungle, I got the right stuff
Smooth operator, pilot and navigator
Break out from oppression, my mission to escape
The, invasion
