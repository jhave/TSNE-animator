Romeo, Romeo, wherefor art thou?
That's what Juliet asked, but I don't know now
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Yo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at Ju-li-et
Don't regret, cause he will be back
to come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab
But, there's an obstacle that's in his way
I think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay
Well, I'm the B-I-Z-M-izza-A-R-K
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
that you two people are a part of life
It explains why Romeo died by the knife
Or was it - the poison on Juliet lips
or vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips
Whichever way it was, it's very educational
So look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing a long, now come on now

	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4X)

To the R-O-M-E-O, and the J-U-L-I-et
I think the thing he did was to get respect
The way that I see it, it was a great deed
Because if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed
at getting Juliet's heart, and loving care
and all of the moments they had to share
But I really want you just to check out the plot
of the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot
It will make you laugh, it make you cry
and that's when you know you will be satisfied
Cause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right
cause the Diabolical is outta sight
Yo, Romeo and Juliet should be household names
They names should be in the hall of fame
with my funky beat, you can never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing this song, now bust it out now

	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!
	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!</pre>
