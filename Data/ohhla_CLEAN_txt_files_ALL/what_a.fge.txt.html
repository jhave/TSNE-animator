[Inrto: Wyclef]
It's funny how the Earth rotates, man you never know what's 
going to happen, ya know mean?
All I said was "Aiight, I got this chiki bang bang dang da dang"
Then it all got it started for me, man
Yo, man I'm just getting back from the tour, man
What it be like, man?
Yo, bust it, turn me up
Somebody told me if you can make in New York City, man, you can 
make it anywhere else, man
Somehow I believe that shhhh

[Chorus] (Wyclef)
Oh, what a night
Late December, 1993 (what happened?)
Who thought he would rule the industry?
What an MC on the grind

[Wyclef]
Yo, I ain't always have whips, I ain't always have yachts
I ain't always have chips, I ain't always have rocks
Matta fact I was a grimey little negro
Who said if music didn't work, I'd sell diesel
What cha'll thought, I wasn't raised in the projects?
First of the month waitin for that PA check
Lived on the first floor
Were so poor that if you rung the buzzer the roaches would answer the door (who is it?)
I went from boy to man in one night
When I saw my life flash like light from poltergeist
What made it worse, I couldn't speak English
But from his facial expressions, he wanted my Adidas
So hurry up and come out and play
I'll be damned if I leave bare-footed in this hallway
And I got big plans, so beg your pardon
Cause next year this time I'ma sell out the Garden

[Chorus]

[Wyclef]
Yo, yo, I ain't gonna brag and boast and say I did it all
But I'm the only rapper to play Carnegie Hall
The first rap group, video cost a million
First rapper to ever rep for the Haitians
And sa fa say, na boolay
Grammy night, we took 3 away
22 million sold, I can't believe this
There's still ain't a rapper alive who could achieve this
But I ain't satisfied, when back to my home contemplating
How could I become the next Quincy Jones?
That's when Jerry hit me up on the horn and said 
"Clef, your on the cover of
the cover of The Source by The Rolling Stones"
No more struggling, good life we loving it
You could live it too, if you only publish it
So here we go, so what's the scenario?
I own so many cars that I'm renting 'em for videos 

[Chorus]</pre>
