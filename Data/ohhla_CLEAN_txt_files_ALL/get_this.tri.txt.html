Typed by: toyainva@hotmail.com

[Chorus]
Come on, all my ladies, let's get this money
Come on, all my fellas, let's get this money
It's only for all of us to get this money
Ain't no need for player haters acting funny

Come on, all my ladies, let's get this money
Come on, all my fellas, let's get this money
Trina finna show you how to get this money, right

[Verse 1]
You gotta have a J-O-B to be with me
Best believe I'm going diamond on my next LP
I stacked my game up, sexed my frame up
Bitches using my style, I'm set to change up
Unh, new year, new gray Jag
After the first album, you should hear Shay brag
I been around the world playing 2-way tag
While these wannabe Trinas out here claim bad
But guess what, I'm still the baddest
Jewels still flooded with 24 karats
OK, you know I live lavish
Chanel glass slippers in a Cinderella palace

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Unh, unh, See me on South Beach rolling the five
When I come through hoes rolling they eyes
I'm the- baddest bitch, so I'm used to that
Draped in the hot shit off the Gucci rack
I like Tiffany ice, that expensive stuff
The diamond princess draped in princess cuts
Don't be mad hoe, cause I'm that bad hoe
Pushing that pink Lamborghini Diablo
I play niggas like dummies for the fast money
You wanna holla, it's gon' cost you cash money
Slip and slide, then we stacking chips
The redbone, wonder woman with the platinum wrist

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Breakdown
Miami hot, 'Candy' flopped
I'm the new bad girl and I can't be stopped
Unh, sipping Bailey's, flossing daily
On TRL with Carson Daly
Dressed to chill, icy, extra chill
Touch of class, bad with the sex appeal
Flawless baby, female ballers baby
Stay diggin' in them millionaires wallets baby
Tored up, Christian Dior'd up
Cases of that Cris, gettin poured up
Got it sewed up, like stitches
Reppin' for my bad bitches, stackin' riches
I shine, baby cause the game is mine
I'm on top of the charts, no room to climb
And when I say I'm the baddest, I'm mean it
Me and this cash, can't nothing come between this

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
