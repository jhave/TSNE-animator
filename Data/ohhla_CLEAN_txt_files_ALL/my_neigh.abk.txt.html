Song:   My Neighborhood
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[ABK]
My neighborhoods full of drama, killas and thugs
Everybody's representing by throwing em up
With a quick hi, hello, or beat down baby
Even the cops know the blocks that it's all time crazy
It's alright cause it's home sweet hood
Even though half of us is up to no good
You gotta love it when you born and raised
In place full of problems that you gotta face
I'm a native in the city of these Detroit streets
With a warrior mentality that won't at ease
Tomahawk in one hand, blunt in the other
So I can just get high and swing at motherfuckers
That's how it is, I protect my shit
On my front porch serving up free fat lips
So come and see me if you down to hang
But when you visit in the mix you can't be acting strange

[Chorus x4]
My neighborhood ain't what it's all crack up to be
So much drama

[Boondox]
H-double o-d-c-o-v in the double 7-0 is where you finding me
With that front porch living got that lawn chair high
But don't mistake this lifestyle for a reason to try
Cause it's a reason to die, we straight country folk bangin
Them dirt road junkies know them country folk slangin
Got that hard, that soft, that prescription for your mentals
My neighborhood homies got them backwoods credentials
Two 4 door chevies, one's on blocks, the other pumped out
Bad ass kids leaving grown folk's punked out
Trailer park cooking serving up that ass
City folk's cars swerving when them hoes walk past
Because them cornbread booties got em hypnotized
Spending college tuitions just to grip them thighs
My neighborhood to some might seem worlds away
But this is where I stay, Red clay, G-A

[Chorus x4]

[Female]
My neighborhood
[ABK]
Is on lock cause we like it that way
[Female]
My neighborhood
[ABK]
Is a place where the gangsta's play
[Female]
My neighborhood
[ABK]
Can see right through you if you don't belong
[Female]
My neighborhood
[ABK]
Can defeat all the weak and build up the strong
[Female]
My neighborhood
[Boondox]
Is on some shit like you ain't never seen
[Female]
My neighborhood
[Boondox]
Red dirt roads full of thugs and fiends
[Female]
My neighborhood
[Boondox]
Country fucking mouths ain't never heard of no blocks
[Female]
My neighborhood
[Boondox]
Is so far out, don't bother calling no cop

[Chorus x4]</pre>
