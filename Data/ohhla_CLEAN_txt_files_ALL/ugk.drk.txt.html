Yea... bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be drivin, it just got so much harder
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight
Ohh, fuck with me, I'll buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggaz die a lot
And lie a lot but I'm the truth, that's right I fuckin said it
The livin proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rappin bitches, bitches and rappin
Rappin and bitches until all of it switches - I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important what really happened before this
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
singin "Walkin like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah~!"
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushin myself to get somethin that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin back to my WAYS

[Chorus: Drake]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm a underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city {"U.G.K., fuck these other niggaz"}

[Drake]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
And tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talkin all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggaz got them diamonds glowin in they mouth
And they rockin furs like it's snowin in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryin to be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothin I'ma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that; makin major changes to the life I'm livin
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin back to my WAYS
