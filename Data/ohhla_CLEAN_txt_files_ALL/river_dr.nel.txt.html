[Stephen Marley]
Yeah!  Yeahhhh, yeah!
Yeah, right down, right down
Light on, heh, right down

[Chorus: Nelly] + (S. Marley)
They say - walk down the river
cause the river don't run (Yeah!)
Same thing make you laugh, make you cryyyyyyyyyyyy
(That's why what goes around comes around, my son)
They say - walk down the river
cause the river don't run (River don't run!)
Same thing make you laugh, make you cryyyyyyyyyyyy - c'mon!
Plus I got the rocks, them yellow diamonds and that oh-oh-ohh
Bling!

[Nelly]
C'mon!  Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I got two twin Cutlass's interior gatored (hmm)
I call 'em Now'N'Laters cause they candy flavored
You see, I drive one now and drive the other one later
Shit it's the new Fresh Prince and all I'm missin is Jada (hey)
I got a hard drive, all I'm missin is data
Please give my number to your sister, I been missin a dater
I hate to hate a hater, in fact I hate to hate
Hatin is hatin, you should never hate, congratulate
Look hurr, my attitude is sensed that you may never know my mind
I know just what I'm thinkin if I don't want you inside
Yeah, inside my men-tal, I know you meant well
I'm +Out Of Time+ and out of +Training Days+ like Denzel
Never the gangsta type, more like a hustler - mayne
I fuck them ones up out them +Playboy+ books and +Hustler+ - mayne
+Honeys+ and +Black Tails+ (uhh) the +King+ magazines (yeah)
The +Maxim+ or the "Eye Candy" +Jet Beauty Queens+

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'ma spit it 'til I really can't spit it no mo' (yeah)
Nothin changed, cell phone still 3-1-4
Nah the derrty ain't moved to near East/West coast
I'm a "Midwest Swanger" cause they love me the most (hey)
Some like me humble, others like me to boast
Please, my whole life is alphabets and numbers
I take a G-4 Land to that H-2 Hummer
Leave at 7:45 in L.A. for the summer
I got the World Wide sale to check the E-mail
Plus 401-K plan in A-T-L
Got eight females, I see 'em all from 8 to 12
The only playa who can ball without his A.C.L. (c'mon!)
Who may not be original but still a don-dada (yeah!)
I'm gon' take this beat and flip it, I'm gon' make it hotter (yeah!)
You go 'head and take your plane and I'm gon' take the chopper
I'm tired of niggaz frontin like they top gun shottas (hey)

[Chorus]

[Stephen Marley]
Not come runnin ovah!  Jah-Jah shine his light (JAH!)
Blessed is the day!  Sacred is the night (yeah)
Wrong wishers beware (watch it) now that I am here
Hey, lordy lordy lordy lordy Lord
Lordy lordy lordy lordy Lord

[Murphy Lee]
Shoot, they thought a derrty wouldn't make it this far (far)
Now I'm supportin my family, they likin who I are (are)
Schoolboy a hard worker, they consider him a star
I guess that's why they look at us as if we from Mars
Singin-a-ling!  I deal with bars like a weight trainer (trainer)
Hustlin got me bigger like weight gainer (gainer)
Always remain a, St. Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her?
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kick bars for a livin
Get rich and trick, collect cars for a livin
Houses on hills, with Great Lakes in the back
Bowlin alleys in basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn, look at the leather in that old school 'Llac
They be doo-doo green, I wonder who would do that
The original rude dude, considered too cool
Probably know me from touchin yo' booty at school
Bling!

[Chorus]
