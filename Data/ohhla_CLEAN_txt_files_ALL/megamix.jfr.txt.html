  [Brand New Funk]
Get down, brand new funk, hit it
Get down, brand new funk, hit it
:
It's new, it's out of the ordinary
It's rather extrordinary, so yo bust this commentary
A literary, genius, and a superior beat creator
Have come together, and we made a
Musical composition which we think is a remedy
To cure all the dance floors that's empty
You wanna dance?  We got what you want
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince bustin out with the brand new funk

  [Brand New Funk -vs- Summertime]
Summer, summer, summertime (get down, brand new funk, hit it)
Time to sit back and unwind (get down, brand new funk, hit it)
Summer, summer, summertime (get down, brand new funk, hit it)
Time to sit back and unwind (get down, brand new funk,hit it)

  [Summertime]
Here it is the groove slightly transform
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony
A little bit out of control, the monotony

Listen homeboys don't mean to bust your bubble
But girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble
So next time a girl gives you the play
Just remember my rhymes and get the hell away

  [Parents Just Don't Understand]
You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you, all the kids all across the land
