[Verse 1] 
You looking good in them guess's shawty showing yo ass
Make a nigga wanna grab a hold of yo ass
Strip you out yo couchie dress and hit the flo' wit yo ass
When I leave the club I wanna see some more of yo ass
I ain't tricking shit but I might spend some dough on yo ass
The way you bouncin on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncin yo ass
If I leave the club wit something rather go wit yo ass
Them other broads fine but you a pro wit yo ass
When I see u poppin and droppin I know it's yo ass
In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass
 
[Bridge: T.I.]
A now a thug done chose 
And I don't give a damn if the club done closed
Give the DJ a dub tell him spin one mo
So I can finish watching you poppin yo
shakin yo, droppin yo, bouncin yo ass

[Hook: T.I. &amp; Females]

(repeat)

[Verse 2]
I see ya every Friday night outside the club in da line wit ya partners
Shawty you see all that ass poking out them Dolce Gabbana's
Hey as soon as she get in I'm a find her ass
The first record the DJ spend I'm behind her ass
I don't care if I got some henn' I'm putting down my glass
Just so I can get out there and grind her ass
Wit yo fine ass, must I remind yo ass?
You da baddest thing in here that's why I'm eyeing yo ass
In ya Iceberg suit, ya face looking cute and I like those boots
Ya nails all pretty and ya hair due too
I'm fucking wit you, shit just choose and we'll be fucking by two
 
[Bridge: 1x]
 
[Hook: 1x]

[Verse 3]
I made this song to let you know shit that I see ya when you workin dat ass
Make a nigga think later on he gone be twerkin' that ass
And I can tell by the way you throw it back it ain't no hurting dat ass
And ain't no room for nothing else in that skirt but that ass
The jiggling shawty, got a nigga shivering shawty
And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back
I tell her if you ever give me dat ass I ain't giving it back
She bouncing her ass, later on I'm a blow a ounce wit her ass
Ride out wit her ass, cut sumethin' on the couch wit her ass
Then bounce to her pad, coz you know it ain't no housing her ass
Coz since the first time I seen her, all I been thinking bout is her ass

[Bridge: 1x]
