[Woodie]
Enter my danger zone Northern Cali
Yes son from the valley to the bay
The mighty Norte got it sewn
We bout half a mill' people up in these streets
So keep a grip yeah we flared up we red flags and caps
This ain't Blood or Crip this is northern organized raza till eternity
Putting dips up in this mutha fucker stack and murder piece
Never heard of Woodie now you have listen up and soak it in
Northern Cali is full of killas homie go and tell a friend
And if Fallen trail of nuds trail methamphetamine is good
Northern Cali crystal crossing boreders got the country hooked
We gon raise the roof we pop our collars grip our nuts
Kill our enemies' visions and feed fishes there guts
Heavier in the old school country launching Malibu's
350 rockers 450 (?)
We got the now 609
661 and 409 on the valley grind
We got the 405 West Bay
707 North Bay 408 South Bay
But its all Norte
The (?) of east bay 925 East Co Co.
The Northern Cali breakdown for you po-po's

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
This is Northern Cali representing putting it down
We from the valley everybody holla your town
We from the bay we all hear the shit the same way
From the valley to the bay ready for some gun play

[Woodie]
Homie we slang and we bang in east bay it's a G thing
Punks saying salutation while taking lives with no delay
Feel me its west coast the left coast no test wit killer Cali
Nasty flashes (?) through your back streets and alleys
Past the valley acting badly
I hits the carry a fifth of brandy
Splash these bitches cuz there trashy
Rolling old school flows (?)
(?) Valley cougars larks that park cut thangs and mustangs
But one thing there's gun play
So when the fucks bring
Let your nuts swang
It's a mustang for the no repore make you levitate regulate
Po-po's got to bring the yellow tape in everyday
Up here our tapes will set your hood now
You can hear the evidence we represent put it down
For the whole bay is a cold game
And it all while cursing city streets
These addicts smashing traffic on that cradik
In the A-N-T-I-O-C-H we don't be hate
We fo da pay and blowing brains
I'm smoking dank (in my throw pit?) in my corner of the golden state

[Chorus]

When you smoking on the bubonic chronic that got you gone
Where you think it come from
Where you think it come from when you smoking
on the bubonic chronic that got you gone
Were you think it come from
Where you think it come from

[Woodie]
It comes from northern Cali
Up in home bock county the northwest region
By the ocean not the valley
It's considered the most ronic California commodity
The hommies call it puff or balm
The hippies call it pot or weed
It's garneted to get you high tho O fo sho
And the Northerners are making a killing slanging that roach
But straight fo yayo packing pistols illegal substances distributed
Got domies packing crystals and glass pipes and feel good again
It gets dirty in this west coast sunshiny state
You might die early gangbanging
But that is the chance you take
Locked up in prison for life
1 2 3 strikes your out
Sell a pound pack a pistol
Shot a rival oh no doubt
Wit no hesitation the judge will have you facing a life long vacation
But we still regulation
And these suckers are punching and get treated like sluts
This is northern cal bow down lick on these nuts

[Chorus] - repeat to end</pre>
