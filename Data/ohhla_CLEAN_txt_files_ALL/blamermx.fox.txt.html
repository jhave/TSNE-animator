[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Excuse me (Remix) I think y'all need to bring a little bit 
Of every type of liquor over here to the table, every bottle
We got Weezy, Bus, Pain and Jamie Foxx over here

[Jamie Foxx]
Blame it on the Goose (Goose) Got you feelin loose (Loose)
Blame it on Patron ('Tron) Got you in the zone (Zone)
Blame it on the al-al-al-al-al-alcohol
Blame it on the al-al-al-al-al-al-al-alcoh-ol-ol-ol

[Verse One: Busta Rhymes]
Mami lookin good, mami see me
And now she step into the bar because she know she need me
Her favorite song on, body so appealin
And she sippin on me because she know she need the feelin
I make her feel good she call me 'Tron silver
Gotta have me in her body, no matter if it kills her
I get up in her body, I'm kind of like a coach boo
Mami feelin proper body's movin like it's supposed to
(LOVE) When I'm in it I make mami wanna dance more (Yeah!)
Now she dancin like she's fuckin on the dancefloor (Yeah!)
She movin like she wanna break 'em off
I keep her hot and sweaty till she wanna take it off
Baby girl you better sip slow
I'm dangerous when the bottle starts to get low
When shorty's knocked out from havin a ball
Just blame it on the al-al-al-al-alcohol

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]

[Verse Two: Lil Wayne]
Blame it on who? Blame it on me
She drink till she sleep when she drinkin on me
I live in the cup, I watch the ice sink
She sippon all night on some shit that's light pink
You know they say, you are what you drink
But baby I gotta be Louis The Thirteenth
And I could talk to her, but nobody hear
Her liquor so good she don't go around beer
Yeah! And shorty got class
Shorty got class when she pour me in the glass
Hey! Shorty take me to the head
