[Intro]
Turn it up... turn it up!!
(DJ KHALED)

[Chorus: Future]
Let's get it started, let's go dumb and retarded
Let's get high as we wanna, let's go and burn up a forest
Better load up the cartridge, get the car it's inside it
Let's put some ice on your watches and designer on your body
Let's order bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's order bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, bitches and bottles
Bitches and bottles, let's get it started

[T.I.]
I'm turned up 'til my knob broke, say turn down I say nah ho3
My neck +Rocky+ like +Balboa+, my watch official, it's uncalled for
In the same regions on all floors, I got six sluts on all fours
They french kiss and say bonjour, I got my own shine but I won't show
I'm stupid rich, got stupid bitches, who stupid thick in Louboutin
Don't like me? Fuck you again, wanna fight me? Well come do it then
Right hand to God on everything I see the hearts of men and they very lame
I won't entertain no punk shit, they talk shit and I run shit
Boy you tryin to get what I been here, headed down for like 10 years
I'm gettin it in 'til it's unreal, let's say one album, like ten mill'
Plus my swag is stupid low IQ (gone) hurt nigga feelin I don't try to
But when you ballin like I do, you know something nigga don't like you

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
It's Tunechi, you bitch you, I like sticky weed and sticky pussy
Sittin on like a hundred mill', I treat that shit like whoopie cushion
Ballin on them fuck niggaz, they on the bench I benchpress 'em
They hatin from the sidelines, they pissed off, piss test 'em
Man I'm on that lean, liquor for them bitches
Who's fuckin with me? all I hear is crickets
I got stank up in my Swisher, my bitch pussy smell like roses
She on that Molly, I'm on that Mary, I'm on that +Mary+ like +Joseph+
Man I'm married to this shit, you can call it Shit Carter
Dick stay up, like it got insomnia
All them niggaz hatin, fuck ya in your pussy
The best things in life are free, free my nigga Boosie
Gone

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ayy (let's order bitches and bottles) DJ KHALED!
(Let's order bitches and bottles)
(Let's order up another model)
(Let's order up another model)

[Chorus]

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
I make hits, I find hits
and I put hits out
It's We the Best, it's Y.M.C.M.B.
Lil Wayne, T.I., Future
DJ Khaled, fuck boys suck a dick
Bow down, +Kiss the Ring+
Shit real over here
Bitch I'm the biggest mogul in the game
Salute {*echoes*}
