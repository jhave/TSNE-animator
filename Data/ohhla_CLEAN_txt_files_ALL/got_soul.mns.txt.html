Song:   He Got So Much Soul (He Don't Need No Music)
Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

Man, I had soul since I was negative three months old
When it came to getting down I was bold
Kicking steps until you had to put my ass in a choke hold
And damn near wouldn't fold
Check the picture with the apple jack hat
My father even taught me how to skat
So I developed the skat into what we call rap
And get nasty at that
Getting loose is not a problem, it's getting back together
I pull girls like a lever, I get tired 
Bring the coffee to my lips and watch the Large Professor do backflips

He got so much soul, he don't need no music  (Repeat 4x)

I possess skills in the field of rapping
So get down cause I make it happen
Pop with a limp, low pro pimp
I make other MC's mope
Cause their skills ain't developed like negatives
Throughout the years, I've done mega kids
So don't fix your mouth you say I can't handle
I got more sole than a sandle
Cooler than a liter of digital soundproof
I raise the roof (Ain't that the truth)
Got money in the bank, baby pah, I'm a star

He got so much soul, he don't need no music  (Repeat 4x)

I rip rappers up like a card
(Yo Large Professor I want to battle)
Man, you're sorry
I'm part of the Main Source
And we eat DJ's and MC's as the main course
For dinner, lunch, brunch, you better break fast
Cause I'll eat your whole bunch
Or crew, your girl's stuck to me like glue
Cause I kick it like a class of kung fu
I use a pick in my hair without force
You use a lawn mower, you got peat moss
Growing on your dome, that's why you're so dumb
I'll eat you like a plum
Messing with the brother on the beat
I share the rhymes that are kicking like feet
So don't let me start, holmes
Because I'll pull your chart

He got so much soul, he don't need no music  (Repeat 4x)</pre>
