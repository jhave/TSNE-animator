[Intro: Movie Sample]
Beware the beast man for he is the devil's pawn
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust greed
Today he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land
Let him not breed in great numbers 
for he will make a desert of his home and yours
Shun him for he is the avenger of death

[Chorus: Timbo King]
Yo, Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive energy, always corrects errors, Royal Fam rulin this
Now and forever, what
Play your part braveheart, play your part braveheart
Play your part braveheart, play your part braveheart

[Timbo King - Royal Fam]
Orotorical, niggaz is metaphorical
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical
Geologists studying land, using the earth's crust
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density
Hi-Techs, science, thrustal gravity
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinning, what
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up
Frequencies way beyond the earth's equator
Forver glow, electro, magnetic force field
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, 36 still exists
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist
Fire war, royal sire laws, revealing this
Protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions
My center of atraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen
My square be complete, architectual, visual
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
My perimeter damns your diameter
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada
What, from America to Canada

[Chorus]</pre>
