Album:  The Unplanned Mixtape
Song:   And We Danced
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

And we danced, and we cried
And we laughed and had a really really really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives
Our lives, our lives, our lives, our lives
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
'Cause tonight's the night
Am I right?

Dance!

Feels like night for a party
My nature so naughty
There's a knock on the door, it's the neighbors
Quick cock blocking
We're having a ho-down, you hoe's down?
Don't let me pull my hose out
'Cause it's big, long, pink, strong
And known to dance like all night long
Grab my hand, play this song
DJ save my life, come on
Leave your fear, back off the wall
Free of beat and pussy pop
If you don't have a pussy
Pop a cock into a booty
To a booty

And we danced, and we cried
And we laughed and had a really really really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

I am not, I am not going to stand on the wall
I will dance, I will dance, I will break that ass off
And I see you in the corner, corner looking so small
Doing the robot like if I die tonight at least I went hard
I will not, I will not give a damn who watches me
I will live, I will live liberate the fox in me
I will be the discoball, freak and give my all
To whatever girl's booty I'm freaking on
I'm not skeeting nah, it's just freaking hot
Alright I skeeted
I will not be a mannequin
The ego banish it
The roof's on fire
Let's burn down the Vatican
I will moon walk to Pluto in honor of Michael Jackson
In heaven he'll be saying that man is tight at dancing
RIP to the king, Michael Jackson, we learned it all from you
Dedicate this to the dance floor
Party up the sorrow 'til tomorrow morning happens
We pledge allegiance to the DJ put your hands up

And we danced, and we cried
And we laughed and had a really, really, really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives

You see me looking at you from that bar right over there
But your friends are huddled up and they are hating on a player
I just want to dance with you, get on the back of you
Tip tap the boots, extract the truth
Da-Dance with you, get on the back of you
Da-Dance dance dance
Awesome

Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh

Hey-oh, hey-oh
Hey-oh, hey-oh

Uh-ah-ba-bo
Uh-ah-ba-bo

Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop
Zib-oh-da-we-bab-ba-dap-bop-bop

And we danced, and we cried
And we laughed and had a really really really good time
Take my hand, let's have a blast
And remember this moment for the rest of our lives</pre>
