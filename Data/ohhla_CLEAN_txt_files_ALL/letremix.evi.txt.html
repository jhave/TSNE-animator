[Phonte - Intro]
Aiyyo, Ev
They say this is what we shoulda did the first time, man
[*chuckles*] We gon' get it to 'em, though

[Evidence]
Let's go...yeah
{A-A-A-Al-Al-Al-Al-Alchemist}
Let it go, let yourself flow
Slow and low, that is the tem-po!
Uh, it crazy man
Just let it breathe for a minute, just let it breathe...
Uh, this my story, c'mon

I sat up, watch my people do cocaine
Way too much Scarface, they ain't showin no shame
They ain't gettin no sleep, but I'm grindin okay (huh)
Stay on my lane, stay on my rhyme 'til it's Progain (yep)
Stayed on my course, I played the role until one day
I said I'ma blow solo, they said, "Uh-uh, no way" ("You crazy!")
I love when they doubt, when hate come out they mouth
When they front; this year it seems like it's just about gone, man
"4" on The Source, "XL" on XXL (uh)
I mean I let myself go first, then brought out my A game
From Cali, no doubt, slang, but never did gang thangs
Just air out these tracks hard, that A-L-C bang bang
I fuck with the best, it ain't a joke, I don't jest
Some do more, some do less, don't count my numbers like Rainman
We killin with this, of course it's the remix
Evidence, Phonte, Alchemist stay on these hits - c'mon!

[Chorus: Phonte]
Aiyyo I'm all about elevatin
I'm on the grind tryin to get mine instead of waitin
So why you hesitatin? (Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
If you ain't hustlin then we gon' have a problem fam
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)

[Phonte]
Uh, this is just what good music do
Make a nigga wanna take it back to the stud-iu
so he can remix, rewrite, re-edit, renew the tools
on how to make a new verse, that's gon' make these niggaz lose
theyself in the beats, I mean I thought that they knew the rules
Sometimes I rap, sometimes sang like the mood of blues
Back in your residence, wit my nigga Evidence
and, he hit the trees until his eyes look like Lucy Liu
Now that I've introduced, this group of unruly dudes
We roll with the big dawgs, you stay with the poodles who
stay on the porch because they ain't pay they Scooby-Doos
From city to city, servin these niggaz like Ruby Tues'
Day in and day out, holl'n at hoes like, "Voulez-vous
coucher aver moi? Ce soir? Oh, fuck it, let's Do the Do"
I'm goin for delf. Phonte got more on the shelf
The Carolina flame thrower, LET, go of yourself

[Outo: Phonte]
Aiyyo I'm all about elevatin
I'm on the grind tryin to get mine instead of waitin
So why you hesitatin? (Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
If you ain't got a plan, then you are not a man
If you ain't hustlin then we gon' have a problem fam
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
(Letyourselfgo, Letyourselfgo)
Uhh, Phontigga, Evidence and A-L-C
Most definitely, we keep it.. we run it..
We do it.. we gun it..
My nigga Evidence whattup (whattup)

[Evidence]
It's the Weatherman, landin in your area
Who said it doesn't rain in Southern California?
Man they crazy
Stay on my grind...</pre>
