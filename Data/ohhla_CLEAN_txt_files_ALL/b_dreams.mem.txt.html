[Prevail]
In the beginning all I hear is people singing
Deep and low with iron bells ringing
And there's a source of heat near my feet
Im so weak I pass in and out of sleep
Flashes of light blotches of colour
I yell out for help but its drown out by weather
Downpour terenchal power of the vengeful
This was all triggered by the sub-conscious central
Sweet dreams are hideous lets not confuse those
Bad dreams will find you confine you to circles
Every other movement is slowed by your mind
That's why stabbing them blind is no crime
With no REM. your bound to cave in
And life in the conscious life is quite grim
If I can't escape than I'll die in my sleep
Cause the cliff is to steep and the waters to deep

Chorus: Mad Child &amp; Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad Dreams
you don't want to have to wake up here

[Mad Child:]
Im running down a hall with one wall of flames
With friends I've never seen in my life with strange names
Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Pains not what it seems cold stares and sudden screams
I get in fights every night as im reflecting
Throwing punches fast hard as I can but not connecting
There protected by a force field locked in an engagement
Until I see the colour red when pounding heads into the pavement
Caught up in a chase scene or working on a plan
Sometimes im falling and I have to wake up before I land
Lots of doors to open afraid what I might find
My girlfriend getting fucked with eight more guys in line
Cant wait to rise and shine when ill thoughts are provoked
My girlfriends right beside me getting choked
In real life plus I heard it could get worse
So much for walking in my sleep that's close to murder in the first

Chorus: Mad Child &amp; Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad Dreams
you don't want to have to wake up here

[Prevail]
They say that most people can only dream in black and white
That's why he packs a knife and only reappears at night
I pray for the light to turn him back to stone
And shine bright enough so I can find my way home

[Mad Child]
Watching myself from above and just behind
Like im controlling video games inside my mind
Be careful what you dream for because its right there
Sometimes day dreams turn into nightmares

[Prevail]
I've prepared the chair
electricity rumbles through the air
You don't want to have to wake up here
Its cold in the morning
Breath the eternal frost of our dawning

[Mad Child]
Plus its dark and death
With slight hints of ???
So cold im spitting icicles
Rip right through the flesh
Smoke forms with every breath
The sound of children screaming
Pinch my self I have to wake up
Afraid of dreaming

Chorus: Mad Child &amp; Prevail

Sound familiar bad dreams can kill ya
Deeper the sleep the realer man I feel ya
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
You don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad dreams sad scenes and fear
you don't want to have to wake up here
Bad Dreams
you don't want to have to wake up here</pre>
