[Lecrae]
That man don't love you like he need to
If he ain't following Christ, he can't lead you
I ain't tryin to deceive you
I know he look better than most men
But without Christ, looks are no reason for bragging and boasting
You got your heart on him
Now you can't depart from him
You knew from the beginning not to even start on him
Compromising your faith for sex
Hurting yourself and God
Cause you outside of marital context
What's next?
Mami show respect for your body
Instead of getting naked and naughty
Like sex is a hobby
You know what you're supposed to do
Let him loose and cling to the God that wants to get close to you
You've been blessed as a chosen few
Mami, if ain't rollin with Christ
Then don't let him roll with you
Cause you've been blessed as a chosen few
And if ain't rollin with God
Then don't let him roll with you
WAIT!

[Chorus]
I know you're the apple of momma's eye
A star in your daddy's sky
But God knows you living a lie
You giving a guy, everything your husband deserves
It's absurd
Don't follow your feelings, just follow The Word

[Lecrae]
You wanna be in a relationship
Well, you can give him your all, but how deep can the relations get
If your God's on the sideline
You won't be happy I promise
Until you understand, that God is the lifeline
He ain't pleased with lust
So even if it feels right
Remember, he ain't pleased with us, when we
Let our emotions loose without a ring on the finger
It's only gonna come back to sting ya
Don't let the singers sing you sweet lullabies
Without giving The King's sweet love a try
It ain't none better
Who else you know, that would give up his life
Just to love you forever
WAIT!

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I know you thought that y'all could win together
Y'all been together
But all y'all do is sin together
You're wasting your own time
You keep deceiving your mind
Saying that this is part of God's design
Knowing he treating you good
Know his ways is nice
But he can't love you like he should
He's not engaged to Christ
And you know this ain't the man for you
But you hold on like God ain't got better plans for you
The whole worlds says 'you should be dating'
God says you should be serving him while your patiently waitin'
Everybody rushin and racin
Huggin and kissin and hold hands, all before their days end
Yea, I know it's hard but TRUST
I wouldn't waste my breath on this song if it wasn't a MUST
The same God that made you
The same God that died for your sins and saved you
HE ain't tryin to play you, WAIT!

[Chorus]

Your ready to go... wait!
Can't take no more- wait!
I know it's hard but, God is never late
Don't follow your feelings - wait!
Just follow HIS Will and... wait!
Girl, serve the Lord and don't anticipate
WAIT!</pre>
