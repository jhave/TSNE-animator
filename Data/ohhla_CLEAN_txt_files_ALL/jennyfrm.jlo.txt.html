[Intro]
Children grow and women producing
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

[Verse]
[Jadakiss:] L-O-X... J.Lo...
            Yea, yea, yo, yo
            We off the blocks this year
[Styles P:] Went from a 'lil to a lot this year
[Jadakiss:] Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
[Styles P:] I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from 
            You hear LOX in your ear
[Jadakiss:] Yea we're at the airport out 
            D-Glock from the block where everybody air-forced out
[Styles P:] With a new white Tee you fresh, nothin' phoney with us
            Make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us

[Chorus: J. Lo] (2x)
Dont be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Verse: J. Lo]
From "In Livin' Color" to movie scripts
To "On the 6" to "J.Lo" to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm Real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm Real)
That's just me
Nothin' phony don`t hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

[Chorus]

[Verse: J. Lo]
I'm down to earth like this
Rockin' this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and lovin it
Rumors got me laughin' kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first And can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing, yeahh

[Chorus]

[Verse]
[Jadakiss:] Yo, it take hard work to cash checks
            So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got their assets
[Styles P:] You get back what you put out
            If even if you take the good route
            Can't count the hood out
[Jadakiss:] After a while you'll know who to blend with
            Just keep it real with the ones came in with
[Styles P:] Best thing is to stay low, LOX and J.Lo 
            (Everyone's got to make a livin')

[Chorus] (2x)</pre>
