I'm off that weed boy
Swisher sweets no phillies (yeah)
Young khalifa man, (uh huh)
What up to the whole west coast
I had to do this one man
It's mr. 4-1 uh, yeah

Young guy come to write beats I'm the baddest
Everything tatted
Call me young travis
Taylor gang till the day I get buried
I'm next up to bat watch the game get buried
And don't take that line for something it's not
Cause I don't beef I feed off of hip hop
Rocks in my wrist watch
Blunts with the best smoke
Pittsburgh nigga hit n' rob em on the west coast
Here young boss (boss)
I'm a boss too (too)
I'm what they want (want)
Call me A-1
All my hoes on point like a ray gun (gun)
Got a tattoo on her that say young
And I don't rock jays
Only five o' one jeans and all black chuck tays
And I don't know the game (game)
But I know this beats one of the hardest (yeah)
