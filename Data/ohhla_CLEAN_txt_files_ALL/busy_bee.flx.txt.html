[Busy Bee]
Sixty Minutes of Funk -- Volume III, The Final Chapter
of the Funkmaster Flex
Aiyyo Flex this is Busy Bee man, and I ain't goin for that
I heard Volume I, I heard Volume II
It is now to do Volume III, with Busy Bee
And we gotta do it somethin like this

Ahh yeah that's the way it goin down
Now this is how we did it way back in the days
It was all about peace and love and happiness at the Latin Quarters
All up in the Disco Fever, all uptown in the Boogie Down
at the T-Connection, and then we should come on down to Union Square
and play at the Roxy's, oh we just had a good time up there
and it was goin down like this, we had all the DJ's all the MC's
all the unity, kickin it like this
And now we gon' do it somethin like this, Flex c'mon

Now throw your hands in the air, and wave em like you just don't care
And if you wanna rock with Busy Bee, scream it out and say ohh yeah!
Ohh yeah, don't stop y'all, ah don't stop y'all, you're lookin good y'all

Hey this is how we used to do it way back in the days
It was all about the love, youknowhatI'msayin?
So as we keep it on rockin to the next millenium
with the Funkmaster Flex, on Volume III
And this is the Final Chapter
And you got me the chief rocker Busy Bee
Now Flex, what I want you to hit me with some of that old school
REAL old school, breakbeats, stuff like that
so I can kick some of that old school flavor for them youngs
Understand what I'm sayin?  Yeah..

Ah so right now y'all, it's time to prepare
for the kid that sets the atmosphere

So one for the treble, two for the bass
C'mon Flex and let's rock this place

Yes yes y'all, a to the beat y'all, a freak freak y'all
And don't stop y'all, a the body rock
Don't stop don't stop don't stop

Ba ba ba bah, ba dang a dang a diggy diggy
Ba ba ba bah, ba dang a dang a diggy diggy
Diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy

and my name is known, all over the town y'all
The people here love the way I run my game
They can't wait, to see me make the Hall of Fame
Now Busy Bee is my name, and that's a fact
And you can't beat that with a stickball bat
Funkmaster, rock the house
