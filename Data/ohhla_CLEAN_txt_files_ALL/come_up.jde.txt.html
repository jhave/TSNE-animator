Yo, still hungry man

Yeah
Ay yo I'm bout to make moves
And get this little bit of paper right
This broke shit got a bitch staying awake at night
It ain't a guy thing or a girl thing
It's a me thing getting high and drunk every weekend
Fuck drama I'd rather shine ???
Blacks in the Cadillac no ice at all
Seven-six ay ah bitch watch me ball
?? like a motherfucker dipping from the law, Awnaw
Kinda game is they playing?
I got a gang a players call my gang to bang em
A let em know that I'm all for the ?
? say nothing young'n that shit is play doe
Push the pedal to the metal hit the fuckin floor
Ain't about the D-O-E then what you talkin for?
Expedition never slippin on a money mission
Shit is real when you ain't even got no pot to piss in
That's why I'm on the come up, for the come up
Watch you niggas get done up who try to run up
However, whatever the case may be
You tryna get it down down we can get it down down

Yeah, up late at night
Yeah, at the kitchen stove
Yeah, with them V-12's
Yeah, tryna make they ghost
Yeah, with the tekan gage
Yeah, sellin grey and beige
Yeah, cos the red and blue
Yeah, ducking the federals
Yeah, gotta keep the smash n biz
Yeah, with the mansion runs
Yeah, fuck driving dog
Yeah, drug trafficking
Yeah, making illegal lefts
Yeah, making crazy rights
Yeah, code over moneyman
Yeah, never mind the ice

These motherfuckers ain't right
Mad cos I got my game tight
You never find a brawl who grind twice as hard
Uh, this money situation niggas acting funny on occasion
But that's on them cos that's time wasting
Meanwhile I'm a be scheming for dockets
Stash in the sock drawer, nice little duckie
Working on a master plan to get the master cash
Parties and shit I'm a have to pass
Cos one day I plan to live it up
Until then you gon give it up
Moneyman tell me what the fuck is up
Here we go, here we go, here we go again
Roll it up, light it up, pass it to a friend
Stacking it all whether it's twenty or a thousand
Out to take my Philly off of welfare out of public housing
Who me? I got bills to pay
Until then I'm gon make a way, is that okay?

Yeah, up late at night
Yeah, at the kitchen stove
Yeah, with them V-12's
Yeah, tryna make they ghost
Yeah, with the tekan gage
Yeah, sellin grey and beige
Yeah, cos the red and blue
Yeah, ducking the federals
Yeah, gotta keep the smash n biz
Yeah, with the mansion runs
Yeah, fuck driving dog
Yeah, drug trafficking
Yeah, making illegal lefts
Yeah, making crazy rights
Yeah, code over moneyman
Yeah, never mind the ice

The smell of money got my trigger finger acting funny
No stoppin me homies until I'm sittin nice and lovely
Keep puffin until I'm high as a bird
Want the doe; fuck the crumbs give em to the birds
Oh my stars ain't asking no how come's
Fuck being patient I ain't waiting for the outcomes
Fuck you eating ? please don't get me started
Out for the paper with that big face on it

Yeah, up late at night
Yeah, at the kitchen stove
Yeah, with them V-12's
Yeah, tryna make they ghost
Yeah, with the tekan gage
Yeah, sellin grey and beige
Yeah, cos the red and blue
Yeah, ducking the federals
Yeah, gotta keep the smash n biz
Yeah, with the mansion runs
Yeah, fuck driving dog
Yeah, drug trafficking
Yeah, making illegal lefts
Yeah, making crazy rights
Yeah, code over moneyman
Yeah, never mind the ice
