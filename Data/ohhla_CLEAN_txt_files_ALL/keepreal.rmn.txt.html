[Musiq] Ayyy, motherfucker..
[Noble] Yo, Funk Doc, my man Musiq, check it out (AOWWW!)

[Redman]
It's the Doctor Bombay, da yellow hombre
Spotted like Kwame for smackin a blind date for scratchin my Hyundai
It's Doc way - don't like it, then move on
The bullshitter push a Yukon with bullhorns
Arguin - what the fuck we doin?
Starin eye to eye like, who the fuck we screwin?
Here take these nickel bags and deduct your doin
With Knicks I can't ball so who snuck me Ewing?
No ice with no blue and, tires with no shoe and
Cribs with no boo in, pockets like I'm Jewish
Tight, I'm an Aries born in April
That means my attitude is I'm born to hate you
Now let's get it gritty
I'll doggystyle while you watching "Sex and the City"
My palms on your tittie
I'll bomb yo' committee, if y'all MIDI
I treat your girl like spades and walk off with the kitty
Kitty, kitty..

[Musiq]
Tell me why, when I, saw you the, other day
You spoke to me as if I was your best friend or sum'
But when today I tried to say whassup and you walked on by
You had nothin to say to me then
Now how come when I be seein, youuuu chillin
Allllll byyyyy yourself
Youuu, always actin like you know me
And act like you don't when you're around someone work on my nerves

Ohh tell me what is on your mind tell me, what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers

Sometimes, I can't even understand why you'd even
bother to pass my way no
Cause, dealin with you kinda makes me wonder
exactly whereeee yeah does my time go (and noooooo, no)
I can't believe the things that you be doin for me
Knowin in yo' heart you don't really mean to, nooo
Why ya, tryin to get over with yo' shuckin and jivin
When the, only person gettin hurt is youuuu, ohhhh

What is on yo' mind, tell me what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers

[Redman]
Nah nah nah nah girl you wrong, you wrong, no no no
Almost from the door you ain't shit
I want the bracelet, the necklace, the anklet
That foot spa with the nail and toe paint kit
That half a pound I loaned your pops he ain't flip
That itch your boyfriend keeps Gaultier sniff, y'all good together
When y'all tongue kiss y'all suckin my wood together
Fallin in love, I won't do it; cause some of these women
THEIR CLOTHES LOOK SOOOOOO GOOD, but they act stupid

[Musiq]
Next time, that you see me, walkin down the street
Don't even bother to speak, don't even bother, nooo
Cause - if it ain't genuine then ah, don't waste my time
Cause um - I can't deal if you can't, keep it real

What is on yo' mind, tell me what you wanna do
Tell me, how you feel about me so I know how to deal with you
Because, people like you really without them I can do
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers
All youuuu, fake frontin motherfuckers
All youuuu..
