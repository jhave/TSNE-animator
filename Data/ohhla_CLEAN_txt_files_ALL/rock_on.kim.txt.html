I rock on with my bad self cuz it's a must
Kim blow past hoes tell 'em 'Eat my dust'
Cuz um, I gets busy with my bad ass
Straight from Brook-lawn, Vietnam, Baghdad
Cuz I'ma get you high like that stick-icky one time
One verse from the Queen is like sniffin' a line
Higher than a fever, ya best believe her
This young viva senorita flow tighter than a two-seater
Lyrical murderer, I'm servin' these haters like a waitress
Back to the basics
I got the game in a chokehold, better take a No-Doze
Sleepin' on Kim is a no-no (UGH)
The capital Q-B, now take it to the E-E
I'm bringin' things to light but you still can't see me
I flows like the monthly you can't cramp my style
Can't take the pain here's a Motrin child
You already know it's Ms. G.O.A.T
Numero U-N-O, now here we go

I rock ruff n stuff though they put me in cuffs
But still I
(Rock on with ya bad self)
I rock ruff though these punk niggas talk too much
But still I
(Rock on with ya bad self)

Think ya hotter than me? YALL STUPID
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the UNDISPUTED
Lyrical champion, dough I stack it
My verse crazy I write with stray jackets
You can't hack it, some try to backstab
I drive by them haters while they try to flag cabs
Hate to brag but fuck it why shouldn't I
'Gini with the top off, why wouldn't I
I was tought by the streets so how couldn't I
See right pass niggas like BIG's crooked eye
BOOM! BAM! GOT DAYYMMM!
I'm hittin' so hard I be shakin' the land
KIM GET IT CRUNK
Like the speakers in ya trunk, got you feelin' drunk
Off the rhythm that I give 'em
Spit that venom, in 'em, honey girl be killin 'em
Yea, I put that on my unborn kids
Kim run this shit, man you know what it is

I rock ruff n stuff though they put me in cuffs
But still I
(Rock on with ya bad self)
I rock ruff though these punk niggas talk too much
But still I
(Rock on with ya bad self)</pre>
