[Eminem]
I'm a soldier (*repeat 4X*)

Yo.. never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin
Willin to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant
life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see, if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel, it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

[Chorus]
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bones crush
or crumble, I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bones crush
or crumble, I will never stumble

[Eminem]
I love pissin you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin judge lets me off
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch it's news
Pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers, six-two
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you SWEAT bullets
An EXCELLENT method to get rid of the next bully
ACTUALLY better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt 'em and come BACK again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin out their haltertops
Runnin and duckin out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, cause

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin to it
You motherfuckers could NEVER do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

[Chorus]

[Outro: repeat 4X]
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left right left</pre>
