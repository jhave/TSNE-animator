[Sample]
That's the way I always heard that it should be
You say you wanna marry me

[Verse One]
I'm looking for the one
They tell me stop lookin'
And everywhere I look
I seen all the good ones tooken
Mistake, taken, so heart breakin'
They say be patient so I just keep waiting
Ring finger vacant
Ain't gotta be perfect but I'm hoing you adjacent
Close to it, go through it, baby that's whow most do it
Fake it 'til we make, then attach some hope to it
And let it flow on
Bow tie dunks, with my sport coat on
And we standing at the alter
I'm looking in your eyes
Hoping that I don't falter
cause I adore you
can't wait to explore you
Give you every luxury that I could afford to
You lead me and let me lead the way
As times goes on I love you more each day
(Will you marry me)

[Chorus]
If you could
I'm down on one knee
Hoping that it's all good
To have you, to hold you, to cherish you forever
Build a family and some memories to treasure
The first day of the rest of our life 
We stand together as husband and wife
Family and friends get together, throw rice
If you say yes, it will be so right
If you would...

[Sample]
(That's the way I always head that it should be
You say you wanna marry me)

[Verse Three]
Who want to treat you like a queen
Cook and clean
A Father MC to help you live the dream
The house, the children
A future worth building
Please and use the ark that I wanna be stilled in
A million kisses, a thousands roses
You're my everything, without you I'm hopeless
I go the extra mile to make sure you know this
Put you on a song, for the world to notice
And oh yes
It only gets better
What we have here is the truth, forever
What ever happens, my love is unchangin'
My shining star, my sun and the rainin'
The good, the bad, the hurt, the painin'
The times we drive each other insainin'
Won't always like you but never not love you
And solemnly swear to put nothing above you
 
[Sample]
(Will you marry me)
