[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
As we go way beyond sky's the limit, and you know who we are
We shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin it far
Shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us

[Busta Rhymes]
Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages
Like - about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'ma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us
Like - mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous
Like - I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin to SAVE US

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
I spread my wings takin off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin through the sky now how the hell they gon' stop me
Like  most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin you waitin
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak and
grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin
Like  and tell me who you tryin to race with (who?)
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit
Like  I know it's kinda hard to believe this (why?)
The way I always come back and return with the heat bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son it's hard to defeat this
Risin out the ashes, flyin like a PHOENIX

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
See now you see I'm back in the zone, B
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggaz know I'm the only
one to be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies
Like  we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I SPEAK nigga!
