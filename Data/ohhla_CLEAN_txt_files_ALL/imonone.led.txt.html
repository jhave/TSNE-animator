[Intro: Drake] (Rick Ross) {DJ Khaled}
(I get 'em onnnn) I'm on one
(I get 'em onnnn) Fuck it, I'm on one
(I get 'em onnnn) I said I'm on one
{DJ KHALED!}

[Drake]
Uhh.... {*sings*} I'm gettin so throoowed
I ain't work this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I saaaay -- anything I donÄôt mean
Like what's up with yo' best friend?
We could all have some fuuun, believe me
And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all coooomes so easy?
{*raps*} But get it while you here, boy
'cause all that hype don't feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I'll be right here in my spot 
wit a lil' more cash than I already got, trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long and my fans who been so patient 
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fuckin allegations 
I'm just feelin like the throne is for the takin -- watch me take it

[Chorus: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only gettin older, somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one... 
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one... Yeah, I said, "I'm on one"...
Fuck it, I'm on one...
Two white cups and I got that drank 
Could be purple, it could be pink
Dependin on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one... I said, "Fuck it, I'm on one"

[Rick Ross]
RUH~! IÄôm burnin purple flowers, it's burnin my chest (RUH!) 
I bury the most cash and burnin the rest (Stuntin) 
Walkin on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah) 
The ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear (Chyeah) 
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill (WHOO!)
Kiss you on ya neck and tell you everything is great (Ross)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin 8s'
Still runnin with the same niggaz 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha!)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (WHOO!)
in a room full of money (WHOO!) out in London and she screams (WHOOOO!)
UH! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M-G until I get the chair - chyeah!
Ruh!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
{*lights lighter, inhales smoke*}
I walk around the club -- fuck ev'rybody
and all my niggaz got that +Heat+, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listenin, nigga what money?
I'm a made/maid nigga, I should dust something
You niggaz on the bench, like the bus comin
Heh, aint nothing +Sweet+ but the +Swishas+
I'm focused, might as well say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh~! IÄôm about to go, Andre the Giant
You a sell-out, but I ain't buyin
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches -- Mazel Tov
It's a slim chance I fall -- Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne overlaps during chorus]
Young Moula, baby!
YMCMB
Uh-huh!
