* Nas "my medicine" sample plays in background throughout song *

[Guru]
Yo, son, pass me the medicine...

[Ini Kamoze]
Ah...

Yes, Ini Kamoze alongside the Guru
Baby, I got red eyes
What? I got red eyes
I got red eyes, what?
I got red eyes

Gimme the medicine, I am no leprichan
It's the dealin of the nation
I used to understand, but now I overstand
I'm freakin herbs, man
Yes, I am...

[Guru]
My skills boom through the smoke filled room
Feelin the contact like the Mack, I then consume
All fools who blunder, so I take them under
ground, cuz I got the crazy phat sounds
I blend it with jazz and mystify the masses
Huh, we teach blunt rollin classes

[True Master]
My dialect reflects hip hop at it's best
after I fat burn of cess, and yes, I guess
that you could call it habitual
(Why?) Cuz every day is a ritual

[Ini Kamoze]
Hit from a Thai stick, not come from cocoa whip
My knee gonna never skip cuz a man like me don't never slip
As we elevate, my ghetto mindstate
Cooked like a dove plate, but wait, but wait

Red eyes, what? I got red eyes
Huh, tell ya what
Red eyes, what? I got red eyes
Hey

[True Master]
Determinded energetic, born to suceed
Independently minded (Are you ambitious?) Indeed
New Breed and suckers can't compare
To the Master, the truth got you trapped in the square
You're restricted, while I'm unlimited, gifted
and I'm even iller when I'm lifted
Stimulated in the dome on the microphone
after a bone, Guru, why don't ya take em home?

[Guru]
Yes, I bring heat, so feel the warmth from my free speech
Believe in Ja, the ganjha helps me reach
my creative leaves of enlightenment
and when I'm writin then, you know just who's on the mic again
Fools on the map kid, you took a nap kid
Takin me out is an impossible task kid
I spark you up, lock you up, huh, now you gone
You should've paid attention way back when you were warned
You're too into business, I take gifts of my spliff
I change into what an expert will never quiz

[Chorus x2: Guru]
The medicine, the medicine, the medicine
Lah will bring us back again
The medicine, the medicine, the medicine
Ja is comin back again

[Ini Kamoze]
Now I'm comin up, so don't be runnin up
on my crew, big up, Guru pass the cup

Red eyes, what? I got red eyes

Pass the medicine, I am no leprichan
It's the dealin of the nation
I used to understand, but now I overstand
I'm freakin herbs, man
Yes, I am...

Red eyes, I got red eyes
What? I got red eyes
Red-red-red-red eyes
What?</pre>
