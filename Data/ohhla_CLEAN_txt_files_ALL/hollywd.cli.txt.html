[Verse One]
San Diega Freeway northbound around
Culver City, Westwood into Beverly Hills
You're gone Hollywood
I'm gonna look, I won't touch
Oh it's live but then, thanks very much
Where the happening be at tonight, it's Hollywood 
As I stepped out on my front porch
For miles around I see
Hollywood the way she once was, Hollywood the way she be
As I step back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
San Fernando Valley way below
 
[Hook #1]
I'm strutting to the east side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm stomping to the west side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm stepping to the north side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm strutting to the south side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
 
[Chorus]
Holly wants to go to California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!!
Holly she belongs in California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!!
 
[Verse Two]
Say you want to be in the moviestars
Bourgeois, Intercontinental never know where you are
You've gone Hollywood
I was caught, out on the beat
Without even a single piece of ID
And the man said to me it's who you know in Hollywood
As I stepped out on my front porch
For miles around I see
Hollywood the way she once was, Hollywood the way she be
As I step back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
San Fernando Valley way below
 
[Hook #2]
I'm stepping to the south side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm funking on the north side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm kicking on the east side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
I'm strutting to the west side of "HOLLYWOOD!!"
 
[Chorus: with minor variations]
Holly wants to go to California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!!
Holly she belongs in California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly... living in Hollywood!!
Holly wants to go to.. 
Ho ho ho ho.. ha ha ha ha.. Ummm.. mmmm.. 
 
[Verse Three]
San Diega Freeway northbound around
Culver City, Westwood into Beverly Hills
You're gone Hollywood
I'm gonna look, I won't touch
Oh it's live but then, thanks very much
Where the happening be at tonight, it's Hollywood 
Hollywood!!
As I stepped out.. to best side of.. Hollywood!!
Hah hah hah hah.. Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could.. Hollywood!!
 
[Chorus: with major variations]
Holly wants to go to California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!!
Holly needs to be in California, living in Hollywood!!
And she wants to shine, living in Hollywood!!
Like the Hollywood salad, living in Hollywood!!
Awww just selling by, living in Hollywood!!
Holly is brought to California, living in Hollywood!!
Holly is here, Holly would if Holly could, Hollywood!! 
 
[Outro]
Hollywood!! 
On my back terrace, amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
Holly in the ?? man
Living in Hollywood!!
Living in Hollywood!!
Ooh existing ahh.. awwww in Hollywood
Living in Hollywood!!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!!</pre>
