[Willie Nelson]
You know Snoopy a little while back
I had one of those, carpal tunnel operations
And the doctor said "I want you to go home and 
SHUT UP (mm) for four months," annnd that's kinda tough
I said "I'll try it," but while I was there
I wrote this song {*strums his guitar*}

[Willie Nelson]
Too many pain pills, too much pot
Tryin to be somethin that I'm not - Superman! Superman
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin 'bout?

[Snoop Dogg]
I blew my throat and I blew my tour
I wound up sippin on soup d'jour - I wasn't Superman
Oh no, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman

[Willie Nelson]
I hear ya! Mickey play with us
... {*harmonica solo*}

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, play that Mickey, go ahead!
Play it Willie! {*more harmonica*}
Yeah... go ahead Willie

[Willie Nelson]
Well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame
But you ain't Clark Kent and I ain't Lois Lane
You ain't Superman; you ain't Superman
Tryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand
You ain't Superman - whaddya think Snoop?

[Snoop Dogg]
Well when I die, put it on my stone
God said Snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't Superman
Ha ha ha, no, I wasn't Superman
I'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I wasn't Superman (I hear ya!)

[Both]
Tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand
I ain't Superman

[Outro]
