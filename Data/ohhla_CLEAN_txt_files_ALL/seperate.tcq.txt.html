   Verse
   
   Sometimes men and women look at themselves and see bliss
   Through experience we tend to exist
   That's through our past or our caretakers
   The instance is in particular, so you need to recognize that
   if you take all this away
   and look at us at the end of the day
   we stand great among creation
   So baby take these words as a little inspiration
   While I kick this shit get your ass motivation
   MCs, you're walking a thin line
   Get in your ranks and tighten up as we walk through mines
   and plus vipers, phony rhymers and biters
   Money-grubbers, beat-dubbers
   amongst a whole host of others
   Who be fakin', fraudulatin'
   Waitin' for your bacon
   They be takin' and skatin' while you sit contemplatin'
   Who's your peoples
   Well let me tell you somethin' now paw
   We're livin' a world that's R-A-double-raw
   It's crazy but it's true, go for delly is the law
   and if you cross the path then you dangerin' your jaw
   And if you Glass Joe, don't go toe-for-toe
   Yo all we wanna do is our thing and lay low
   So brothers hold your heads high when you get down
   Don't violate these women cuz we need them around
   It's all of us together, not the one without the other
   The Abstract is ill, word to mother.
   
   Chorus
   
   We got to do our do, not separate, together
   Got to move on through, not separate, together
   Got to do our do, not separate, together
   Got to move on through, not separate, together
   
   Yo, we got some problems baby
   People stressed out, check it
   But we can make it Sugar
   Keep it light and I say
   move on through separate
   not together but together
   Not separate, that's how
   we got to do it, check it on out
   Bust it, yo...
   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
