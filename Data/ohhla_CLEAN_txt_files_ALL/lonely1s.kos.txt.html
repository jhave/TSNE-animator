Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Ron Burgundy]
"Here's the thing
I don't trust this chick
We need you around, and she is just using you
Everyone just relax alright!
If there's one thing Ron Burgundy knows, it's women!
Ron, there are literally thousands of men
I should be with instead
But I am 72% sure that I love you..."

[Chorus]
The lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who call in the nighttime
Lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who fall in love

[k-os]
Yo
Put back the mic in the holster
Picked up my drink from the coaster
And took a sip to the head
That's when GOD, read my mind
And sent an angel cherub
From behind, she said
I came to rescue you
Not to seduce you
This world is destitute
There's a few true
I'm one
You're like the sun I'm like the moon
Let's pretend where in the movie Blue Lagoon
Swoon! And then she kissed me
In the warm summer breeze
The one that'd melt my heart and Mr. Freeze
I couldn't believe
I couldn't conceive
A true love,
When doves cry butterfly
With bullet wings
I tried to sing
But not a note came out
No doubt
This could be the end of my vow
To love music over all
My pledge to never fall
Cuz a man is like a baby when he crawls
Y'all

[Chorus]
The lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who call in the night time
Lonely ones
Are the only ones
Who fall in love

[k-os]
One year passed
And on a summer night
We were looking out the window
With the city lights
I hopped a cab downtown
So I could hear the sounds of the
Solitary people on the street
She stayed at home
I'm not a man that's unfaithful
But then again
I'm not a man who's un-fateful
When destiny is on the table
I eat from the plate
That's when I heard a voice that
Made the earth rotate
She said
I came to rescue you
Not to seduce you
This world is destitute
There's a few true
I'm one
You're like the sun I'm like the moon
Let's pretend you're not in love with sonnet
Oooo!
She tried to kiss me but I walked away
Went back to my planet and called it another day
Call it another way of being in love
Or call it being afraid of being lonely

Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love
Only the lonely
Will fall in love with me</pre>
