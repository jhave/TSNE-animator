[Verse 1: Bun B]
Well it's the king of the Trill, Bun B on the flip

See me lookin fo somethin jazzy baby, jus like you
So what you gon do {repeat 3x}

[Chorus (singing): Natalie]
What you gon do if I say I'm gon leave wit you tonight, tonight, tonight
What you gon do if I say I'm gon leave wit you tonight, tonight, tonight

I know you wanna touch, well let me know whats up
We can do whatever you wanna do

And cut you out a slice of life that you've neva seen

Not to mention that thug love makin it blow ya mind
Anytime she want mo than jus a one-hitta quitta
She already know, call me up and mayne I'm comin to get her
