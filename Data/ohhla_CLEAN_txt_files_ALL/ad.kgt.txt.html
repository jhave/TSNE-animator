He's a mean one, no a clean one, he's the King hon
  {*sniff*} I smell blunts
  Hey, ask him has he seen one!
It doesn't look like he has blunts in his handles
Looks, more like, a fifth of Jack Daniels
  Look what you dropped!
Some crazy-ass shit for listeners
Up against the wall with the bitches
Damn, I wonder why he don't want the Chronic like snoop
  Because he's from Tha Alkaholik group!

Yo, ah one-two (yo yo yo)

  Did you peep his walk?
Yeah he walks real cool
I guess that bulge in his coat is a tool
  Yeah but for what?
For those who don't know who he is
The neighborhood jackers that bumrush kids
  But yo I think he's straight, it looks like a 9 millimeter
Yeah POW-POW, nice to see ya
  Look he's stretched like he just got released from the county
With a gang of little hoochies all around me
  Well he always been a pimp
Haha, yeah that's true
Some say they bob with the K-Swiss shoe
  Aww, you're buggin
Nah man, that's the truth
They say, Tela got hoes like Luke
  FUCK LUKE!
Yeah his records kinda shitty
King Tee'll bust rhymes for the whole city
  He's from Compton
Yeah, just like Most Wanted
  He drives a grey beamer with the blue pearl on it
It's advertisement

Ah one-two.. uh!

Huh, yeah, ah one-two..

Well, guess who got the fat shit for 1994?
  Who is that?

That shit's wicked, wait, oopsy-daisy, here's your ticket
We paid $20 to see E-Swift mix
