[Sean Paul]
Sean Paul, gotta get 'em drunk
Gotta shakem' off in the club, get it crunk
Give you what you want, shawty got what ya need
Set dat thang out, get down on ya knees
Ya know I'm kinda picky, like my girls tricky
Tricky kinda greasy, gotta be freaky
Sho' nuff, know to blow, that's how thangs go
Charge it to da game, ya know I gotta lay low
So tell me how ya know everything gravy
You're under to the cover 'cause my homeboy paid me
These gulls goin crazy, ya gotta shakem' off
They be all up in yo grill and I be all up in they mouth, ho

[Chorus]4x
So shakem' off (Shakem' Off)
Shakem' off (Shakem' Off)
What's up, it's Youngbloodz, we shakem' off (Shakem' Off)

[J-Bo]
They about 5-4, 2 or 3 inches, cut 'em loose
And let 'em bend wit that wind as I guzzle duece
Goose cook, so is she hot wit dat boilin point
Must revolve 'cause these broads wanna lock dat joint
And pick-pocket through all you fools, soon as you choose
Ohh shit, so lock and pause for that girl called
Is a ho, now what you know, so let it go
To show that what she is, is nothin mo'
But a hungry simple freak that'll take yo cash
And laugh and be gone so long you can't even ask
And from what's left, you envy without a dime
So watch out for them felines in heat that cross dat line

[Chorus]4x

[Sean Paul]
Well I'm Sean Paul, I got gulls galore
You might get a lot of cut but I gets much more

[J-Bo]
Well I'm J-Bo, got these broads in check
Stayin down for the real and got no time to flex

[Sean Paul &amp; J-Bo]
We Be Them YOUNGBLOODZ!!!

[Sean Paul]
Them boyz that got dat mean mugg

[J-Bo]
Stompin in the club, boy gon' get ya scrubbed

[Sean Paul]
I got them gulls goin for that low-low

[J-Bo]
Boy get yourself some face befo' ya let that girl go

[Chorus]4x

[Pause]

[Chorus]4x</pre>
