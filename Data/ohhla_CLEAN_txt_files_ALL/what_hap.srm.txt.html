[Chorus: Sample from "Wanksta" by 50 Cent, "Stunt 101" by G-Unit]

Damn homey, the-the fuck happened to you? ("50 Cent")
Kids used to look up to you, what happened? ("Lloyd Banks")

[Verse One: Erick Sermon] (Sample from "Dead This Time" by Bounty Killer)
Huh! I see you comin through where's your applause
I seen niggas man where's your broads?
Talkin to you playboy number one celebrity
With the cars goin back like the 70's
You had fans, Facebook, plus tweets it was sweet
Enough followers for you to eat
But now I'm Mr. Nice Watch got your spot
Like a parkin lot, he outside with the drop (OKAY!!! THAT'S RIGHT!!!)
With that same old video vixen
In that same spot where you used to be sittin, huh?
Now your standin there with that so called swag
And you wanna represent with the flag
But you ain't even active
But that live nigga shit look attractive, so you start actin
Now you a killer why your pants so skinny
You can't hold that glock so where you puttin that semi?

[Chorus: Sample from "Wanksta" by 50 Cent, "Stunt 101" by G-Unit]
D-Damn homey, the fuck happened to you? ("50 Cent")
Kids used to look up to you, what happened? ("Lloyd Banks")
Damn homey, the-the fuck happened to you? ("50 Cent")
Kids used to look up to you, what happened? ("Lloyd Banks")

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon] (Sample from "Dead This Time" by Bounty Killer)
Uh! Yeah! You wanna be a Bad Boy hit Mase up
'Cause you ain't cuttin it tattoo in your face up
And you too got a chopper in the car huh?!
Your star didn't make it that far NAH!!!!
That's new shit your ship sinkin
No table you at the bar mixed drinkin
Thinkin I used to make over six digits
Song on the radio like every six minutes (YEAH YEAH!!!)
You was like everywhere you was on everything
HUH! Now it's gone left like a wedding ring
Your career was last year
Well you ain't get the memo motherfucker when Craig Mack was here?!
Yeah! You had no plan when it hits ya
Strike three you couldn't dodge the picture
CHEESE! Now you get the picture
Not me but somebody will miss ya

[Chorus: Sample from "Wanksta" by 50 Cent, "Stunt 101" by G-Unit]
D-Damn homey, the fuck happened to you? ("50 Cent")
Kids used to look up to you, what happened? ("Lloyd Banks")
Damn homey, the-the fuck happened to you? ("50 Cent")
Kids used to look up to you, what happened? ("Lloyd Banks")

[Outro: ?]
Why you put the strain on me?
Uh! Yeah! They blind now I can see
Uh! Your intuition don't work on me
Uh! I'm like yo!!!
Hey!! When you first got in the game
Everybody knew your style your name
Now you did a 360 and now you changed
Your career don't poppin you to blame
Yeah! Uh!</pre>
