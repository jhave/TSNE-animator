[Ras Kass]
I walk the walk talk softly
And carry a big stick
Cause most niggaz is intense of it
I used to wonder why, niggaz don't give a fuck
Now I just except it
All the experiences collected and analyzed
and learned from, turn one, one and earn some
from break dancing
Now I'm glacing at a potential Manson
Make mistakes but you never no the path your life takes
Until you step one foot into the night
I got character defects that are light
Cause I don't drink soda
or smoke weed from a pipe
But I will drank a 40 ounce of OE
And smoke a pack of beadies
Won't sells crack, but I will steal a TV
Until motherfuckers love me, or leave me alone
Because one man's right could be another man's wrong
So let me choose the path I hype
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life

[Chorus]
*Scratching* "Speak Ya Clout" sample
"You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life" - Lil Dap

[Ras Kass]
Nobody else walked a mile in my shoes
Nigga you didn't pay my dues
It ain't about greed so money don't
confuse the issue
It's all about giving respect, to earn respect
So on whatever level nigga you better come correct
Cause the straw that breaks the camel's back
is when you treat a nigga like a friend
and he fucks you in the end
So fuck people pleasing cause niggaz don't
appreciate your sacrifices
Ain't down for the crisis and don't want to pay the prices
But want to ride for free
Whatever they want is mine
But whatever I get is for me
I'm representing Ras Kass best interests to the fullest
Be it 12' singles or teflon bullets
Whatever's clever I'm a get my shit together
(Or else) I'm a die trying ok?
Got a better chance then OJ nigga
It's only right
You couldn't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life

[Chorus]</pre>
