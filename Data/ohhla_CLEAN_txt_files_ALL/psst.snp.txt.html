[Jamie Foxx]
Hey you, out there
Fat ass, good hair
Hell with my homies
I wanna kick it with you
Cuz I got my swilla
Packed to the cilla
For what you heard
Don't be scared
Tell me what's the deal-a

Go, go, go, go
[Snoop D-O Double to the G]
Go, go, go, go

[Snoop Dogg]
Ay, what's yo name
and who you with?
Have a see baby girl
Come and limp with a pimp
Relax, you know I got this shit
Split that squishy
While I pop this Kris
Yea girl, its the D-O dub
How you feel

I wanna be yo thug
Now
I wanna treat it like its never been treated
Mixin and fixin and beat it and beat it

[Chorus]
Psst!
Baby let me holla at you
Psst!
I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst!

Psst!
Boy what you want?
Psst!

[Jamie Foxx]
Your love so bold
And so cold
Like a fridgerator
You work that ass
[Snoop D-O Double to the G]
Up and down
Like an elevator

[Snoop Dogg]
Dont you wish yo boyfriend was a gangsta like me?
But he ain't
And don't drink slow
And think slow
Cuz hey

And I'm likin it
Lovin it
Twerkin it
And then you dippin it
Diggin in
Workin it
Why you wanna go an do that?
Its not T.I
The boss with the horse
Snoopy D-O double G-Y
And I'm settin the tone
You know
Me and you we need to be gettin it on
In a real way
Its so major
Me and J. Fox wanna fly ya'll to Asia
So what's stoppin ya'll
Let's get it poppin ya'll
A little somethin for the head
Like a tylenol
Groove
And do yo doo
And don't play with it
Go and make yo move

Boy what you want
[Snoop D-O Double to the G]
Tell me what you want

[Chorus]
Psst!
Baby let me holla at you
Psst!
I'm tryna throw these dollas at you
Psst!
