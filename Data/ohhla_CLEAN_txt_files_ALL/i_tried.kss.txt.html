[Chorus: Avery Storm]
Every day, somethin in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin right, I try to see the light, I try
Ohh, it's like my eyes got a cover on 'em, and somethin holdin me back
A better man, better level, better know I try

[Jadakiss]
Uh-huh, get off me, AH-HAH! Uh, yeah yo
Listen, I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came with the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave 'til it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you with a mask
And the bible'll tell you nothin is gonna last
The name of the game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride, you know I'm gon' ride too
Make an M every day, I'm gon' try to - let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Uh-huh, get off me, AH-HAH! Uh, yeah yo
I tried to tell niggaz I'm willin to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggaz that ask for it
Got them things on the scale, I'm still weighin 'em
Thought my dues was paid, I'm still payin 'em
Couple Eleanor's and the Goose, I'm still Bay'in 'em
Semi's and the fully's, know that the truth stay with him
Wolves and gorillas is loose, so don't play with him
Somethin's holdin him back, nothin that you could say to him
Popped champagne with Biggie at the Palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titaniums
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died, but at least he tried - let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Uh-huh, get off me, AH-HAH!
Uh, yeah - watch the game get tooken over
I'm still on the same side of the fence, I'm just lookin over
A solider, from the gravel to the grass
to the obstacles in life I traveled in the past
Whether I'm holdin a mic or holdin a mac
It's like an invisible force is holdin me back
But I ain't lettin go of my pride
After I get the dough I'll slide, better know I tried
Let's go, uh

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Avery Storm]
Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me, here we go again ahhh
I try to do what's right when life is so wrooooong
I want a better way, I see a better day
'Nuff what the people said, I want a better me
God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Avery Storm]
I tried, hey!</pre>
