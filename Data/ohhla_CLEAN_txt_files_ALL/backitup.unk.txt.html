[unnamed woman]
Y'all better look out back there
I'm fin' to back this big ol' thang up~!
{*truck backing up with beeping noise*}

[Intro]
Okay now, I need all my ladies to report to the dance floor
If you got a big, big ol' butt
You need to be on the dance floor right now cause this is yo' song
I need all my ladies to back it up
Ay ay, let's go, ay ay, let's go~!

[Chorus]
Back that ass up like a Tonka truck
Back that ass up like a monster truck
Back that ass up like a Tonka truck
Back that ass up like a monster truck
Make it drop like a six-fo' {*repeat 3X*}
Make them ass cheeks clap to this hoe

[Unk]
Back that thang up hoe
Bend over and touch your toes
Now jack that thang up, whoa~!
Make it roll like them 24's
Now pull up to the bumper baby
And make these niggaz love you baby
Big booty on duty, you drive me crazy
And I got somethin for you lady
Go forward, reverse, and forward, again
Table dance five dollars you can keep that whole ten!
Whassup, tell that DJ can you play this shit again?
I ain't seen a ass this big, since God knows when
Back it up

[Chorus]

[Unk]
I like the way she move her body
Patron and Goose inside me
She turned around politely
(Back that ass up like a Tonka truck)
I looked at her like what the fuck?
Excuse me girl, is that your butt?
If it is, then thats what's up
Throw the motherfuckin dollars up
Back it up, go on bring it right back
Work that ass, make a nigga throw a stack
Tonka truck! She got a ass so fat
Ummmm - I ain;t seen nothin like dat!
Thirty-six, twenty-fo', thirty-six
This girl here be super thick
DJ Unk gotta have some of that
And I don't give a fuck who you with

[Chorus] - repeat 2X</pre>
