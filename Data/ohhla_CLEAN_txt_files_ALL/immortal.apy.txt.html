Typed by: apathy@hiphopsite.com

Hook plays once

"I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal."

[Verse 1]
I spit, to make the mic like a flammable torch
"It's understandable" my mind is a mechanical force
And I'm a cannibal my mandible is chewin' ya corpse
"I'm tyrannical, a vandle of intangible sorts
Not a mineral a mammal or an animal, I'm.
Metaphysical, the syllables in critical rhymes
Flows blowin' off ya limbs like invisible mines
Been invincible with rhymes since the biblical times
A warlord with a sword from the Mongul Horde
Speak the tongue of the lord, to bless my vocal chords
They tried to resurrect hip-hop, but faith is gone
So I'll take it over by force like Ghengis Khan
If you say it ain't raw, you better pray to Allah
Cuz I got an arrow that'll travel straight thru the jaw
Got breath control, flow like a ship with a sail
Divine when I spit, like if I sipped from the grail
Cuz I'm immortal

Hook repeats twice
"I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings
I have no rival, no man can be my equal." IMMORTAL

[Verse 2]
I'm underground like communities of homeless bums
Sleepin' by the third rail where the A Train runs
My brain strains to lift freight trains from off the ground
When I'm walkin' around, I'm the talk of the town
Cuz I harness mental powers scientists don't understand
So I'm on the low hiding from the average man
In a bad savage land I'm rockin' a gas mask
With black gats attached to snaps on back packs
To easily grip, when frequency blips
Alert me to intruders in the sewers where I secretly sit
Fine tunin' my rhymes until I got the hottest style
Then wrestle the mics from mutated crocodiles
That slipped into the pipes sometime in '88
Now they taste nuclear waste that makes 'em radiate
I'm subterranean, and melt the steel titanium

With powers of urainium comin out of my crainium. immortal

Hook repeats twice

[Verse 3]
I'll walk thru Hell till it freezes
If Reverend Run sells his Addidas
I stomp cats and leave a path of skeletal pieces
Ya'll are washed up like shellfish on beaches
I'm a genius that's developed speeches deeper than telekinesis
My immortality's recorded on record
Never distorted, contorted it into 240 seconds
You pressed ya single up but nobody will hear you
Like that Puerto Rican flag CD hangin' off ya rear view
GET READY TO RUMBLE, let's get busy
I'll spin the axis backwards, make ya planet dizzy
Decapitatin' catchin' the quickening when I'm spittin
I be wettin motherfuckers like a christening and cripplin'
Ya click, quick with equipment equipped
Like bloods blast crips
My hammer never clicks, pack back up clips
Slaughter all the competition when rippin a mortal man
And cut ya heads off, like only an immortal can

Hook repeats twice

Apathetic is immortal, I'll live forever
"Forever, forever ever, forever ever?"
One Two is immortal, I'll love forever
"Forever, forever ever, forever ever?"
Celph Titled is immortal, he'll live forever
"Forever, forever ever, forever ever?"
Open Mic is immortal, he'll live forever
"Forever, forever ever, forever ever?"</pre>
