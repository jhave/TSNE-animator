Bizzy Bone It's the Dog, Bizzy Bone
Got the Dog
You got Bizzy Bone ya man
Undisputed champion boy
Here's how it's done aight

I love you in a place, Where there's no space or time
I love you, for the life, You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, Remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing this song to you

Fully-Automatic, Whateva you want to know
We got's to cry, That I
Stand in the back and ready, Attack
And ready for combat, I
Heavly heated, Weeded, Beat it, Need it, See it
Get it, Get it, Get it, Good, Don't get it missunderstood
My homey, Only homey, Walking and we talking fo' sho
And I'm a be with him in the end with forgiveness, No more
And remember the words are (herb?) perfict, How could I be worthy
And when I feel so dam dirty, Dirty
By leaning on a leer jet, Baby ain't here yet
Henny, Caffeine, &amp; nicotine, Notice I left out the green
Notice I never brake a set, Who's that Fuck it
I don't even know the chick, I don't even know that shit
Ex me, Perplex me, Flex on decks man
Chastment, Investment, Quiet as kept
I say now, (Man, Man, Man, Man)
Ex me, Perplex me, Flex on decks man
Chastment, Investment, Quiet as kept
Fair

I love you in a place, Where there's no space or time
I love you, for the life, You're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, Remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing this song to you

Mad stressed, that I can't even sleep were I rest
So now I were a vest, but what if I don't catch it in the chest
Then I'm out, just like the light when the powers gone
And there's another tombstone, the childs putin flowers on
Long live the dream, of making enough cream
Were I won't have to skeem, or roll aroud with the team
And niggas I can't trust, and I mite have to bust
Over something dumb, know where I'm coming from fuck the fuss
It's to much to bare, and everyday is getting worse
Got me plotin on my peeps, and how to get'em first
It's something to make a nigga strive, and {Stay alive}
So I wach my own back {With a black 45}

Are thay coming? Thay coming to get us
"I'm ready For eva", they never defeat you
Thay'll never deceipt ya!

"WHAT!, Come on"

And were are thay coming? Thay coming to get us
"I'm ready For eva", the love of the future
Thay'll never defeat ya!

"YEAH!, Come on"

I love you in a place (I love you), Where there's no space or time (Time)
I love you, for my life (I love you), You're a friend of mine (Mine)
And when my life is over, Remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing this song to you
Tell me do you remember, Cause Baby I Remember
We were alone, and I was singin my song.

My homey, Only homey, Walking and we talking fo' sho
And I'm a be with him in the end with forgiveness, No more
And remember the words are perfict, How could I be worthy?
And when I feel so dam dirty, Dirty.

I love you in a place, (I love you) Where there's no space or time (Time)
I love you, for my life, (I love you) You're a friend of mine (Mine)
And when my life is over, Remember when we were together
We were alone, and I was singing this song to you.
{Donny Hathaway} I was singin my song {Rest In Peace, Baby}
To you and only you, baby
