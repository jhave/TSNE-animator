[Trina]
Uh-uh-uh-uhhh, uh-uh-uh-uhhh
Sex is what I'm talkin 'bout, sex is what I'm talkin 'bout
Ahhh..

[Trey Songz]
I'm not gon-na hold on no

[Chorus 2X: Trey Songz] + (Trina)
I ain't talkin 'bout a 70/30 (no way, no way)
Or a 60/40 (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Talkin 'bout a (50/50 when the room is empty)
(And the clothes come off, I'm doin you and you doin me)

[Trina]
First thangs first, Miss Trina, ducks all the lames in the game
I'm quick to put a nigga to shame
Fo' sayin my name, cause umm that'll get you nowhere
but West Bubblefuck, with a kick in yo' nuts
So if you wanna hit the guts, then you gotta play yo' cards right
Go against the odds, cut me like I'm hard white
I train bitches like Tyko
To get the dick then the money out these niggaz goin psycho
That's if you like a man, he kinda tight though (shit)
I don't give a damn, I'm tryin to get you right though (what)
Got vibes retired like David Rob
Heartthrob forever, cute and thicker than ever
Sheeeit, you know you need a chick like me
Own cars, own house, own shit like me
Uhh, see me and only me
I'm the real Queen of this shit, truly yours, "Baddest Bitch"

[Trey Songz]
I'm not gon-na hold on no

[Chorus]

[Trina]
Uhh, you know I'm still in my prime
So, give me some lovin I could feel in my spine
And do it to me like you said you would
Talk dirty but don't hurt me, do my body good
Show me love and give me hugs, let me cop a squeeze
Burn a few trees and let you get on top of me;
strength on that D - freaky deaky in the bedroom
I'm a lady by day by night I need my legroom
Wanna let my hurr down - get a glass of Chardonnay
I don't mean to drink it fast but homey pardon me
Calm your nerves I got you shakin hyperventilatin
Lack of preperation and waitin for the penetration
Concentratin with every moment when we have relations
Sensations give me temptations, so gimme more ain't no limitation
We lovemakin in the late night
Ain't goin home 'til the daylight - so fuck me right nigga

[Trey Songz]
I'm not gon-na hold on no

[Chorus] w/ ad libs to fade</pre>
