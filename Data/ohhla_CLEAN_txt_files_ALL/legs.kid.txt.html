She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's holdin' legs, wondering how to feel them
Would you get behind them, if you could only find them

She's my baby, she's my baby
Yeah, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, uh, right

She's got hair down to her fanny
She's kinda jet set, try undo her panties
Everytime she's dancing, she knows what to do, what to do
Everybody wants to see, to see if she can use it

She's so fine, she's all mine
Yeah, you got it right, so right
You've got it right, alright

Uh, hey, yeah, come on
She's got legs, she knows how to use them
She never begs, she knows how to choose them
She's got a dime all of the time, all of the time, all of the time
Stays out at night movin', through time

Oh I want her, so I got to have her
That girl's alright, she's alright
She's alright, right, right, right</pre>
