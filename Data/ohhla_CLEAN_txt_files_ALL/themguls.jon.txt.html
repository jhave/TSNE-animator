Repeat 2x's
It's some hoes in this house
It's some hoes in this house
If you see them point them out
If you see them point them out

Verse 1:
I like them hoes with them golds in they mouth
That be them hoes from the motherfuckin' south
I like them hoes with them big ass butts
That be them hoes that'll let a nigga cut
I like them hoes with them tats on they thigh
That be them hoes that love to get high
I like them hoes with them piercings in they tongue
That be them hoes that suck dick and swallow cum

Chorus: Repeat 8x's 
I like them hoes

Hook:
Some call them hoochies
Some call them breezays
Some call them bitches
But we call them hoes
That's how it goes

Verse 2:
I like them hoes with them colored ass wigs
That be them hoes with two or more kids
I like them hoes that'll help a nigga fight
That be them hoes that'll fuck with a dyke
I like them hoes with they own damn car
That be them hoes down for menage a trois
I like them hoes with them six inch heels
That be them hoes that'll let a nigga drill

Chorus: Repeat 8x's

Verse 3:
I like them hoes with them diamonds in they nails
That be them hoes that ain't scared to go to jail
I like them hoes with that weave in the front
That be them hoes that can roll a fat blunt
I like them hoes with them tight capri pants
That be them hoes that put you in a three point stance
I like them hoes that be tooting that dust
That be them hoes that don't really give a fuck

Chorus:
Repeat until fade</pre>
