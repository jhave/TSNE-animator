Check it

I got something that I really want to say
It's been on my mind and it goes this way
Concerns about society
And while I have a chance imma say it (hey)
We got
Teachers teachin' crap to the kids
Equivalent to selling crack to the kids
That's why the world's so addicted to fear, monkey business

You see my inside
Said something ain't right
I've got a mouth fright
I say it out right
I'll make a statement
State my opinion
Maybe my action
Gives inspiration
To make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you

Hey mister, something's wrong
We know something's going on
You know something we should know
Hey! Hey! You! You!

Ohh, and what do they know?
When they don't say what they know
Ohh, you're life you own
Things you must say, let me know

There's some things that I really wanna know
Check it out now, cuz this is how it go
Look we can go and buy tobacco
But apparently weed's illegal
If the world's so technological
Then why do we run cars off of oil
Gas and plastic all for oil
We went to war for oil
When it boils down to
(to, to, to, to, to, to)

You see my inside
Said something ain't right
I've got a mouth fright
I say it out right
I'll make a statement
State my opinion
Maybe my action
Gives inspiration
To make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you

Hey mister, something's wrong
We know something's going on
We know something wish you'd know
Hey! Hey! You! You

Ohh, and where do they owe
When they don't say what they know
Ohh, you're like your own
Things you must say, let me know

This is Monkey Business
I've got my rights to a business
This can't be life or is it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

This is Monkey Business
I've got my rights to a business
This can't be life or is it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you
Make them hear you

Hey mister, something's wrong
We know something's going on
We know something wish you'd know
Why don't you just let us know
Make them hear you
La-la-la-la-la
Hear you
La-la-la-la-la
Hear you
La-la-la-la-la
Hear you
La-la-la-la-la

Hey mister, something's wrong
We know something's going on
You know something we should know
Hey! Hey! You! You!</pre>
