Song:   Slater
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Tyler, the Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggaz who pushing tons
Tons of drugs, Foul flow dirty mouth like kissing bums
Momma done made her one, a witty son
With no respect for women so-so, show me your titties hun
"You eighteen?", Me? I'm twenty something
Okay I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he cum?"
I'mma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack, for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, Mac and Cheese
New Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics, (How's your dick?), "Shit, How's your knees?"
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
Came up with "Rella", ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than, Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, "Aye!", getting TU, OF NB
We was missing Sweatshirt like, where's the hooded sleeve
Okay, nevermind, we found him

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stopped rapping and started asking "Where my fucking passion is?"
Probably where that faggot went (Who?), Tyler talking father problems
Shocky shit he spit to popping topics in a gossip column
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now Ye's PJ sippin leche, Chips Ahoy! boy, listening to Cowboy
Aye boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy (Aye!)
AUS was AWES, I enjoyed, boy, y'all niggaz played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
Cameras with panorama's views
My shoes have seen more vans than Mexicanas with crackers in Alabama
G-O-to the-L-F, this O-F, I open a store so I don't stress
But nigga I, (What?), mosh in gardens, jazz punk shit
Playing chords, making up shit, pardon my Dolly Parton's
And I keep sharting, hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

[Interlude: Frank Ocean] + (Tyler, the Creator)
My bitch was on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch was on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind

My bitch was on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch was on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
My cool summer never ends

Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater

[Frank Ocean]
Oh my god.. I guess you're a cool guy
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser
(haha)
Oh... Fuck</pre>
