[C-Murder]
Baby, you can't listen to all that 
he say she say stuff going on out there right there you know
I can't explain why they mad at us 
Why they don't wanna see me and you happy 
You know but uh 
You my girl, you my world, you know
We gotta stick together through thick and thin 
Don't none of us need to be alone right now baby, you know 
  
As a kid I used to dream of us being together 
But as we grew, it broke my heart when you went with another 
It didn't last, cause he smashed, didn't wanna love you like me 
Just lookin' at your picture, I knew I had to be with ya
And tryin' times wishin' you were mine, many years no play
But up and down relationships would release you comin' my way 
Didn't have no money, but I was funny with big dreams of the future 
Never competed, always completed and there when you needed 
Broken hearted and lonely, you were there like my homie
No time for dates with them bustas because you knew they were phony
All the years that I waited, I guess they all paid off
Cause now you call me your baby, and uh I call you my ladie
  
Chorus:

Be alone, be alone
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone 
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone, I don't wanna be alone

Many haters tried to play us when I made to the top
Tryin' to crush our dreams but it didn't seem to stop 
It's like they didn't agree with the happiness we shared 
You confused, 'bout to lose all the times we had 
Are we victims of a jealous crime or lost in time
No need for livin' unless you given' me the love that's mine
Damn near fightin' in clubs, females testin' your patience
Talkin' marriage and livin' lavish but still pushin' engagement 
Up and down, tug-of-war between me and your freedom 
No time for shows or who oppose because we really don't need 'em
Conversations of you leavin' home pick up the phone 
Cause baby girl let's stay together, cause we don't need to be alone
  
[Chorus repeats while C-Murder talks]
Baby boo pick the phone up 
It's your baby, I know you hearin' alot of jealousy out there 
People comin' at you sideways, tryin' to break us up 
I'm not havin' that though, i'm not ready to be alone 
I'm ready to be with you so uh
Let's stick to that marriage, let's live lavish, get paid, 
Get engaged, and stop fussin' and fightin' 
Because an up and down relationship thang, that ain't cool
You know, I know you want me, and I want you 
So let's stay TRU boo, 
and stick together through all that bad weather baby
Cause the world is ours, the world is ours</pre>
