Ay, ay, ay!
Now listen to me for a minute
Ay, ay, ay!
Can ya hear me?

(Ciara)
Yeah, yeah, ye-ah!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Ha ha ha, yeah, ye-ah!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ye-ah!

(Verse 1)
TI
I know what you be thinkin' when ya hear me tryna holla
I'm a baller! You don't wanna come near me
I know ya hear me, but you really ain't tryna be bothered
Cause you probably used to leavin' out the club gettin' followed
But listen, shawty, I ain't nothin' like a stalker
If I say then I mean it, I ain't just a sweet talker
I know I want a woman 'fore i ever try to call her
I know ya first mind tell ya to decline, but you oughta
Come and chill for a minute, take a load off
Know ya heard rumors, plenty hoes say I'm throwed off
If ya choose to listen to them then it yo loss
But what you wanna do let me know, 'fore I roll off
I know ya havin' second thoughts, it ain't yo fault
Just don't let the bling scare ya off, I'm a sure floss
But I keep my business to myself, let the hoes talk
Kick it wit da King, be the Queen, it ain't no cost

(Chorus - Ciara)
I'll be your Queen for a day
Maybe we can get away
I do anything you wanna do anytime just pick a place
I'll be your Queen for a day
baby you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"
I'll be your Queen, for today
Maybe you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"

(Verese 2 - T.I.)
Come and hang wit me, shawty
I can change ya life! Not a lil bit, look I'm talkin' major like
I mean first class flights, not first class seats
Gotta go G4 if ya commin' wit me
I put you in position broads would be honored to be
Hoppin in the double R right in front of the suites
Tell the driver to drop us off in front of the beach
Set up a table in the sand, fix us somethin' to eat
You'll be surprised whatcha learn sit and talkin' to me
As the moon and the stars glisten off of the sea
You've hardly ever seen only one woman with me
and if ya did then she probably mean something to me
I know you know I tote glocks and I come from the street
but I done growed up alot since I was runnin' the streets
And even if that don't change ya opinion of me
I bet ya glad you got the chance to come and kick it with me, right?

(Chorus - Ciara)
I'll be your Queen for a day
Maybe we can get away
I do anything you wanna do anytime just pick a place
I'll be your Queen for a day
baby you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"
I'll be your Queen, for today
Maybe you won't have to chase
If ya really want me to be the one, all ya gotta do is say, "I'll be ya King!"

(Verse 3 - T.I.)
I know ya had a chance to listen to the rest flirt
for you give on up the song come and try my vest first
I can give it to ya slow or I can make the sex hurt
Ooh but no pressure we ain't gotta have sex first
I know you wanna know that it's a mutual respect first
But we goin kick it if ya wanna clear ya head first
We can blow on the best purp til ya chest hurt
Take a couple shots drop the top in a wet vert
Call up ya homegirl, we can go and get her
If she love a good time well tonight might impress her (ha ha)
Squeeze in ya tight skirt, match it wit ya best purse
I can show ya both how to ball I'm an expert</pre>
