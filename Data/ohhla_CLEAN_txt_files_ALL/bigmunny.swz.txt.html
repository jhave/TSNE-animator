You niggas talking fast but your money moving slow
That nigga's acting tough but you niggas all broke (they like)
Here come "Big Munny"

Niggas talking shit but they ain't taking this shit from me
I'm all on the block with the all black drop
I've got the creme on creme and it ain't gon' stop
'Cause I be cruising in that Lambo looking like Rambo
Tank-top with the bandana on (on)
You niggas acting tough but you know it's on
They be yelling on the block 'cause I be bringing it on (and they like)

[Verse 2]
For that paper, everybody want a little drama
Got movie stars want to be my baby Momma
I'm a, entrepreneur slash monster
Just copped that crib from that chick named Madonna
My bank account say zero, zero, zero comma
Zero, zero, zero comma - it's my time to
Shined you - blind you -let me remind you
Homie, I don't know you - How I blow you like some ganja
Oh yeah, they be thinking about my money when I'm walking (walking)
Uh-Huh, they be thinking about my money when I'm talking (Uh-Huh)
They ain't getting a dime of that (No!)
'Cause I'm on the fucking grind for that
That's why they always saying...
