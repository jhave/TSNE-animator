[Canibus]

[Repeat x4 - quietly]

This is a favourite short scene of mine
Two famous lines, time flies
Especially when you listen to rhymes
Words become time and time is disguised
Around the world in 80 seconds through a sentence
Experience is the mother of all adventure
Who knows the unknown? Where will you end up?
Question yourself, who, when and what
I tell you this much, it's up to every one of you
Learn from the past or the future will punish you
Power flows to those who remember
Memory comes from words, words come from letters
This is Mic Club's primary premise
We tell history, we don't let history tell us
Mic Club...
