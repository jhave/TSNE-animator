I...I'd like to uh, if its cool with Jake and Jack,
I'd like to address the juggalos, on a, uh, personal matter
Because, it's not all good
I mean, things aren't always done cool, you know I mean...
I just wanna talk to you guys about a problem I got...
Maybe you can help me

[Violent J]
I stab people, 4, 5 people everyday
I tried to see a shrink to stop that shit but it ain't no FUCKing way
I stabbed him, stabbed his nurse and his fucking cat
Stabbed them!  Stabbed them all like that
I stab people I know, I stabbed Alex, my manager
He was like, "WHAT THE FUCK?!" I stabbed him in the gut!
I order food just to stab the guy when he gets there, I don't care
I stab anybody anywhere [uh, uh] there
I stabbed the mailman, he was pissed, he tried to mace me
I'm to quick with the stabbing, come on, come on, taste me
I stabbed Twizted, Jimmy Madrox, I stabbed 'em
Myzery stabbed me OWW!! Goddamn him!
I stab old people, ladies, little kids, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!
I stabbed a fat guy in the but [hehe], what?
I met Pete Rose and stabbed him, twice in his nipple
I'm Violent J, I stab people.

Maybe somebody can help me (4X)</pre>
