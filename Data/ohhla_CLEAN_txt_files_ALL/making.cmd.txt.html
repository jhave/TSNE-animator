Hey C-Murder who you hang with?
Say little Kevin boy you know I only make moves with thugs
nigga nigga nigga what
make moves with thugs, nigga nigga what
I make moves with thugs, ghetto niggas feel me

[C-Murder]

I wake up in the morning and grab my gat
re-cock my shit before I grab my hat
then I page my niggas Fiend and Mac
cuz we be strapped like the men in black
and uhh one time don't bother me 
already payed my dues for a robbery
just cashed a check for 200 G's 
left them hoes alone to pursue my dreams
I told them haters don't play no games
got a bunch of bout it mother fuckers screamin' my name
left the life of crime for the life of ryhme
with every move I make its bulletproofs with nines
you don't wanna go to war with me
I got Big Man and Baz with me
just some more thug niggas ridin' with me
cuz makin' moves with thugs is a high
makin' moves with thugs

(Chorus)(2X)

You know the deal (nigga soliders and thugs)
this thugs for real (makin' moves with thugs)
we packin' steel (i'm makin' moves with thugs)
in cabs we peel (makin' moves with thugs)

[Master P]

how many niggas wanna ride with me
how many thug niggas and bitches wanna get high with me
don't cry for me, just ride for me, 187, 211 is a robbery
I hang with killers and dealers thug niggas and bangers
see 3rd world niggas keep one in the chamber 
don't play no games boo cuz this shit be real
I roll with young niggas that be hard to kill
I gave Kate Wang gold, bobby and jimmy
Big V, big token nigga watchin' they enemies
throw up they soldier rag if you bout it bout it
cuz us thug (3rd world) niggas livin' be rowdy rowdy
hennessy and weed when we smokin' and jokin'
I mean nigga nigga when we token its open 
nigga we gone ball take a fall nigga
cuz me and C-Murder biggest thug of 'em all nigga

(Chorus)(4X)

You know the deal (nigga soliders and thugs)
this thugs for real (makin' moves with thugs)
we packin' steel (i'm makin' moves with thugs)
in cabs we peel (makin' moves with thugs)</pre>
