[Intro: The Game] + (DJ Clue)
Ay Clue? turn me up a lil' bit, the mic and the headphones
(A Week Ago!) all the way up (Part 2!)
It's a true story (The Game!)
(Listen close y'all! Clue?!)

[Verse 1: The Game] + (DJ Clue)
It all started off as a dream, me &amp; you
In the hood sellin' rocks, never thought I would see it through
I was just a hood nigga sellin' crack with deflated hoop dreams
You can't see it by the way the Bentley coupe bling (ha ha!)
I'm fresh out, just tryna keep my shoes clean
While you on TV doin' your 1, 2 thing
On BET sittin' by Free in them blue jeans
Is the reason I waited for you like true fiends
Fast-forward, relationship in full-swing
News headlines read "Game Got A New Fling"
I got a new queen
And after what happened at Hot 97 it's time for a new team
Get Jacob on the phone, cop some new bling
Can't be affiliated if he snitched on
This Rap shit'll leave you scarred
And through it all, you are my ghetto superstar

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
(Ahh) no sleepin', tossin', turnin' (ahh)
Never thought the tables were turnin' (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin'
'Cause it was all just good a week ago (ahh)
Took a chance and now I'm learnin' (ahh)
Real talk, my faith would deter me (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin'
'Cause it was all just good a week ago

[Verse 2: The Game]
It's funny what seven days could change
From the "Dreams" video to a box at the Wizards' game
I give my heart, my house, &amp; this chain
Just to see ya face when the roses came
You wanted me to meet ya family - I'm on the next plane
To eat dinner with ya pops &amp; be if change
He said he would die for you I told him I'd do the same
And I seen it in his eyes - he could feel my pain
I told you I had a son - you wanted to know his name
Harlem, but the fans call him "Baby Game"
For his birth I was against all odds in the streets
Me, Little Mike, &amp; Fase dodgin' police
Now we in the studio - heads bobbin' to beats
First Jay &amp; Beyonce then Nas &amp; Kelis
Same night I told your pops I would give you the world
I was your +LL+ you was my +Around The Way Girl+

[Chorus: Mario Winans] + (*DJ Clue*)
(Ahh) no sleepin', tossin', turnin' (ahh)
Never thought the tables were turnin' (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin' (*Jimmy H.!*)
'Cause it was all just good a week ago (ahh)
Took a chance and now I'm learnin' (ahh) (*that nigga Diddy!*)
Real talk, my faith (*Clark Kelly!*) would deter me (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin'
'Cause it was all just good a week ago (*come on!*)

[Verse 3: The Game] + (DJ Clue)
I had dreams of lovin' an R&amp;B chick
But I had no idea the shit feel like this
If I told Dre, he wouldn't believe this shit
Me &amp; you at the movies holdin' hands (ha ha!) watchin' Hitch
And even though we both got a lot at risk
We in DC eatin' chicken on a college bench
To my condo in L.A., slap-box, I'm with
Daddy's lil' girl, makin' people Glock and a whip
Now is it that irate that a nigga could relate
to us holdin' each other down on our first date?
You remind me of my nigga, ridin' state to state
She ain't worried about my digits 'cause we both got cake
You made yours singin' - I made mine off weight
Niggaz reach? Take five shots from a .38
And murder was the case that they gave me

[Chorus: Mario Winans] + (*DJ Clue*)
(Ahh) no sleepin', tossin', turnin' (ahh)
Never thought the tables were turnin' (ahh)
Seven days, my heart's still burnin'
'Cause it was all just good a week ago (ahh)
Took a chance (*Clue?!*) and now I'm learnin' (ahh) (*Desert Storm!*)
Real talk, my faith would deter me (ahh)
Seven days (*Professional 3!*), my heart's still burnin'
'Cause it was all just good a week ago

[Outro: The Game] + (DJ Clue)
DJ Clue! The Professional!
Hurricane, Mario Winans, gangsters need love too
This song is dedicated to (ha ha)
The baddest bitch in the game, she know who she is
(DJ Clue! Professional Part 3! Y'all know what it is! Ha ha!)</pre>
