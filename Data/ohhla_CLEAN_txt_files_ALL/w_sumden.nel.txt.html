[Chorus - repeat 2X]
Hey this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

You see Biggie be like "What's Beef?"
Me I'm like what's weed?  
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours like a prescription I smoke
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool "J's" I mean bud
Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds, 
I spit residue smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop, 
but that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point "A" ya dig, 
and my momma think that I should quit

[Chorus]

Ya I get high
You might see me stroll by 
in the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors

You know how we do it kid.  We get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, Wrap Sumden (Wrap Sumden),
make a nigga clap somthing, get all mad and slap somthing

Yo grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time,
and I burn mine, don't you ever ever touch mine

Fire it up dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get bloooowwwwwed 

[Chorus]

All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more,
but since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though
I keep the pants sag.  Bubble eye hands rag
Eyes glassed smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
"What we doin' today"  Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Ok made a left so continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them, 
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

[Chorus]

Fade
