(Big Ed)
Ha, Ha were my mother fuckin soldiers, its time for war (attention)

Fire in the hole take cover

Seen that 50 calibur spit that bits, unload, reload and extra an clip, 
I thought i was watchin gymnastics the way i seen that hoe flip 
Its the A-S-S-A-S-S-I-N who am i (the assassin) 
Big Ed be puttin it down like dat get your gat
A-R fully automatic now whatch how act 
It's survival of the roughest nigga, toughest nigga 
When im drinkin happy, so they call Mr. bucka nigga 
Ask my nigga Chris Artis he say No Limit niggaz be the hardest
&gt;From Coast to coast regardless

Watch out the bound nigga comin 4 your grill

And Momma Mia's verbil A-K gon spray 4 my Soldiers
