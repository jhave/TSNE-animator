Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge]
Touching your self
I see you twerking and you needed some help
Well girl I won't stop until you say

[Chorus]
That's my shit
That's my shit
Yeah, that's my shit
Oh Annie, that's my shit
Yeah, that's my shit
Yeah, that's my shit
Yeah, that's my shit
Annie, girl

[Verse 1]
Pop that pussy on me, you can ride on me
Pass the weed, get me right
I'll make you feel good, girl
Annie, kissing your body
We going all night
Won't stop until the morning
I got you [?]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Annie show me that ass
Get ready, girl make it do what it do
I'm trying to get the best of you
Annie, kissing your body
We going all night
Won't stop until the morning
I got you [?]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Kissing your body
We going all night
Won't stop until the morning
I got you [?]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]</pre>
