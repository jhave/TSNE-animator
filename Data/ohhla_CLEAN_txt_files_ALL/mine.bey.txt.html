[Beyoncé]
Uhh...
I've been watchin for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, ohh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my ohhh my
Been having conversations about break-ups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Ohhhh
Cause if we are, we're takin this a little too far
If we are, we're takin this a little too far
Baby if we are, we're takin this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried 'bout wherever you are
We're takin this a little too, far
We're takin this a little too, far
We're takin this a little too, farrrr...

(We are, too far)
(If we are, take this too far)

[Chorus One: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood; still treat you like I should
Whassup?

[Beyoncé]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of
is, we should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holdin back on this and let's get carried away
Stop makin a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm askin for but you
Stop makin a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus Two: Drake &amp; Beyoncé]
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really askin for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
Long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus One]

[Drake]
From 8 until late I think 'bout you
You own my nights, I don't know what to do (do)
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep (yeah)
This whole thing got way too deep - and we should
Stop makin a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm askin for but you
Stop makin a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus Two]

[Chorus One]

[Beyoncé]
All I'm really askin for is you, yeah...
Long as you know who you belong to

[Drake]
Yeah, yeah yeah
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go "Thriller" on you
I'ma just (pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talkin when I see you baby girl, I miss feelin on you
(Pull up on you) I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you, that's just how I feel about you
(Pull up on you) Been about you and I'm still about you
But, we ain't finished talkin (pull up on you)
I told you you don't need to worry about them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talkin (pull up on you)
Cause they don't wanna see you happier than them
And girl you swear they are your friends and there's been a problem (pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that, yeah
I know you think it's funny that yo' ex is not a runningback
but that nigga came runnin back (pull up on you)
And you tell me you done with that...
And I believe it's true
Long as you know who you belong to
Uh, oh-hohhhh

[Beyoncé]
All I'm really askin for is you
Yeah {*echoes*}</pre>
