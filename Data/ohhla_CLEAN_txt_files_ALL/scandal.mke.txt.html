[Mike Jones]
Hoes these days mayne, I'm tellin y'all
They scandalous baby, scandalous baby
That's why

[Lil' Bran]
I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes

[Chorus: Mike Jones] + (Lil' Bran)
Females I don't trust 'em, Lord knows I don't love 'em
I fuck 'em, I don't cuff 'em, I swear they nothin but trouble
And for that reason there, I keep my shit in my pants
Because (I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes)

[Mike Jones]
Geah!  I watch my back when I'm walkin, I watch my mouth when I'm talkin
My glock cocked when I'm crawlin cause you never know
Who hate the fact you got plenty of paper stacked so they envy
the way you move in that Bentley now you got more than one enemy
Tryin to take you out nope, that's why you ride wit'cha scope
Or aim the infrared beamer straight to they throat
So if you ever in fear of your life, you put steel HERE in they life
Cause you ain't goin down, especially not tonight
I never ever trusted hoes because they got a plan
They don't want me for me they want me because I got some Grants
It's sad when you down nobody lends a helpin hand
But when you blow up and don't help them you {?} man
My grandma told me watch these hoes because they got a plan
to get your paper that's why I keep my shit in my pants
You're on your own 'til your gone that's what I was told
So I'ma help who helped me 'til my casket closed

SYEAH!  Mike Jones, WHO?!  Mike Jones
That's why

[Lil' Bran]
I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
What's my business is my business, don't worry 'bout how I'm livin
I'm gettin it how I'm gettin it, you should do the same
These haters hate, they mad cause I'm gettin cake
That's why (I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes)

[Lil' Bran]
Stand you scandalous hoes

[Mike Jones]
I cain't stand 'em mayne
We fin' to do a little bit different right here
Check it out - SYEAH!

[Mike Jones]
Now that you stackin up dollars, these hoes now wanna holla
They wanna be on your team, they wanna know all about'cha
They wanna ride on your ride, they wanna be by your side
until the day that you die, that's what they tellin you right?
They sayin they wanna commit, because your paper legit
The minute you go bankrupt the second they gon' split
Now yo' ass ain't got shit
Listenin to that bitch got you flat broke quick
If you was straight from the streets you'll know that that bitch
was from the jump a hoe, playin you for your dough
But I guess you thought I was hatin when I was keepin it real
I'll bet you gon' listen now cause she got you for your scrill
So let this lesson be told to those who got caught
You tried to pay for some pussy that already been bought
You told the hoe where you lived, cause you thought that the bitch was real
Same time she was one of them niggaz inside your crib
I cain't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks
I cain't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks

[Outro: Mike Jones] + (Lil' Bran)
SYEAH!  Mike Jones
Females I don't trust 'em
Lord knows I don't love 'em
That's why (I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes)
The same ones that'll suck you up, 'll fuck you up I swear
Y'all beter get y'all game on mayne
Hoes are scandalous mayne (I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes)
SYEAH!  Mike Jones (scandalous hoes)
(These scandalous hoes, these scandalous hoes)
That's why (I, cain't, stand you scandalous hoes)</pre>
