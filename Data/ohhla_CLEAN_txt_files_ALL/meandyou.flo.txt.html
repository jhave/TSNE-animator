[Pre-chorus]
You and me (Just you and me)
Me and You (Just Me and You)
Just you and me (Just you and me)
Emotions

[Chorus]
These emotions I feel
(These are the emotions I feel)
These emotions are real
(I know that emotions are real)
'Cause you are my love
(You are my love)
(You are my love baby)
(You are my love)
I got emotions
You got emotions

[Verse 1]
We need to be together
You ain't gon' find you nothin' better
I don't warrant the pressure
I don't mess with them heefers
Baby you under pressure
All of them Italian leathers
All them gifts on the reg'lar
Brand new Phantom umbrella
You on, girl
We even got matchin' perfume and cologne, girl
Ain't no other nigga gon' be touchin' your thong, girl
You mine, ain't no denyin'
Even witness me cryin', take some time to rewind
Let's bullshit, two human beings in love
Nah it ain't like this, see you makin' me cuss
Damn right I'm pissed, it was supposed to be us
This is ridiculous, 'cause it was supposed to us

[Pre-chorus]
Just you and me (Just you and me)
Just Me and You (Just Me and You)
Just you and me (Just you and me)
I can't let it go

[Chorus]
These emotions I feel
(These are the emotions I feel)
These emotions are real
(I know that emotions are real)
'Cause you are my love
(You are my love)
(You are my love baby)
(You are my love)
I got emotions
You got emotions
These emotions

[Verse 2]
I got your name tattooed
You think that's enough for me to go nuts like cashews
Not my soul, like we be callin' black fool
I mean damn who knows, you prolly fucked another dude
I gave you that rose, that ring when I proposed to you
Got rid of my gold teeth, 'cause your mom and them, oops
And shot at them fools who touched your brother, now Boo
And now you gon' tell me we should slow it down, who
Not Flo Rida, I provided Campbells' soup
When sick 'bout to die, I spoon-fed you Theraflu
You gotsa be high, woman, I ain't 'bout to lose
Get out this house, I pay tuition on ya school
I mean to my knowledge, until the end it's Me and You

[Pre-chorus]
Just you and me (Just you and me)
Just Me and You (Just Me and You)
Just you and me (Just you and me)
I can't let it go

[Chorus]
These emotions I feel
(These are the emotions I feel)
These emotions are real
(I know that emotions are real)
'Cause you are my love
(You are my love)
(You are my love baby)
(You are my love)
I got emotions
You got emotions
These emotions

[Bridge]
I don't care what those other people say
Don't care
They don't understand - why I feel this way
I don't care what those other people say
Don't care
They don't understand - these emotions

[Pre-chorus]
Just you and me (Just you and me)
Just Me and You (Just Me and You)
Just you and me (Just you and me)
I can't let it go

[Chorus]
These emotions I feel
(These are the emotions I feel)
These emotions are real
(I know that emotions are real)
'Cause you are my love
(You are my love)
(You are my love baby)
(You are my love)
These emotions

You and me
(And me)
(And me)</pre>
