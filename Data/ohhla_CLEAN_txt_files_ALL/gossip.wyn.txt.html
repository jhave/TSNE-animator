(Verse 1)
STOP! hatin' on a nigga
That is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And you can get tipped
Like you waitin on a nigga
Put in body bag and a apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you can never see
If you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me to win the title fight
But I'ma wear that championship belt so tight
And if I'm wrong there is no right
And if I'm wrong there is sno-white
I'm tryin to be polite
But you bitches in my hair
Like the fucking po-lice
My flow is rare
These other rappers nice
These other rappers bark
Some of em even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light
You just might might wanna...

(Verse 2)
STOP analyzing, criticizing
You should realize what I am
And start epitomizing
Confident, got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident like fuck em all
Pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick so sick
Its like my shit is dying
It rains a lot in my city
Cuz my city's cryin
Cuz my city's dyin
But I emerge from all of that
I am a living poi-ne'er
ZION, fear god not them
Steer my robin coupe thru the streets
In the booth and SABOO
And then I leave a tub in the booth
I leave a bloodbath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth
Now, WHERE THE DRUGS AT?
Like the strings on a shoe, no nigga fuck that!
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot
WHERE NEW ORLEANS AT?
I feel hip hop stole me
Like a bus pass
So in your possession
I must ask...

(Verse 3)
Drag my name thru the mud
I come out clean
Castaway stones
I wont even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I wont even think
Just leave you dead
Like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'ma need cheese
If I'm baking a zede
You niggaz want beef?
I want a steak and a webe
Lost in Amsterdam
By Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga takin it easy
All about my paper bout my paper like easy
Why do rappers? Why do rappers?
Lie to fans lot of rappers, lot of rappers
Lie like acting

(Talking)
Cut the motherfuckin' camera
Cut the check
Fuck ya props
I AM HIP HOP
And I ain't dead I'm alive</pre>
