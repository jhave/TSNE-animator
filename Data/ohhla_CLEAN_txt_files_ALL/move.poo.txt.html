[Chorus X2: Darien Brockington]
Just feel the beat, let your body do the rest
Don't be afraid to move from right to left
We here to party, we ain't here to impress
So move just how you like

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, yo, listen, me at nineteen
Getting very comfortable, tryna get green
Got a couple niggas looking mad cause I'm on scene
and they got a couple records talking obscene
Why you getting all mad? It's just my dream
Shit I figured you was good, homie serve fiends
So you see me in the club, wanna look mean
like you just drunk a whole fifth of Jim Beam
Be easy, here's what you do, find yourself a lil' breezy
Take her to the flo', let yourself go
Drink a lil' mo', here's a lil' mo'
If she backing up then give her what she ask for
I just came to have a good old time
Don't start no shit, don't say no rhymes
If you see me kicking something then it's not mine
cause a party ain't a party 'til you party with dimes

[Chorus X2: Darien Brockington]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, all work, no play
leads to letting yourself loose at the end of the day
Couple shots of Marnier take your trouble away
Keep tipping the bartender, you just doubled her pay
Now headed for the exit but she want you to stay
Wanna pass a CD that she want you to play
OK, maybe later on, not here
Everybody claim that this year is they year
If that so, let's get a few things clear
This exactly why Poobie came here
To shake a leg, sip barre
Not to put you on or become your A&amp;R
Not to take your CD looking for a star
Real rap nigga, I ain't made it that far y'know
So, grab one, have fun, it's allowed
No more demos getting passed in the crowd

[Darien Brockington]
I just wanna have fun, yeah
Grab a drink and hit the dance floor
Just might get another drink and dance a little longer
I'm all danced but I can dance more
...what I came here for

[Chorus X2: Darien Brockington]

[Darien Brockington]
You like, move just how you liiiiike
Oooooh-oh-oh-oh</pre>
