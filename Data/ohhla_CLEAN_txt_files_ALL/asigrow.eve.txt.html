[Eve]
Turn your negitive into a positive
This one is for the kids
Hmm

Chorus: Eve
People hear me when I talk yea(As I grow)
People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)
Cuz this life that I live it's (All I know)
And can nobody can take me off this (Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea

[Eve]
Yo
I'm in a position to help a lot of people
When I love it, but people that claim that they love me
Want to take advantage of it
I duck 'em, I can't lie
That toss alot of lies
Can't trust the story tears swellin in my eyes
Let my pen stab the page, Times I feel raged
Sometimes I feel trapped got me locked in a cage
But I break free
Won't never let the anger overtake me
Cuz actions of another never make E or break E
I never let 'em shake me
And no matter what I never always wish exesive ho's that hate me
The ones they call my enimies
Who only want to be friends of me
On the other hand surrounded by the greatest team
Who wouldn't trade mind for nothin not for anything
Thank you for giving me your best
And I appreciate giving you everything and nothing less

Chorus: Eve
People hear me when I talk yea(As I grow)
People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)
Cuz this life that I live it's (All I know)
And can nobody can take me off this (Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea

[Eve]
I live my life threw my semi chest
My heart beat strong, sometimes contaminated by the pest
And yeah I know I'm livin' blessed
And if I didn't make it here, my life would be a mess
Can't live a life of fear
All that get you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress
And I always had a hard head
Had a choice to play around wit life or listen to a gossip
So I straightened up and I'm doin right
Growin every year, aiiyo this thing ain't happen overnight
But I still got alot to do
And never givin up cuz anything I feel I know is possible
Don't never let people disgurage
Plants see the dream, Baby and let 'em flurish
Lettin you in on what I know
Huh, as I live my life and as I grow

Chorus: Eve
People hear me when I talk yea(As I grow)
People try to break me but I (Still stand strong)
Cuz this life that I live it's (All I know)
And can nobody can take me off this (Path I travel on)
People hear me when I talk to yea
(Repeat once)
