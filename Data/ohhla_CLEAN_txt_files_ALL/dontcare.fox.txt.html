I I I DON'T CARE
I DON'T CARE

[Chyna White]
Yo, consider me a roll model if there's beef in the club
I'm that lil' white bitch that's gonna throw bottles
Me and the fam has this whole model
Fuck you, fuck them, fuck all uh yall
So what if this is not the kids?
So what if there's a hundred labels that got the bid?
So what if I dreamed the devil never dared me to sin?
So what if the industry compares me to him?
So what if I write hard?
Or is it really just a big fuckin' deal cuz' it's comin' from a white broad
So what, hear me so what?!
If I bring it most of these rappers gon' fold up
I don't care if I might be on top, I can give a flyin' fuck 
If you like me or not
So what if you think I'm not the illest chick?
I don't care you still gotta feel dis bitch
I don't care

[Chorus]
To all the hatas that be lookin' to fade us
We not concerned wit what chu put in the papers
I DON'T CARE
We stayin' focus while you try to provoke us
We never cared that industry notice
I DON'T CARE

[Foxy Brown]
Don't give a FLUCK (fuck) niggas know I'm BUCK
Niggas know I'm reppin' they don't fuck wit' me
Bitches know I'm 7 go head get slick
Tick this bitch off get cho highway to heaven nigga
Slick shit hot shit I'm so gutter
If I die tomorrow I reserect through my young brotha
Oh Gawd got to warn yah first shawty spit hard
And she rollin' with the Brown broad
Young Fox don't co-sign shit niggas know she gotta be a live bitch
If we fuck wit her
Niggas know how the fuck I flow 
It's a rap I'm so back it's a double high mode nigga
Please believe it's the BK pretty broad
Code D is a white sex in the city broad
Out in that field we get it crunk we cruise pop
Wit two 20 glocks holla yah heard Fox

[Chorus] (x2)</pre>
