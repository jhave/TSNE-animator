[Don Cisco]
You ready for this? Come on.

[Frost]
Look how we do now, pop chanpagne with the brunette
L.A. so hot, I rock ICE just to cool down
I ride's on spoke dubs in the street
All the ladies on the front that's loving the heat
So turn the beat up watcha, shake to the Cha Cha
Go ahead girl, let the whole world watcha
You know I want you, yo te quiero
You can be my gata and I can be your perro
Game tight, much sharper than a filero
This can be your ticket out the ghetto
A huevo, el mero mero, and the Don Cisco
And the Soopafly, K, get it going on.....

[Don Cisco]
To all my Latin ladies, You all know you drive me crazy
50 by 50 come give it to me baby
Chiqui, wha, what?, Que, que?
I could be your love if you let me
Recognize a thugh and respect me
Morena, Boriquas, Cubanas and Niquas
Sexy Chicanitas, all you fly mamacitas
Me gusta, when you start talking my Lingo
Say she ain't got a Hombre and she love to be single
That's why she hit the club with the girls tonight
You want to shine, go ahead is your world tonight
Shake your thing, break it down, move your body around
You ain't know? It's a party when my crew hits town
Now what?

[Chorus]
Mamacita 
Sexy Señorita
You know how a Playa treat ya?
I only call you when I need ya
I love to love you than I leave ya
I give it to you and never cheat ya
So come on baby, let me teach ya
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya
I'm talking to my Mamacita

[Soopafly]
Hey! yo! I make the ladies rock their drop tops and keep it hot
Lock it in their twat and recite the flows I got
I chip off rocks so smooth I let them slip off
Girls be all flocking the stage to watch me get off
Soopa making a cold manouver, I'm talking to you
Can you shine this boots I'm knocking and running through you?
Drop the Boo-ya it's me they running to now
Who can stop my track? I'm macking them like I'm Dru Down
The first haters that step get kill and peeled 
Messing with Soopa 
you'll be having your conversation with wilt the steel
Your eyes reveal, my ladies stay on tilt, 
I re-candle the flame by sticking ah! to each dame
Like Arriba! Soopa and Frost smooking chiva
Kurupt, Cisco came through with the drink Eurika
I saw you take that money, don't make me beat you
Top greedy and sexy is ready... who that? 

[Chorus]
Mamacita 
Sexy Señorita
You know how a Playa treat ya?
I only call you when I need ya
I love to love you than I leave ya
I give it to you and never cheat ya
So come on baby, let me teach ya
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya
I'm talking to my Mamacita

[Kurupt]
I love freaking, I love freaking, 
I love me a Bon-bon Puerto Rican
Different skirts different weekends, 
from L.A. to San Juan, Puerto Rico
I still move Perico, to the chicas and the chicos, Ay! Dios mio!
Neo, cam, strong, Capone, Stallone, concrete stone is home
Kurupt and Daz, Soopa Fly, Cisco, Hash 
Frost, Big Fred, Tijuana, Cancun, Blast!
Smoking Mexicali, Slim Southern California Cali
OG Russell Simmons with women about a dozen
All my cousins California living sipping Tequila goosing
(As soon as we get home from work, ha ha yeah! 
We gonna have to pop and purk, wha what?)
Cisco, C-note, Big Hash
Cisco and Hash, baby, no! Tango and Cash...

[Chorus]
Mamacita 
Sexy Señorita

I love to love you than I leave ya
I give it to you and never cheat ya
So come on baby, let me teach ya
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya
I'm talking to my Mamacita</pre>
