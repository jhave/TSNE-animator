[Cee-Lo Green]
I've been living for the weekend, but no not any more
Cause here comes that familiar feeling, that Friday's famous for
Yeah I'm lookin for some action, and it's out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity, all in the evening air
And it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So I guess I'll have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me

[Chorus]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriiiiiight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight, tonight)

[Cee-Lo Green]
Now Friday is cool, but there's something about Saturday night
You can't say what you won't do, cause you know that you just might
I'm alive this evening, it was love at first sight
A-this Saturday, and every Saturday for the rest of my life
And everyone's standing in line, uh
Yeah lookin good, and lookin for a real good time
So I'll never have to wonder if
I'll have someone to share all of this with

[Chorus]

[Cee-Lo Green]
Yes I need it, everybody doeeeeeees
Cocktails and conversation, music and making loooooooooove

[Outro]
And it's alright (it's alright)
It's alright, it's alright, it's alriiiiiight (it's alright)
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight)
Bright lights, bright lights
Bright lights and the big cityyyyyyy (tonight)
It belongs to us toniiiiiiiight (tonight)</pre>
