[Intro/Chorus]
I always do you favors, and that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on your job, and that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but... I got to
I got to, yeah yeah
They say the best, part, of waking up
is breakfast after a nut

[Lil Wayne]
And that's romance, that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
We fuck and crash - that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
Okay - fuck my hand, suck my thumb
Be a lady, and buy me lunch
Send me cards, and make me read
But don't send me no flowers, unless it's weed
Cause I'm that nigga, she say I'm that nigga
She ain't got a man but act like I'm that nigga
She check my iPhone - what's that about?
Any other hoe I woulda cussed her ass out
But that's romance, that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
She kiss my ankle when I twist my ankle
She even did anal when she don't do anal
My bitch I'm thankful - let's hold hands
Can we? Hehe
Let's slow dance, shall we?
Hehe
And we gon' be like one, two, one, two
She say I'm the one, girl you the one - too
I stand up in that pussy like a sun, roof
Hehe, yeah

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Okay now give me coochie at my momma's crib
On Thanksgiving, everybody listening
All your homegirls bad, and dare I guess
Let 'em all in, and I'll play chef
That's romance, cause we so real
She said she can not take the pain if it ain't a pill
She say fuck these hoes - they just mad
We fucked a hoe together - that's romance
If you got cups, and I got drank
I take my rubber off and put that money in the bank
I ain't 'cho friend, fuck that shit
Try to find another me - girl good luck with that shit

[Outro Chorus]
Cause I always do you favors, and that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
I fucked you on the table, and that's romance
That's romance, that's romance
And I don't give a fuck, but baby, I got to
I got to, yeah yeah
They say the best, part, of waking up
is breakfast after a nut
