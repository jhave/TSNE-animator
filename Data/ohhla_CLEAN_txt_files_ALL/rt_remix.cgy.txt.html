Ah y'all we get it right herre this the remix

Disturbing Tha Peace, So So Def, Chingy, J.D
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, do, what you do) Let's do it

[Chorus: Chingy]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch ya hips when ya walkin let down ya hairr (Down ya hairr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick ya lips when ya talkin that make me starre (Make me starre)

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Girl why you dat right thurr
She so bad I'm constantly getting calls from da mayorr
I though of a rabbit the way she bouncing fo' thurr curr
Her man defendin' her like a lawyer so bewarre
So dudes be handcuffin but dirrty that ain't fairr
I wanna bet she got da bomb like a terrrorist
She wit it I'll hit it though but I ain't thinking 'bout marrriage
I love these honeys might as well call me Papa Bearrr
Girl you know you looking good, good
Ah don't I know you from da hood, hood
You say you wouldn't when you would, would
Now take it off you know you should, should, now twist around fo me!

[Chorus x2: Chingy]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch ya hips when ya walkin let down ya hairr (Down ya hairr)

Lick ya lips when ya talkin that make me starre (Make me starre)

[Verse 2: Trina]
Miss Trina make the ballas wanna starre (Wanna starre)
House 'a naughty boots lined with the furr (Furr)
Walk with a switch pull it over make it twerk
I'ma flirt 'til it hurt in a throwback skirt
I'm that bad bitch, rocks Benz on bladez
Rocks on my wrist like pink lemonade
Keep ya watches and ya rings, tell them other girls
Lil' mama rockin strings and Chanel Pearls
Im back for my crown fake bitches bow down

Get loose in da club like we just don't carre (Don't carre)

[Chorus x2: Chingy]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch ya hips when ya walkin let down ya hairr (Down ya hairr)

Lick ya lips when ya talkin that make me starre (Make me starre)

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
I'm from the city wherre they do that right thurr the most
Out-a-towners come around and straight over dose
Where the hips sing to ya and swing like, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
Like you done walked into a B2K concert mannn
Back out legs showin talkin like mann
Who got the drink and where the party at tonight damn
That's when they start that backing it up on ya homie and
That's a feelin' you just can't fight
We fired up off that Hypnotic and Hennessey
She can't keep her motherfuckin' hands off me
We both in the club high bouncing to the beat
When she turn around this is what I told her

[Chorus x2: Chingy]
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Switch ya hips when ya walkin let down ya hairr (Down ya hairr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (Right thurr)
Lick ya lips when ya talkin that make me starre (Make me starre)

[Outro: Chingy]
I like that (Uh huh), I like that (Uh huh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, do, what you do</pre>
