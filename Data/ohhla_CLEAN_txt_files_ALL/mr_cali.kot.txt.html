Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We smoke the herb and feel alright
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We gettin' high as a satellite
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We bring the ladies out tonight
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We on the flow and feelin' right

[Verse 1]
Mr. Cali man I need to place an order
I bought a half a B but I need another quarter
Pineapple kush, here's some luke skywalker
Bueberry, silver haze, big island shocker
The smooth rippa, coconut bubbla
The sweet kind of flavor, I don't mean to trouble ya
My people be lovin' ya, the good you be harvesters
Supreme produce, the master of [?]

Mr. Cali man I'm all troubled up
I need the healing tree, yes I need to re-up
I'm twisted and turned, yes I'm all tied in knots
I need this session to help me connect the dots
Get it pumping through my system like an organ that's vital
Mr. Cali man I need a smoke out revival
One hitter quitter, so I can relax
Kick back, nut up, and face facts

[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We smoke the herb and feel alright
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We gettin' high as a satellite
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We bring the ladies out tonight
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We on the flow and feelin' right

[Bridge]
Hola amigo [?]
And we all here to burn one down
In every region, the herb is the reason
For everything, I am so lifted right now

[Verse 2]
(let me hit that joint)
So we be stonin out, let's pack it up, let's get to chillin'
Every flavor in my jar, stack it high to the ceilin'
Feelin' good, like I should, got the fire, I be grillin'
Packin' hash from my stash, through the neighborhood, dealin'
Grab the cash, double dash, and I got the town healin'
Feelin' fresh, smoke a bowl, it's never trash, I be feelin'

I wake up and it's eighty degrees in February
Birds chirpin' smokin' on some blueberry
In flip-flops, shoes and socks not necessary
But, yes, I need my shades to cover up, my eyes are blazed
Mr. Mr. Cali man call me Johnny Richter
King or the quakes, and the blended up rome elixirs
Couldn't states marinate in then you brew a choice
California, the state making the most noise

[Chorus]
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We smoke the herb and feel alright
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We gettin' high as a satellite
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We bring the ladies out tonight
I'm Mr. Cali Cali Cali man
We on the flow and feelin' right

[Hook]
Everybody smoke it up a little bit more,
Pass it on down to me
The flies feelin right when we on the flow
With the smell of the sweet sensi
Everybody smoke it up a little bit more,
Pass it on down to me
The flies feelin right when we on the flow
With the smell of the sweet sensi

[Bridge]
Hola amigo [?]
And we all here to burn one down
In every region, the herb is the reason
For everything, I am so lifted right now</pre>
