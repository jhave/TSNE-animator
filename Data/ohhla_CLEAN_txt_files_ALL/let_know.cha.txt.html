[Intro - Chamillionaire - talking over the Chorus] 
You can just go ahead and put me in the cup homie (haha) 
Ultimate Victory, March 27th 
Kane on the beat (yeah, woo) 
You know I'ma let 'em know baby 
You know what I'm talkin 'bout? 
The world famous, Chamillitary Entertainment 
5 star, 6 star, 7 star General 
Chamillinator baby 
Yeah, back at it, 'bout to take a crack at it (haha) 
Chamillitary mayne 
King Koopa 
 
[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire] 
Felony flow, no misdemeanor 
That streetsweeper gonna make it cleaner 
Show reality out of my cage, spray it until I hit a dream-a 
Think you stoppin me from copin platinum plaques, better switch your scheme up 
I'ma hop out my seat as quick (quick) as every guest on Jerry Springer (woo) 
Y'all always talkin about keep it real (yeah), that's somethin I ain't really got to say 
That's everyday, everyday, "Hustle" like Rick in the MIA 
You know you don't wanna play with the modern day Cassius Clay 
Cause I make hits and those that don't will always rip and pass away 
That means you will RIP, one of these is all I see 
No one got more buzz than me, all I be is bumblebee 
That "Number 1 Spot" that you got's my ho and you in love with her, ain't ya? 
If you see it and you feel like you can take her (take her, take her) 
I, I got up so high that I hit my head on that scraper 
Skyscraper, but my bad (my bad) for tryna stand on top of my paper 
Koopa 'bout to show you how (how), chase this cash, no slowin down (down) 
Then I come through like Colin Powell (Powell) 
With the big blammer, goin (BLOAW) 
 
[Chorus 2 - Rock-D sample] (Chamillionaire) 
Right now nigga let 'em know 
If you came to rep yo set, right now nigga let 'em know (let 'em know) 
If you came to rep yo set, right now nigga let 'em know (let 'em know) 
Right now nigga, let 'em know 
Right now nigga, let 'em know (OH!) 
If it's jail I get for stompin a nigga to sleep, fuck it I go 
 
If you came to rep yo set, right now nigga let 'em know (let 'em know) 
If you came to rep yo set, right now nigga let 'em know (let 'em know) 
Right now nigga, let 'em know (let 'em know) 
Right now nigga, let 'em know (let 'em know, oH!) 
If it's jail I get for stompin a nigga to sleep, fuck it I go 
 
[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire] 
Yeah, only 2 fit up in this Ferrari (woo) 
Baby don't miss the party 
I'ma go head and leave, please hit me on my celly, call me 
My homie got a Harley 
Yeah, Ernest sprayed the body 
We wreck it, will we get another one? The answer's probably 
So bring your partners with you, let me know what y'all is reppin 
I'ma bring protection, no I am not talkin 'bout my weapon 
Even though I have my weapon for anyone who half steppin 
You disrespectin, better be quick when dialin nine eleven 
Somebody better help 'em, Chamillinator's up in here (yeah) 
Mixtape Messiah, Part 2, make haters disappear (yeah) 
Yeah, time is money and it's true that I took out my grill (yeah) 
But I still got a couple decades in my ear (woo) 
Player might fly down to the Chi-Town 
Get on a proper jet and fly right now 
When the album drop, everybody lights out (lights out) 
Haters wanna know, when I put my mic down 
Never, (psyche), the answer's only never for now (now) 
I'm the king of the mixtape scene, hope you ready to bow 
 
[Chorus 2] 
 
[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire] 
Let me let 'em know, let me talk to 'em (yeah) 
I ain't gonna rap on this last verse, I'ma talk on it 
Cause I'm too smart, don't wanna spend a thought on it 
Got everybody starin at the car components 
It look like Voltron with the doors, don't it 
You say I think I'm hard, I say you think too hard 
I think you boys' little mind, what I think you lost 
Engaged to my dough, I never think divorce 
Watch me come through in that sea blue Porsche 
 
[Chorus 2] 
 
(Welcome to the future, the future is here)</pre>
