[KRS-One]
Call me old-school, but
It's all about love (yeah)
If you ain't doin' this for the love
What you doin' it for?
(Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

[KRS-One &amp; Carlet Boseman]
I do it for the (love, baby)
All in the streets we get (love, baby)
Beats like this we just (love, baby)
KRS-One be driving them thugs crazy

I'm not Johnny-come-lately on your station
I takes it back to Zulu Nation
You see what HipHop is facing
How can we sit back and be so complacent?

[Chorus] - 2x
I'm giving you...
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you 
(all my love, baby) You feel it
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you

[KRS-One &amp; Carlet Boseman]
When I'm on tour I spread (love, baby)
The greatest law is (love, baby)
For sure, sex is not (love, baby)
Love is love, have you had a hug lately?

I ain't waitin' for the system to save me
I'm standing up, using what God gave me
Old-school, Kris is no fool
How we gonna organize with no tools?

Man, we gotta do it for the (love, baby)
Respect and more (love, baby)
Less checks and get more (love, baby)
K-R-S One!

[Chorus] - 2x

[KRS-One &amp; Carlet Boseman]
Put down the gun and show (love, baby)
We ain't never gonna grow without (love, baby)
HipHop started with (love, baby)
Not shooting your man with a slug like Janie(?)

We hangin' out up north with Slim Shady
We hangin' out down south with Lil' Wayne
East coast raised me, west coast pays me
This is HipHop, them critics don't phase me

KRS, I know it sounds crazy, but I do this for the (love, baby)
My motivation is (love, baby)
And yes I'm building this HipHop Nation with

[Chorus] - 2x
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you 
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you
(all my love, baby) You feel it

[KRS-One &amp; Carlet Boseman]
This last verse goes out with (love, baby)
Thanks for the years and that (love, baby)
KRS-One gets (love, baby)
Duane "Da Rock" this beat is crazy!

[Chorus] - 2x
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you 
(all my love, baby) I'm giving you
(all my love, baby) You feel it

Boogie Down (love, baby)
Productions (love, baby)
