[S] So what's it gon' be? Women, whiskey, weed
[J] Dope, coke, or all the guns you need, nigga
[S] You could get them thangs for a lesser fee
[J] Yeah and with the right amount of pressure, them thangs look free
[S] I'm on my way now, desperate need of a lick indeed
[J] Believe I got a vick if it's a brick you need
[S] My nigga for sheez
[J] Right back at you, holla after you land we get it before you leave
[S] Is you for sure? Them niggas out there still got cheese
Cuz my niggas in the drop bounced back to slangin OZ's
[J] Man them niggas rapin the town without breakin 'em down
Them bastards makin a killin slangin half of buldings
[S] For real man, I'm on my last nine thousand
Aint got no money, I'm fightin cases with this ho money

[Jay-Z]
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

[S] I caught a northwest flight to NY, on the buddy pass
Sittin at the exit row, by the do'
[J] I got a hoopty from this doofy nigga around the way
I had the fo'fo' under the rug, weekend ago
[S] Three hours, I landed in the city of dreams
With tall buildings, flooded with cabs and limousines
Where the fuck is Jay-Z
[J] God damn traffic is gettin on my nerve
I see your face by the curb
[S] Goddamn dog I been sittin here thirty minutes
[J] You know these motherfucking cab drivers
Like they own this motherfucker
[S] Open the trunk
[S] And then I'm thinkin, Jigga let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
[J] Well if it's a money thing let's get this motherfucking money man
[S] And then I said to Jigga, let's get this motherfucking cash nigga
[J] I got a dope house scoped out
[S] An escape route?
[J] No doubt; let's hit the highway, load up, lock
[S] Let's do this shit
[J] Hold up, cops
[S] Trippin, it's eight million stories in this naked motherfucker
[J] Yeah, and ten million undercovers
We gon' get this raw, we gon' kick in the door
They got guns in the couch, they got shit in the floor
[S] Niggas is gon' shit they drawers
[J] They got a bitch at the door
[S] Bullshit, heard that stupid shit before

[Jay-Z]
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house
And when the money get low and the hungriness show
Niggas better get the fuck out the house

[J] I hit the buzzer, Mita, Manny
Let me up it's Joey motherfucker
[S] Takin the steps up with only one thing on our mind
Wipe this motherfucker clean, everybody gotta die
[J] Up the steps, got closer
The voices got louder, you hear it?
Death's approaching we comin for that powder
[S] Then I knocked four times, I hit the hoe wit clear polish
Well she couldn't see shit, now what's it gonna be bitch?
