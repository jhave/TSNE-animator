He don't aske for nothin, he blast for somethin, yeah
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Five fly high to the sky
Let it off homie yeah
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
All by your lonely
If you have to call me lil' blast master, KIS
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Cus I'm criminal minded
Blinded, by sonic booms
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Clear the room
Hashies clouds like mushroom
This is it...(smoke)
Spit fire, never retire
High heat for higher
The whole repetouir
Even though I don't wanna be, I'm a star
Touchin on Moon and Mars
Fuck the cars
Diamonds, they don't excite me
Feuds ignite me
Fire fight me it's on
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Don't say shit about Eminem or Snoop or Dre
Fell the fire this way, yeah
Ya got somethin to say about me say it
Cus I'm squattin this shit between me and DMX muthafucka
Fuck y'all niggas, All y'all niggas
Bounce or get bust on
Blid, The homies'll rush on 'em
Drop of a dime, So get the fuck on
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)

[Hook]
Pull ya slates in 'fo we go post up at the Bates Inn, suckas
(See we just don't give a fuck)
Eminem got a message to spread "Feel the force of the desert dust"
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Penitentiary chances is a must
And in God we trust
So pop back, or you pop that
Stop and drop that
I'm in the front where the actions at for your soft cats
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)

[Kurupt]
Handle it
Most of these sideline bustas skanless
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Terrorist, mount-a-mode nigga like Mount Everest
(See we just don't give a fuck)
Keep away major
Fuck a cell phone catch me on my two way pager
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
Fuck y'all niggas
The Gold Par niggas, Sawed off y'all niggas
Catch me, niggas tryin to stretch me
Like elastic to get wrapped like plastic, Teflons
Dome from my right palm, a niggas gone
Fuckin with the thunder dome's on
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)

Cus I'm criminal minded
Blinded, by the science
Metaphysical alliance
Subliminal, intricate in a dome alliance
It's all in the mind ?matrictional? defiance
Make a nigga malfunction like an appliance
Systems fryin

Keep on, keep it on, nigga keep on tryin
(Cus we just don't give a fuck)
