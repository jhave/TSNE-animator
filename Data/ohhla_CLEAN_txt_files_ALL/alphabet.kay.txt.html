[Intro: DJ KaySlay]
Aiyyo it's DJ KaySlay the Drama King
And for those of y'all that don't know
I'm workin with a new artist, he goes by the name of Papoose
And for those of y'all that didn't finish school
Check this out, it's all good
I'ma run y'all through this little Thug-acation right now
And what we gon' do, is we gon' scream out the letters in the alphabet
And every letter you hear screamed out, from A to Z
My man Papoose gon' break it down for you
So what you do, is get your pens, your pads, and take notes
Yo Papoose, let's go!

[Papoose]
(A!) Alert, assassins at large allegedly
Automatic artillery, angrily aimed and aggressively
Accurate AK's angled all ways
Adversary afraid as active ammunition abraise
Accumulated an alias after arrested
Accompanied armed accessory, as an adolescent
(B!) Bridge Benz brolic burner bringin brothers
Betrayer's bodies briefly be body banged bleedin brothers
Blades blastin brave bashin Brooklyn bullet busters
Big biscuits barrels blazin beheadin bitch boasts and bluffers
Borough barricaders beat bringers brutally blast
Bringin blood baths (C!) cover cowards corners collectin cash
Confirmed convicts committin crimes clappin cats
Creepin cashiers causin characters comas, cappin crabs
Chaos causin, clearly commandin Cee-Lo
Cocaine capsule caps colored, capturin customer's C-Notes
Confiscatin combinatin, countin cream capulatin
Cockin calibur chromes creatin casualties compensatin
(D!) Dominatin devoted dealer devastatin

Definitely dividin double-digit dollar dividends
Drama declarin demolishin domain dozer
Directin dumb-dumbs doin dummies dirty disarmin Dojos
(E!) Estimatin earnings enlarged and economically
Equally educatin each exercisin equality
Eliminatin, expirin enemies eradicatin
Erasin evidence every element evacuatin
(F!) Fake fraud faggots frontin for fame fleein from flames
Firin full-fledged four-fours forcin flesh from frames
Fortune fanatic, follow formats for funds faithfully
Fuck five felonies, furiously fightin for freedom fatally
Frigidy, frantic fightin Feds feelin fearful
Finacially fortunate, flippin figures from fifty-fifty
(G!) Gambles gatherin grants, grabbin gauges, gangsta ganks geeks
Gettin green, Guess garments gleamin, greatly gainin G's
Ghetto genius, genuine gestures gracefully guide
Government generals gradually generatin genocide
(H!) Head hoodlum, hittin heads heavenly, hypnotizin

Helicopter hijackin holdin hostages, horrifyin

(N!) Naturally negative, Notorious, Naughty Nature
Nasty New York nigga narcotic negotiator
(O!) Observator, oppression obstructin originator

(Q!) Quote  "Queen's qualifyed quantity quality"
(R!) Rulers rule righteously rightfully royal rapology
Real revolutionaries rather regulate rivalry
Rampantly raisin raiders rampagin relentless rivalry

[Interlude: DJ KaySlay]
Hold on hold on

A to Z, now we 'bout to flip it backwards, Z to A
Yo Papoose, get at these niggaz man, let's go!

[Papoose]
(Z!) Zig-zag zigs involved weighin Zambian Zaires
Zodiac zone and Zulu's, Zion's zap a zillion zillionaires
(Y!) Yo you yeah, yesterday's youth yearnin your yen

(X!) X-rated, ex-African, X-Man
Ex-leaders, ex-Clarence, X Malcolm, X-Clan
(W!) We want war, World War, world-wide warnin

[Outro: DJ KaySlay  over last two lines]
Hold up hold up, yo I'm just playin
Yo chill, yo chill chill chill man, chill man
