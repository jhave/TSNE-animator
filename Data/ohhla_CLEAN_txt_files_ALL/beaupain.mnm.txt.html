[Intro: Eminem] + (Sia)
I can feel the heat risin, everything is on fire
Today's a painful reminder, of whyyyyy (of whyyyyy)
We can only get brighter, the further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside (I'm on the inside)
Lookin out cause

[Chorus 2X: Sia]
(I'm) Standin in the flaaaaames
And it's a beautiful kind of pain
Settin fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the mournin process
and rebuildin, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poke its eye out with the thorn bush that ya
used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is
stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas ped-
-al and hit the corner fast, the
more assertive never lookin back may hit the curb but every day's a new learning curve as ya
steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have ta
to avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ash-
-es and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gas-
-oline and while you're burnin the past, stand in that inferno and chant

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
You're so familiarized with what havin to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin
It begins, to seep in, that's the only thing keepin
you from leapin, off the mother-freakin, deep end!
And I'm pullin for you to push through this feelin
And with a little time that should do the healin
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willin to forgive 'em
even after all that shit you've been put through, this feelin of resilience is buildin
And the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fire-proof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin
You look down cause you're so over 'em, you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling!
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remainin the same
But tomorrow today's goin down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief, as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watchin the walls melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin hell!
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream

[Chorus]

[Sia]
I, feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I, have learned, from fighting fights that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly!
And

[Chorus]
