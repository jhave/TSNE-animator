[Sara]
In my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, in my life
In my life, in my life, in my life
Welcome, welcome

Life is what you make it

[VERSE 1] {Ness}
Hit the bricks chicks like, 'Damn where you been Lloyd''
Locked up with a bad case of hemorrhoids
Writin' and fightin' triflin' rhymes about the
Life and the times of niggaz on the grind
White collar criminals climb the corporate ladder
While niggaz like me gotta sell coke and crack
It's riskin' my freedom, boxed up missin' the season
It's a setup'hypothetically speakin'
Even my pop was knocked over tickets for speedin'
Drinkin' and drivin' and I ain't forget, he think I forgot 'em
Mom got gray hairs from worryin' sick
And my sister got a house now, pushin' a stick
Just a little somethin' to get 'em from A to B
I got nowhere to go come and stay wit me
Wit a niece and a nephew that love me to death
My little brother Nick, I guess he lovin' what's left

[CHORUS] (Sara)
(In my life)
Life is what you make it
Though it may sound basic (In my life)
Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)
Though we must build up
The strength to carry on
Welcome to my world (Welcome, welcome)

[VERSE 2] {Freddrick}
I remember one mornin' I was cookin' the O
And out the blue I heard a knock at the do'
I looked through the peephole and it's a fiend and he needed some coke
And at the time I really needed his dough, but I know the rules
You never sell crack where ya rest at
'Cuz haters send shells where ya chest at
But in my case them muthafuckas sent shells where my vest at
Found out I ain't dead, give them a place to rest at
I found out 'bout they spot, had to go and X that
My eyes redder than Cyclops, call me the X-Man
I thank God just for every blessin'
Though the roads got tough thanks for every lesson
I carry loads at times even though it gets stressin'
I remember stickin' the clip in, cockin' and second guessin'
I couldn't stand the rain I'm the 'New Edition'
The fast lane had me layin' in the coop wit pigeons in my life

[CHORUS] (Sara)
(In my life)
Life is what you make it
Though it may sound basic (In my life)
Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)
Though we must build up
The strength to carry on
Welcome to my world (Welcome, welcome)

[VERSE 3] {Babs} (Sara)
Hotheads and high school dropouts
Little girls wit they stomachs popped out, I seen it all
Niggaz stretched out by the corner store
Life no more, dough seem small--I'm gettin' focused
In the crib writin' rhymes while I'm smokin'
While niggaz on the block totin' I see 'em later
My moms make paper but cheap wit her cash
Ask for a pair of kicks she tell me ask my dad (Ask ya dad)
So I'd rather hit the Ave and knock off work
The 100 pack in the pocket of my Guess Jeans skirt
Meanwhile still tryna get a deal on the side
Battle bitches outside in front of Kennedy Drive
A lotta niggaz wanna see me shine
But I still got the lames laggin' behind, hatin' on mine'it's nothin'
I'ma get to the top regardless
Got love for female rappers but think I'm the hardest
In my life

[CHORUS 2x] (Sara)
(In my life)
Life is what you make it
Though it may sound basic (In my life)
Goin' through some bad times
But be thankful for the good times, yeah (In my life)
Though we must build up
The strength to carry on
Welcome to my world (Welcome, welcome)

[REPEAT TILL FADE] {Sara}
(In my life, In my life, In my life)
