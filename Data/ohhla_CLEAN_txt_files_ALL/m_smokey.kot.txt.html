Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Imma just try and do this beat
To the best of my ability
It ain't gonna sound great
But just bear wit me

Oh Mrs. Smokey
She's so smokey
I think I love her
I think she loves me

Just wanna hold you
Wanna roll you
I know you like it
When I light it

Oh Mrs. Smokey
She's so smokey
I wanna smoke you
When I'm lonely
You're my only
My one and only
My Little Miss Smokey
Miss Smokey
Oh Mrs. Smoooookey

Oh Mrs Smokey (Mrs. Smokey)
She's so smokey (she's so smokey)
I think I love her (think I love her)
I think she loves me (think she loves me)

Just wanna hold you (wanna hold you)
Wanna roll you (wanna roll you)
I know you like it (know you like it)
When I light it (when I light it)

Mrs. Smokey

Oh Mrs. Smokey

I wanna smoke you
When I'm lonely
You're my only
