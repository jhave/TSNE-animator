[Intro: Cappadonna]
Never seen nothing like that...
She got a body like.... whatever
Might have to just, try to like slip her my number
In her pocket, like, bump into her
Like I'm trying to pick-pocket her
Diggiler, huh

[Cappadonna]
Beautiful black woman, red, yellow and white women
I got the right woman, some niggas fight women
I build foundations up, and I invite women
I entice women, I love nice women
That's gentle and kind, yo, I stimulate her mind
And she stimulate mine, until she real freaky
Women that love sex get real sneaky
She had me crying when she crushed me, I should of known
When she was with that nigga Jay, and she was fucking with me
Never sold pussy to me, I was fucking her free
Taking her garbage out for her, and sucking her feet
Slobbing her down, hold her by her waistline while I'm crushing her cheeks
When I'm done, I wipe her down and massage her physique
My ghetto princess, ain't nothing sweet
She straight lied in my face, yo, this one is for keeps
Called police on me, plus she be fucking my peeps
What kinda nigga want a bitch that cheat?

[Chorus 2X: Born Divine]
If you don't stop, with the games you play
Girl, somebody's going to get played
And it might be you... and it might be you...

[Born Divine]
One day, lady love caught me, tried to extort me
For my heart and every peace of property
Yeah, she necessary, but secondary to my garden nature
She keeps her pussy like a soultaker
Sexy fly black diva, with connect like genova
Connections, my murial extensions, lights on in the Ac'
Hoop' dog, not tinted, but I'm all up in it
Sweating hard like a race for the senate
She said she love my long verse with the hook in it
To hit, marvelous, and she got hard when I spit
Realest shit, not a trick
Or your, average chick, she on her time
Nine to five school, slow grind, no money
And she never mind, she put in work for the kid
That understand how I live, never sweating for time
Plus she got her own crib, you little devious thing
That came from my rib, you even got a man at home
Laying up, in your bid, paying your bills
Cuz you all up in this here, like some whisper it's Shaton
You all up in this here, and I dare you
To spit and tell the day that I raised the dead
I bring the truth to life, girl, you like a best friend
But you somebody wife, we gotta stop
So this the last time tonight, so meet me at our spot
So we can get it on, cuz a mountain to mourn
When I hit to dawn, your boy Born

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
