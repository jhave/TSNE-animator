[U-God]
Yo, Inspectah Deck track 
break your back Yo
  
A message of a wreckage
50 shell hot track leaking out the Lexus
Eyes hot, Cyclops, cyborg boulders
Call shop of horrors, Lyric just smoking in my holster 
Whip and boil, ?lugotan? hurricane the holler
Daily operation, bullet train tingle farther
8 seconds a scar your style wild buccaneer
Round table revolve around ten musketeer
Think you, got all the riches
Think you poli with bitches
You could run the fuck opponent, gotten with the glitches
The swiftness, hit the spots that are vital
Shake the ground decent, like 3 sticks of dyno
  
[Lethaface]
My administration deceive the population
Start the next generation by artificial insemination
Contaminate stations, for music in the making
Concentration camps, Assassinate for industry domination
Abomination, The Competition and confrontation you mistaken
I'm a nuclear warhead bomb evasion
Extermination of the next man, when the Germans blazing
We burn this for occasions, regardless I see your expiration
Preparation your sweatin, 
I cassette deck and eject your selection for air time
Blow a hole through your brain so you can think with a clear mind
A redesign? of hard rhyme, and slang cracking in spare time
  
[U-God]
Crime Time
We rollin with the undisputed, routin toutin
21 gun solutin, new recruiting
Wu-Tang, slang bang your unit
Put us in your cassette deck, yo, improvement
Smash and blast the shit, I'm doper than math
That makes you level through the devil 
And never surpass
The stakes is hot, like bullet snatch pots 
And hot twats
Fully operational gats mmhmm
The uncanny, vilagialaty panty man
Crock, took by the hook of the candy man
Look, now you caught up in the suction
Rap Tight and my appetite destruction
  
[Lethaface]
Today's day, The bomb gets dropped on America
Human civilization in concert treble concentration camps
Replacement amps blown, Speaker abduction
The Mad weed seduction corruption
From The brain cells decreasing
Its sucker duck season. fuck treason
Blast as you trespass, bullet enters your mouth and exits your ass
Impregnate the math, then give birth to a newborn
Figure of speech drew form, with 8 arms
Napalms, collapses stages you perform on dominate
Drama face, abominate, sling crack behind the black high gate
The nine fades the hearts of men
Slip the cartridge in
Off the hook like telemarketing sales condone over the phone
  
[U-God]
Danger zone
Bozzy Capone alone, in a terradome Stalon
With a great cannon, bones cerebral swollen
Straight both ways scanning
All you roaches lay down I spray the brain damage
Bring the banners, the green gamma ray
Gain up the same data, Scatter
Then a dark part where D and you used to play all day
The ray sound stung you, You kung fu check the cleaner
From fire line I gun you for fun
Dial 9-1-1
Someone tore down the tunnel son
1-2 Check your fronts
Captain Crunch, munch on you for lunch
You punchbag drunk, bald headed monk
Top bunk, chunk your trunk full of junk
Buffer and bump stop humping me
Ruff a scum sucking muthafuckas,
Ducking my shit just luckily
  
[Chorus] 
Other emcees made a big mistake
Fronting on the mic that's truly great
What? how you want it fried or baked
I place in right through the heart of a snake
Sceam at mapps, take what we can take
Til the day we die, meet the pearly gates
Golden Arms going strong, I'm holding weight 
'Cause
