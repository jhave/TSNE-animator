[ *guy mocking Bushwick Bill* ]
You know that little short muthafuckin Bushwick?
Shit, he so goddamn short,
he had to get a runnin start and jump up on the commode to take a shit.
He can't even piss - he can't even piss without runnin all the way back,
squeezin his little dick!
He went to the movie, they was gonna let him in the movie free,
but he had razorbumps, short muthafucka!
I was gonna give him a ride in my goddamn car,
but I forgot my car seat!
Little nasty muthafucka, you know what I'm sayin?
This some old bitch..
(Yo, there he is right now)
(Yo what's up, Bushwick?)
[ Bushwick Bill ]
Cock this
( *shots* )

[ VERSE 1 ]
Bushwick Bill is on the goddamn hunt with a 12-guage pump
Sendin muthafuckas to the dump
The nigga killa, known to slam a hoe
Finger on the trigger, lettin the hammer go
Boom-boom, back up while I'm gettin hype, bitch
Cause you ain't ready for an ass-whippin like this
I'm on a killing spree, lettin muthafuckas see
Me and the G.B. steady makin history
Some crazy niggas out of Houston goin platinum
Send up a gang of muthafuckas, watch me gat one
Bar a bitch cause he's bigger, how the fuck you figure
I thought you knew this was a goddamn slaughter, nigga
I'm sendin sons of bitches to the pavement
And the shit won't stop until I say when
One by one they hit the muthafuckin ground, see
Call it what you want, nigga, yeah, but you can callme crazy

[ (crowd chanting), Bushwick Bill ]
(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
I thought you know, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
Ha, I thought you knew
(That nigga's crazy)
Yeah, I thought you knew, nigga
(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
Ha-ha, muthafuckas, ha-ha
(That nigga's crazy)
I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
I thought you muthafuckas knew

[ VERSE 2 ]
1-2, 1-2, every muthafucka hit the deck
Bushwick is back and I ain't what you expect
5th Ward, born to be a bonafide player
A order-disobeyer, neighborhood bitch-slayer
Settin shit straight, 9mm to the dome
Any nigga wanna feel this chrome, bring his ass on
And I'ma let him know what's happenin
If the nigga keeps on trippin I'ma keep on cappin
Dig it, till every muthafucka falls flat
Lyin in a crate on their muthafuckin back
Cause I'm collectin bodies like a muthafuckin morticianist
Bustin nuts in hoes, so you don't wanna get your bitch in this
Shoot em up, bang-bang, watch em hit the canvas
That's they way I plan this, niggas can't stand this
So make room for the 5th Ward devil
Yeah, see, I'm a rebel, doin shit on that other level
My mind is like a muthafuckin maze, gee
Phase after goddamn phase, but you can call me crazy

(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
I thought you knew
(That nigga's crazy)
I thought you muthafuckas knew, ho-ho
(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew
(That nigga's crazy)
Aw shit

[ VERSE 3 ]
Line a bunch of muthafuckas up and watch em hit the deck
I'm puttin bitches and niggas in check, causin fuckin wreck
Bushwick Bill, I'm far from a rookie, hoe
A maniac, rollin mark-ass niggas out like cookie dough
Hoes got blowed up, competition slowed up
Shit just ain't never been the same since I've showed up
I'm a loner, renegade loser
Filled with confusion, young nigga doin em
There ain't nobody safe when I'm on the streets
I'm the hardest muthafucka you can find on the 5 beat
Bustin caps in gust, bustin nuts and bust
Niggas gon' hit the dust fuckin around with us
Yeah, I'm leavin muthafuckas in a daze, gee
Call it what you want, nigga, yeah, but you can call me crazy

(Why you wanna fuck with Bushwick, you know he's crazy)
Ha! I thought you knew, nigga
(That nigga's crazy)
( *singing continues until end* )
Ho-ho-ho, I thought you knew, nigga
I thought you knew, nigga
Ha!
Ha-ha!
I thought you knew, nigga
Had to wake that ass up, I thought you knew, huh?
Yeah, talk that shit now, nigga, I thought you knew
Haaa!
Yo!
I thought this muthafucka knew
I hope all you muthafuckas know now
Cause I thought this nigga knew, hah?
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about
Yeah!
Do you muthafuckas know?
Cause I'm talkin to you, do you know, huh?
What the fuck's wrong with you, stupid fuck
I thought you knew, hah?
( *speaks Spanish* )...carramba
I tell you somethin right now
I tell you somethin right now
I thought you knew, muthafucka
Yeah!
Ask Mica-Mica, she'll tell you</pre>
