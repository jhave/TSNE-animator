It's my life I'm a do what it do and if you don't like it I'ts cool fuck you

Can't nothing hold me down I'm going to touch the sky (Ooo-ooo)
Can't nothing no, hold me down
(Oo-oo-oo)
Can't nothing no, hold me down (Ooo-oo-oo)
Can't nothing no, hold me down (Ooo-oo-oo)
Now watch me now watch me watch me shut this thang

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras

I hit the jackpot check, check, check, check, check, check, ching

Real chicos do real things on the road to
Get diamond rings
Moved up from the streets graduated hustla on it's way to an entrepreneur undefeated double shooter

Now baby save me from the game before replacement my life's a movie, call me Martin Scorsese

I couldn't care less if you love me or hate me life's a bitch now fuck you pay me

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tra

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras

(Ooo-ooo)

Baby I know how to flyy (flyyy)
(Haa-aa)
Can't nothing hold me down
I'm gonna touch the sky (skyy)

Lose my mind now honey now pay me what you owe me my mens a hurricane you should see the way she glow it

Now baby save me from the game before replacement

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras

Sube sube, hasta la nube
Pa delante-lante
No mires pa tras
