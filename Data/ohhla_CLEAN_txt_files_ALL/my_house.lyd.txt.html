[Intro: Lloyd Banks] (50 Cent)
People! Your boy Banks is back! And this is a Timbaland track!
WOO OOOH!!!!
This is my house (I'll house you) bitch I run this (Girl I'll house you)
This is my house (I'll house you, you in my house now)

[Chorus] Lloyd Banks] (50 Cent)
This is my house you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house under my roof you follow my rules
This is my house (Put ya hands up! Put ya put ya put ya put ya put ya hands up!)
This is my house (I'll house you, girl you in my house now)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Hey, your under my roof, so take off your coat, your hat and funny boots
I can't tell you they names, I just know they loose
Prefer mix the Cranberry and the Goose
A little Armor and that's at least a hundred proof
Now shorty's eyes wide from the Bentley and the Coupes
She can't stop stealin so she trippin off the stoop
And I'm a beware of mine no tellin the truth
Let's run a menage trois and hit the booth
I got a big pool and a room full of bathing suits
See y'all can go swim, while I get in
I'll show you how to make a million dollars with a pen
I drink champagne and pop bottles when I spin
I can't complain a top model's in the Benz
Her wheels is shinnin like it's diamonds in the rims
Just gimme a day or two I'm climbin in her friends
I do what I do cause

[Chorus] Lloyd Banks] (50 Cent)
This is my house you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house under my roof you follow my rules
This is my house (Put ya hands up! Put ya put ya put ya put ya put ya hands up!)
This is my house (I'll house you, girl you in my house now)

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Hey! Watch how you speak
Cause I don't slip or squeak I got the heat
If you get outta line, you'll be in the street
Ambulance man tryin to cover up the leak
And nobody to care if they get you in a week
I rather go there split a swisher with a freak
And get a lap dance while I listen to the beat
She's a beauty and petite I can lift her off her feet
If she gets in a spur, we don't fuck in hur
I'm iced out so she don't see nothin but a blur
Becareful where you rub don't get nothin on the fur
You know we got them things so the drama don't occur
You front cause you drunk, yo' ass gettin jumped
I'm high off the funk, dro, hash and the skunk
Don't make them niggaz dump yo' ass in the trunk
They remembers a black mask and a pump
Them niggaz should have told you

[Chorus] Lloyd Banks] (50 Cent)
This is my house you 'gon do what I tell you to do
When your in my house under my roof you follow my rules
This is my house (Put ya hands up! Put ya put ya put ya put ya put ya hands up!)
This is my house (I'll house you, girl you in my house now)</pre>
