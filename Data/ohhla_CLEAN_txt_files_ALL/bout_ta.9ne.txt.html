Typed by: AlexApprobation@aol.com

Dedicated to all the DJ's all over the world, man

(One for the treble, two for the bass
Come on Techa Nina, let's rock this place)

Tech's in the place, everybody get main-ee
Punks betta cuff yo' lady, can't nobody tame me
Blame me. For keepin' her runny eyed rainy
Ladies used to hate me, now they comin' out they pay-nees
Girls on the jock (check), pocket full of socks (check)
Got fat knots (check), somethin' gone squat (yeah)
Down, puttin' it down, down for the block?
Tryin' to be hot, but you flop
When you shot to the top but you not... DAMN!!!
I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream. Hit the stage, everybody holla
Gettin' throwed, stripper shows throw away a dolla
Father, I don't want to leave nobody too blessed
Cause they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You fixin' to see me in the TV with a few guest
We bout to bubble baby, get ya waterproof vest

[Hook]
Bout ta' Bubble [6x]

Bout ta' Bubble, Baby [3x]
We got'cha lady

We drinkin' and smokin' and humpin' and likin' it [2x]

Yo, get ya ID, passport, state skippin
All around the world, busy with the bass hittin'
We ain't come for bustin' heads, yea we hate trippin'
When we through rockin' the shows, man we chase kittens
J's on my feet, car full of beat
Trunk full of heat, Caribou in the seat
Frown, you can make a song. Clown in the street
Gimme the beat and we leakin'
No mercy for the haters that weep
On to the next, Minnesota to the Netherlands
Veterans, caravans, gettin' chedder, man
Round the world in a day, off in LA
Oklahoma, Dallas, Kansas City to the Bay
Everybody hifey, the South really like me
Ill Bill got it where the East Coast invite me
Tech's in the air when the mood really strikes me
Hey, we bout to bubble, so imbedded in your psyche

[Hook]

Hey, B-boys hit the flo' wit it
Off in Jamaica let me see ya heel toe wit it
Clown and crunk wit it, A-Town stomp wit it
At the set, jugglettes make they double D's jump to this
House on the hill (check), hella tip drills (check)
Paul Wall said he'd do me up a red grill (yeah)
Busta Bus circlin' the 5-6 'ville (yes)
Forty water, he told me a lot in this business for real
Stormin'. In Salt Lake City performin' for Mormans
Out of they garments before the mornin', I'm charmin'
Leavin' 'em torn, mess with the bull you get the horns
Nina gets with a beauty best, it's armin'
Misery's behind me, labels tryin' to sign me
Ain't too many who don't know just who the Tech N9ne be
Is she lookin' for somethin' with a future so shiny?
Kansas City, Missouri is where she gone find me
