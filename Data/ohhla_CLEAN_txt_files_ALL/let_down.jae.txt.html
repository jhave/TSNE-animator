Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Beautiful music for a beautiful woman

[Chorus]
She make me wanna let the top down
She make me wanna let the top down

[Verse 1]
Beautiful day, you're even beautifuller
Don't know if that's a word, if not I made it up for ya
Real nigga but I can't fight the feeling no
Bad enough to be wifey but we just chillin though
No labels on nothing
I'm lying, we got labels on buttons
2 C's on yours, 2 G's on mine
You on key if I lose it all, you believe in my grind
Yea, fly girl with your own
You respect I rap but you respect more that I'm grown
When I'm out my 2-3 you get me in my zone
Love hurts and I only know what I've been shown but damn

[Chorus]
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down

[Verse 2]
You make me wanna go to elegant dinner out
Step in the closet and pull something linen out
Aviators with the champagne tint on em
I can't school you the designers cause you been on em
Baby that's just what I like
That's just what a nigga like me need in his life
When it's time to hit the road you don't flip or get tight
Just tack my doubles and pray God keep me alright
You pray He keep me safe, so I could make it back
So you could see my face and we can just relax
Nothing real mean just long as we together
She keep it real like moms and watch the Knicks like the fellas
And since I met er

[Chorus]
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down

We could take a ride anywhere
Long as the wind blow through your hair
We could take a ride anywhere
Long as the wind blow through your hair

Put your hand in the air, do your thing girl
Do your thing girl
Put your hand in the air, do your thing girl
Do your thing girl

[Verse 3]
Let's get our cruise on, put something smooth on
Carl Thomas first album, something cool on
I'm in a good golf shirt, I got my trues on
Pocket full of green but I got Chanelle blue on
You make me wanna work you out like a stairmaster
I get elevated when I stare at ya
When you down yea I worry but that's the key factor
And I'm a extra low key kind of nigga
But when I'm with er

[Chorus]
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down

We could take a ride anywhere
Long as the wind blow through your hair
We could take a ride anywhere
Long as the wind blow through your hair

[Chorus]
She make me wanna let the top down
Baby, you make me wanna let the top down
She make me wanna let the top down</pre>
