[Chorus 2x]
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

[Verse 1]
Girl I feel the way you love me, hold me at night and hug me
You got the phone from my pocket to beep me and bug me
Forget the do rag, I ain't no thug, gee, I'm more bugged gee
Sleep in the bathtub, get rid of the waterbed
Move your thongs out to the side
Forget the the room, hotel lobby, I bone on the rug, gee
Reset the tripod, filming women like Rocco
Putting their hands between their legs, with ecstasy
I feed the girls like cats, Purina to go
Here's your bowl, they always jump out the shower
Doggystyle on the couch, with their heads shedding on my pants
Rubbing next to me, you pay me, I'll pull out a ??? gee
You changed up on me, now you gotta pee

[Chorus 2x]
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

[Verse 2]
Trojans in the green pack, you lay on the kitchen table
And lean back, fruit cocktail and pancakes syrup
Flow down your butt crack, ice-cream around your pelvis
You're a star, baby, buy a ticket from New York
You wanna meet guys like me, directors in Hollywood, you wanna sell this
Win awards in Vegas, slide your g-strings off
You're wit' the top film makers, mid-town traffic
I'm meeting with Black Tail, you're talking to fakers
I own a factory, my workers are thong makers
Black woman with Carribean shakers
I've been doin this since Time Square Arcades had Space Invaders
Removing your panties off slow on Penn Station escalators
I love lesbians, they're not haters
Hunny, you graduated to booty shorts
Hands around the missal, you made it to the majors
Pick a condom, cherry, strawberry, blue-berry
I got all flavors (I got all the flavors...)

[Chorus 2x]
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby

[Verse 3]
You make the appetizers, I'ma re-connect the DVDs
The television is clear, Ghetto Booty in progress
Adjust the atennas, hunny, no need for cable
I fix the triple X wires, don't lie if you're on your time of the month
You don't have to rush, cause internal problems can hold
I don't want the room to smell like car tires, I'm sipping Stolichnayas
Butterscotch, soaking your g-spot area from Breyer's
Don't fool yourself with the toys under your bed  - you're deniers
No time to hurt you, they're looking for screamers, I'm looking for cryers
Admire your bed sheet you're on
Careful planning, the one I need to teach you on
No regular movie, I rather watch porn

[Chorus 2x]
Freaks get naked, freaks get naked
Freaks get naked baby, freaks get naked baby</pre>
