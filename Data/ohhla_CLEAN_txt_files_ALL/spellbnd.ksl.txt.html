[Verse One]
Hey - what I'm about to say
May hit a lot of people in a real strange way
Some - said I should've spelled this a long time ago
but I stayed amateur while others turned pro
P-R-O now I'ma throw - letters in my word
So I can make a Spellbound flow
Read it slow, see how it S-O-U-N-D sounds
K S-O-L-O Spellbound!

[Verse Two]
First I'd like to say I'm the K-E-V-I-N
My last name is M-A-D-I-S-O-N
And when I R-A-P they call me K S-O-L-O
My rhymes are heavy like a rock, so I'ma throw them like a bolo
Rhymes are def, beats are hittin' it's workin'
The alphabet's in the coffee pot to keep the spellin' perkin
I S-P-E-L-L very W-E-L-L
I only spell so all can T-E-L-L
Rhymes I got or write will S-E-L-L
For rappers who don't believe me go to H-E-L-L
Rhymes I write are made by M-E
Turn the M around and it spells W-E
We K-I-C kicked the B-E-A-T on the S-T-R-E-E-T
No one got rhymes like T-H-E-S-E
These rhymes you can R-E-A-D
Read! See how it sounds - My fundamentals are spellin'
And K S-O-L-O Spellbound!

[Verse Three]
I'm not a G-A-M-E to say the S-A-M-E
R-A-P-P-E-R whose style's O-L-D
I'm N-E-W for Y-O-U
Any C-R-E-W paralyzin' vowels
A-E-I-O-U nothin'- you're frontin' - and rappers almost Q...
U-I-C-K to T-A-L-K
some are real quick to W-A-L-K
You can S-A-Y say what you M-A-Y
When I spell or write a rhyme I won't P-L-A-Y
Play around when it's time to get down
Read it slow when K S-O-L-O is Spellbound!

[Verse Four]
Oh yeah, I must drop this line
For MC's who try to spell or put spellin' in the rhyme
They can't get it - I'm the B-E-S-T best
Spellbound got a hundred while you failed the T-E-S-T test
Next time try things I didn't spell
Verbs and nouns, action words and adjectives
Add it together and ask R how it sounds
And maybe a rapper out there could be spellbound
But for now I'm the S-P-E-L-L  K-I-N-G
And this song I  S-I-N-G
And thanks to E-P-M-D, I-M  O-U-T-T-A  H-E-R-E
Spellbound!
