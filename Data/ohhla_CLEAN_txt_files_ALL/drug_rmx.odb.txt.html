[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Kids, don't get high
Mothafuckas had me up in this mothafucka, last night and shit
I'm cocained the fuck up
Paranoid as a motha.. yo I'm paranoid as a fucka
Yeah, fuck that.. yo I fuck around and shit
I sprained both of my fuckin' fingers
This shit.. man a nigga need to get.. I'm tired of gettin' high like that
Ain't nobody came in my mothafuckin' school with no mothafuckin' drugs
Stop fuckin' wit me niggas, stop fuckin' wit me
Nigga, that shits all in my family, nigga
Stop fuckin' wit me, the fuck is you talkin' bout?
On the strength, what the fuck is you talkin' bout?
We've been here too many years to stop fuckin' wit me

Nigga I'm scared of the trigga
While I'm the life giver and the life taker
I'm your father-in-law, married to mother-in-law
Got the universe movin' in the form of the sea-saw
You killed 2Pac and Biggie, you know they was rollin' wit me
You paid for your stupidity
You can't do nothin' to me! I let your fuckin' eagle fly free
Nigga, I'm pioneerin' all the sound ya hearin'
Earth from steerin', high mountaineerin'
I sincerely fuck you up severly by the yearly
Keep the sky clearly
I'm straight from the seventies
Mockneck colors wit ya bitch ass disappearance
Give me clearance, I don't want no fuckin' interference!
I'm the Big Black Jesus!

Throw ya hands in the air! And wave 'em, fuckin' Wu don't care!
And if ya +'Bout It, 'Bout It+
Like we're +'Bout It, 'Bout It+, let me hear ya say, "Oh yeah!"
Oh yeah! Well, oh yeah!

I smoke woolers too, I majored the dust
Uh, it's legal for me
I drink everything, I don't give a fuck
It's part of the universe
Hey, what else I do? I do what I do
Man, fuck that! I stays high!
I don't give a fuck!

[Trigg'nomm]
Yo yo yo I don't stop at the booze, no not, can't drop the tool
So no to C.Rules and go to these schools
Now who thinkin' elementary, class
I be see no to ecstacy and hash
Headed to the penitentiary one way
Blackin' out sippin', dust plus gun play
Knucklehead nigga in a stolen Hyundai
Sip this two, a one-to-three on Monday
If I'd have stayed in school and said no to drugs
I'd probably just be what my moms thought I was
I probably wouldn't be here pleadin' with the judge
And bitchin', it's silly, hope the God forgive it

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
(Yeah) Kids, don't use drugs! (What what what what? M.M.O!)
Durg Free! Drug Free! Drug Free!
Durg Free! Drug Free! Drug Free!
Drug Free! Drug Free!

{*beat cuts off*}

Dun-dun-dun, dun-dun-dun
Dunh, do-do-do-duh-duh-duh
Dun-dun-dun
Maybe I was a fool, dun-do-na-na-na
When you say gettin' high wasn't cool, do-na-na-na
When I got used to this stuff, dun-duh-na-na-na
{*snorting*} Wasn't enough..

{*beat comes back in*}
Drug Free! Drug Free! Drug Free!

[Itchy-Fingas Sha]
Eh-yo, we worldwide, Drug Free but we all hide
Pumpin' adrenaline through all sides
Most guys need coke to cope, the only smoke I choke
is when I burn niggas verse for verse
My drug caper, stoppin' ya heart just like a pacemaker
We hold weight so we cross trainers
And headbangers with these black Rangers
Feds tryin' to contain us
Cuz we live dangerous, drug paraphanelias
My life changes, switch up frames in different angles
Crack'll leave ya dead or with shackles on ya ankles
Loves and thank yous, but it's a privelage for me
Givin' 'em Drug Free style, M.M.O., O.D.B.
