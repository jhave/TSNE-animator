[Method Man]
Oh shit, 3-2-1, blown to bits
Step inside the nightclub like I own the bitch
Southpaw two left feet set to trip
on that bullshit, back it up with extra clip
Man listen, pissin in the same pot I'm pissin
You're goin down, get in that plane crash position
Turbulence ahead, boy you must be sick in the head
Go get Excederin, or get intelligent
Recognize a veteran, player stay wetter than
the thug type, up mo' late nights than Letterman
Ask Teddy, Wreckx-n-Effect I'm ready
The same way I was in that bar scene in "Belly"
(Say what?) I freak the flow that let you know I'm a flower
Yo' ass is grass and I'm a lawn mower
So uhh, go ahead pass the doja
It's the return of Tical, party over

[Chorus: Meth &amp; T.R.]
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the street now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gon' see now (party and bullshit)
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the streets now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gon' see now (fuck with..)

[T.R.]
You chicks, bounce to the music
Shake that ass like you bout to use it
Wanna fuck with a baller? You choose
Wanna fuck with a scrub? You lose
Fuck that, let's keep it movin
Talk about how this beat got you groovin
Nod your head, make you shake your dreads
Bass travel down the spine, get stuck in your legs
Dance 'til you rip the soles off your Timbs
Shit - knock the chrome straight off your rims
Hit - after hit, well get who you wanna get
Ain't nobody really fuckin with us
Haters try to tell me I'ma suffer for this
Hatin on me cause I mastered this
You asked for this, come here and get a glass of this
.. party and bullshit

[Chorus: T.R.]
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the street now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gon' see now (party and bullshit)
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
You really want the street now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gonna see now (party and bullshit)

[Method Man]
Yo, the whole base of this is party and bullshit
Y'all lil' cats, we ain't on no cool shit
Y'all lil' dogs better learn some new tricks
And you video directors better find some new chicks
Watch this, man I got this, Hot Nikks
Mean gob spit when I talk wear galoshes
Wu-Tang Clan in the house and ain't leavin
How my Killer Bee clique feel this evening?
Meth; guerilla serial killer for scrilla
See the God run through your block like Godzilla
Menage-a-tois for these french vanillas, I'm iller
Hard as armadillo and coat made of chinchilla
New stuff, bang this, bust this, bruise this
And ballers ain't fuckin with Staten Isle, New York
What? Still in the game, platinum plus
Y'all might fuck with them, but y'all can't fuck with us

[Chorus: Meth &amp; T.R.]
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the street now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gon' see now (party and bullshit)
Y'all niggaz wanna get down? (fuck with me)
Y'all still wanna be round? (fuck with me)
Y'all really want the streets now? (fuck with me)
Y'all niggaz gon' see now..
