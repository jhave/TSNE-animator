[Hook 1] 
I see you with your palms in your pants 
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands 
I make it spin on my finger 
I'm a critical thinker 
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker 

[Hook 2] 
I know your name, yeah 
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast 
And she thinkin bout abortion 

[Verse 1] 
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard 
Ashed my blunt in my grammy award 
You can save your bullshit on your memory card 
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed 
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli 
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly 
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga" 
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars 
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers 
I'm tryin to walk a straight line but the line crooked 
I'm shootin for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets 
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude 
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin shoes 
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to 
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" avenue 

[Hook 1] 

[Hook 2] 

[Verse 2] 
Down on the ceiling, lookin up at the bed 
Life is a gamble better check the point spread 
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head 
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds 
Smokin on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus 
Help me focus on the future, and not the previous 
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason 
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon 
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees 
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed 
Livin in the glass, and everybody's lookin
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it? 
This current affairs, but who the hell cares? 
Everybody's fightin over positions, musical chairs 
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs 
I'm just fuckin ready so I come prepared 

[Hook 2] 

[Verse 3] 
And if I could sweat glare, the bombs burstin in air
Life is a roller coaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise, its right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that its there

[Hook 1] 

I know your name...</pre>
