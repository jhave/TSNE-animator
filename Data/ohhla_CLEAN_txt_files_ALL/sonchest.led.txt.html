"That be that Cash Money piece, go restin the dead"
(Alright, alright)

[Chorus: all comprised of various samples]
I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin the dead

[Lil Wayne] Yeah... uhh

[Lil Weezyana] If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead {*2X*}
[Baby Birdman] If I want to get a nigga dead, then the nigga dead
[Baby Birdman] Yeah, I said a nigga then the nigga dead

[Lil Wayne]
Peporting from Kim's corner store
Hollygrove, 17th kinda Ward
Ridin through the city in a Tonka toy
I got old money, coulda bought a dinosaur, huh
Only ride Chevy, never drive a Ford
And my Coupe doors open like plaza doors, yup!
Red thick women (uhh) eyes adore
I'm a whore, you know that I'm a whore, yup!
Cash Money, Cash Money, monster boys
Mafia bitch! Even the cop's a boy
When you say you want beef, then I got ya boy
I'll just let the Big Mac, Whoppa-boy
See my dreads hangin like-a like-a rasta boy
Fuck with my rasta and I turn into Mufasa boy...
We run up in ya casa boy
And blast off like NASA boy~!

[Chorus]

[Lil Weezyana] If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead...

"I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
 That be that Cash Money piece, go restin the dead"

[Birdman]
Yeah, "Ca$H Money is a Army" nigga better know it's gravy
If you ever fuck with young'n, if you ever fuck with Baby
Shit gon' be crazy, nigga doin it like the 80's
Buncha young nigga poppin off and they sprayin
Up in the early, we thank ya for the sunshine
Got to get my bling on, reach for my chrome 9
Kiss momma cause we goin out and gettin mines
Next nigga in line, 17 on the grind
Shoot first, nigga not seein mines
Big purses, million dollar headlines
Five drops, O.G. the last Big Tyme
Lord to the game nigga 'til it's my time
"Like Father Like Son" nigga this time
Junior got the fame and the game mastermind
Two hundred on the dash, watch me mash
Doin doughnuts in my hood gettin paper bags

[Chorus]

[Lil Weezyana] If stunna say the nigga dead then the nigga dead {*2X*}

[Birdman]
Ribbon is red, that how we plead
An Uptown C.M.B. blood 'til I'm dead
That's what I said, I'll put some change in your head
If you ever cross a line nigga it's nothin but bread
Fifty shots I'm hot, nigga we won't stop
From puttin candy on the slab nigga stirrin the pots
Put the hammer on the jam nigga pull it and pops
And put the rubber on the bands nigga stackin his knots

[Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm the boss, bih.. bitch I'm the boss
And bury me like my father on the cross
And carry thy teen, I shall over across
Shorty got that game on lock, like a vault
Weezy, Baby, cayenne pepper, no salt
Windows down on the hog in the winter, it's yo' fault
Hehehe, I don't jump on the track, I pull forward
I got that "S" on my chest, man I'm supposed to boss

[Chorus]

[Outro: composed of various samples]
Cash Money, Cash, ka-Cash Money (that be that)
Cash Money, Cash, ka-Cash Money
I walk, I walk around like I got a "S" on my chest
That be that Cash Money piece, go restin the dead</pre>
