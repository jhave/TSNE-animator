[GZA]
On a man-made lake, there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure-8 twice
At 16, uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke aboat the average loss commission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet, and now a riot will form
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm
I swing, on you fake, radio personalities
Boost ya ratings, but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements 
The earth use, and built it to a complex
Network, of communications, you're up against a hopeless, situation
I screen every vehicle, through enemy observation
Swarmin unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the force significantly, change the error
Check my wind pattern, it's headin west
Success is freedom, failure could mean death
Humans sweat, aim shovels
Dig up the debris and rubbel
Permanent, damage caused by the double-
U, Now who, cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you
Signin marvel, who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, practically marred in marble
His accountless, amount of MC's I saved
And those same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

[Chorus: RES sample]
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Change the race by reason, and ashes just the wind
The left is so our we're breathin, keep ourself from givin in

[Killah Priest]
Love and hatred, home is most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin for the Feds
Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin me
Sign all documents, usin forgery, cuz just a near thought of me
Like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants, and old kings
Who sold everything, on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed 3 times, when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss, of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts, for 4 religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians, on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts, to ward the weak, sick and ifflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her, when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth 
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell
Embracing her was like embracing a 3rd world

[Chorus]
