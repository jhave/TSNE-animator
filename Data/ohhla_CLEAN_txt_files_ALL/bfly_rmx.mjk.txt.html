[Intro/Verse 1: Eve]
Trackmasters, uh oh she just your type right
Tryin to figure out how you could play a major part up in her life right
Shorty got your mind tight
And everytime you see her walk by start thinkin bout your night like
She all that's in your eye sight
And ever since the first day you seened her thinkin she the wife type
You figure she'll be perfect lovin you
Fantasize the tingle from her fingers rubbin you
Tryin to analyze the situation, you feelin crazy
Wan't it there forever what's so special 'bout this lady?
Feelin like you wanna cool back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Raise some things swingin on the porch while the kids nappin
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life complete

[Michael Jackson]
All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls                         When I'm 
trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies, inside inside and I

[Verse 3: Eve]
You like, wait, stop, the way that she got you hot
Excited said you be what she got
Entycin mommy like the cream of the crop
Pressure gettin heavy 'bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you would it feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions make it known whatever the plot

[Michael Jackson]
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
Til the end of time

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I just wanna touch and kiss and I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies, inside inside and I</pre>
