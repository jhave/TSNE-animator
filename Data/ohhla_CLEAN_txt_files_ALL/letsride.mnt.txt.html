[MP] Let's get rowdy, let's get rowdy
[MJ] Know Montell is Bout It Bout It
[MP] Let's get rowdy
[MJ] Master P is Bout It Bout It
[MP] Let's get rowdy... looka here
[MP] Let's get rowdy

[Montell Jordan]
Stepped in the club, after my show
You know the spot, where everybody's on the low low (let's get rowdy)
That's when I saw her, she saw me (unggggggggggh)
She told me she liked Master P, and Montell occassionsly
So I laid back, put a fifty in my mouth
Said I wanna see you shake it girl
cause that's what that Bout It Bout It's 'bout (let's get rowdy)
All the n*ggaz in the club, was jealous of me
Cause I waited for it, I stayed for
And I'm damn near 'bout to pay for it
So

Chorus: Montell Jordan (Master P)

Let's ride (let's get rowdy)
All night (let's get rowdy)
I don't doubt it (let's get rowdy)
Your love is Bout It Bout It (let's get rowdy)
and I'm so excited (let's get rowdy)
	Sooooo excited (let's get rowdy)
Girl I wanna ride it (let's get rowdy)
	Girl I wanna ride (let's get rowdy)
Let's ride (unggggggggggggggh)
Tonight
Can't do without it
Your love is Bout It Bout It (let's get rowdy)
And I want tonight
        And I'm Bout It Bout It baby (let's get rowdy)
Girl I wanna ride it (let's get rowdy)

[Montell Jordan]
Now baby was more than incredible, she did her thing
5'5" 146, wearing nothing but a G-string
Her chocolate lips and, sexy thighs, sittin properly up on top of me
She's ridin, and never ain't no stoppin me now
She bounced back, then rocked slow
Like she's auditioning to kick it in my video (unggggggggggggh)
There ain't No Limit, to what she'd do
I'm listening, she's whispering
Her girl wanna ride me too

Chorus: Montell Jordan (Master P)

Let's ride (let's get rowdy)
	Yes she do
All night (let's get rowdy)
I don't doubt it (let's get rowdy)
Your love is Bout It Bout It (let's get rowdy)
and I'm so excited (let's get rowdy)
	Said I'm sooooo excited (let's get rowdy)
But girl I wanna ride it (let's get rowdy)
	Baby won't you let me ride (let's get rowdy)
Let's ride (let's get rowdy)
	Wanna slap them thighs (let's get rowdy)
Can't do without it
Your love is Bout It Bout It (let's get rowdy)
And I want tonight (let's get rowdy)
	Baby yeahhh, baby yeahhh (let's get rowdy)
Girl I wanna ride it (let's get rowdy)
	Listen baby (you know we Bout It Bout It)

[Montell Jordan]
She's moving up and down, and round and round tonight
	Moving up and down, and around and around (unggggggggggggh)
She's moving up and down, and round and round, let's ride
	Oh baby ain't nothin like the real thing, can't you see

[Master P]
See us Soldiers do it wild, I could make you smile
Make my nine go pow, put on your boots let's run some miles
Camouflage on them sheets, make that headoard squeak
Up and down til you weak, cause us thugs like to freak
68'll be my code, if you Bout It girl let's roll
I told you was No Limit cause tonight, anything goes

[Silkk the Shocker]
Anything goes, let's roll, lemme help you take up off your clothes
Give me a preview before, and the rest after the show
Thug love mixed with cream, Hennessey, strawberries, and Moet
Champagne, mo' in bath hop in the hot tub, drop a foot off a Oriental Rug
Can't get enough, you on top of me, me on top of you
Do what you want to this thug, girl ain't no stoppin you

Chorus: w/ variations (mostly minus Master P)
