Yo, yo
I want to welcome
Welcome everybody to Hustle Town
Are we recording?
Alright, let's do this fellas
Word

Chorus: All
For years, I've been working on the block of rock
For years, I've been keeping nina glock on cock
For years, I've been working on the block of rock
For years, I've been keeping nina glock on cock
For years, I've been working on the block of rock
For years, I've been keeping nina glock on cock
For years, I've been working on the block of rock
For years, I've been keeping nina glock on cock (For years, homeboy, for years)

(Verse 1)
[Eddie]
Now
If you wanna battle me, then it's on
I'm blowed, while I'm
Creeping up, with a my tech, so now you're gone
You shouldn't have tried
That set up, now you ass is gettin' wet up
Cause real G's from the
South east'll leave you haters, tryin' to get up
You'll definitely get
Dealt with if your bitch ass has a death wish
And on your grave
I tag, it's the motherfuckin' Rican you don't mess with
So let me keep stressing that
Lesson, to all y'all players and y'all haters
Haters keep watching y'all back
And y'all players keep creeping and stacking that
Paper

[Jose]
Now
Now
Why do these haters wanna plex
Why do they wanna be starting mess
Get the fuck out my face is what I suggest, cause I really don't think that you wanna test
This Mex
Comin' straight out the south east side of that Tex, so if there's
Something you gotta get off your chest, it's best that you don't express it
It's hard enough for a Mexican, so I really don't need all that plexin'
There's all kinds of player haters out there, so beware, let me tell you 'bout those
First, you got them fraud ass hoes
Then you got them fraud popo's
Then you got them fraud ass niggas in the street who just wanna plex and take yours

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Low G]
Guess who's back, from the pen, out to win
Sipping gin, with my kinfolk
Gots the grin on
My face, when I come through
If you ain't down with these G's
Motherfuck you
Cause that's a straight up
Struggle in my barrio
Second Ward
Gettin' high on the patio
And when I'm wet
I'm a threat, to a rival set
I get respect
When I step
With my new tech
Don't sweat
I, check hoes daily
On the regular
Talkin' to your lady
On the cellular
Creepin' on the lowride
In the middle of the night
With no lights
And the .45
Chilling at the Dope House
Low G
Is something you don't know about
Little tricks
On my dick, 24/7
Treat them like a bitch
Still got them hoes beggin'
Keep it real for my people
I fear no evil
Stay high
Til I die, flyin' like a eagle 

[South Park Mexican]
And as you know

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: South Park Mexican]
You're superficial
Talkin' 'bout life with a pistol
But you'se a hoe, livin' life clean as a whistle
My missiles
Oh, they do leave body dimples
Attack your whole staff
Like a pack
Full of pitbulls
You simple
I'm complex
And comin' on next
Oh, take a wild guess
That South Park Mex
Spark sess, blow smoke in the darkness
You don't wanna start mess with the heartless
I be the smartest
Hottest
Artist
My GM shine brighter than the golden arches
Shootin' star, yes
Oh, trick
No, blow
Endo, before they kick door
Then flip coke
Tip-toe, to the top
Tellin' thug tales
Of wicked love spells
Hoes and drug sales
Some fell
In fact, it's most
So a toast to my niggas who died in the smoke

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican {*Eddie &amp; Jose chatting in background*}]
H-Town
Hustle Town
Did this for y'all
My boy, Low G
No love for every neighborhood
In this world
No set trippin'</pre>
