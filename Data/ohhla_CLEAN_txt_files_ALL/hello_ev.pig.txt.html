[Intro]
I do this for my family reunions
This is for my grandma
All my people in Nebraska
My cousin Simeon
A check it out a check it out

[Verse]
Hello everybody, how do you do
My name's Pigeon Johnny
LA symph's the crew
I know what you're thinking
Who is this fool
My name's Pigeon Johnny
I make the ladies drool
Not really but it sounds cool though

[Chorus]
All my party people in the place go (Hey)
All my nerds on the internet go (Hey)
If you showing up late to work go (Hey)
All my college drop out niggaz go (Hey)
If you're working temp jobs let's go (Hey)
All the black white girls let's go (Hey)
To all the white black girls let's to (Hey)
To all the prettier Whittier girls let's go

[Verse]
Met her at the Derby
Over the weekend
I said my name's Pigeon Johnny
And she grinned
I said can I get the 7 digits
And she said "NO"
I said but but but but but, my name's Pigeon Johnny
She said she had to go
Not really but it sounds cool though

[Chorus]

[Verse]
One time for your mind you'll find
Pigeon Jack dipped and well equipped wIth a rhyme
100% I dodge dent try to repent
but usually fall when I start to climb
I'm modern day saint PJ
6th and Alvarado becomes a cliché
Never that change format
And double that double down Jack
Don't ask him but what she say
Cause I don't really care what they think
Tomorrow they'll be doing my song and will be claiming it's new
And 2 years ago they used to say that ain't even hip hop
Now they dipped in a Sinatra suit
Acting real silly thinking PJ's a joke
But they'll be doing exactly what I do
I tell you what I'll give you my style right now to save time
Cause it takes time for you to chew obviously

[Chorus]

That's what I'm saying y'all
All the way from Mexico
To 6th and Alvardo
Put your hands down and roll y'all</pre>
