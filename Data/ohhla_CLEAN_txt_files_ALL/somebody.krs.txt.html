[KRS-One]
Oh, do it now, oh, do it now
Yeah, we celebrate diversity in the university
Everybody can't be a queen, everybody can't be a ho and a bitch (Ha ha)
Everybody can't b e a philosopher
Some of y'all gotta load up the clip
Word up, watch this

It goes 1, 2, 3 we the best
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, as you can see, or KRS
You don't wanna test the team, why get a vest
You don't wanna be cursed in a verse, by the blessed
KRS with the sound for the eat and the west
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Somebody gotta be fresh
Somebody gotta be wack
Somebody gotta be the Mc
Somebody gotta do the rap
Somebody gotta be smart
Somebody gotta do that
Somebody gotta do art
Somebody gotta be black
Somebody gotta have heart
Somebody gotta be white
Somebody gotta do their part
Somebody gotta be bright
Somebody gotta be up
somebody gotta be down
Somebody gotta be the teacher
Somebody gotta be the clown
Somebody gotta be lost
Somebody gotta be found
Somebody gotta be in the economy making the money go round
Somebody gotta be the president
Somebody gotta get down
Somebody gotta be hesitant
Somebody gotta be relevant
Somebody gotta be celibate
Somebody gotta be having their sex in a lex for the hell of it
Somebody gotta be intelligent
Somebody gotta be illiterate
Somebody gotta go all the way
Somebody gotta go a little bit
Somebody got to be an idiot
Somebody gotta be belligerent
Somebody gotta be hip hop
Cause somebody else is living it
Somebody gotta be spitting it
Somebody gotta be ignorant
Somebody gotta be holy
But somebody gotta have sin in it
Somebody gotta be losing it
Somebody gotta be winning it
Somebody gotta be flippin' the style I'm kicking just a little bit
Somebody gotta be into it
Somebody gotta be out of it
Somebody gotta be up for it
Somebody gotta be doubtin' it
Somebody gotta be running it
Somebody gotta be all that
Somebody don't even known that
Somebody gotta come right here
Somebody else gotta go back
Somebody gotta be scheming
Somebody gotta be a witness
Somebody gotta be seeing in the meaning is different
Somebody else gotta be somebody, for some else to be somebody
Somebody else to run into to wealth, to try to create one body
One aim, one GOD, one destiny
I'm not non-violent, you can back up off of me
I sip my tea, and cock back three
One for Tiny Tim, Mr.Walt, and Evil Dee
I hope you all see, the need for unity
I'll never stop speaking about Marcus Garvey
Kwame Ture or Malcolm X all day
Black leadership today is all play
Y'all play, y'all immature black behavior
IS worse than being a trader
Do on to others, as you would have done do to your neighbor
Big up to my philosophy majors
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal from the cages
We writes the pages and teach all ages
Justice, tell me what we want now
Justice, for Mumia Abu-Jamal
Or justice for Amado Dialo
Justice, there is no peace without (*Justice*)
All dem mercy, now watch this
I sing, 1,2,3 we the best
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, as you can see, or KRS
You don't wanna test the team, why get a vest
You don't wanna be cursed in a verse, by the blessed
KRS with the new sound for the eat and the west
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no
follow no...

Follow no beast, on a quest
Do you hear me?
Follow no beast, on a quest
Word
Hip Hop ya don't stop
Tiny Tim ya don't stop
KRS ya don't stop
