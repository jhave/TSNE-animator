*Talking*-Gunshots

Chorus x2
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Still still fuckin' talkin'
You niggas still breathin'

Which side are you on
Life or death

Chorus x2

The Kila Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed
Ask Jesus for forgivin'
For all the sins that I did
I'm trapped in a storm
In a place we call Earth
I tried to stop but I just slid
Into a path where hatas are dwellin' my life
Lie in the hands of others
It's so fucked up in this place we call home
Cause it's the back stabbin' bustas
I separate my folks from friends
Is the type of click that I be in
It makes it difficult for me to decifer
Who came to ride to the end
See Ana it's all
Be every be wonderin'
If I'm gonna see tommorrow
So I pack my heat
Off in these streets
Bitch to relieve all this drama
I'm settin' my stake high
To a g to make g's
Cause I'm known to be the mackBut soon as I take two steps to the 
	future
It seems I get pulled three steps back
You see less fortune in niggas
Start lookin' suspicious neglected
See we were cool
Now I hate em'
Inject the pain'
Suffacate em'
You smarter than (??)
See ain't no love for no busters
You punks is shaded like graded
See you ain't shit I don't trust ya
Life or death
Theres no one left
The engines miss so brace yourself
Will they allow me to have these doors
I close my eyes
And I lost my breath

Chorus x5

Which side are you on
Life or death

The Killa Klan Kaze gon' watch you bleed
Never mistaken your life
I be taken so watch your step (watch your step)
The borthers out there sit wonderin' how can I overcome life
With no closer def
But prophets has raised me up from the grave
But I'm afraid to come back to my life of sin
But see when K-Roc just keep on and take so hes oh
(fuck a friend bitch)
Fuck a bitch
Kill the trick
Lifestyle serves down for my hustle man
Prophet Entertainment motherfucker wanna burp
Killa Play can you say what you do
Keep it to what you through life or death
Triple 6 witness is victims
Or speakers no bitches don't know what is K-Roc himself
These no one left

Spank a bee
Ckeck a bee
take a nigge she leave him here
And thie D's when you fuckin' with P fool
You and coll you and Lou who
Be in the Killa Klan Kaze will blast if I motherfuckin' have to
Real from my palm hand niggas in my trunk trunk
Bot they redrum
Why don't you come and get your head bump
Lumps ah what I want
Better for your body
More Scanman rap
Drop (??) in the dungeon
All I want is you to come and walk along with me
Three 6 Mafia and Killa Klan Kaze
(??) is what they had you send to me
Can you like feel my breeze
See fool breeze between them trees

Chorus x2

Which side are you on
Life or death
Life or death
