Follow that nigga (x11)

(Juicy J)
Fuck that nigga and his whole damn neighborhood
Let me make one motherfuckin thing understood
In my hood a couple of you niggaz try to sell out, tell out
Now you know don't have to make me take my scope out
And when I do that
I'm a aim then fuck ya
Solid in my face all mayn
I'm a busta
Cap in yo ass
That's for fuckin with me nigga
I know that you a hoe
 And now I heard you clamin killa
A killa is a nigga who will look you in the eye
Put tha pistol in your face
And let the pistol meet the fly
But I don't think so
You betta not try
I'm throwin out guns like a kamikaze pilot
My eyelid is raised and I got u in focus
What you wanna faze all you punk ass jokers
I hope this
Lesson motherfuckers gonna teach you
I got 6 slugs and they all wanna beat you


(Chorus)
Follow that nigga 
Follow that nigga
Follow that nigga
Bling bling bling
Fuck this shit

Follow that nigga 
Follow that nigga
Follow that nigga
Bling bling bling bling
Fuck this shit 

(Juicy J)
Fuck you nigga 
And you know just who I'm talkin bout
Livin on that other side
And you crossed a nigga out
I'm about my home
When it comes to stayin down
Use to be my road dogg
Now you just another clown
Hangin round you
Was a very very dumb mistake
Thought you was a real nigga
But you was another fake
Busta, musta
Wanna be thugster
I'm a label you as a dead motherfucker
Fuckin with a nigga like that 
You can die hoe
When I come out with the gat
I'm a try hoe
All of my might 
Put you six under
Lookin for a fight
I'm a break out with the thunder
Sound of a glock 38
What you gonna do
Last sound that you hear (boom)
Mark ass niggaz fruntin like they gonna blast
Don't make a nigga like me run and kill yo ass</pre>
