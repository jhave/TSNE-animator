[T-Boz]
Dear lie you suck
You said you could fix anything
Instead I'm fucked
You made things even worse for me

If I had balls
I'd tell you get away from me
Guess I'm not smart
I let you unnerve me
I let you control me
Afraid that the truth would hurt me
When it's you that hurts me more

1 - 	Get outta my mouth
	Get outta my hair
	Get outta my mind
	Stop puttin' words in my head

	Get outta my mouth
	You're nothing but trouble
	Get outta my life
	Get out of me
	Out of me, out of me, out of me, lie
	Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

[T-Boz]
Dear lie, you're dumb
You think you've got the best of me
You think you've won
Misread my vulnerability

I've got your balls
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned your heart
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

Repeat 1

[T-Boz]
I've got your balls
Now get the hell away from me
I've learned your heart
Won't let you unnerve me
Won't let you control me
The truth will only free me
And your lies won't hurt no, no more

Repeat 1

Dear lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Dear lie</pre>
