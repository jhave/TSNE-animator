Song:   Letter Home
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

You're the only girl that I have ever wanted
Every other girl is tryin to be you
My mama says that I should write you letters
But I think you're with other dudes
Take my hand, you'll like it
You don't even have to call
Yes I've had some alcohol, I'm sorry~!
Take my hand
You don't even have to call
You're somewhere out there after all
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever wanted</pre>
