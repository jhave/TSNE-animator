Typed by: sim_0006@hotmail.com

"Diamonds are forever"
"They won't leave in the night, have no fear that they might"

[Chorus]
"Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
"Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"
The Roc is still alive everytime I rhyme
"Forever..."
Forever eva, forever eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through East St. Laurent glasses
And I realise that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my vibe, does
He write his own rhymes, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgat better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up
I ask, if you talk about classics do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop top Porsche
It's spoilin' yourself thats important
If you stripper name Porcha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is mini-van
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only player that got robbed and kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried talk some sense in him
Thrity minutes later saw his note convincin' him
What mo' could you ask fo'
The international asshole
Who complained about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though
Somebody still speak from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is ya'll to pronounce my name
Is Kanye but some of my plaques still say Kayne
Got family in the D-King, folks from Motown
Back in Chi, them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, she need to go down
My father Ben said I need Jesus, so he took me to church
And let the water let the water run over my sleezer
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got steel, like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message to leave it
The Roc stand tall, and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Ya, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust gets swept off
Big K kick it where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I drop my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&amp;Rs lookin like phhttt we messed up
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio, we really though, ya he next up
People askin' me is I gon'give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question all yo, where Dame at?
He's tracked the Indian dance to bring our rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are ya'll okay, man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-r-right here stand a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Chorus]

"Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"
"Diamonds are forever, forever, forever"
"Forever..."</pre>
