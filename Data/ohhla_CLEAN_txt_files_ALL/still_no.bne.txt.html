[Hook - Krayzie Bone]
Mr. Law Protector, me don't respect ya
Ya took to many innocent lives (still no surrender!)
It's all too familiar, license to kill ya
Seems we beat the rep every time (still no pretender!)

[Layzie Bone]
Crooked officer... (fuck the police!)
You wanna come get me, but I'ma keep runnin cause prison ain't for me
...You know me no surrender!
I can break you off, fo sho...
You better off dead, cause me in a cell will never prevail
...You know me no pretender!
Me runnin and duckin, evadin the law, since I can remember
Tryna get paid, sellin my llell, from january to december
In a gizzard, through the blizzard, on a porch when, it's scorchin
Only fuck with, familiar, when I'm stackin, my fortune

[Hook - Krayzie Bone]

[Wish Bone]
So don't trust the police
Down here, get KILLED fuckin with the police
No love, no trust, no respect for us
And we will not surrender to the police
Nah, they do us RAW...
Pull us over, jealous of CARS...
Lyin witness, they'll shoot niggaz up, leavin families SCARRED
Nigga FUCK THE POLICE, they get, BEHIND ME
Then FUCK THE POLICE, I got, WHAT THEY NEED
I'm legal! Don't give 'em that reason just to fuck with you!
They hate when they can't touch you! And never ever give info to em!

[Hook - Krayzie Bone]

[Krayzie Bone]
We got some issues with the PO-PO!
They keep on killin us, why aint nobody seein this? I dont know!
Even niggaz are the victim of the street
The BLACK COP! BLACK COP, BLACK COP, BLACK COP!
Just like every other day the po-po kill a man
UNJUSTICE, but trust me, don't nobody give a damn
So whatcha gonna do when they try to do you?
Would you pop-pop-pop-pop, pop, or let them shoot you?
