[Wyclef]
One, two...
One, two-One,two...
Yo!
  
(Chorus)
Hey yo!  The Streets Are Like A Jungle
I'm countin' money in the jungle
Hey yo!  The Streets Are Like A jungle
Guns go off in the jungle

[Wyclef - Verse One]
I tip my derby like Zorro
Ain't no such things as war heroes
Frontline planes fly by, like the sparrow (BLAOW!)
My face hits the dirt, flashbacks of Vietnam
Remind me of the L.A. riots, when it was on
Fire hits the street, neon lights are bright
My tank cuts the corner, enemies take flight (That's right!)
Make no mistake, you can't have this cake it took too long to bake
and you can't carry this weight, so move on
These are the words of the elders
Babysitters got caught with cocaine in a baby's diapers
Explain that, in the form of a rap
She got caught with vals, A-CRACK-A-LACK-A-LACK!!!
Now I'm upset, I get back to the projects
First one I blast was a usual suspect, a fiend
In the alley, named Ricky
Talked to a Det. rookie, gave him the info
About the paliquo, and where he gotta go
All he want in return is a Sony stereo

[Chorus 1x]

[Wyclef - Verse Two]
Hey yo my mind is my business so I'm...
Minding my own, in the club 'til this girl said,
"Let me see your telephone"
I passed her my celly
She called her girl Mary
And said that she just broke up with her nigga out in D.C.
She needs a new honey, in the city she gets lonely
I finally figured out her man's locked up in a penatentary
So tell me, what should I do when she gets off the phone?
The devil said, "Clef, take her ass home!"
God says, "Repect her, her man's in the pen"
This kid pushed me from behind, "Yo, why you fuckin' with my woman?!!!"
Then his girl looked at me, she winked!  I blinked!
Now he's coming up to me with the gorilla instinct
Aww, cool-n-shit!  I'm sittin' here eatin' shrimp
Besides, I would hate for you to be a missing link
He said, "Son, do you know who I am?!  I'm no man, but one man
who?  The son of Sam!"
I said you've got this wrong, I never sung your girl a love song
He drew for his weapon, there's no more conversation
Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!Cock!  He released! 
then breathe, His aim went off balance
The music got tense
That's when I knew I was in trouble!  The street is like a jungle!
I jumped behind the bar, but caught two in the ankle!  POW! (Echo)
