[Intro: Busta Rhymes: (talking)]
See we, we about to take it where
Where it all started
We gonna take em' back
Busta Rhymes now, Flipmode now
My nigga Fingaz now
Check it, yo

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Uh huh, Busta Bus is back in this bitch, holding the spot
Puttin all the pep all in your step now we controllin the rock (Yeah My Nigga)
See how we comin be loadin the docks
Floatin and simply stockin the goods that we makin you flop (Ay yo)
See now we thicker and we be makin you sicker
Stuck like a bumper sticker from how we be dropping it quicker
For all these niggas that be riding and whippin in their truck (Crash)
And buyin another one and do not be givin a fuck (What!)
Flipmode (Yes) cause we knowin we comin to get it
Gather around all my niggas who that be already to set it (Set it)
Fuckin and just break them off,  let the women just shake it off
Got them bouncin to take it off for me, Check it!
Cause i've been double dutchin and dosey-do' in on music way before
A lot of these new  niggas could figure then pattend all on my flow
Peep on how we coming to rip it and know we gonna wet ya
And rep for my niggas cause I'm coming to get ya
I said...

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Guess who's comin?
With brand new fire to satisfy all the people in the street when it drops 
(Let's Go)
Now!
Let me see all the people with me let me see your hand high
    let me know you up in the spot (Ay yo I'm sayin)
Everytime we givin you music we give you the kind of music
    that makes you bang it loud on your block (C'mon C'mon)
This is to know when I'm comin I'm comin to make you wyle out in the
    place that makes you get up and wanna HOP! (Let's do it)
Go head and HOP!, Go head and HOP!, Go head and HOP!
We past makin them bounce, Go head and HOP!
(C'mon just do it) Go head and HOP baby!

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Now you know it we comin to kill you niggas for shizzle
Makin these bitches wanna shake it and we just makin them wiggle
Capitalizing off on the music that be we be keepin coming
Have you niggas really spazing and blackend out in their stomach (Hey bebe)
There's no mistakin you know we makin you bounce
Takin the unforsaken approach the way we be takin out
Scrapin these niggas and breakin their pockets to chase them out
Suddenly call your bitches to see just how they just makin out
Fuck it, we kick the bucket and to continue to stake them out (Ha)
And in back of the crib is where we will be makin out
Puting some shit together make it so you could all attend
Welcoming you and my nigga so we can break your pocket again (Oh Oh)
Niggas flossin and tossin their drinks like they all in the place
And leave the niggas the (?) until they catch one all up in their face (Huh)
Y'all know we'll spray y'all niggas and know we gonna wet ya
And rep for my niggas cause we comin to get ya
I said...
