Look at me, Angie
Let's go, let me hear it

[Chorus]x2
Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

[Verse 1]
Look at me and how I put it down
I was working while you stood around
See, I don't got to be the best chick
But for the heat ya'll know who to get with
Whether you knock it in your Benz of your Lexus
If you go the bracelet of the necklace
If you want to O.D. or just test this
It don't matter cause we coming on some neck shit
I bet this be the one that takes the world
Even though some of ya'll want to hate the girl
But watch your mouth, I'm the type that run the show
Plot the low, quick get your money and go
See ya'll ain't really nothing to me
All day you hear my name and got something to say
But I'm a chill, lay it down, make a hit and do me
Angie, up close don't worry you'll see

[Chorus]x2
Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

[Verse 2]
Whatcha gonna do now
I'll make it real hot, let me cool down
Look I don't care what other people doin
I just wanna spit and try to keep it movin
What they gonna say when a bitch drop hits
Ya'll niggas ain't never gonna stop this
Watch this, you ain't never gonna top this
On your hot list, shit is just monotonous
You ain't never gonna be hot, shit
You rap mad like De-Da
Me I stay cool, I know the remedy
Make sure you cats all remember me
I ain't never wanna fall I wanna ball hard
And leave the hatin muthafuckas all scarred
You got no points on the score card
So you can't be a part of the all-stars


[Chorus]x2
Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!

[Verse 3]
Look at me getting cocky wit it
When its on then its on, ain't no stoppin wit it
Ride the beat like my Poppy get on top of it
Knockin it for them fuckas that be poppin shit
Keep the development, and how she rock it so eloquent
Not to wreck with, resources to dead shit
Well-connected, well-respected
It the Big Kap, Ange, Funk Flex shit

[Chorus]x4
Come on, let's do it now
Just move around
Move to the sounds
Look at me, Wow!</pre>
