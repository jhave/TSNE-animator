Woadie
Yo bitch, welcome to this, uh, White Flame, you feel me?

Fuck that sucka, Based God bitch
That nigga hating on me? Fuck that bitch
Bitch can't hear ya, yeah nigga I made it
All by myself nigga, motherfucking payment

Remember when niggas used to look at me crazy?

Looking at my black card, bitch I made it
Suck my fucking dick, simple flow, bitch I made it
Everybody knows Based God hella places
