Song:   Jack Boy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a JackBoy
Don't get jacked ya boy
Have my Lamron niggas to come jack ya boy
Have my O.T.F niggas come and jack ya boy

We gon' jack you
Don't get wrapped up
We got hittas
Call 'em clappers
We gon rob 'em if he taxin
We go hard cause we be battling
24/7 like we maxin
We got 30 if you lackin
How you fawnin? You be lackin
I'm just actin keep that mac in
I'm reacting to these actors
I'mma drill 'em if he asking
They say, "Durk gon bullshit..."
I just hold my own dick
30 year old 40 clip
Got 30 in that 40 clip
Shorty's sick
Fuck the opps
3hunna shit we drop 'em out
Police asked me for some shit
I ain't gon lie
Ain't a snitch
Loud niggas be the same niggas that'll tell 'em shit
Got caught with a ratchet so
I be on my felon shit
One thing bout my hittaz that they don't be with that tellin shit

[Chorus]
I'm a JackBoy
Don't get jacked ya boy
Have my Lamron niggas to come and jack ya boy
Have my O.T.F niggas come and jack ya boy
Have my O-block niggas to come jack ya boy
I'm a JackBoy
Don't get jacked ya boy
Have my Dro City niggas to come jack ya boy
Have my O.T.F niggas to come jack ya boy
Have my 46 niggas to come jack ya boy

Eastside got my name ringin
Po-Po grab me, ain't no singing
I'm reactin, ain't no thinking
Grab that cannon, safety reasons
JackBoy out
Ain't no reason
Mama callin
I'mma grab the mac
And I'm holdin
Got these niggas dreamin, duckin shit
Ain't duckin no action
But bitch nigga it's crackin
You can't find a nigga up in the street that say I'm lackin
Goofy niggas talking goofy
Cap and get the 30 clip
Niggas talkin shit
Lil Durk
We up in this bitch
Ma big homie call me and he said get rich and bond him out
I ain't hear it from a crowd
I heard it from his word of mouth
Got a "Orbit"(c) 30-shot 40 for a "dirty mouth"
Rob a nigga for a count
That's crackin Kyle's we trappin hot

[Chorus]</pre>
