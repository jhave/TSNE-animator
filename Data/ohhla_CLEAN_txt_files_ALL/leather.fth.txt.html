Lik-like-like-like we always do about this time

[Chorus: Canibus]
Ha! You know we got you open, don't front
You know the name by now, you know what we want
Come on, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Ras Kass, come and get some
Eyo get 'em up, nah, get 'em up higher
Get 'em up in the sky like frequent fliers
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Ras Kass, come and get some

[Ras Kass]
We the movement, gladiator rap
Move over, move out the way
I'm a walkin' melee, bleed ammonia
Can you smell what the glock is cookin'?
Rip yo candy ass with a desert recipe book
From Watster, Brooklyn, then your watch get tooken
While four racist cops is lookin'
You gon' know I'm Kaiser Soze when I stop walkin' crooked
The glitch in The Matrix
Bend spoons in my mind cause I concentrate on hatred
Dedicated to the memory of my nigga Fred Jordan
He used to tell me matadors need a lungoring
My horn pourin' out you like juice
Bitch nigga turn your platinum chain into a tight noose
Cause most of ya'll rappers all Tupac and the Outlawz
75 percent of ya'll publishin', doubt ya'll thuggish men
Face this capital punishment
Decapitate your whole crew then juggle your jugulars

[Chorus: Kurupt]
Yeah, The Horsemen got you open don't front
You know the name by now, you know what we want
Nigga 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Canibus, come and get some
Nigga get 'em up high, get 'em up high
Get up in the sky like frequent flies
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Nigga spit that shit, nigga get some

[Canibus]
Yo, It's like David against Goliath
Ghostbusters verses Bowzer, Gary Coleman battlin' Fat Albert
You could be tall as the twin towers
And I still cut you down to size and drown you in a golden shower
Ambush you in transit, like the Klansmen
Throw you in the sandpit, and feed you salt sandwiches
See, niggaz like you can't exist without Canibus
Cause you're a poor excuse for a man, you bitch
I bang you with hits, the animal with the mechanical mandible
leave you tangled in semantics
Boot campus, for new recruits that can't spit
If you got a hundred bars, nigga do the damn thing
Lost like Atlantis in Los Angeles
I mix milligrams of potassium with Canibus, and go bananas
Don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry
You wouldn't want me to unleash The Horseman in me

[Chorus: Canibus]
You know we got you open, don't front
You know the name by now, you know what we want
Come on, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Young Gotti, come and get some
Eyo get 'em up high, get 'em up higher
Get 'em up in the sky like frequent fliers
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Young Gotti, come and get some
Eyo get 'em up high, get 'em up higher
Get 'em up in the sky like frequent fliers
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Come on Young Gotti, come and get some

[Kurupt]
The saber-tooth, sargeant of slaughters
With three daughters, the titanium minotaur, precise poltergeist
Drowns like leagues of water, words pure, observe
Peturbed, sour like birds, billions of words
Fly like harpoons, the coniseurs are back
Millennium alligators, the dinosaurs is back
The hauntin' started hauntin', the island just prayed
The hilanger just started overwhelmin' my head
The contrasted calculations and inhibitions
Put a couple of provisions for the chemically imprisoned
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Four Horsemen-mental patients loose on the run
They try to look through my eyes and develop the map
To the core in the center where the emperor's at
Verbal contusions, shockin' is electrocution
Posted with the Geto Boys in Dallas and Houston
Man, we in palaces, postin' with battalions
And armies, you can't alarm me
Harm me, bomb me, nigga

Lik-like-like-like we always do about this time

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
You know we got you open, don't front
You know the name by now, you know what we want
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
It's Priest mothafucka, you better get your gun

[Killah Priest]
I'm death, the destruction to those that oppose
Give you wings and halos, I'm the seven treis oh
Once engaged, blowin' open holes in niggaz like doors
That walk through 'em like hallway floors
With cannibal, man of war there before
Castles and towers, radiate my power, causin' showers
That sword will devour, cowards
My minds beyond the scallids of Howard
I strike men like lightning, derived from Gods
Run through bitches like kids in school yards
I tear off the roof like I'm Zeus
Fuckin', put your neck in a noose
And squeeze 'till you cannot breathe
Then hold your soul, and your body, 'till you cannot leave
I'm the plague, code red
I walk around with crows over my head
Crows over my bed, crows over the dead
I bring back the life just to sacrifice, 2002 Black Knights
In the shadows with scalpals
Eagles that slide your name inside the funeral chapels

[Outro: Canibus and Killah Priest]
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, check it
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Horsemen nigga
