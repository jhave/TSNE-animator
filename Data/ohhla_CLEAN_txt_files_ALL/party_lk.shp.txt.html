(T-t-t-totally duuuude!)

[Chorus]
Party like a rock - party like a rock star
Party like a rock - party like a rock star
Party like a rock - party like a rock star
Party like a rockstar  (T-t-t-totally duuuude!)

I'm on a money makin mission but I party like a rock star
Flyin' down 20 lookin' good in my hot car
You know dem hoes be at my show, grabbin where my chain go
I'm tryna grab and hold my pants but these hoes won't let my thang go
I DO like I DO, cause you know da hoes be tryin dat
Hoe don't you know I fuck wit fine dimes that look like Pamela
They fine and they hot brah, when I'm in the spot, brah... (yeah..)
I PARTY LIKE A ROCKSTAAAAAR!!

[Chorus]

IIIII (IIII) - party like a rock star
Do it wit the black, and the white, like a cop car
(Yeaaaaaaah!) WHOOP, WHOOP! Me and my band, man
on the yacht wit Marilyn Manson, gettin a tan maaaan!
(Cool!) You know me, wit a skull belt and wallet chain
Shop Boyz, rock stars, yeah we bout to change the game
(Change the game? Uh ohhhhhhhhhhh!)
They know that I'm a star (I'm a star)
I make it rain from the center of my gui-tar

[Chorus]

As soon as I came out the womb, my momma knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course, trippin wit the Osbournes
I seen the show wit Travis Barker, rock star mentality
I'm jumpin in the crowd just to see if they would carry me
Bitches wanna marry me, they see me they just might panic
My ice make em go down quick, like the Titanic!
yeah, I'm wit Da Shop Boyz, you know what we do
I'm surfin screamin "Cowabonga, TOTALLY DUUUDE!!"

[Chorus]</pre>
