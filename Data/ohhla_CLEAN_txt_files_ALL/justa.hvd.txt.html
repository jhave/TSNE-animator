It's time again, it's definitely time again
Check, check, check check
It's time again

Funk... say what?
Just a interlude y'all, just a interlude
Interlude y'all, yeah (it's just a interlude?)
Just a interlude y'all, just a interlude
Interlude y'all, yeah (just a interlude)
Just a interlude y'all, just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, yeah, check it

What the deal like, what it feel like, talk to me
Lyrically I'm spittin, y'all niggaz ain't fittin
Verbally you heard of me, I give a match in like a bookie
Chicks looky looky, you ready ready?
It's Heavy Heavy, Waterbed (what?)
Do or die, nigga fly with his crooked eye
Who stoppa, Heav' Dada, no-ba-da
Beat rocker, non-stopper
No time for them 9-8 cats
We forever and for real try that
Check the stats, we in Godfather hats
Not for nuttin but I'm like Heav' Corleone or somethin
No frontin

It's an interlude
Just a interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
It's an interlude y'all, it's just a interlude
And we out (Waterbed)</pre>
