[La the Darkman]
A letter to my baby girl, why I'm out on the road
It's January 18th, and the world is cold
Dead winter, dick hard, wishing I was in ya
Smoking this spliff, licking my lips
While my mind paints a silhoutte of your hips
Look beautiful, the love we make, beds we break
Trips we take, risks we take, it's all maturity
Try to fit your heart, in this purity
All women looking for a little congenutity
Smell me? Feel like I just met you
At the carnival, you fed me a pretzel
And you like it from the back, make ill noises
Ass is incredible, pussy is the moistest
Damn, it's all good, I bought you a ring
But marriage, nah, love, respect my thing
I wouldn't do that you, nor to myself
You signing papers to me, that's something else
But we can get the house, the whips and the seeds
Seven day, eight night, cruises to Belize
It's all in the budget, you like it, I love it
But rumors about me and the street, stay above it
I travel a lot, bitches babble alot
See the way I treat you, you lick the spot
You with the God, wisdom, strength and beauty
Civilizing savages, my everyday duty
Live free, make money, young black male
Most niggas like me is dead or in jail
I'm from the gutter, treat my wiz like I treat my mother
Respect for me, come check for me
You isn't scared of the fact, I kept a tech with me
Plus you hold it, you even asked me to teach you how to load it
Just 'case one day, I need you to explode it
That's raw, I never seen it in a wiz before
And you lady like, stay wet all night
Screaming like a baby, when I'm giving you the pipe
I'm good, that's gully, no more running the street
I got a dime piece at home, smart, laying sweet
Satin sheets, living life of the peak
Intelligent at work, and a bed pure freak
I speak for engineers, hustlers, athletes
Businessmen that travel, be gone for weeks
Getting money, come home, shit is intact
Just being around me, you get percentage of that
Just when my flight leave, know it's coming back
Round trip, baby...</pre>
