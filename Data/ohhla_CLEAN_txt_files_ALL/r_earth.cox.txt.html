[Vast Aire Kramer]
They lied - when they said there was no air/Aire in space
MC shit right here, master of ceremonies
All that other garbage
("one dimensional emcees can't handle that")

Yo, music is my love, press play on stereoid
Life is a breath of fresh air, mahogon-oid
Negroids act like Sigmund Freud
Dreaming of a perfect i-roid, screaming cerebrum steroid
Faking-jack decoys got beef with Ox
You can get caught in my Real Earth chatterbox
That's virtual (virtual), if you drunk a V8
You couldn't be parallel, because hell is vertical
Aha, fooled ya, thought it was beneath you
Got propelled in the sky, now soul is see-through
But it doesn't matter cause there's no molecules
Then genius becomes burden to ridicule
Realize much at stake 
And excuse me for lack of better words, that's my bond that never breaks
Pierce hearts with stakes, bloodsuckers cast no reflection
In my prism detention, they hate 
On Prison's intentions, get diesel, read a book
Find god in a cell block, that's your fate
I'm that voice in the back of LL's head saying
"You gonna let a weed plant do that?" yeah, I like to instigate
This aint a space race so why you rushin'
To be the first to catch a concussion, from El-P's percussion
Watch me throw a sentence in the air, say word up
That's just a phrase for my action, like a bum with a cup
And Rome wasn't built in a day but it fell in one
And you don't got half of a step but you walk like one
I got calluses on my hand 'cause I held the sun uneven
I, got the weight of the world on my chest and still breathin'
Can-Ox is like 007 and man from U.N.C.L.E.
You off the top broke but I rip the turn-buckle
You a halloween thug, I'll expose ya face
And use you as an example that fell from Grace
They lied when they said there was no air/Aire in space
I'll boil an emcee to the teeth with no trace
I'm like Moses with a staff that parts the Red Sea
But it's a new day, so I use the mic to depart emcees
This Earth is as real as a Chinese fortune cookie
In English with lottery numbers; I'm finished
Uh, with lottery numbers, I'm finished
Yo, yo

And one dimensional emcees (can't handle that)
And one dimensional emcees (be biting backs)
And one dimensional emcees (be getting smacked)
Now one dimensional emcees (know how to act)
I said one dimensional emcees (can't handle that)
And one dimensional emcees (be biting backs)
And one dimensional emcees (be getting smacked)
Now one dimensional emcees (know how to act)
I said one dimensional emcees (be biting backs)
Wha, what, can't handle that
I said one dimensional emcees (can't handle that)
And one dimensional emcees (be biting backs)
And one dimensional emcees (Def Jux; be getting smacked)
Now one dimensional emcees (know how to act)
It's like that, Real Earth, take me out there
Real turf, take me out there
2001, space odyssey, what, Cold Vein, uh
