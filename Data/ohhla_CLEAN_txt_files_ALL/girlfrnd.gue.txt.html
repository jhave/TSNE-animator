[Jazze Pha]
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen...(gentlemen gentlemen gentlemen)
this is a Jazze-phizzle produc-shizzle
Ha! (Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha)
Ho boy! Black! Black... give it to 'em daddy

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]
Got somethin' that you need to know
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Way too fly, can't let you go
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Girl you the flyest, let me inside it
Don't deny it, come on and ride it, baby just try it
Cuz I think I wanna make you my girlfriend

(Guerila Black) Uh, uh

[Verse - Guerilla Black] (Jazze Pha on echos)
I guess what they say, opposites attract
You the first make me, wanna stop my pimp back
My game tight, your frame right
We could do it, 5 or 6 times in the same night
Now I got keys for you, I believes in you
Ma, don't you know, I bleeds for you?
Sheeeit, real tall, you was meant for me
No pretendin' to be, somethin' that you not
No frontin' ma, keep it real sexy
Even though I'm thugged out, like Joe Pesci
Test me, I'm a all natural born winner
We could eat Filet Mignon or shrimps for dinner
(Then enter?), my palace
Rubbin skin with baby oil til both of my hands get calloused
Huh, a fly girl (fly girl), in my world (my world)
No need to ask, you my girl
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
You're so captivatin
Just this time I pull on my cape and B(?) cap to save em
Your flava, so distinct
I used to react fast, now, I'm so slow to think
Pink diamonds I lace you wit'
Yellow diamond wit' bracelet
Caribbean vacations, it's just so satisfyin'
I ain't touch ground, ever since I met you I been flyin'
Three quarters of the globe, 4 karats each lobe
Outlined in that white gold
Your frame so uniqe, my game's at the peak
Ma, can't you see, hell, I'm playin for keeps
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha) Black, spit it!

[Verse - Guerilla Black]
I just wanna talk wit' ya, walk wit' ya
Forget everything ma, I'm tryna get lost wit' ya
In a mind state, where time don't take place
At the San Pedro cliffs, different wines we taste
Toastin' to success of our relationship
Through the, ups and downs I'll embrace you wit'
Nothin' but the love from the deep depths of my heart
Give you hugs in the dark, I'm a (thug from the start?)
Hell, but it's been nothin' but heaven
It's like rollin the dice, and hittin straight seven
Call the reverend's, and get your bridesmate
I can't wait to tie the knot ma, I just can't wait
Come on..

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha)
Jazze Phin-zel, Washingtin-zel, huh
In the flesh with Black, uh
Real big mama, whoo!
You see us, hah
Coladas mama, yeah, like that, uh huh
Whoo! Palm trees and fiends, your neck can bling
Yeah baby can't happen to you
Hahaha! It can happen to yooUUUUU
Hey! Watch me pour Cristal on these gaiters and, they gonna swim again

[Chorus - Jazze Pha]

(Jazze Pha)
Ladies and gentlemen, you have just been..... warned
Hahah! Whoo! That we lookin for the girlfriend...Oh! for the girlfriend
