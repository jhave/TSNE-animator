[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh I wear a gun like a gurdle
Bullet proof car got me feeling like a turtle
Shit these niggaz ain't satified till they get murdered
You heard me
Yea and I'm a G
You don't know a muhfucking thing about me
I tell you one muhfucking thing about me
Bitches got so much money on me uhhh

[Ross]
I'm looking thug in the Bentley
I gotta few slugs don't tempt me
Cali put me up on the fur mats
I'm a million dollar nigga let's confirm that
I rep Kerr city out in vegas
and the magic hundred thousand dollar bracelet
More guns than The Matrix
Neo, reload get your face twist
cartel cocaine by the cases
cartel more cars than the races
AK's on the lere jet
G4 Rick Ross I'm a real threat

[Chorus]

[Brisco]
standing in the blue house, chopper in my right hand
stomach growling and brisc gotta feed the fam
I gotta meet the man, the man wit them kilograms
he bout to get jam by the opalocka goon
I found the needle in the hay stack
put boys in and flood the streets I got my weight back
now I'm known around day as the young don
aint no bitch made pussy where I come from
and them dicks ain't stopping shit
eight pounds on the peak and bird feather on the wrist
so far so hood
move around hit his ass it ain't look so good
now he leaving in the black bag
he a roach the brisc be the black flag
and dont leave your dope round me
straight gutta foreal ask your homie bout me
I'm a G

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
fat paper bag
brown paper bag
rubberband green paper cash
fuck wih it get the laser tag
Y'all niggaz better wave a flag, it is over
I walk with a hand gun ride with a pump
"vroom" it must be the coupe or something
since I love her I'm a put some candy on that hoe
I go topless no panty on that hoe
see, y'all niggaz think its sweet
sweet tooth niggaz get shot in the teeth, like that bwoy
I got guns where guns ain't suppose to be
you need to get a full dose of me
I'm crack

[Chorus]

[Ross]
niggaz know I'm millitant
know who you dealing with
fuck your pretty whip
you niggaz ain't killing shit
every bird I whip
fucking every bird I'm with
I'm your Makaveli sucker with a murder hit
Y'all niggaz ain't trill (trill)
Y'all niggaz know the deal (deal)
Y'all niggaz wont deal (deal)
what you talking is irrelevant
this shit would leave a hole in a elephant (boom)
so if I got it then I'm selling it
need cheese cake like Fredrick
your hear the ?
think you not a predicate
Rick in the seven-six
six shot medal kit
Ross

[Chorus]
