[Intro]
WKYA Gilla House Radio
Yeah niggaz, I'm back
And the weather outside is hot than a motherfucker
But we cold chillin in the Brick City
So kick back, light some blunts
Put your hands on a big fat greasy ass and turn the music up
As we take yo' ass on a ride as Redman Goes Wild on WKYA!
 
[Redman]
Gilla House, yo, yo
Come see the sideshow, nigga how it go?
With my eyes closed I can hit nine folks
You want the beef nigga? Here the prime roast
My mic's the gun, the bullet's the 9-volt
Fuck the convo, here go the pyro
G.I. Joe, mixed with Desperado
I ride low, with a bomb in the armrest
Prepare to snipe a fucker like John F.
Connect ya like Nynex, nigga holla
I'm on the corner like Hollywood with a Starbuck
Bring it to ya like the Japs in Pearl Harbor
Red is to blunt like redneck is to Marlboro
This is our world, join the effect
Clean your ears for Doc Donald Goines with a pen
What more can I say, Doc billin
Gilla general, Def Squad lieutenant
Ill at will, thought you knew
I'm in the hood, you +Most Wanted+ up in +Malibu+
I don't co-sign shit that ain't hundred percent
Tryna blow money-wise like Bubba Gump Shrimp (Gilla!)
I feel I'm young, out for the crumbs
Shutgun warrior with a Wu-Tang tongue (Gilla!)
How ya like that, tell me how ya like that
How ya like that, tell me how ya like that
Don't fuck around or walk around with an icepack
I test your gangsta, didn't wanna fight back
This for niggaz, Jews, and white trash
I deliver them punchlines with a nice jab
Smokin weed on a go-cart at Bo Craft
BC-4, straight out of Low Cash
Low Cash, Low Cash (WKYA!)
Low Cash, yeah!
 
[Gov Mattic]
The new Brick City, low down, gritty
Fo'-pound semi, minds I leave 'em empty
Keep the fo'-pound round the nine-milli with me
So when the Feds run up, they likely not to hit me
Like J-Kwon everybody, in the club tipsy
You be on the mixtapes soundin like 50
But this is Brick City, Gilla House we comin through
Smokin blunts, sippin Henny too
Girls is bouncin, niggaz bouncin too
On the blocks, new whips we drivin through
We gettin money, CD's is pay-per-view
At the go-go girls come up into
So listen up as we tell y'all what to do
Come holla at my motherfuckin crew (yeah!)</pre>
