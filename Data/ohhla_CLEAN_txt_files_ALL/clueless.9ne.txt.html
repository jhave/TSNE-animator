I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless
So clueless

What did I do to deserve this kind of pain?
Out of all the fights, this was the main
You said to give it a chance
But I saw you at the dance
We tried to work it out
But I still had a doubt

(Clueless)

I just can't take the risk of getting hurt again
And you're way worse than other men
I used to think you had a brain
But now I know that you're way insane
You tried to steal my heart away
And you'll pay for that someday

(Clueless)

I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless

(So clueless)

I cant believe I let you play me for a fool
N' wt you did was so totally uncool
I had no clue it would end this way
And I don't really care of what you have to say
I'll never forgive you for what you did
Gosh, I was such a kid

(So clueless)

But now that I'm grown and mature
I realize that I was blind and unsure
It ain't gonna happen no more tho {no mo}
And it's obviously the end of us, yo
Now I just wanna scream and shout
Cause you don't even know what our relationship was about

(So Clueless)

Should've told me the truth in the first place
Now I'm gonna have to pick up the pace
Boo if you loved me so
Then you wouldn't be this low
But now that I figured out your cheating ways
It's just too damn late

(For us to ever be togetha again!!)
And you won't get away with anything else these days
(this I promise you... Yeah...)

I can't believe you did this to me after all I did for you
Cause you made me so mad and there's nothing you can do
You and I were clueless, but you were the most
And I guess you just got lost
Baby you were just clueless
Clueless..
Clueless!!!!

(You should've told me before... should've trusted our love
should've thought about that before you went on and broke my heart..
but its ok because in the end I'm better off without you
and its just too bad that I cant say the same about you! you're so clueless)</pre>
