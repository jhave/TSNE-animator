Yeah, Paula
Danja!

[Paula DeAnda - Verse 1]
I might be a young girl but I know how to have fun
I got them boys try'na make me the one
When I'm out shopping its like having a gun
Whatever I wanna get, got them boys caught up

[Paula DeAnda - Bridge]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now
Back up off me

[Paula DeAnda - Chorus]
Oh, I got them going crazy you see
Uh-ooh, head over heels for me, oh
Uh-ooh, weak in the knees for me, boy
Uh-ooh, 'cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

[Paula DeAnda - Verse 2]
Oh, I'm much wiser than you think, better I act like you know
Just because I'm a teen it don't mean that I'm slow
I think you're a cutie boy, but you're turning me off
Sometimes you gotta play hard to get and then it's on

[Paula DeAnda - Bridge]
I know I'm a hot, hot shorty
But you gotta slow down
You don't know me
If you in a hot, hot hurry
You gotta go now
Back up off me

[Paula DeAnda - Chorus]
Oh, I got them going crazy you see
Uh-ooh, head over heels for me, oh
Uh-ooh, weak in the knees for me, boy
Uh-ooh, 'cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

[Lil Wayne]
One take! Weezy!

Baby, tonights the night
And them girls all on me like white on rice
And I get 'em to the crib, play to on 1
I'm already hot, now its you on one
Take a jet in to the sunset, you wan come?
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum
Baby, I can take you to and from
Ice up ya little wrist 'til ya blue hand numb
Um, you dealin wit a boss lil' mama
Young Wayne, Tony Montana
And for you I'll tell my homies "I'll holla!"
And if ya man ain't me why bother?
I go by the name Carter
I got more plaques than tartar
I'm just checking out the charts on the charter
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula

[Paula DeAnda - Chorus] (2x)
Oh, I got them going crazy you see
Uh-ooh, head over heels for me, oh
Uh-ooh, weak in the knees for me, boy
Uh-ooh, 'cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy
Cause you so damn easy

[Paula DeAnda - Outro]
Don't be so damn easy
Don't be so damn easy</pre>
