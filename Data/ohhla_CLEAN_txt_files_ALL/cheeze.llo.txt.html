[Intro]
Fat Rat!!!.... Fat Rat!!!.... 
Fat Rat!!!.... Fat Rat!!!....  *beat comes*
Fat Rat!!!.... Fat Rat!!!.... 
Fat Rat!!!.... Fat Rat!!!.... 

[Lil' O]
You know Lil' O [Uh-huh]
Hit the brick and turn thirty-six to fifty-four [Uh-Huh]
Get the rental, hit the interstate and get the dough
I keep my game face on [Yeah]
H-Town niggas stay paper-chase-on 
All that "Whut's up kinfolk", we ain't no rela-tion
I got my dough, you wanna play you get a gamesta-tion
Cuz I don't want the block, I want the whole na-tion
I'm greedy, envy, trife, and lust crea-tion, I'm the [Fat Rat!!!]
Tha fat rat with the cheddar
when I blast my Barretta, slugs smash thru your sweater
And if you come, I'm show you if I mash it's whutever
I spin a nigga hot and turn his ass into leather
Two bricks in the dash, fifty g's in the fender
Throw stash spot from my glock, I call it blender
Do managitouis with them broads, Kim and Brenda
I'm the cat that separate the ballers from pretenders, I'm the 

[Chorus]
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha boy that got the work, from half O's to Ki's, they call me 
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
I bleed niggas' blocks and stab O's and G's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha little nigga, that push them big body V's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
There's stealers on my team that smash blows and freeze

[Lil' O]
You know when Fat Rat hit the club I always ride thru stuntin'
There's sumthin' big and wide, and it's glidin' on buttons
Cuz the wool lookin' phat my insides lika a glutton
And I don't say hi to these hoes that ain't fuckin'
And if you wanna check, go head and try it ain't nuthin'
There's killers on my side, just dyin' to spray sumthin'
Paint sumthin'...wrap up the tape sumthin'..
That's whut happened to the last niggas came thru frontin'
Now I'm in the field [Uh-huh] arms in the Lexus [Uh-huh]
in the bitch like they mommas keep they heads put away
Every soldier on my team all about gettin' cake
And the ones get out of line, we do em to set em straight
Now it's the thugg ones [Yeah] who snatch your loved ones [Yeah]
And call you for the ransom we want it in all ones [For real]
(???) debatin', we all dunns [Get money]
Them niggas alright, but me, I'm awesome

[Chorus]
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha boy that got the work, from half O's to Ki's, they call me 
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
I bleed niggas' blocks and stab O's and G's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha little nigga, that push them big body V's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
There's stealers on my team that smash blows and freeze

[Lil' O]
I'm still a vida-loca [Yeah] slangin' coke-a [Yeah]
Block leadin', tryna get money like Op-rah [Whoa]
In the kitchen cookin' these chickens like ok-ra
I can get it raw, white, yellow, tan, or moca [for real]
Ain't no game is ov-ah, it's just a lot of new heads [uh-huh]
Now a niggas winnin' wars, giving game to the Feds [uh-huh]
That's the type that cats that get found with a brain full of lead [uh-huh]
In the living room, tied up and gagged, laying in red [uh-huh]
Laying and dead, cuz playa if you mention-my-name [uh]
I will break, every bone and every inch-of-your-frame [say whut]
When I throw you off the roof and have you wrenchin-in-pain 
There's nuthin' in the world like the stench of remains, 
Cuz when I throw em I don't play no Elementary games 
Not when he drunk, ice grill, catching a flame 
He could bust, anything, tryna get at my change
I got the streets on lock like pennetentiaries, man,  I'm tha

[Chorus]
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha boy that got the work, from half O's to Ki's, they call me 
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
I bleed niggas' blocks and stab O's and G's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
Tha little nigga, that push them big body V's, they call me
[Fat Rat!!!] 
Tha fat rat with the cheeze....
There's stealers on my team that smash blows and freeze
