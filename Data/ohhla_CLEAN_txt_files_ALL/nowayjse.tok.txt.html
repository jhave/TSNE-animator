Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Flexx]
Wait, hold up hold up hold up baby one minute (T.O.K.)
I hope you don't think I was gonna come in here by you drinks
Then you just walk off into the sunset just like that
Pay that crap, mi nuh play dat yo, wait, wait, check

[Chorus: T.O.K.]
No way jose, we nah go ever stray
A gal fi know she haffi give it up before we pay
No way jose, listen weh we seh
Mek she know she haffi give it up before we pay

[Verse 1: Bay-C (T.O.K)]
Alright then, gal a line up fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She could a be a Playboy bunny
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)

[Verse 2: Flexx]
Some gal just a flex like Delilah

Wid di sexy pretty cute face pretty smila
A try fret yuh bet mi spot yuh from a mila

[Verse 3: Bay-C]

How much yuh waan mi carry yuh pon cruise
Before mi do dat mi haffi collect mi dues

[Chorus: T.O.K.]
No way jose, we nah go ever stray
A gal fi know she haffi give it up before we pay
No way jose, listen weh we seh
Mek she know she haffi give it up before we pay

[Verse 4: Bay-C (T.O.K)]
Alright then, gal a line up fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She could a be a Playboy bunny
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)

[Verse 5: Alexx]
There's no truth in denyin
Tricks of di trade girl I know every line
Nah spend a dime yo if mi not buyin
Time's really rough so mek up yuh mind

[Verse 6: Craigy T]
Yo yo yo, listen to mi good, listen to mi proppa
When yuh a look gal yuh haffi tink like a shoppa
If mi spend a dime somethin must get whoppa
Draws haffi drop before di champagne poppa
Don't get mi wrong I think some man is not a dappa
Pure pretty gal mi a pure toppa toppa
And dem know seh dem haffi please Big Poppa
If dem nuh do dat dem pocket would nah go fatta

[Chorus: T.O.K.]
No way jose, we nah go ever stray
A gal fi know she haffi give it up before we pay
No way jose, listen weh we seh
Mek she know she haffi give it up before we pay

[Verse 7: Bay-C (T.O.K)]
Alright then, gal a line up fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She could a be a Playboy bunny
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
Yo yo, how yuh must fi tink seh money drop off a tree
Mek mi tell yuh nothin in this life is for free
Yuh a look a joy like gal pop off a mi
Yeah yuh are a dime but yuh nah get a penny
Haffi work hard before yuh get my money
All yuh waan fi do a drink all my Don P
And carry all yuh friends dem pon shoppin spree
If yuh a do dat get a J.O.B. and lau mi

[Chorus: T.O.K.]
No way jose, we nah go ever stray
A gal fi know she haffi give it up before we pay
No way jose, listen weh we seh
Mek she know she haffi give it up before we pay

[Bridge: Bay-C (T.O.K)]
Alright then, gal a line up fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She could a be a Playboy bunny
(If she don't play then we don't pay)
She haffi puff hard fi get money
(If she don't play then we don't pay)

[Chorus: T.O.K.]
No way jose, we nah go ever stray
A gal fi know she haffi give it up before we pay
No way jose, listen weh we seh
