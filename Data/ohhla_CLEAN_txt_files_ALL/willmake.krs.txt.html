[KRS-One]
Instead of reading the word of Christ, BE the word of Christ
Instead of following God's word, BE God's word
That's the conciousness of hip-hop
You are not just doing hip-hop, you ARE hip-hop
You are not just reading the word of God, you ARE the word of God

[KRS] I will make it
[HWC] I will make it!
[KRS] They can fake it
[HWC] (??)
[KRS] Time that I state it
[HWC] I can create it
[KRS] I create it
[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS-One]
For me, what you see is what you get in these days
I'm so hungry you can throw my dinner right on the stage
You can bite down on my rage, bite down on my anticipation
With no doubt or hesitation, repeat this affirmation
(I WILL MAKE IT) Not I wanna make it
(SHOW 'EM HOW WE MAKE IT) In fact, we've made it
Every time we state and believe it we create it
The power of your very word is highly underrated
Sleepin in the dark in the park watchin others push they cart
Say this whole thing in your heart

[KRS] I will make it
[HWC] I will make it!
[KRS] They can fake it
[HWC] (??)
[KRS] Time that I state it
[HWC] I can create it
[KRS] I create it
[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS-One]
For me, I ain't askin I ain't beggin I ain't pleadin
In a positive direction my lifestyle I'm leadin
I'm readin about ways of achievin what I'm believin
Every time I'm speakin I'm seein myself leapin
over buildings, over the one on the corner chillin
Straight into knowledge of self, countin up millions
Changin my situation, with creative visualization
Givin libation for this ancient information

[KRS] I will make it
[HWC] I will make it!
[KRS] They can fake it
[HWC] (??)
[KRS] Time that I state it
[HWC] I can create it
[KRS] I create it
[HWC] No one can make it

[KRS] For me
[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!
[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!
[HWC] I will make it.. cause you're gonna make it!</pre>
