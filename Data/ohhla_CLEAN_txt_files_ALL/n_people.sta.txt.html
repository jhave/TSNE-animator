[Intro - Freeway - talking over Sample]
Yeah, uh oh, y'all know
Free, Statik Selek'
We in the building
Like we always do it around this time
Uh huh, uh, uh, let's go

[Verse 1 - Freeway]
Freezer, squeeze Nina, make you check like cheetah
Tote a very long heater (uh huh)
100 G's in my carry on
After my niggaz' bury y'all, I'm laughin like hyena (haha)
We are, around the world like Boeing
Jets, my sex is the shit
My dick's like, Boa Constrictor, hit your sister (uh)
With the snake, then I make her carry weight, wait! (uh huh)
Know all my niggaz can relate (that's right)
All my niggaz that be movin the white, move it at night (yeah)
Get it to them smokers that's abusin the pipe (uh huh)
We be doin it and doin it and doin it right (uh huh)
Diss me, dump tools, lose your roof on the mic (roof on the mic)
These other rap niggaz is fools but I'm the truth on the mic (truth on the mic)
Me and Selek' Statik, we're back at it
Tote fully 'matic ratchets, clap ya on sight (yeah)

[Chorus - Masspike Miles] - 2X - w/ Red Cafe ad libs
Under the radar, they ain't seein us (yeah)
But they gon' see it when we double up (double up)
We movin like a thief in the night (like a thief in the night)
We the type of people that move in the night (night)

[Verse 2 - Red Cafe]
Double XL in a black SL
Late night smellin like wired cell
Now where the hoes at? We live as hell
Got bottles on deck, whole box of L's
Light up! Shake down affair, Cafe invasion
Dressed for the occasion (yep)
Stayed strapped so I hit the club wiser (uh huh)
Be freshly brewed, Budweiser (what up?)
Graveyard shift on my Avon shit
Barksdale, don't let the AR spit
One eye open
cafe wake 'em up when y'all dozin, I be the chosen
When I talk niggaz listen
If I ain't on the block, shit I'm in the kitchen
Makin tea bags and all, not Lipton
Believe I'm scorin, even when I'm tourin, it's movin (movin)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Freeway]
Uh, hit 'em no hat, bare back, bare pus' (yeah)
Psyche I'm kiddin all my women know I strap up (strap up)
Roll back to the sacks, smokin sacks
And acts and bents with my sidekicks, rockin fly kicks
Hunnies want a check but all I wanna know
Is them bitches down to go and is they swallowin for sho' (uh huh, yeah)
Uh and if them bitches can't leave
There's some rooms backstage when you swallow at the show (swallow at the show, uh)
Gargle it, handle it, vanish it
Make it disappear like you swallowin some more (swallowin some more)
Add Rosé (hey), let's role play
You can be the dirty Latin maid, you my Latin slave (woo!)
And I'm the house owner (house owner)
But you gotta clean the couches, do the dishes, when you finished, bend that ass over
It's a Naughty America
And these bitches, freakin, fuckin, strippin, suckin for the math (yeah)

[Chorus] - w/ sample playing until the end</pre>
