Baby Girl, what

[Verse 1: Aaliyah (Timbaland)]
Your hotter than a summer day, in California
You got me meltin' like a sundae, I want ya
I know you've been wait, you've been waitin a long time for me
(I've been waitin, I've been waitin, I've been waitin, what)
But if you wait a little while longer, this is how it'll be
Oh, it's gonna be...

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Hot...like...fire (I'm gonna take you...)
Take...you...higher
You...can't...resist (When we...)
Kiss..kiss..and kiss and kiss and kiss

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
You shouldn't rush it, take our time
I'll let you know when I'm ready, if that's alright
I won't keep you, I won't keep you, I won't keep you holdin on
But if you wait on me, I promise you it wont be long
Oh, it's gonna be...

Repeat Chorus 2x
