Televised revolutions on the net
Only yet we're witnessing connecting us could pose a threat
Over through the openness of poverty &amp; hopelessness
Cover it with shadows of a mob, tipping over stress
&amp; they've got their torches lit
Progressive acting vocalist
Close the lips of those who only wish to keep on holding whips
Stolen chips are given back, what be that, Sherwood
Justice wears the face of us, who be that, Thurgood
Butter flies are flapping wings
off the banks of river Nile
Entitled waves amass a scene
wash away the villains vile
This is how we disembowel
The belly of beast
Another message from the east
I only hope we hear it loud
Let the wise men deliver, to the salivating crowd
Thirsty for the end of hurting, fiending to begin the plow
Plant the seeds for the pupils raised in the ways of now
Present for the present state to never let it come around

&amp; My, my look at the times we're living in
As blind eyes begin to see the vivid end 
As time dies, a new era fit to begin
Let's celebrate the end, &amp; get to starting over

Birth of a nation
Problems that they're facing
Shadowed by rejoicing tears, cry for liberation
Indeed congratulations is in order
I'm from north of the border
Responsible for the slaughter
I was on their side
For them I'll always ride
Being raised in the states, I learned we're in the same tribe
Niggas in the eyes of those from outside
They wanted us to die, it's conquer &amp; divide
It's all for the oil that rest beneath our soil
Within our turmoil their nations are going to thrive
It's too late though
The murders &amp; the rape
Have replaced how we relate
With the kind of hate though
All according to plan
Use the color of a man
Then divide up all his land
As if it was fate though
But good luck though to my brothers in the south
Africa's youngest country hope you show them what you're about

&amp; My, my look at the times we're living in
As blind eyes begin to see the vivid end 
As time dies, a new era fit to begin
Let's celebrate the end, &amp; get to starting over</pre>
