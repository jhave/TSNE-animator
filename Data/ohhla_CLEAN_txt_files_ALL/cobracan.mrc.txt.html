[Marc Live]
UHH!  Yeah..
I just got this call from my nigga Jay Mine
He say - yo Marc, we way out in this motherfuckin Paris y'knahmsayin
I just whipped up some ill shit for you nigga
I said - yo I'm on the next plane out, Air France
You know, no Boeing jets, y'knahmsayin, real shit
Stratosphere shit, check it out yo, listen

Yo, I'm clearin the area, I'm scarier than most
I'm terrorizing whole coasts, call me Godzilla
See I can herb niggaz, you can't get this rough
I'm independent, the label bought disposable
Your camp, your team, now y'all get lost
The jungle is thick, Live seven rhyme better
Tonight's the night, my niggaz gonna roll out
We 20 deep, we all deep in them UV's
We hit the streets, the windows down
The smoke's in the air, chokin the air, get down
If it's dope you want, nigga we don't care
It's everywhere, see we out and about
We huntin, aiyyo we countin them bundles
We roll with the bottles, chickens that gobble
It's not a model but, she down today
And I bet you she'll be down tomorrow, hey
Drop off aiyyo we pick up, two more
We hit the liquor store, drink from the bottle we raw
Ohh!  They lookin and hatin
They wanna know who the fuck we are, check it
Rap criminals, bad men
We mad men, chainsaw niggaz, bad men
Money we got, gangbang with us
Come slang with us, it's not a thang with us
Check it out now, one two
One two, Jay Mine yo
This shit is crazy, y'knahmsayin
I just wanna keep goin, I just wanna let these niggaz know yo
Yo, listen, check it out yo

Stop showin out, you not the band
You kids is whylin out, you not Da Band
It's no layover, I'm straight to the gate
I'm straight with the gat straight to your face
I'm ready I'm so focused, I'm steady, listen up
Yo, we gettin heavy when we trip 'em up
All my niggaz wanna control the state
All my niggaz wanna control your fate, uhh
I'm a New York nigga
A hood nigga, all good it's all good nigga
Freestyle what?
It's so hip-hop, niggaz get stuck and get bucked
I'm from New York, the Bronx kid
I take the mic and I stomp kids
Put your hands in the air if you down
Put your blunts in your air, get down
Smoke it up, choke it up
All you bitches just soak it up, c'mon

Check it out now, uhh
That's it, New York City
L.A., Texas, Chicago, Crash Man
Junakdelic, Marc Mega, Iceberg, S.M.G.
