Hello to all my niggas and bitches
Welcome to Digglers Wild World of Girls
I'm sitting here with the Baddest Bitch (Thats Right)
So Trina tell us a little something about yourself

(Trina)
Hustla I'm the queen of this south shit
Tight with a cute face that's what I'm bout bitch
Sexy, specialize in filet show
All about my pesos 
Never was a fake hoe
Shot shore throw throw the cock like a flame thrower
In the mouth of a cock blower
Just a diva
Mack momma looking for them ends
Traded in the Lex for a G-5 Benz
Touring on the road getting stacks
20 grand karats for the show no tax
Bell-V is what I'm pourin on them hatas
Blinding with the lock no imitaders
Broke ass niggas getting on my nerves
Get sliced, diced, chopped, and served
Ask am I off the chain
I won't lie
But I don't want your man boo fuck that guy Uh

Girl Talking:
Oh OK Allright
I see how y'all be getting down in the MIA
But Trina what I really wanna know is 
how would you get with a nigga who live with a bitch

(Trina)
Wait... for his bitch to live
Ms. Trina gotta trick up her sleeve
Open up the door I walk straight in the house
Put your man down and put my cock in his mouth (Damn)
I need a heavyweight like Georgy Foreman
To work my ocean like the Long Shoreman
I'm real successful
I live off interests
So get it right bitch I'm the Diamond Princess
Banking and its all for the cause
(Hey Trina would you suck a nigga dick)
Bitch hell naw
And fuck what a bitch tell yall
Stay the fuck outta mine hoe and go get a job Ugh

Girl Talking:
Damn girl
You wild as fuck
But what I really wanna know is
How you set a motherfucker up...

(Trina)
See a nigga pumpin gas
Don't look
Get out your car slow drop your book
Sell em' with your name and your freak out game
And show a lil' shot of ass just to get in his brain
Tell em what he wanna hear 
Calm and slow
"You want this ass"
Come on let's go
Call my dawgs at the hotel
Let em' know I'm coming
Bring em' upstairs and leave the car running
Get em' in the room don't be scared
Go in broke come out with bread 
That's what a nigga get 
Playing with that cheese
Fun for a freaking 
Watch ya get skeeze
Out the door 
Real quick
Then out come my dawgs with the K's and shit
Thinking with your dick man that ain't nothing
(Trina one more thing)
Naw no more questions

Girl Talking:
See now that's what I'm talking 'bout
We need more real motherfucking bitches representing real shit
You heard it live from the baddest bitch
Reporting live this is Ki Ki
