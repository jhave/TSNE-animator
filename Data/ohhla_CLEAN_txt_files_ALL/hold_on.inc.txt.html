[ad-libs]
Yeah... another day..
Another motherfuckin' dollar..
But look, nigga...
It's how we do
Livin' in the ghetto, ooh, ooh
 
[chorus]
Livin' life up on the corner
Slangin' rocks and smokin' weed
From a eightball to a G
Worked my way to a ki
All I can try to do is hold on
Caught up in the struggle
Seems the only way to be
Never gone find no peace
Till the day they bury me
All I can try to do is be strong
 
[verse one]
And nigga, you can find me
Hangin' up on the corner
Or layin' up in the cut
Tryin' to get my motherfuckin' money right
My hammer right beside me
And I really don't give a fuck
If somebody gotta die tonight
Cause look... nigga, my pocket full of stones
Is everything I own
And this is all I do, all I do
A nigga straight hustlin' everyday to get through, get through
 
[chorus]
 
[verse two]
Gotta be on the lookout for them stick-up boys
Cause when they come
They be straight hemmin' niggas up
And it really all about takin' that money, man
If they catch me, they betta kill me
Ain't comin' out like no punk
Shit, can't let no nigga take nothin' from me, man
Cause look, yo... they steppin' in my zone
And infiltratin' my home
And what the fuck would you do?
If a nigga straight... took ya cake
And tried to break you, break you
 
[chorus]
 
[bridge]
I wish that I could let it go
How we in the struggle and hustlin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that we ain't have to be so canivin' just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
How my niggas in the pen doin' time just to make it out the ghetto
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that genocide wasn't survivin' just to make it out the ghetto
 
[verse three]
Everyday is just weed, rocks, and pistols, cops comin' to git you
When niggas that wanna put you on shirts readin', "We Miss You"
Everything I been through, nothin' but issues
Tired of goin' to funerals and passin' moms the tissue
Getcha prayer in ya life, it's hard to listen
When there ain't nothin' fair in ya life
It's God that's missin', that's what they be tellin' me
And I try to wait but He be takin' so long
I'll probably catch another felony, inhalin' weed
Keepin' me broke, though, I slangs my coke
I probably push less weight than the trees I smoke
And ain't no hope for tomorrow, hot, heavy wit sorrow
Cause my peers bring tears from findin' em full of hollows
I know you probably goin' through the same thang
The same pain, cause we caught up in the same game
And don't a damn thang change, nigga, bump this song
Cause you strong and you ain't alone, nigga... just try to hold on</pre>
