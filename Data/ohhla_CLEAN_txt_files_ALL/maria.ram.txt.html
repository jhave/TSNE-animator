[Zack de la Rocha]
The sun ablaze as Maria's foot touches the surface of sand
On northern land, as human contraband
Some rico from Jalisco passed her name to the Boss
She stuffed ten to a truckbed, she clutches her cross
Here comes the exhaust and it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to the pasture, like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106, sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates upon the memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood debts on the loans
Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
Of graves hidden trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing, no one, nobody, NO MORE!

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates..
Through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates..
And like the sun disappears only to reappear..
She's eternally here...her time is near
Never conquered but HERE..

TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!

And now she got a quota
The needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across the new line of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim the point an inch from her vein
The foreman approach, his steps now pound in her brain
His presence it terrifies and eclipses her days
No minutes to rest, no moment to pray
And with a whisper, he whips her, her soul chained to his will
"My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill"
Her arms jerks, the sisters gather round her and scream
As if in a dream, eyes on the crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to the floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, NO MORE!

These are her mountains and skies and she radiates..
And through history's rivers of blood, she regenerates..
And like the sun disappears only to reappear...Maria..
She's eternally here...her time is near
Never conquered BUT HERE..

Ugh, TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!
TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!
TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!
HA!!

[whispers]
No minutes to rest..
No moment to pray..
No minutes to rest..
No moment to pray..
No minutes to rest..
It eclipses her day..
Just a moment to pray..

[guitar riff]
UGH!

TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!
Ugh, AWAY AT THA MASK!!
TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!
TO TEAR AWAY AT THA MASK!!</pre>
