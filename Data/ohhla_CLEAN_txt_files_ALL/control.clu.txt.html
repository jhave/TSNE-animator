[Mocha]
What hot, we droppin'
What not, we stoppin'
Ya'll rock toppin', we bottle poppin'
Ya'll block watchin', we watch coppin'
Ya'll car hoppin', cause now we got it locked and
We dedicate for ya'll feather weight
You better skate cause we never late
Gon' replicate then bet I set it straight
But you can't bet what you never make
I'm the same cat from the same tracks
That hadda bring crack when you played that
When I spit move way back, you get sprayed at
I write my own shit bitch, can you say that?

1 -  	[Missy]
	Alot of ya'll MC's talk mo' shit
	Talkin' bout hits and all the whips you dip
	I know most of ya'll rappers live dead broke
	I go to your accountant and he say, "No dough"
	Rappin''bout the weed and you can't even roll
	If I blow you a gun nigga, can you smoke?
	Why you gotta front when you whack as shit
	Me and Mocha, we ain't braggin' bitch
	I ain't gotta rap about the dough I hold
	And I ain't 'bout to talk about the cars I drove
	And I ain't gotta front about the shows I blow
	Turn on your radio, see me control

[Mocha]
It's best that thee put on the bets wit' me
And testin' me? I hit your chest wit' three
Let's make it clear that we gon' take it there
The way it appears, there ain't a club shakin' rears
Mocha here, call me the richest chick
With the thickest chips, and the quickest whip
Get a grip, why can't you try wit' me
Dumb variety, I get it done lively

2 - 	[Nicole]
	My rhymes, they like
	They really, really like
	They for it, adore it
	So come let them enjoy

	My rhymes, they like
	They really, really like
	They for it, adore it
	So come let them enjoy it

[Missy]
Wooo, I get it hot like heat
You the MC that 'posed to scare me?
Ahhh, scream 'till my voice get hoarse
Spit on the mic, make all ya'll moist
Hey, you don't wanna fuck with me
And if you do, then you've been practicing
And no one even told you who I was
Well I'mma set it off, show you who I am
God damn, I got skills like a thief
And while you sleep I snatch out all ya teeth
Hey, you don't really want that beef
I repeat, you don't really want that beef
I said hey, you don't really want that beef
Now you know not to mess with me, hah hah
Uh uh uh uh uh, uh uh (mmm mmmm)

Repeat 1

Repeat 2 to fade
