[Zack de la Rocha]
It's a Beautiful World...we live in..
A sweet romantic place..
Beautiful people...everywhere..
The way...they show they care..
Makes me...want to say..
"It's a Beautiful World...
Oh what a Beautiful World..
For you....."

It's a wonderful time...to be here..
It's nice to be alive..
Wonderful people...everywhere..
The way...they comb their hair..
Makes me...want to say..
"It's a wonderful place..
Oh what a wonderful place..
For you..
For you..
For you..
For you..
For you..
For you..
Not me..."</mailto:krienamloh></pre>
