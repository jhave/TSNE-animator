Flow flow
Here come the Lords
Mc's with the mic cords

[Verse One] [Mr. Funkee]
I grab the microphone and rock, grab my doe and then I split
I'm too quick with my lips come and jump up on the tip
Okay okay now stop, it was fun while it lasted
Now back up little man, or get that ass blasted
You talk about a battle, psst
You big jackass
Why don't get my services, kick my black ass
You call yourself MC? C'mon you must be kiddin'
(Yo he tried to grab the mic!)
Haha, no he didn't
I'm nice, I'm known to get smooth like green velvet
They ask me, "Why so funky?" I say, "Damn, I can't help it."
MCs try to step to me but their not legit
You think you're flowin' like the Funkee Man? 
Shhhhit

[Chorus]
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on

[Verse Two] [Kid Deleon]
Back up punk, the vibes will almost put fear in you niggas
I execute the astonishing with my rap trigger
Cause I left bodies back in Texas like in the cemetary
And I'm ready to rip up shit like out of the ordinary
Like ? man, daily I'm the one who sing
No fuck that shit, I'm from the south and from a rope you'll swing
So start believin' what they're rappin' on the record YO!
They be like talkin' the mad shit, went on and check it SO!
I stay away when I can, I mean like fuck that shit
If I don't like you I walk up to you and tell you bitch
See that's the way the cowboy's do so act like you know
So call the traffic control to know which way to go
I fly that fuckin' head off like Continental
And mastered that boom bam like an oriental
I made you with your fuckin' ass you caught the vapors
And now when you takin' a shit you wipe your mouth with toliet paper

[Chorus]
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and

[Verse Three] [Doitall]
Straight from the realm of my underground madness
My mouth is on some shit now my lips need chap stick
With intro and intros only done by low tongue
Excuse me, y'all don't know us, but the Lord is are a fuckin' bum
Even if there's no church on Sunday
Praise the Lords everyday, not one day
Amen, Amen
Go ahead and get to it
(Praise the Lords!)
Yeah, you know how to do it
I got the skills that's packed and piles of stacks
And if you're wonderin', they're labeled rough raps
I give it up or should I say I gave it
So don't try to play me cause I'm not the one to play with it
I hit the skins in all types of fashion
Treat it like a sport and call the sport ass crashin'
And on the mic with the port that had a SHORT!
And ripped it down with my mad train of THOUGHT!
I'm overflowin' with skill pops and peas
So when you hear that I rap, oh Doitall please

[Mr. Funkee]
Kick it, you're such a bad bro
The Lords can't flow
(WHAT? YOUR MOTHER CAN'T FLOW!)

[Chorus]
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and

[Verse Four] [Sah-B]
Ama, amen
Can I get an amen? 
? flip trip like I was in gym (whoo!)
I got the feelin'
I'm ready to storm shit up
Warm it up, cause the form is blowin' up
Take ya take ya take ya to a new type atmosphere
Don't even worry cause you're almost there dear
Let your right brain focus on the beat
Then the left pick up the vocals on a different type frequency
Now you're ready for the test
Now here we go
Don't get nervous, cause it's easy, for real do'
I do my part as I rip shop and combine
For those who want work I get up in ya like a tampon
I know you like to hear that rated R rough shit
So I came equipped with the rhymes that don't slip
They keep comin' and comin' just like an orgasm
I feel gratification, sation when I'm grabbin'
A microphone, check one, check the two to three
Check the S.A.H. dash and check the B
You probably didn't know a female could flow as hard as this
Did I show and prove or do you wanna hear this?
As I get props
Spank and rip shop, suckers get dropped, they can't fuck with the hip hop
And how about I go break it on this part of the rhyme 
Slam the track, stop the rappin' and whine, whine, whine
Now I'm back to my ill flow
You think of steppin' to this SHHHHHHITTT
That's a no no

[Chorus]
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and

Flow flow
Flow
Flow flow
Flow
Flow flow
Flow
Flow flow
Flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and
Flow flow
On and on and on and</pre>
