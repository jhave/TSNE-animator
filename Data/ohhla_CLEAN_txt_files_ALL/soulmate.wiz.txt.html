Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Taylor Gang or die
Cloud crowd
Heavy hustlin

Yeah

Big money, small money
Short money, tall money

Soon after we locked eyes
I had a vision of me inside
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything it wants
Private school her whole life
got an infatuation with being bad
You take her out to shop and spend it all
cause she don't see them tags
I get deep inside her soul though
if she was a guitar I'd treat her like the solo
and pull my fingers through your hair
And last night was amazing
I could honestly say that you're the best I ever had
And you don't remember cause you weren't even there
but your soul was

Keep goin, just catch up on the next one
Ay
ay, ay
Ay

We don't make love, I touch your soul girl

She don't party where the rest go
You need to be able to let your hair down
so you can feel good
Girl you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car
purchase them louis bags on your own
Her parents money long
but since she grown she'd rather spend yours
I get deep inside her soul though
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo
And so you think it's too much
And even though now you figurin out how or what we shouldn't have did
to your friends you'll admit that we have fun
Okay, okay

Ay, ay
Ay, ay

Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the mayor
I'm gonna a beat top man
I'm gonna take you to never never land
When you're all dried up
here's an ocean to wet the sand
Of course I'm gonna see what's good with your fancy car

I'm relighting in the dark, to her lock I got the key
And niggas down to get a copy

Damn
How does it feel this great when you're not even here?
And you climax with the thought of me
that mean we gotta be</pre>
