[Intro][Prodigy]
Yea
It's that war shit
It's that war shit
And you know what dun

[Prodigy]
It makes you sick to hear the mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock to this
My duns' heads bop to this
We stand out like a tourist
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like pelle
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground y'all niggas like punishment
Dumpin' out full clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
Until they least expect you bringing action exactly

[Chorus]
It be the Guns,money,pussy,cars,drugs,jewels,clothes
Brawls,killings,boroughs,buildings,disease,stress,in these,N.Y.C
2X

[Havoc]
Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas go
So you can lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a jaguar nascar
And be out buck 80 on the slow mar
Hennesy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged niggas getting amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Fit to make you dance at the same time
Stop and glance 
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young shit with young mind but that quite contraire
Young nigga smart nigga
Who started from the stairs 
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
Taste test this Military shit
Bitches love this
They mans wanna dub this
Thugness it ain't easy to find
Shit like mine I'm a rare species
You's a dime a gross
That's a dozen heast the least
Keep silence the most
Regulate with the rest of my establishment
Blast out the pockets of coke
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Ironsa permanent flesh your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting
Spent most of my nights graveyard shifting
Make burial grounds be that man grim reaper
With all pleasure
Pick your feet up
Pick the heat up
Let's do it like the crematory
Make it hot make the temperature rise like mercury

[Havoc]
When I feel like getting' bent [Yo don't fuck with it dun]
Imma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs getting lost in the fog
Never to return I guess they heard god's call
And nature don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I can't have that
Pull out I try to grab that
Caught one nigga like Mahadat

[Chorus]

[Prodigy singing]
Tonight we gon' get this party early
So let's get it right</pre>
