[Intro: Hell Razah]
Maccabee Military, machine gun
Stand up... wave ya AK's with ya face bandage

[Chorus 2X: Hell Razah]
No M.C.'s original, it's nothing new fucking with Sun
Many'll call, but a few will come
This be the revolution, choose a gun
You either run with us, or choose to run
This be the Maccabee machine gun

[Hell Razah]
We was raised offa Marvin Gaye, now look at us now
We King Tuts of the modern day
Got hands like Langston Hughes, drop jewels
Like Curtis Mayfield, make gangsta blues
Black Jew rap, Sammy Davis, write a script
Like Spike Lee, to take back our forty acres
Aiyo the hood is my resident, God is my President
I still hear pops playing Duke Ellington
In the project to keep felons in, more veterans
War veterans, coming home, more heroin
More guns in the minors hand
They wanna fuck up my future plans, man

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
My revolutionary fears hell, son of Israel
Outlaw, cuz I'm known to skip bail, Maccabee watch our shit sale
My nine spit shells, out like waves to beaches
It is real as the braveheart fatal creatures
I light candles and I say thesis
Raised by G's, born in the 40's
Told me stories, none are happy
End as they all, ending gory
Told me that the same government is coming for me
So what I do? Go back to apartment, 4D
Went in my closet, grabbed the burner with the rocket
They want me, they gotta take my whole projects
Fuck ya'll, I'm in the back getting foot massages
We the realest, you all marages
Maccabee, Black Israelites, liberal life
Nights in prison, fight the system, Muslims, Jews and Christian
The hoodlum serving food in kitchens
Polishing, just try'nna full the listens
Listen up, project hallways, since the 4th grade
Since I smashed more brains, my nephew he had always
Back in the days, the track leap from the grave
To the stage, we Maccabeez, gats and trees
Yeah, gats and trees, we Maccabeez
Relax and breathe, we actually
The master is me, yo, faculty
Black fatigues, we clap at you P
U-S-S-I-Es, fuck ya'll, yeah, we Maccabeez muthafucka</pre>
