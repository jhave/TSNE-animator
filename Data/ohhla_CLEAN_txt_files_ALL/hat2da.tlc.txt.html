[Verse 1: T-Boz]
Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Nobody can make me do what I don't want to
I can be myself a lot and I'm proud of what I got
So I'll never change for you
Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Tight jeans don't hit the scene with one like me
I got to be feeling free and you better believe I'll
Do what pleases me
Yo Left Eye kick the scene

[Left Eye]
See everyday last week and not a place to go
This nut still had me dressin' like a fashion show
But not this week I'm chillin' cause it's nothin' to hide
Threw on my baggy dips and waited for my ride
He pulled up knock knock til I opened the door
Peeped my gear and started dissin' me from head to toe
But yo just to let you know, it's takin' ta
Make me wanna say gotta go, gotta go

[Chorus Chilli]
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl I am
That's the kinda girl I am
Hat 2 da back I gotta kick my pants down real low
That's the kinda girl that I am

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Here we go, here we go, here we go again
Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Some people just don't understand the things I do
(You feelin' it "D", you feelin' it)
Chillin' with the girls or kick it with the fellas
If I choose
Being that I am the kinda girl that I am
Dumb rules are left for fools
With no attitude I think my way is cool
So let me be me and continue being smooth
Yo Left Eye what's up wit' that guy?

[Left Eye]
So yo gettin' back to this dude wit' the foul attitude
Shoot he made another bad move sayin' that
Girls shouldn't wear baseball caps he can go take a hike
Cause it's the style I like yeah it's a trip
Cause somethin' hasn't yet been said
I never talked about them damn fingerwaves in his head
Tight pants and 2 rings in each ear
You know that is dead but it's me instead

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chilli]
Here we go again
That's the kinda girl I am
Don't cha know I really don't give a damn
Let me be me for me and not what I'm supposed to be
So I'm gonna do what I wanna do
Cause dumb rules are left for silly fools
That's the kinda girl that I am - ohh!
Here we go, here we go, here we go again

[T-Boz]
Some people might wonder why we're like that
Cause we're smooth
Smooth you know

[Left Eye]
Relatively speakin' I am no ordinary dip
Cause I ain't reachin' hipped
Til you be thinkin' I'm flipped
And that is ooooh on the TLC tip

1-2-3-4 y'all
Here we go again

[Chorus]</pre>
