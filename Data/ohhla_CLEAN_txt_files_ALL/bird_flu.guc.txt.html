[Intro]
Yeahhhhh - it's Gucci!
Gucci, So Icy Entertainment, Atlantic Records man
(Yeahhhhh) Let's get money man, Zaire

[Gucci Mane]
Pay me fifteen G's, your track I'll sneeze on it
Hah-choo! I'm rich, say gesundheit bitch
Please excuse me miss, pardon my French
My necklace look like Crist', your diamonds look like piss
I spent a quarter million dollars just to look like this
In the kitchen cookin chickens, tryin to pay my rent
Got a cockeyed Bent', and a bowlegged Benz
Pigeon-toed Aston Martin with the off set rims
I'm not like them, I done outshined him
I done flatlined him, Gucci I'm still here
Gucci don't drink beer, but he does drink Dom
Hundred thousand dollar murder charge I made bond
It's Gucci!

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I got bird flu shawty, sellin bird's my business (yeah)
Catch that bird flu shawty, that's a terrible sickness (yeah)
I got bird flu shawty, in the summer it's Christmas (yeah)
Catch that bird flu shawty, nigga handle your business (it's Gucci!)

[Gucci Mane]
My chain got pneumonia and watch got the measles
Sellin like the Beatles and my jewelry game Skittles
Bird flu victim, your wife got sicker
See I ain't even trippin, cause I cain't even miss it
Gucci Mane lady, crazy karat Jakey
I'm livin like Baby, more soldiers than the Navy
It's Gucci Mane Laflare baby how 'bout that?
Make it rain on the stage leave yo' stage show wet
Sip Canary Moet, same hue my 'Vette
Gucci Mane how you? Shawty iced out too
It's Gucci!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci done it, does it, charm Ruben Studdard
That's colored, covered, that's flooded, studded
Ring Lynard, Skynard, watch sherbert, pervert
Whip flagrantly foreign, it's an Aston Martin
If you tricks didn't notice, watch me don't lose focus
Trap boys get bricks, athletes gets trophies
Gucci Mane get cake, it's my birthday party
Want a sweet sixteen? That's two times forty
Watch look like Diddy's, chain look like 50's
Gucci Mane fuck with me, shawty I move chickens
Shawty I do live it, wanna take ad lib it
I'm so hood with it, you hip-hop critic
It's Gucci

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uhh, uhh
