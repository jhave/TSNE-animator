[ Eightball ]
Eightball, MJ-G, Swizz on the beat
We from the streets, come with the heat
[ MJG ]
Come back with gritty hardcore, sweep
Touch streets who, sleep all damn week

Get crunk and buck, get crunk with us
Turn it up a notch with that country thump
[ MJG ]
We spread funky stuff, I know you want your stuff
Got the beat and it's tough, you can't take it, too much

Your body achin too much, trick, you're fakin too much
Talkin bad 'bout your people, player-hatin too much

[ Eightball ]
This for all my niggas, this for all my bitches
Space Age 4 Eva, Eightball, my nigga
Memphis Tenn. I'm from, you can call me a titan
Hot rhymes I'm writin, burnin niggas that's bitin
Platinum flows I bust, ice cold is us
You can give me the hay and you can keep the dust
I like em yellow and stout, pretty face no doubt
Not scared to use they mouth, know what I'm talkin 'bout
I hustle for change, remain the same
Change the game, cut the chains
Tight flows is wet, much deep respect
Don't sweat the hood, gotta collect checks
8Ball's my name, y'all all the same
Y'all ball the same, y'all fall the same
We came to kick it, you submit and quit it
Try to cut it and split it, ain't nothin new, hit it
Yeah

[ CHORUS ]

[ MJG ]
Be off in them streets, cause them streets is in me
I be puffin on En-do-nesia indeed
It don't come with no seeds, it don't come with no sticks
It don't come with no extra added chemical mix
Never run with them tricks, I keep it pimpin and shit
I kill, and, dissect a bitch
I wreck the shit, mic-check your shit
1-2-3 - go, let the shit
Get you crunker than crunk, make it bump in your trunk
Let me see, all, women shakin their rump
Put your back in a hump, start touchin your toes
Eightball, M-J-G supposed
To come out harder than hard, plus realer than real
I stack, and, build skill for skill
Got you noddin your head, got you movin your feet
Ain't no way you can stay in your seats
When I
