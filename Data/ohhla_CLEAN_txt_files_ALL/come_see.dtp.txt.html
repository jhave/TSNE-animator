[Smoke]
I'm the cookie monster, from Seasame Street with big
Yellow birds for sale you need chicks I keep bricks
I'm the boss, They workin' I sit back and make calls
Movin' keys I never seen like Stevie and Ray Charles
Like bodybuilders, we move weight, from da weed to da yay
Servin' more O'z than Omarion and B2K
My birds don't got wings, I have to package 'em
I wish they could fly, then I wouldn't have to traffik 'em
That uncut base, they'll be back like Ma$e
Take it to the kitchen, whip it, watch it come back like New edition
Bricks... I got 'em lower than them, The nigga that sold it to you
I sold it to the nigga that sold it to him

[Chorus: Smoke]
Come and see me, if you want dat hard or dat blow
I got 'em 16, half for 8, quarters for 4
Come and see me, if you want a block of dat D
I never drought, I always got it homey holla at me
Come and see me, if you wanna cop you a brick
Just place an order, Hit me on my celly or on my hip
Come and see me, if you wanna cop you a key
Got what you want, got what you need, my nigga holla at me
Come and see me..

[Stat Quo]
Holla at 'em, birds bag 'em, move 'em, pass 'em, in a wagon
Down the strip, gotta have 'em, lanes nappin while we trappin
Wonder how the come up happen folk, rappin, hammer blastin'
Geek, monsters, plenty action, servin, working'
Bread stackin' folk, Heroin, Exstacy, Purple, and Coke
Got people that own boats, In Miami ya know
One hit and you float, My workers never come up short
They knowin it toat
Don't gotta market and promote 'em, never broke
So many J's, so many ways, so many hoods for me to slang, Mane!
Wrappin' work is operation shoe string, Mane!
I'ma tie up and lace the market wit dat Cane

[Chorus]

[Smoke]
We got shit you stick in vein, brick of Cane
Dubs, Dimes, to Nicks of Jane
Ask my fiends da shit you name it
Ain't shit that you can't get, cause we got it
Blocks like Lego, white like Mayo
Pills in all flavors come taste the rainbow
I camp wit a *unit* of G's, *50* deep
Wit *Bank* rolls of *Bucks* in *The Game* dealin' *Yayo*
Got boy by the balloon, gallons of that sizzurp
Got regiment, green and purp, got 16 years of bizzurb
Erybody know me, so do like Dorthy
Folow the yellow brick road, to the Wizard of O-Z

[Chorus]</pre>
