Typed by: AZ Lyrics

All I ever wanted was lights, camera, action
People staring at night cameras flashin
Living the movie now be prepared to see the last scene
All I want is the pretty woman for the casting
Wanna confront him, put your money where your mask is
You a chump talk guns but you scared to blast his
Buy them bottles by the case, we don't gota chase
For the love of money we in a million dollar race
Windows done tinted niggas hate em but I fish bowl
So I can letchyo hoe see me while I'm in it
See I ain't got a deal
But everybody know that I ain't kinda real
I'm hundred dollar bill authentic yeahhh
Hotel room, marijuanas in it chevy watchin the game
Yo bitch she rollin me planes
Passport payin my dividence for the fame
Mind in the gutter you niggas ain't in my lane

[Hook]
This is not the life I chose but it's the life that chose me
The money got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes the cars and clothes living life is all I know
I found my lane and now I'll change for nothing
There's only one way to gooooo

Now they cop the mixtapes n watch my videosss
Maybe cause I got bars like a seriallllllllll... code
Louie pouch full of pre-rolled
Mouth full of kush, mind on my zero
Hoes always thought I was cute but would speak though
Know they see me they be jockin on my steelo
On a private ride higher than a ski slope
I'm just flyin haters try n cut my wings though whoa
Now they see us n wana be us
I'm partyin n poppin bottles
With models to meet and greet us
Fuck her, follow n retweet us
In the sky so my nigga keep up

[Hook]
I don't know where this road will go cause my life is crazy but I ain't changin baby
This is not the life I chose but it's the life that chose me
The money got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes the cars and clothes living life is all I know
I found my lane and now I'll change for nothing
There's only one way to gooooo</pre>
