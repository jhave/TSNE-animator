[Hell Razah]
The Sunz of Man-sion, has been opened up
The door is open, yeah, yeah

It's like, beware of biochips, I share hits
harder than slavewhips like I waited to get tips
From Egypts to seaships, to bein chased by New York
cops out the precincts, and words was bricks
We buildin projects to pyramids, evil kid
I destroy your ass like London Bridge, smoke trees of weed
Take off the leaves out the twigs, pure truth is what I got to give
a lot to live for, you ain't rich before poor
It ain't peace without poor, how would stand without a floor
under, over, toxicated, sober
Younger, older you're elevated, higher than a Empire State
Elevators I roll with creators and cremators
Stalkin through this nature, the heaven raise ya
Capacity in your brains beyond the clouds of rain
Seven and a half are contained
Space was my birthplace, meditate in cocoons
Now see snakes in human costumes...

[Killah Priest]
Expand your mind (4X)
In time... in time...

[Father Lord]
Call this, the blind man talk, cripple man walk
See nor hear not summon as Lord
Divident per segment def unseen beings
speak no evil to all I see, tappin into the
worlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation
Situation on lives from state to state
Rent to pay, state debate, contract dates
Cheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure
Washing my robe in the blood of the lamb, constant plan
Never strayin New York cause I rock supreme forever for I can never
?blackring? on the ?axspring? the ghetto compact
Put em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath
increase accelerate the Sun behind you radiate, to burn to ashes
Ain't one of the parties you been crashing
Bring the beat and I'ma slash it
My niggaz make sure the doors have been barricaded
It's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ?block spin?
But make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts                      
redrum mania reincarnate to another shape
Bomb flashes, what can happen, New Jack-in
Your rappin ain't the Magnum so when he cought up to half these
niggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion

[Killah Priest]
Expand your mind
Seek and you shall find

Walkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man
Knowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway
through a long dark hallway
Use your concious as a compass to avoid bein conquered
by nonsense, use your subconcious as a map
Once it's time to head back use your food for thought
and leave breadtracks
Now we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly
You need common sense as a detour
Up ahead there lies three doors for you to see more
you might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard
Understandin is your flashlight
It reflects the windows to your past life
No psychiatrics could raid you from off the mattress
As you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips
cause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative
which is always competitive; therefore
you must never let it live

Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind, seek and you shall find
Expand your mind, seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind
Seek and you shall find
Expand the mind...</pre>
