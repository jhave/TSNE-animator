Yeah man, it's the world famous, DJ Clue Desert Storm

Jigga-man, ya heard me?

Ain't I?

I'mma... I'mma... I'mma

Ain't I, Ain't I, Ain't I

I'mma hustlers hustler

Your favorite, ain't I
Ain't I, Ain't I, Ain't I

I'm still winnin' and I'm no where near finished
It's just the first inning, and I'm gunning for the pennant
And I been this, God made me, y'all hate me, y'all A-the-ist
Ya'll safety is at risk
It's the return of the messiah
One and only Hov
Nah I ain't God, but I've been made in his mold
So when the story is told let it be said I refuse to fold
I only fold bread, I stood for the best, I owed no debt
I represent the hood 'til my dying breathe
I took a pay cut to become an exec
So the next muh-fucka can earn his paycheck.
And even though these niggas talk greasy 'bout me
Ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me.
Ask these niggas if they want stets involved
And even if they don't like me, they respect the God...

I'm Hustlers poster child, I'm 'posed to style
I ain't got nothin' to prove I'm 'posed to smile
I ain't insecure, I'm 'vested in a piece of Carol's Daughter
I'm in Sephora
Bricks are insignificant to him
He's a grown man, you're an infant to him
Take your baby money and burn, T-Ha
I spent that on furniture
I got warhols on my halls walls!
I got Basquiats in the lobby of my spot!
I'm so sophisticatedly hood, S.Carter cashmere premium goods
Thousand dollars for the sneaks
Timbo on the track
Two-Fifty for the beat, G4 back and forth 'til my flow seats
I spent a couple mil just to lose to the heat...

Anything you aspire, to acquire I got
Any gun you say, you fired, I shot Any type of paraphenalia, I am the seller
I guess you're sayin' that's how I started Roc-A-Fella
Feds all fed up
DEA can't tell the dirty money from a Roc-A-Wear sweater.

And I'm never ever going back, back
Oh never that, never that
And I'm never ever going back, back
Oh never that, oh never that

I'm clean as a whistle, official gotta way
I'm the king of all kings, it's official
