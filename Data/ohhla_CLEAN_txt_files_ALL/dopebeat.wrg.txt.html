(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G

Y'all know me, the G from the 213
LBC, Regulatin, skatin' on all them Dayton's
Bankin' back on them singles
With the Henney's and the Jimmy's
Like I'm all tall, short, and like dark, thick and skinny
I'm a ladies' man, Mercedes and
Proper ice, livin' nice, as far as gravy stands
Ain't nuttin' changed, me and Snoop's still the same
Plus Nate droppin' weight with the classic thang
Now I remember way back, at the bachelor set
Slip my brother, Dre, Snoopa tape it, put it in the deck
The party started bangin' and they both shook hands
And made it legitimate for the G-Funk Fans
Now after that, they hit the top when The Chronic dropped
Remember 187 on the motherfuckin' cop(I wanna)
It's Still A G Thang (with my), where we hang and claim
East Side 'til I die, or I rise to fame

(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G

I got my own style, I got my own pal
If you don't know now, then nigga, you better slow down
Spendin bills, bendin' wheels, people think I steal
Puttin' cameras in my grill everywhere I chill
Kick back, I spit facts, and twist our tracks
Drank gin with The Twinz, see a bitch I mack
Cuz if I ain't in the studio, I'm deep in the hood
Anyway gettin' paid like Warren should
Dre teachin' me to work a beat, now I'm bangin'
And I been with platinum, now my album slangin' (I wanna)
Hangin' with my G's (with my) from the LBC
With the homies that I know will put it down for me
Well known, keep my chrome, and I hold my own
But I'd rather roll and flow and be holdin' the shows
With the G-Funk Family earnin' a Grammy
You can't see what I see, and don't understand me

(Chorus x2)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G(I wanna)
A dope beat(with my), a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G

I'm on my way to the studio, beatin and thumpin
Scoop D from Long Beach got some heat from Compton
Hit the Eastside manages to see whats crackin
Got some MGD, just watching for jackin
Its a hard knock life, ya heard Jay-Z featuring Annie
No Limit like Snoop, thats when the grammy
Hit the Beach in the Long gray and black caddy
Reminiscing on my great escapes through the alley
Damn I done grew up and things done changed
Just shakin my head, trippin off the game
Its so much you gotta do to keep it real out here
But ain't nothing guaranteed cuz ain't nothing goin' give

(Chorus x3 to fade)
I need a dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G
A dope beat, a dope beat
Just holler at your boy named Warren G</pre>
