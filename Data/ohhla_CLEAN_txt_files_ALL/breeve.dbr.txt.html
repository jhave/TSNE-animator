[Da Brat]
I Don't stop, I stay hot, y'all stay shocked, we keep it locked
Just throw yo hands in the air motherfuckas
I came to make y'all freak one another
I, I keep bangin', I keep slangin'
We keep watching niggas die for simple things
So I keep swingin', fuckin' a nigga head up
Dead up, I'm fed up feel my lead bust

[22]
Now I don't stop, but I smoke weed
I ain't gotta pop rocks no more I got G's
Just wave you hands from side to side
Cause we gone show keep it live
We got greed in our eyes, I keep spittin', I keep rippin' 
I keep women, I creep and keep hittin'
They impressed with my shoe size, deuce I'm with you tonight
Girl if you do it right, me and you can do it twice

[Da Brat]
When I'm called on to bust, wanna get yo brawl on with us
Can't ball with us, too hard to touch
22 fuckin' up they callin' us

[22]
Im the first one off the bus, got nuts to lust
They keep rushin' for status, some more than you got it 
All for cabbage as far as we got it

[Da Brat]
So don't push me, I'm too close to the edge
Bout to go loco on these niggas, leave'em for dead, and

[22]
When it's time for us, bitch we diamond cut
I'm 22, We West-Chi

[Da Brat]
And I'm da motherfuckin' Brat right

Hook:  (say 2x)

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours 

[22]
When I hit the door, nigga best move, guess who
We ain't got no dress shoes, just a couple scarves and a vest too 
Test who why you trippin' we came to party 
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody 
Gotta be hard, women they love to touch it
And when I fuck 'em they hypnotized
Sprung cause I hit it right, tongue tied sometimes
Like Zinfandel wine, got they mind blown
In my zone, I'm a grown man, gone I ain't tryin' to keep her 
She got nice features, but so do Mesha, Imma keep creepin' 
Keep getting deeper they playa hate me all of a sudden
A new kid bussin', you hear it hush and she
Scared to cut___fuckin' too many hoes, me I got
Twenty hoes, I'ma hoe, be a hoe, spend the dough, see a show
Let it be known playa west to east
Cause I'm the dog that fell in love with the Georgia Peach
 
Hook

[Da Brat]
I heard you wanna hit this twat, nigga I thought not
Fell up in the party with a phat knot, glock cocked
Got too much of my own shit to stop 
And look for niggas, when I make any dick rock
Shook them niggas, took all they cheese, still they say
They body's callin' for me, wanna go half on a seed and shit
Fuck that, I got half on the weed and shit and I'm Brat
One of a kind of my breed and shit and you can find me
On the West Side of Chi with my thieving click, believe a bitch
Cause ain't no nigga hated on the pussy yet
Squeeze the dick, got grip, they can't forget
Ain't a hoe tight like me, flow tight like me
Quote, write and recite, fuck all night like me
They say is she is or is she ain't a dyke
You curious cause you wanna fuck me tonight
