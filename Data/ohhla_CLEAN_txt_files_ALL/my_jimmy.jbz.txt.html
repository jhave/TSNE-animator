(Intro):
A B C D E F G H I
Hey, do you know what letter comes after I
"What do the Jungle Brothers call it? The jimbrowski"
"It's jimmy, it's jimmy"

Hook (Jungle Brothers):
She always cry when I tell her that I'll be goin' back on the road again
Tears in her eyes tell me that I'm the man someday she'll be marryin'

Verse 1 (Afrika):
Beggin' me to bring you back home
Out wonderin' why why ya home all alone
Feenin' for the jimmy, feenin' for my love
Fixed and addicted to each other like a drug
Nothin' like some acid or some ecstacy
I give you pieces of my love so you'll remember me
Love letters in the mail show me that you still care
I reminisce about the kiss that turned into a love affair
I tell you now I didn't mean to do you harm
But your love was gettin' to me and my jimmy
"got hot when I..."

(Bridge):
My jimmy weighs a ton (4X)

Verse 2 (Mike G.):
Mike G the honey hunter not at all the honey sweater
Chillin' on the corner when I have ?
Sweet, sweet ? only angels look betta
But I ain't that jet so I best to go get her
Hey ? she said what you want it to be
Cause I've been waitin' a while for you to come get with me
Oooh, ahhh, she touched my heart
This could be the sign of a wonderful start
Cause my love is that deep
To some it is a treat
Playin' me for keeps
Ball and chain at my feet
But I got a curfew
But baby I don't want to have to hurt you
She said she want to run away with me
But that can't be (Nah, G)
Cause I was sixteen and she was twenty-three

Hook (female singer):
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be goin' back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you're the man someday I'll be marryin'

Uhhhh, uhhhh, uhhhhh
"Got hot when I...."

(Bridge):
My jimmy weighs a ton (4X)

Verse 3 (Afrika):
Love is a gamble, life is a lesson
By golly when I met you you made a good impression
on me
You wasn't all about playin' those games
(She wasn't all about playin' those games)
You said I wanna be your girl, get to know ya
But I already got a girl I told ya
She said You got the love that I want now bring it to me
She caught me off guard, I started singin' to her

Hook (female singer):
I always cry when you tell me that you'll be goin' back on the road again
Tears in my eyes tell me that you're the man someday I'll be marryin'

"J-I-M-B-R-O-W-S-K-I"

"Got hot when I..."

(Bridge):
My jimmy weighs a ton (3X)
