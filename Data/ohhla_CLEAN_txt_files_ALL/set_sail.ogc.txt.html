Chorus: Hennyville
  
Set Sail off, we going to the world
Living in no fear, so hold on to your girl
Lovely in naps, I got no time for curls
Cause', nothing can stop this like Duke of Earl
  
Set Sail off, we going to the world
Living in no fear, so hold on to your girl
Lovely in naps, I got no time for curls
Cause', Destination: MFC, the world
  
[Hennyville]
  
I puff la 'til I die, mommy don't ask why
I roll up and puff, and put it down like such
And roll another Dutch, this nigga never get enough
It sounds wicked, like when ya Ville's still pack a biscuit
A free week from studio and shows
All I needs is me a check, and extra ends or dough
Run up in my hoe, bang her walls
Then I, bust off cause' I can't take no more
Then I, flee with my p-e-o-p-l-e
With love up in my background, yellin, "Come back Henny!"
A nigga 550 in an off-way Milleni-um
I made a promise, told her, "I'll be back, come gimme some." (Mwwah)
That's the way it's supposed to fly
Either with me or against me, until I die
'Ville Slug kill jugs of Henny, puffing plenty
If I see some love in the street I like
I tell her, "Gimme some."
  
Chorus
  
[Top Dog]
  
My day starts, my mission moves me closer to the door
It's sunny outside, yo son, say no more
My chest achin' from the smoke that I was takin', in
Yo, please pass no green weed again
Because it's nasty, I don't give a fuck, let it pass me
The last one that gave me that shit, must of been gassed, B
Sayin, "Just smoke." That's all that y'all do
I read it up in THE SOURCE, in VIBE arti-cle, hard to do
The things that come naturally, how can it be?
Police is coming after me!
Driving my whip, I had to put out my spliff
Crack the rooftop, and let all the smoke go out
  
Chorus
  
[Starang Wondah]
  
Aye yo, niggas tried to play my crew
And got they ass chewed-up
We out here like eighteen-deep (all crewed up)
It was hot outside, I had my shirt off (tatooed up)
Last time I came around (had to fuck some dude up)
My mom said, "Damn, boy I think ya heads screwed up."
But now we MFC for life, you know how we do chumps
Yo nigga stay flippin' (why?) Cause' Starang stay whippin'
Something nice for me and my MFC to sit in
Aye yo, all my gangbangin' niggas everywhere, bang-on
My West-Coast niggas, I'll be there soon, hang-on
Niggas mad at Dru and Buck, cause them niggas put Starang on
See me in the streets, now bitches wanna clang on, my dick
See my face up in the mix
I push a GS4 now, but I be pushin' a 6
That nigga Starang Wondah (William H.) Fuck a Hummer!
I'ma push this LP (and push another next summer)</pre>
