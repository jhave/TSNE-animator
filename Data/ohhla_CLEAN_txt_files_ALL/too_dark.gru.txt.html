It's yo man Guru. Building right now in the lab
with the god Solar. Tuning you in like so not
tracking you down. Niggaz tried to dome my shine
but now my shit is crazy bucked up

[Chorus]
*It's gettin all, too dark to see.*
Too dark to see, what I need to be. And you know
*I can't use it any more.*
We need the streets to peace. (2X)

[Verse 1]
Fake friends tried to keep me down, life tried to beat me down
I bounced back nigga, and nothing can defeat me now
The game had me twisted, angry and upset
About to take it all risk it, crash and burn like a jet
But I live for this, yes I was made for this
I acrificed for this, and there is nothing I would trade for this
So every ghetto I walk through, every person I talk to
Could feel me, bringing life like I ought to

[Chorus]
*It's gettin all, too dark to see.*
Too dark to see, what I need to be. And you know
*I can't use it any more.*
We need the streets to peace
*It's gettin all, too dark to see.*
Too dark to see, what I need to be. And you know
*I can't use it any more.*
The fights, the mic, my life

[Verse 2]
See I'm a strong man, you try to play me I'm the wrong man
And when I spit, it's like smacking you with long hands
You can't bury me with jealousy
I got soul, watch me move the crowd, check my melody
Mysery loves company, that's what they say
So all you lame ass niggaz, stay the fuck away
Mad rooms filled with snakes waiting to suck my energy
They explode at the dust, just another bad memory

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I heard it all son, from threats to straight lies
Any problems, I'm rolling with vex to take lifes
I ain't want it like that, but I be damn If I don't
Preserve and protect, and what's a man if he won't
That's why right now I'm on the next page boy
You don't really want to take it to the next phase boy
My struggle prepared me, that's why you all leary
You thought you was *Bruce Almighty* like Jim Carrey

[Chorus]</pre>
