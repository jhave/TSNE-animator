[ShaCronz]
What... I got bullets that'll touch your brain
It takes nothing for me to fuck your dame
Remember me from "Hatin' Don't Pay", pa, nothing's change
Pushing heavyweights, still weighing a buck and change
Soaking wet, rock whole diamonds, no cuts in the chains
Let's get the jumped off jumped off, where the chicks at?
You see a nigga with a nice 'what', nigga get that
Young rich cat, pitch crack, you against me is a missmatch
I spit murder, and sip canteens, back like six gats, so what up homey
You out of luck homey, still don't give a fuck, homey
Ride with the heat on me, in a big truck, homey
Cadillac, Escalades, you still getting stuck, homey
Got clientele like a weed spot, henny'd up
Creep blocks, with the heat cocked
Semi's bust, after that, all beef stop

"Wanting respect..." - Ghostface Killah

[Chorus: Freemurda (ShaCronz)]
Catch cars on the interstate
Move heroin, on the interstate
Heat toke cars on the interstate
ShaCronz gonna win this case, crawls all on his face
He pour Don on this bitch's face
(What is it?) This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
(What is it?) Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga

[ShaCronz]
Don't give a fuck who you are, my crew get down and murder ya
Change positions, move around like furniture
Inviting all hoes, you can slide with me
Party with Tory, or ride with Free
Peep the scenery, you know who my team be
Light reefer, know how to deuce on the green bee
With wife beaters, fuck envy's, don't like cheaters
If I can't get in, with my sweats and Timbs
I'm a hood nigga, I live in the projects with a Benz
Ain't like ya average rap nigga, still keeping gats, niggaz
Post up like Shaq, on the block, with crack niggaz
Spin ones, all that, and then some
Turn, shoot, shot in your face, and one

[Freemurda]
This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga
This is Brooklyn, Middle, nigga
Brooklyn, 6-7, Middle, nigga
