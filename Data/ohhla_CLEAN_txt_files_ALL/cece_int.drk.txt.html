[Drake]
All night I've, been starin
Can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open
There's nothin, I won't do oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhh
Just thought you should know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohhhh

[Chorus: Drake]
That's when you start to laugh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Sayin I just want what I can't have (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Won't even give me a chance (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Claimin I'm just not as serious as you, shorty if you only knew
This is serious (serious)

[Drake]
Uhh..
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy

[Chorus]

[instrumental w/ guitar solo for 34 seconds]
