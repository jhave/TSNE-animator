[Chorus] - X 2
You know it's hard out here on a G
All these gang injuctions and the penitentiary
Gotta watch these snitches and witnesses
cause Arnold Swastika, I mean Schwarzenegger
got us facin' life sentences

[W.C.]
That's why I'm in this shit and spit it like a lugi
Schooled by niggaz raised under the umbrella held by Tookie
And I ain't leavin 'til they cuff me and book me
Strap me to a jail, take my life away like Tookie
Strap kept under the seat, 'cause niggaz can't kill these streets
And in these streets the gutter is me
Like wheat bread leanin' on peanut butter is me
House shoes and a Benz, ain't a nigga gutter as me
Shots to all the gillas and killas lovin' a G
From Down South to Chi-Town or up in the D
And to you lames who ain't fuckin' with me, I ain't trippin'
This is for my niggaz  slangin' them P's and cuttin' the D

[Chorus]
(From the school of hard knocks, I took the G class)
(C'mon, clipped up, pimped up, neea)
(From the school of hard knocks), (Blow yo' ass off the map)
(Stacey Adams tip spiffed up, golf hat flipped up)
You know it's hard out here on a G
All these gang injuctions and the penitentiary
Gotta watch these snitches and witnesses
cause Arnold Swastika, I mean Schwarzenegger
got us facin' life sentences

[W.C.]
W.C., I come with no bullshit introduction
No tail tuckin', no dick suckin', no false identity
No sympathy, no lyin' about my street credibility
No fake gang stories, no fakin' for the fame or glory
No fakin' of claimin' the territory
But when confronted by reputables, niggaz changin' they stories
Fag niggaz, you could get mad nigga
But the truth is the truth, I ain't no kiss ass nigga
I'm a stomp down nigga, Chuck tongue down nigga
Leave yo' ass on the steering wheel slumped down nigga
Pistol pumpin' down niggaz, quick to bust a round nigga
Bust a U and turn around nigga, dump now nigga
Dub make the thang knock, flame go pop
Throw slugs and that shit you niggaz rappin' bout you ain't got
Goodnight motherfuckers, it's curtains for you
soft ass Brian McKnight nice soundin' motherfuckers

[Chorus]
(From the school of hard knocks, I took the G class)
(C'mon, clipped up, pimped up, neea)
(From the school of hard knocks), (Blow yo' ass off the map)
(Stacey Adams tip spiffed up, golf hat flipped up)
You know it's hard out here on a G
All these gang injuctions and the penitentiary
Gotta watch these snitches and witnesses
This Arnold Swastika, I mean Schwarzenegger
got us facin' life sentences
You know it's hard out here on a G
All these gang injuctions and the penitentiary
Gotta watch these snitches and witnesses
This Arnold Swastika, I mean Schwarzenegger
got us facin' life sentences</pre>
