[ DD ] Who is? Relax, sweetheart, I know what I am doin

[ DD ] Yeah, sure
	 So what are you tryin to say?

You said you'll be gentle with me
And I hope you will

[ YY ] Ooh, and next?
[ DD ] We'll try to do the wild thing by the sea
[ YY ] Na-ah, see look, Dazzie, you act like that's all there is
[ DD ] Let's not be silly, you know I care about you
[ YY ] Really? And besides, whenever we're together you don't act right

[ YY ] Cause when it comes to this I must resist
	 Hey look, straight up, it's like this

And I'm ???
Waiting for you to walking in
I tried so hard to relax
But I..
I just can't keep still
No

[ YY ] Now first of all, we kiss and hold hands and that's all great
[ DD ] So now I guess it's time to make love? 
[ YY ] Ah-ah, see now wait
	 See, I can't have a boyfriend that don't spend time to be with all of me
[ DD ] But I do..
[ YY ] Not the kind of star that try to try to dog me
[ DD ] No but it's not like that
	 See, I'm the other kind, the soft and nice type
	 Then I like to quickly make a moment when the mood's right
[ YY ] It's real fun, we're by ourselves when we're together
	 But if we wait (wait?) it'll be much better
[ DD ] Yeah, whatever..
[ YY ] So why all the rush, it doesn't matter where we do it
[ DD ] Cause you're my sweetheart and the only one I wanna groove with
[ YY ] Okay, shall we hold on or shall we let go?
	 Step off and go?
[ DD ] Nah, heck no
[ YY ] Why? 
[ DD ] Cause you're special
[ YY ] So why all the rush to the bedroom, I really don't know you
[ DD ] Yeah, you're right, but here's the perfect time to

[ DD ] But it's not true
[ YY ] So what you wanna do?

You said you'll be gentle with me
And I hope you will</pre>
