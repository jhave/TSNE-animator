(Verse 1 -Squeak Ru)
Flossin thru my city in a coupe
You see the indo locked my brain and sippin 80 [???]
Today I gots to get loose
I mash the gas on that ass
So when I [???] I crash the roof
[???] on my menue, I'm lowridin, Westsidin cuz that's the shit I'm into
I never fucked wit the phonies
I keep my shot to the real, never hooker over homie
[Catch your dime and dollar ?], I can make you hollar
Girls break they necks when I'm in it in impala
I like they [can at they pants ?]
Girls wit the big ol' butts, I can make you dance

Chorus:
I can make you dance, I can make you dance, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to
I can make you dance, I can make you dance, baby, baby
I can make you dance if you want me to

(Verse 2 -Squeak Ru)
Now Westside Connect is the shit
And can't none of y'all niggas get wit it
And if you think that we clubbin
Fuck all the [thuggin ?]
We got to [pull file ?????], come on

(Verse 3 -Binky Mack)
It's Binky Mack, so throw up the W when you see me

Connect got my back plus I got the checkin
Representin it to the fullest
So a [follow ?] me [???] affiliate

In the coupe wit my cousin [Soup ?] as we parlay
Sippin on some orange juice that's mixed wit the Tanqueray
Trickin, never let, nigga, I'm a OG, hoe
Westside Connect wit the rips and the B-dogs
It's all good wit the tracks that I'm in [???]
Gangstas straight boogie but I want y'all hoes dancin

Chorus

(Verse 4 -Mack 10)
Well, the party didn't started till I walked in
And I probably won't leave the [v- ?] end
So in the meantime I stays to the grind
So you sell yo work and I sell mine
Wit the [world of ?] cream, we can all have green
I got the bomb hemp [beat ?]
Sellin sack for a [???]
Blue and Red wavin money and it's strange to me
Cuz everybody in the house screamin Dub-S-C
Since gangstas don't dance, I get my boogie on
[???] a few bitches and sell a few phones
So the weed all [grown ?] and everybody [blazin one ?]

My nigga Bink and Squeak will lock the B in

It's the nigga Mack 10 wit AllFrumThaI

Chorus
Mack 10 and AllFrumThaI
