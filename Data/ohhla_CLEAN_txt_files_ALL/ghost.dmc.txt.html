	GHOSTBUSTERS!
I ain't afraid of no ghosts (3X)
	GHOSTBUSTERS!

[Run]	Something strange goin on
	Something's wrong
[DMC]	Gloom in the room
	Outside is the storm
	All alone in the crib
	Watchin the tube
[Run]	Yo-o-o-o is that what I think?
	Did I see somethin move?
[DMC]	Chill down your spine
	Your heart fills with fright
	Not filled by the things
	that GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT
	They walk through the walls
	With no time to stall
[Run]	You call the GHOSTBUSTERS
	Well that's who you call!

	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	We ain't-we ain't-we
	We ain't afraid of no ghosts
	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	We ain't-we ain't-we
	We ain't afraid of no ghosts
	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	We ain't-we ain't-we
	We ain't afraid of no ghosts
	GHOSTBUSTERS!
[Run]	Stop! UHH!
[DMC]	Bridge
[Run]	Hit it!

	I-I ain't, I-I ain't
	I ain't afraid of no ghosts
	I, I-I ain't afraid
	I-I ain't, I-I ain't
	I-I-I, I-I-I ain't afraid of no ghosts

	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	GHOSTBUSTERS!

[Run]	All alone on the phone
	so whassup with that noise?
	The wife's at work and I'm no jerk
	and I just left my boys
	? at school and I'm no fool
	and I got no time to waste
	So you get up and call, don't trip and fall
	Go outside and leave the place
	Now it's no dream because you seein
	a shadow in the night
	But we will come and get it done
	so don't worry save your fright
	Now there's a group who likes to troop
	and you know you can trust us
	So don't get nervous cause at your service
	the local GHOSTBUSTERS!

	I ain't afraid of no ghosts
	I ain't I ain't afraid of no ghosts (2X)
	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	I ain't afraid of no ghosts
	I ain't I ain't afraid of no ghosts (2X)
	GHOSTBUSTERS!

[DMC]	Aight aight aight
	I remember the time, I visited the grave
	My life on the line, only my life to save
	All by myself, with no one around
	Did not understand a hand comin out the ground
	I knew it wasn't mine, it was somebody else
	But I didn't care G, I just screamed for HELP!
	Then - GHOSTBUSTERS - had strapped to their back
	Screamin - GHOSTBUSTERS - those 'busters attacked
	"We are your friendly neighborhood ghostbusters,"
	that's what they said to me
	"We are the busters of an ?, G-H-O-S-T"

	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	I ain't-I ain't-I ain't
	I ain't afraid of no ghosts
	GHOSTBUSTERS!
	I ain't-I ain't-I ain't
	I ain't afraid of no ghosts

[Run]	Howling haunting
[DMC]	Scaring screaming
[Run]	Ghostly ghosts
[DMC]	Ghouling demons!
[Run]	Monsters spooks
[DMC]	Werewolves and devils
[Run]	All those things
[DMC]	on the same level
[Run]	Nightmares (bad dreams) cannot be beat
	It takes a brave man (to stand in defeat)
	Must be the bravest (yo, the bravest and most)
	You must be able to say, "I ain't afarid of no ghosts"
[DMC]	A good sense of humor, is important to have
	When a ghost tries to scare you (ha, don't make me laugh)
	They be dustin off ghosts, like true ghost-dusters
[both]	Go, go, go, go, ghoooooosstbusters!

	GHOSTBUSTERS!

[D.M.C.]
Busters, busters!
One time in the house
Peace to everybody out there
We love ya, peace
