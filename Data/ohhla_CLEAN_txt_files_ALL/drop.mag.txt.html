Awww lord guess who's coming
Timbaland A.K.A freaky Phil Drummond
Who can get it crunk like me Timbaland
Oh my nigga Scoop A.K.A fat man
Weed guaranteed to make the party people bounce
Fellas say (OH) girls say(ah)
Lookin at the cornrows up in the club
Girl don't be bashfull girl back it up
Throw it girl like its poking man
Shake that ass as fast as you can
White girl shake it like she burning from a sun tan
My dog grip it grab it like it was a soda can
What you talking bout holding back
When you get on the dance floor drop it like it was a cadillac
What you talking bout cutting nigga slack
girl girl you betta bend that back
12 my girls roll deep in the club
Cant't wait to hit the bar and get that thug
Where my dogs that got more than a hundred bucks
Cant wait to freak one of the big old butts
Before we start to turn it out
you must learn to crunk out
Before we start to turn it out
You must first begin to

Get your freak on at club(?)
We aint put the album out niggas got their leak on
I done  been up in the club seen a ho with a thong
I aint hear good at first she was singing the song
Shorty rocking donna she was pushing and popping
Red bone with a bop she was stoping and dropping
Stopping and dropping this the part of the song where
You need be snaking and popping
Snaking and popping yeah hoe Mag made the song
Yall niggas still popping and locking
Aint no zone (?) a white girl
I aint turbo rocking a damn curl
Watch Mag slow while I break you down slow
When you get it right girl go for what you know
Wiggle a bit stop drop get up snake freak whop
Wiggle a bit stop drop get up snake freak whop
Get off the wall hands of your balls
Yeah nigga with the drink in his hand trying to ball
You dont want shorty I can show you the dance
Gone once gone twice you done lost your chance
Now stop for Big Pun stop for Big pun
Drop for Big L drop for Big L

Waist line five six seven now drop
One time all in together now drop
Yo dont stop dont stop

Guess who came with a cape on his back
Pulled up with some gin hopped out the Cadillac
Mag is chilling Tim is chilling
When I get up in this club I'm making a hoe feel it
Got no game but I got big cash
Mess around I be leaving this club with Stacey Dash
I aint cute enough but my jimmy got a flick and it shimmy
I'm in the club pulling hoes with Timmy

(Timbaland)
All my shadow people where freaky where you at
All my Broadway people freaky where you at
Where my fellas in the back with the carnie act
Where my girls who think they got it like that
All my ndependent  freaky where you at
All my get money dogs freaky where you at
Where my girls with the thongs who be shaking it fast
If you love to sing along nigga holla back
