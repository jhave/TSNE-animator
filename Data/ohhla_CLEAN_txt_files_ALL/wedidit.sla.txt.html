"Yeah"
"We did it" {*9X*}

Yeah
Hate to sound like a broken record but, we did it
What else we gon' do, huh?
What else we gon' do but hustle?
Grind, go hard man
We in a position where we gotta succeed, by any means necessary
Failure is not an option (real niggaz don't die)
Cause if we do fail, it's back to the drawing board</pre>
