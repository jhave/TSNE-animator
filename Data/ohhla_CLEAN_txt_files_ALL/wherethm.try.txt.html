[Pastor Troy talking]
This that hard shit (hard shit)...
This that hard shit (hard shit)...
This that hard shit (hard shit)...
PT baby y'all know what time it is (yeah)

[Verse 1]
I'm in the Trans'
Taking a chance they could kill me
But I don't give a fuck, they gone motha fuckin' feel me
'Til the car stops tickin', nigga I'm spittin' (blow)
Empty my mag' (bl-bl-blooow)
Dead at yo ass (come on)
Say you want it hard being Sam gotta goon squad
I don't give a damn, if I bam I'mma take yo heart
Bleed blood nigga, bleed blood fuck nigga die
All that he heard is that thunder-bird pass by
Up out my T-top
Big Keith, don't stop
Let me put my scope on
Show this nigga how bad I want 'em
On channel two tonight, on forty six tonight
On channel five tonight, somebody died tonight
Ready to ride
Nowhere to hide, I'mma physco
Tap a nigga lips to the barrel of my rifle
I'm liable, to hit the grave-yard with my squad
To make sure you all see GOD (nigga)

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
What, what, what, what, what, whaaaat (Where Them Niggaz At?)
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huuuuh (Where Them Niggaz At?)

[Verse 2]
First a fuck nigga talkin' shit off of twenty east
A whole bunch of mouth but the ain't disturbin' no peace
I'm at least known for the chrome, how I get it on
Sendin' all the fuck niggaz home, but say they gone
Hit 'em in the chest
Peal flesh, let 'em bleed hoe
Shots through the door
Out that gold desert eagle
Fuck yo' eagle
Gotta go, then he gotta go
Why?, I don't know
'Cause I mother fuckin' said so
Two eighty five, call me eighty five south
Fly ass mouth and some K's at my fuckin' house
Start bustin' shots when I motha fuckin' twelve (come on)
Ask my brother (yeah) I'm hard as hell, (come on)
You can tell, how I walk, how I talk it's real
I can go anywhere in the world and chill
'Cause I will, ride for mine all the time (blow)
Y'all bitches betta watch it
Eight ball corner pocket (nigga)

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
What, what, what, what, what, whaaaat (Where Them Niggaz At?)
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huuuuh (Where Them Niggaz At?)</pre>
