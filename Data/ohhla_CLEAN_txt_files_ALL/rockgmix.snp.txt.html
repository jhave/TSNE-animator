[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
G Mix!!!! I was a fiend, before I became a teen
I melted cabbage sacks instead of cones of ice cream
Crime orientated that's how the west was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzle, complicated
I droppped the sack and tried to rap hits y'all
They tried to bang on me, and say that I'm too small
Cool!!! Cause I don't get upset
I call the king of the east catch a flight then I jet
Right back to the west, where my niggas is at
Scoop the gilly put it back on the map
Like this like that while you rollin a bag
Loadin ya gat, pop pop, I'm holdin ya back
I'm like the Whopper FUCK THE BIG MAC!!!
Run up on the dog my gat go click clack
And that's fo' sho!!! 
The reason why, man I don't know so let's go cuz

(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)
(HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!! HEY!!!) I wanna rock right now, rock-rock-right now)

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Boss Dogg chillin, lookin like a million
Yeah, nigga got it, I'ma leave it to my chil'ren
Tonight I'm on some other shit, and baby lovin it
Hella fast, grip dey ass like the oven mitt
I'm gooned up, boy! Rich as fuck, boy!
Black and gold brakes, that's my truck, boy
I'm on my Eastside, shit I'm workin
I got the party goin, and it's jerkin
My niggas all long, we rollin out deck
Hoes gettin in, you betta pick a bitch
'Cause when I shut it down, the party's over wit
She call me Superman, I'm on my +Soulja+ shit (YOOOOOOOU!)
Boss Dogg, get 'em, I sick 'em and take 'em home
West Coast bitch, I'm on my fuckin throne
I'm giggin on these hoes, do 'em like dominoes
And slam 'em on they back, and tell 'em vamanos
