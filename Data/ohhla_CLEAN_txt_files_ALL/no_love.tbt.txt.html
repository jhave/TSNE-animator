[Chorus x2 - Jazze Pha (Mannie Fresh)]
Its a beatiful life, colourful ice, flyest of hoes, spending the night
(BEAUTIFUUUL)
I'm a Tymer baby, all my shit be designer baby, it's a beautiful life!

[Verse 1 - Mannie Fresh]
I roll through your city they go who is that
In a brand new Baby Blue Cadillac
Truck two days old, with remote controls
Press the motherfuckin button and the TVs fold
Out the top of the dash, shaking they ass
Tuck a lil' something and I show her some cash
I'm Mannie Frsh hoe, represent the 'S'
Cash Money Records nigga nothing but the best
Got a monster truck, sitting on 30's
Fuck the rap game cuz I still push birdies
I'm hood rich bitch, you know who I are
They don't want to fuck me they want to fuck my car
Now wait a minute hold up mayne get it straight
Ya dude push pebbles Birdman push weight
And its so incredible the things he does
Take a project bitch from where she was
Clean her life up, wife her just because
We some motherfuckin' pimps you bitch

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2 - Baby]

Blastin' rounds when we moving these pounds
Counting cash out a shoebox, we getting it down
I'm holding my town, like a nigga on a mound
Or a crab out the bucket when me moving around
I'm strong in the hood, steering wheel all wood
In the back of the 'lac the nigga played all good
I'm on my grizzy my nizzy to get this brand new crib
Behind this money its gon' be a fucking killin'
I'm moving around uptown this how its going down
I'm coming thru the hood for a billin killin bitch
Money is a must, hanging out at the club with hoes on motorbikes my nigga
That ghetto life, with these calls and brawls it ain't no love in my eyesight nigga
A million in cash in the back of the dash and I'm the OG driving my nigga

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh &amp; Baby]

[Mannie Fresh]
Yeah got my root beer dickies on
With my motherfuckin' diamond studded cell phone
I got cars to match these clothes
with some ignorant ass banged out project hoes
I'm dope boy fresh, I mean that bitch
Thats gators on my waiter when he serving that shit
And I'm coming thru your hood, disrespecting y'all
Bass turned up loud knocking pictures off the wall

[Baby]
I'm riding gangsta in a green mercedes
Throwing spinach out the window Mannie Fresh and Baby
Icey whips with the gun on my hip
Bootin up at you bitches like 'fuck y'all haters' (fuck y'all haters)
So get straight or get this gun in your face
And fuck around and be a whole 'nother killin
In the Sky Blue Bentley, 23's they spinnin
Big Money Heavyweight and we gettin

[Chorus x2]</pre>
