[Verse 1]
I had a zig zag story just the other day
I rolled a fat blunt and yo, it ripped this way
I took a puff (uh-huh) and what did I see?
Those motherfuckers still wanna I-C-E
To blaze up a sac of that green bombay
And when I reach my peak, I explode like dante
Tha ganjay has got my mind wide open, I'm soakin'
In the music, I use it, And don't abuse it
And true, It gets me high like the sky
I will buy till the day that I die
You ain't gotta ask me why
I take tokes from the smoke, I can't deny
Got a lifetime supply

[Chorus]
And I wanna get you high
Get you high all night
'cause I wanna get you high
Get you high all night
And I wanna get you high
Bang another joint
Zig zag stories
Bang another joint
Zig zag stories

[Verse 2]
This is a zig zag story that I had last night
A six-pack, a joint, And I was feeling all right
Lit up tha chronic, And what did I see?
This bad-ass bitch creeping up on me
She had the look that could get the ice cooked up in a second
I pictured her undressing and gettin' butt-naked
She walked up to me and said her name was mary jane
Ain't no shame in my game, Down to do anything
Took me by the hand, Ask me if i'd like to fly
You know I like to fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now here's a zig zag story that I'm havin' right now
Gotta get myself together, Cause some shit is goin' down
Hit you people off with my new cd
Hard to swallow, Like saying "fuck the industry!"
I'm stompin' through the bayou with my black boots laced
And takin' out you motherfuckers acting two-faced
For the people out there gonna blaze 'till I die
Blaze up the thai

[Chorus]</pre>
