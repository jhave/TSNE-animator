[Intro: Defari + (girl)]
Look, leave me the fuck alone bitch

(Oh, there you go, damn
 "leave me the fuck alone", "leave me the fuck alone"
 That's all you cryin' nigga
 Ooh, your breath stank nigga, damn, you reefin'?
 W-Why you always gotta come home drunk and shit huh, faded?

Leave me the fuck alone, will ya?

(Whateva nigga, you know what?
 Your eyes all red and everything...)

[Chorus]
You always get so drunk..
(Bitch I don't give a fuck, bitch)
You always come home high..
(Bitch I don't give a fuck, bitch)
You always get so faded..
(Bitch I don't give a fuck, bitch)
You always have red eyes..
(Bitch I don't give a fuck, bitch)

[Defari]
The club bumps
Faded off Remy and five blunts
Codiac cush got me fucked up
I'm goin' round for round, drink dark brown
Smoke trees in a leaf that be dark brown
Look at baby, so thick man, she dark brown
Bad bitches all around, you know it's goin' down
I be posted at the bar like a ghetto C.E.O
Spank T with a new jean suit from ????
Spank white Nikes... so fresh and so tight
The bitches wanna holla back, young and all night
So what do you expect when I'm out wit my niggaz
Drink it up, smoke blunts, poppin' bitches

[Chorus]

[Defari]
Monday Night Football start at 6:00
My fifth Hennessey at the bar with chicks
It's on once again, a new night, new mix
Before we left the crib - already finished a fifth
Me, B Fin, Stats, and my nigga E-Swift
Fredwreck on deck with this Brazilian bitch
After football we gon' hit the spot
After 2:00, after hours pop, it's on all night
Kilous spinnin' right, oh fo sho nigga
My nigga Kilou tight
Stop by 7-11 get another pack of blunts
Get a 40, feel sporty, roll 'em up

[Chorus]

[Defari]
You think you all presidential
We stay low key dippin' through the residential
Sippin' Presidente in the wet El Camino
On rallies, deep dish spin so simple
Here I am with another blunt in my hand
It's Tuesday so we all got tall cans
T ??? is at Joseph's in Hollywood
So many birds I've never seen lookin' so good
In a minute I'ma pull this hundred and spend it
My niggaz crowd around the bar like they all built it
I guess we vultures in the late night club culture
I'ma do the damn thangs that I always told you

[Chorus]</pre>
