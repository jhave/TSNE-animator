(Tech N9ne)
I started out with
No dough, no clothes, no shows, and no hoes
And ended up with 
Mo hoes, mo shows, mo clothes, and mo dough

I used to be the ideal nigga 
Preppy like Hilfiger
Pretty vill nigga 
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga
Not pickin' cotton 
But pickin' up mics and rockin'
Recoppin' so I can feel richer
So I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie
And I will stick her real quick 
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills
I can feel nigga best deals 
You can get the steal
If you ill I'm concealed with a
Technina millameter by my side
God used to guide me Lucifer beside me
Evil was lively trippin' with wifey
Never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into 
This is the message Imma send to
God the evil shit I've been through
Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen cuz the hurt cut me deep like a ginsu

(Chorus x2)
This life 
Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever
Burn in the flame 
This life 
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's
Possessing my brain 

(Amjad Bakani)
This life 
Full of money bitches weed and riches
Kansas City niggas grind it
Cook it up in the kitchen 
Pay attention to the corner nigga
Roguish and rugged 
Nigga fuck it it's a must
I conceal it and tuck it 
This life
Can make a nigga murder for nothin'
This life 
For the money have you fakin' and frontin'
This life
Can make a nigga take a deal with the devil 
This life 
Got me rippin' up shit in my kennel 
Ya see I live in the rain 
Laugh at the storm
And mastered the pawn 
Bringin' war at the crack of the dawn 
Tottin' the bomb 
A nigga with a third eye vision 
Like a malachi blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes
You can tell I'm a rider 
More shows more clothes 
More hoes more dough 
And no foes yo 

(Chorus x 2)
This life
Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever 
Burn in the flame
This life
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's 
Possessing my brain 

(Short Nitty)
Some times I wonder
How did I survive 
With all this drama in front of me 
Poppa went out like a bitch 
For runnin' from me 
Though momma never lied
She cried 
Seen me sittin' in prison
Servin' a sentence 
With bad intentions 
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin'
On a joint dipped in water 
And high hopin' the future's wide open
For my daughter my eyes are open
To all animosity constantly
Falling quickly the devil calls it
A blessing to cross Nitty 
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back 
To the penitentiary visit me 
Hell bound coffin dwellin'
Before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me 
I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight 
Despite this hell to pay
Can't wait to see the day 
When my adventures begin
With this here life of sin 
I'm all in 

(Chorus x 2)
This life
Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever 
Burn in the flame
This life
I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's 
Possessing my brain

Is it heaven or hell
I really can't tell
It half cupid half relic
My life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils
And I fly with the angel 
And I stand on a level
Where mind is so tangled</pre>
