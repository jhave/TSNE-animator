Hey what's happening baby
I'm the one who needs no introduction
Cuz I'm the world class doctor
The master of seduction
I can heal all your ills
And give you extreme delight
But only if you allow me
To turn off the lights

1 - 	Before you turn off the lights
	Let's get one thing understood
	If you plan to make love to me
	You've got to do it good
	Cuz I'm a hell of a woman
	And for me it takes a hell of man
	So don't you dare turn off the lights
	Unless this you understand

Yes, my name is Shakespeare
A world class poet
So kick back and relax yourself baby
Let me pour you a glass of Moet
Darkness will be your blessing
As I bring you extreme delight
But first you must allow me, Shakespeare
To turn off the lights.... click

Repeat 1

2 - 	Don't turn off the lights
	Unless you'll love me right
	You hear what I'm saying
	Cuz boy I'm not playing
	Don't turn off the light
	Unless you plan on staying

And of course, I'm DJ Yella
The mixologist of the crew
And I would just love
To mix bodies with you
Your lips I would kiss
Your body I would hold tight
But only if you allow me
Check this out
To turn off the lights

Repeat 1

Like a meloncholy dancer for you I'd dance
With nothing but a g-string on my hip
Your kiss and touch I'd slowly collect
For they'd be my tip
There's parts of your body I'd slowly kiss
And others I'd gently bite
But first, you must allow me, Lonzo
To turn off all the lights

Repeat 1

Repeat 2
