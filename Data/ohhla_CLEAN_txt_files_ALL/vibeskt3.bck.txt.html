Let's run over there and get an exclusive interview (let's go)
C'mon Phil! (Let's go)
Excuse me, dickhead
Ay! Dickhead, dickhead {*man makes choking noises*}
I'm here with the alleged asshole, and
Sir what the public would like to know...
Is that piss, you're lying in?
Uhh, would you like to give a shoutout?
How about your homies, for your homies in the pen?
What do you have to say for yourself?
I bet that's the last time you approach a black man while he's eating dinner

["Phillip Ondeez"]
You can ALSO bet this isn't the LAST time you're gonna hear about
Dr. Dre and Young Buck getting into some shit!

["Jack Offden"]
We'll be back, right after this</pre>
