[Justin Timberlake]
You'd take the clothes off my back, and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth, and I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why... why I love it so much
{"Thanks for warning me"} Ohhhh {"Thanks for warning me"}
You curse my name, in spite, to put me to shame
Air my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why (don't know why) why I love it so much
{"Thanks for warning me"} Yeah {"Thanks for warning me"}

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you're screamin you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sippin from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Jay-Z]
Uhh uhh
Uhh, Blue told me remind you niggaz
Uhh, fuck that shit y'all talkin 'bout, I'm the nigga
Uhh, caught up in all these lights and cameras
Uhh, but look what that shit did to Hammer
Uhh, God damnit I like it
The bright lights is enticin, but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, 30 mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin on me, what I do? I took her back
Fool me twice that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame, Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself - uhh

[Justin Timberlake + Jay-Z]
And we all just, entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Know we all just, entertainer-r-r-r-r-r-r-r

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body, psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk, see 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off, enough is enough, I'm callin this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin though? I'm gettin high, sittin low
Slidin by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works, I think back, you asked the same person
if this is all you had to deal with, nigga deal with it, this shit is ain't work
This light work, camera snappin, my eyes hurt
Niggaz dyin back where I was birthed, fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse, you got the shit that niggaz die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad, don't throw the baby out with that bath water
You're still alive, still that nigga
Nigga you survived, you still gettin bigger
Nigga livin the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive, Michael Jackson's "Thriller"

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take, the blade right out my heart, just so you can watch me bleedin
I still don't know why (don't know why) why I love you so much
{"Thanks for warning me"} Yeah {"Thanks for warning me"}
And you play this game, in spite, to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink, with guess whose name
But I still don't know why (don't know why) why I love it so much
{"Thanks for warning me"} Yeah {"Thanks for warning me"}

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
