(Intro) {Chorus}
Kobe:
The block got my back
And my boys do too
And my big mama trippin said she need more loot
Every block, Every hood, Every ghetto got beef
I got a heater on my lap
And another in the back
She hassels her coke with all this stress on me
Erybody and there mama callin fed's on me
I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It (I'mma Do It)
Look I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It (I'mma Do It)
I got money on my head but im ridin in a drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop)
 
(Verse 1)
Fabolous:
Yeahhhhh!!!
Feelin just like JFK in the city that let em fly like JFK (Ayyye)
Sometimes LaGaurdia I ain't gone lie to ya
If looks could kill then my style might body ya
that's why I'm with naudia I call my gun naudia
When she say hi to ya it's buh buh bye to ya
Make it sound like Saudia
Arabia, maybe the haters should watch what he say to her you think
I can hold my head high and die or i can live and duck
My attitude is celebant
I don't give a fuck
 
(Chorus)
Kobe:
The block got my back
and my boys do too
And my big mama trippin said she need more loot
Every block, Every hood, Every ghetto got beef
I got a heater on my lap
And another in the back
She hassels her coke with all this stress on me
Erybody and there mama callin fed's on me
I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
Look I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
Look I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
I got money on my head but im ridin in a drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop)
 
(Verse 2)
Fabolous:
Yeahhhhh!!!!
Now who are you to tell me how to conduct myself
Why don't you go practice safe sex and go fuck yourself
The rumor is that I'm a hazzard to a sucka's health
I coulda told you that, yeah I coulda told you that
Picture me not flop where is them explosives at?
Right here on my lap 
That's where my composure's at
I'm back like a gun cock 
I'm so cool that if i go to hell all i need is my sun block
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck
My attitude is celebant
I don't give a fuck
 
(Chorus)
Kobe:

Look I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
I got money on my head but im ridin in a drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop), drop, (drop)

(Verse 3)
Fabolous:
I mean let's be honest you never liked a nigga
Tryin to live beyond this so i kept the strap on
Clap on, clap off lights out like flights out
You could be departed
Never me who started
I Lambo Gallarded I am vehically challenged
That means the car is retarded
But regardless I'm "Tin Man" heartless
No love, if son lookin for love 
Get a show on VH1
Nigga hold ya high and die or live and duck
My attitude is Virgins
Still don't give a fuck

(Chorus)

I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
Look I don't know what imma do but I'mma Do It 
I got money on my head but im ridin in a drop, drop, drop, drop</pre>
