It gets no better when you're caught up in the earthquake weather 
Keep your eye on the storm come and get us 
When the shit goes down we're all down cause we're fed up 
At how the system is set up 
  
Breaking through my storm sick weather 
Psyclone stroll my zone come on enter 
Government punks think their world's a lot better 
But it's regular men that run the country forever 
Who got the power, the law, really? 
Never! Thought I'd go to war with my city 
Carry out plans advance in the dark 
Tactics trace you with white chalk 
Crash hits and my troops get marked 
I'm in a danger zone when I walk 
Split seconds in time life become short 
Courtesy of LA P.D psycho 
Inhaling white coke straight snort 
Life is a contact sport weather report 
  
The sun will be smitten 
You understand what we're transmitting? 
Under the vanishing ozone 
Melting like a snow cone 
Listen before we come to not existing 
The new system 
Sets up the weather to splice us 
Wipe the dust off mental vices 
Snipe devices in this age of crisis 
The price of being decisive is choking 
Welcome to no hope land 
Where two words can't be spoken 
That's prevent this 
So they're frozen like cryogenics 
In the driest of ice scaling global heights 
With hollow sights on scientists' heads like lice 
Who have patternized more than just mice 
Strike to kill the present but the present is this 
Try to fight a dead end that's sent through fists 
Mind computer list of motives 
Electric convulsive through the voltage 
Prime supreme truth cult 
Rhyme revolt 
Forecasting the act of action 
To flatten the state of defense 
Info prints static 
To unpulsate the black magic that breathes 
Believe in what we ourselves conceive 
For us it must and it will happen 
Destruction before creation the war of capping 
It gets no better when you're caught up in the earthquake weather 
Keep your eye on the storm come and get us 
When the shit goes down we're all down cause we're fed up 
At how the system is set up </pre>
