......I'ma run it..
I dont know whats going on, or about this feelin, you got me feelin
Cuz everytime I try to leave I'm right back again, yea
And I aint goin no where, you got me walkin on the ceilin

So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone, oh
Ill be the one you call, no tellin where we might go
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there, flyin in the air
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spent the night...low...

It go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up

So high I'm not comin down, and you wit me you aint comin down eitherrrr
Lets write our names on a cloud, break sum down
Roll it up and pass it all around, god dam she a keeeperrr, yea

So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone
Ill be the one you callllll, no tellin where we might go
And everytime you look up baby I'm right there flyin in the air
So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spend the night...low

It go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up
We go up up up up up up up up

Cuz everythings better when your high
Everythings better when your high
Everythings better when your high
Everythings better when your high
If you dont smoke I dont kno why

Cuz everythings better when your high
Everythings better when your high
Everythings better when your high
If you dont smoke I dont kno why

Keep all that....even keep that too
And keep that too but you cut this out.....
