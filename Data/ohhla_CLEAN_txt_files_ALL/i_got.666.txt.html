[Verse One]
I'm ridin tall on 24's, spittin game out to the hoes
With my windows tinted black, make you think you saw a ghost
My home painted white on white, inside leather white on white
Chiefin, drankin up all night, ballin out yeah that's the life
Ladies wanna ROLL with me, blow a bag of 'DRO with me
Party to the crack of dawn, when I'm down in YO' city
I'm all about this pimpin, when it comes to wo-men
Get some head while drive mayne, oh what a feelin~!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Here I am; here I am so fresh, so so clayn
Off in the club, aww shit I see I blew the hoe's brain
Befo' I came, I say I blew a whole thang
Clean as a dollar, off in my black on black Impala
The Don Dada, is what they call me overseas
But over here I should say I'm the king of Memphis, Tennessee
Rap, is a wrap, haters wrapped off in my duct tape
What it take I say I been hard since first mixtape
Face get your G's up, way way up to my level
Higher than the clouds where my daddy restes in heaven
But on another note I'm so stylish I changed the name
I surpassed clean, like a baby, I'm clayn clayn

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Ay let me tell you niggaz somethin
Let me tell you somethin nigga

{*beat changes to a piano loop*}

[Verse Three]
That paper is like trash nigga, throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
That paper is like trash nigga, throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out) - YESSIR
Throw that shit out (throw that shit out)
We got - big rims, big cars, big guap, ghetto stars
In the hood, gettin rich, gettin it, livin large
Sellin white, sellin pills, sellin crystal meth meth
Sellin D's, sellin speed 'til there's nothin left left
Fresh clothes, pullin hoes, get my roll on (roll on)
Phone ringin off the hook, bitch hold on (hold on)
I got a brand new woofer, put some more hoes on
So I can hit the club, strip, and get chose on

[Chorus]</pre>
