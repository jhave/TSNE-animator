**Phone dialling**

	[Mary]
What's up, this is Mary, leave a message, and I'll holla back, peace

	[Diddy]
Yo, yo Mary, pick up the phone girl
Ay yo Mary, pick up the phone girl

MJ = Hello?
PD = Ay yo, what's up?
MJ = What's up Puff?
PD = Girl you ready?
MJ = I'm always ready

	[Diddy]
It's about that time again
This the moment they all been waiting for
Time to take it back to the gutter
The queen of hip-hop soul

	[Mary] (Jay-Z)
Oohh, live your life cos life is love
Always thank the man above (thank you, uh)
The more you the more you get (that's real talk)
Yeah, yeah (let me warm it up for ya)

	[Jay-Z]
Who better to usher you back through the gutter
Than America's number one hustler (Sean Carter)
Don't call it a come back
Unless there's some money attached to that
And you can call it whatever you like, in fact
It's something like a phenomenon
Like a young LeBron, gettin my high school games on
TV just for dunkin on
Whoever want it with Sean he can get it jumpin like Donkey Kong
We could get it thumpin like bum-ba-bum
Travel the way of the gun, come on, c-come on
No, I'm not only beggin I'm eggin you on
Until you dead or gone that's the vendetta I'm on
This ain't no video game with wrestlers on it
The competitor on this is on some shit
Honest come through all black like a Amish
Holsters under the armpit, the arm spit, ha
Just that Brooklyn don shit
Along with the queen from Yonkers
Come on kiss the ring
Fore I let miss Mary sing
Supposed to you a soul in the everything, yeah
It's classic material
I see you bastards at the burial
Jay go first and then Mary go, round
I just ride, hold her down with the fifth by my side
Me and miss Blige
Look up in the sky it's a bird and the 'caine
And the hydro flow that I brought to the game
I could go mo' but I'm a let ma do her thang
Brooklyn, we did it again

	[Diddy]
I can't really explain what it is about her
I don't know it's just, it's something special
Ain't nobody like her, there's only one Mary
Only one queen of hip-hop soul
Love and life, let's do it</pre>
