[Intro/Chorus: Young Noble]
It's my niggaz, runnin' the street with heat, don't sleep 
Don't nobody peeps, so we always deep
It's my niggaz, we bleed together, stack G's together
When Five-O scream freeze we ever..
It's my niggaz, cause we be starvin' for months
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz, what!, it's my niggaz, what!
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz..

[Verse 1: Young Noble]
Aiyyo, I've been through a lot with my niggaz
And still we strong, damn Yuk' was my nigga, I wish he wasn't gone
The mission we was on, done shake the world
But now, I'm screamin' fuck it, and clutchin' my baby girl
And eye for an eye, for the next one of my soldiers to go
Everybody gotta die for sure
We've been strugglin' too long for you bitches to fuck
We've been hustlin' too long forth not to come up
Gotta be touched, fly angels, I feel the love
Outlaw, we was taught by the original thug
I ain't shit without my homeboy, and you ain't shit without yours
Where the fuck would I be, without my outlawz?
Probably, workin' nine to five, no, life as a crime
And the Kitchen Probably is different when I'ma own dime
Required time, my childhood memories
Same bitches, same enemies, my niggaz 

[Chorus: Young Noble W/ Minor Varitions]
It's my niggaz, runnin' the street with heat, don't sleep 
Don't nobody peeps, so we always deep
It's my niggaz, we bleed together, stack G's together
When Five-O scream freeze we ever.. 
It's my niggaz, yeah, cause we be starvin' for months
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz, what!, it's my niggaz, what!
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz..

[Verse 2: Phats Bossalini]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I lived my life, nigga, everyday was all in my mind
For those who thugged there's a price, and it ain't nothin' nice
Fool, when I bleed, a dozen men will bleed for me
And if I die in this warfare, creep for me
Grab the heat for me, and mentally they all die slow
Some niggaz ripped, some niggaz post, some niggaz rippin' up flows
Streets fly, and cocked .45, my team'll rise 
raisely with no reply, my stutas ready to ride

[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Yo, rest in peace to Hego Storm, I hit no stone, like Algator
I never hate Sean who's playin' alone
Fade them all, we dead alone cause Makaveli gave the call
I got some soldiers that'll hit you up and play alone
Like nothin' never happened, mother fuck rappin'
13 with more planety than your mamma stackin' 
I got a gat, I never hesitate to pull it
For every soldier I lost, you gonna catch a bullet

[Chorus: Young Noble W/ Minor Varitions]
It's my niggaz, runnin' the street with heat, don't sleep 
Don't nobody peeps, so we always deep
It's my niggaz, we bleed together, stack G's together
When Five-O scream freeze we ever.. 
It's my niggaz, cause we be starvin' for months
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz, what!, it's my niggaz, what!
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz..

[Verse 4: Fatal Hussien]
Huh, my niggaz, puttin' it down every where I go
It's my niggaz, gettin' niggaz after every show
Where the fuck would I be without me and doggs?
Pack the bags, still scrapin', heat deep in the fog
Y'all niggaz is bitching: I don't walk in the streets with them
My niggaz, when I'm broke, I can eat with them
Show and beef with them, hold heat with them
Get money down South, and rip the whole East with them
It's my niggaz that kill, my niggaz that will
Get that blood money for sure, my niggaz as real
And when we rob you got who controlled the wheel
Napoleon and Kastro, Young Noble and Me
EDI, Killa Kadaf, Makaveli as real
Taught this Rap game for life, somebody tell me the deal
My niggaz, High, my niggaz, Up, my niggaz, What
My niggaz, Huh

[Chorus: Young Noble W/ Minor Varitions]
It's my niggaz, runnin' the street with heat, don't sleep 
Don't nobody peeps, so we always deep
It's my niggaz, we bleed together, stack G's together
When Five-O scream freeze we ever.. 
It's my niggaz, cause we be starvin' for months
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz, what!, it's my niggaz, what!
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz..

[Interlude: Fatal Hussien Talking]
To my nigga Paul Bang and [Name] Jewen Squad
Real niggaz, you know, Ful Gottie, rest in peace
Algae, Hego Storm, Killa Kadaf, Makaveli, Thug Lord
You know, MIC Murder Incorporated
You know, Thug Black Pawns, and DJ [name] in the streets died rapping
You know what I'm saying, keep it real
Yo, it's my niggaz..

[Chorus: Young Noble ]	
It's my niggaz, runnin' the street with heat, don't sleep 
Don't nobody peeps, so we always deep
It's my niggaz, we bleed together, stack G's together
When Five-O scream freeze we ever.. 
It's my niggaz, cause we be starvin' for months
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz, what!, it's my niggaz, what!
Nigga, I don't give a fuck, I do it all for us
It's my niggaz..</pre>
