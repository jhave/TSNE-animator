[Oobie]
There's something, that I gotta tell ya'
Cause I know, that a brother got needs tonight
I ain't trippin' on ya' pimpin' just that this time
Cause you gotta pay tonight tonight tonight

(Chorus)
I know you wanna get laid tonight
But I'm tryna get paid tonight
We ain't even gotta fuss and fight
Just hit me right, sore all night
I know you wanna get in bed wit' me
But you gotta come correctly
Nothin the night is free ??

[Oobie]
I hope you...can feel me
When I say....pay before you play wit' me
Wanna taste this....but it's priceless
It's something that you never done before, I'm not ya ordinary hoe

(Chorus)

[Lil Jon]
I fell off in the club (shawty)
Not lookin' for love (shawty)
But I'm lookin' for a gul (shawty)
For I could cut (shawty)
Like lil mama in the blue (shawty)
She so got damn cute (shawty)
But she say she need cheese (shawty)
Before she dip wit' me (shawty)
Well let me see (shawty)
What it might be (shawty)
And what's ya' fee (shawty)
For my fantasy (shawty)
Now I ain't rich (shawty)
But I spend a lil bit (shawty)
So who you wit'? (shawty)
Let's do this shit (shawty)

(Chorus)

[Oobie]
There's something, that I gotta tell ya'
Before you lay with me tonight
I ain't got no problem ???
Cause you gotta pay tonight tonight tonight

[Lil Jon]
What chu' talkin' 'bout? (shawty)
And get cum out cha' mouth (shawty)
Say you want some cash (shawty)
Before I hit that ass (shawty)
I'm not yo' boy (shawty)
I ain't no toy (shawty)
Don't play no games (shawty)
Cause I ain't lame (shawty)
But foe' my gurl (shawty)
I'll give her the world (shawty)
Ain't no thang (shawty)
To give up that change (shawty)
I ain't rich (shawty)
I spend a lil bit (shawty)
So who you wit'? (shawty)
Let's do this shity (shawty)

(Chorus)

[Oobie]
Now I'll be there for you
If you want me to
I'll be by ya' side
If the price is right
Take care of me
And I'll take care of you
Nothin to night is free

ohhh, yeahhh
Can I get paid? woo
Now if you want me
Come correctly
Might be something you never done before
I'm not yo' ordinary hoe</pre>
