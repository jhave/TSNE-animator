   (Babu mixing)
   "Let...let...let...let me tell you somethin"
   "I'm 'bout to set it off, society watch me while I do it"

(Iriscience)
Yo, yo, I buck shots, lick shots, take shots, give shots
Headliners know, this year we switch spots
Check it, I spit it for the righteous and the wretched
First came the live show, next came the records, (next)
With wax collectors with rap perfectors
With scratch, with dance, with graf protectors
Worldwide travelers in your sector
DJ Babu, come down selector!
I raw here, I explore here
You like that, where that comes from there's more there
This is warfare and we score fair
We don't stop 'til our flag swings in your air
I rap to build or I rap to ruin
Your whole career, yo, watch what you doin

   (Chorus-Babu mixing) [Iriscience talking]
   "Let...let...let...let me tell you somethin"
   "I'm 'bout to set it off, society watch me while I do it"
   [Pay attention]
   "I'm 'bout to...I'm 'bout to....I'm 'bout to...
   I'm 'bout to set it off, society watch me while I do it"
   [Watch and observe]
   "I'm 'bout to...I'm 'bout...
   I'm 'bout to set it off, society watch me while I do it"
   [PAY ATTENTION!]
   "Watch me while I do it
   Watch...watch...watch me while I do it"
   [Watch and observe]
   "Let...let...let...let me tell you somethin"
   "I'm 'bout to set it off, society watch me while I do it"

(Iriscience)
Yo, yo
I'm a poet, with the warrior spirit inside
Chokin rappers out like Hickson in "Pride"
We all share the same sun givin us light
But remember, sink or swim, time winnin's a fight
Expansion Team takes rows, takes oceans, takes flight
Then takes over the stage 'til the morning breaks night
Word of mouth crew, make sure we pay right
Then Hendrix takes over my body, I blaze mics
Spray 3-d outlines and highlights
I know lowlifes that are livin the high life
At great heights I exercise my rights
So much smoke, when I'm this high, I sky-write
Raaka raps to build, or raps to ruin
Your whole career, yo, watch what you're doin

(Chorus)

I rock hills and valleys, rap shows and ralleys
Record stores and schools, live shit from Cali
Take it to the people, cut out the middle men
Like Chuck said, "I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin"
I rap to build or I rap to ruin
Your whole career, yo, watch what you're doin

(Chorus)

(Iriscience talking)
Babu, Iriscience

Pay attention, UK y'all, USA y'all, Japan y'all, Japan y'all
France y'all, France y'all......</pre>
