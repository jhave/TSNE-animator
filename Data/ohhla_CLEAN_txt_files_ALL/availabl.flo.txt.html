[Flo Rida]
Its the time, its the right time
Its the time, yo its the perfect time
Yo, its the time, its the right time
Its the time, baby baby baby
I'm a single man
Now lets go out and hit the town and start the minglin
I'll bag the baddest girl around and get her gigglin
I'll take her out onto the floor and get her wigglin

Cuz I aint got no girlfriend, got no obligation
Baby, I'm a single man...thats my situation
Let me put your number in my iPhone, baby
And when I call ya later, maybe I can see ya, lady

[Akon]
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight
I'm so available, I'm so available
So come and get me

[Flo Rida]
If you a single girl
Up in the club lookin for love then come and bring it, girl
This is the song, now turn it up and come and sing it, girl
And if your man blow up your phone, turn off your ringer, girl
Turn off your ringer

Cuz I aint got no girlfriend, you aint got one either
If you got a girlfriend, baby wont you bring her
If you got a ex, leave your ex at home
And if he instant message, throw away your cell phone

[Akon]
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight
I'm finally free and I'ma get right tonight
I'm so available, I'm so available
So come and get me</pre>
