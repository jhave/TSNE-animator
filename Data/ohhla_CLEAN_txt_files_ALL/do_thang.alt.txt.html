Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Hahhh! Here I am, here I be
Hah, the great Al' T
G.C., God Connection, bust it, bust it
Wooo!  That's how we do
I'm makin moves, cause you know who's
All you shorties - all you shorties
Yeah, drop 'em, drop 'em

[Al' Tariq]
The bottom line - Tariq got plenty for the masses and many
Be bangin 'em all, that's just the skinny
Get 'em sprung with the tongue or strung with the dick
(That's my shit) straight up and down, I give 'em fits
I be legit and won't quit, the hon cum in buckets
Fuck it, I'm spankin that ass, you know you love the way I struck it
I strike it, don't mind if you dyke it (look, look)
Bring all yo' friends I loves extra skins
I got the ends, whatever treat hoes like they queens and
queens like they tramps I rupture the spleens and
puncture the liver be up in the gut, WHAT WHAT?
I'm splashin backsides with my nut, hut hut
I deliever, gall-ins of semen
Schemin, dreamin of ways to keep 'em screamin
Fiendin for Al' 'Riq, to drink 'em down like Tang
Word is bond hon, do yo' thang

[Chorus]
I said right about now do yo' thang
(Break 'em off hon, no pain no gain)
I said right about now do yo' thang
(Break 'em off shorty wop no pain no gain)
C'mon right about now do yo' thang
(Break 'em off what? No pain no gain)
C'mon right about now do yo' thang
(Break 'em off shorty wop no pain no gain)

[Al' Tariq]
Look, look - outrageous nights I lights up the heavens
Niggaz fakin shit get ass with these elevens
Sevenies on my baby WOO!  Take 'em off
When I get to lickin shit she can't shake me off
Just break me off, somethin hot show-stopper
Bang you right baby, Hammer Time, my shit proper
On top of old smokey, all covered with cheese
Hon stripped and teased made me freeze then hit her knees
My main squeeze, cause that puddy's, like amazin
Plus how mine stays in mode for steady blazin
Steady raisin, got this jones for brown shu'
I'll switch vanilla butter pecan chocolate deluh'
You're shook, you're scared to look but love peep it
If that shit ain't fresh like Secret then shorts, you can keep it
And freak it on yo' own get bad, to the bone
You don't need no rap singer throw up yo' middle finger
and do yo' thang

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Al' Tariq]
Break it down like this
So I guess by now right now you know that who's who
Al' Tariq uniquely freak straight out the Q
For you, I'm thorough, out the desert borough
Land of mida midas I LOVE these mamacitas
Conchitas, y senoritas, fuck what you speakin
Whether you bright, brown skinned, or Puerto Rican
I still be keepin, you open, this papichulo
With twenty-four hour fuckin power I eat that culo
or cula, "Woo-Hah! Got You All In Check"
Cause I smoke on that ass LIKE WHO? Inspectah Deck
Check my status, as the baddest, Mr. Clutch
Too much, whenever we touch so roll the dutch and do yo' thang

[Chorus] w/ variations
