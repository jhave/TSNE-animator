[ LMNO ]
Believe what you will - entitled
I'm a complice receiving direction, guided
In a conversation, interaction with others
Hasn't spread the word, effect no longer
Agnostic, seed, soil, rain and sunlight
Crews think God is day and night
BC to AD, DJ play V
Religiously, simultaneously

[ Key-Kool ]
New identities for every time I grow
Discovery my character when it's myself I know
Rockin' every show, showin' I'm improvin'
With my flow I'm movin', emotions I am soothin'
To the soul and the mind and the mental elevation
Underneath forty trees in meditation
Still tryin' to resist temptations
Reflectin' life by recreating creations

[ LMNO ]
A changed lifestyle like Saul to Paul
I'm not actin' appalled if the movement stalls
Own fault, accept that ( ? )
( ? ) borderline haemorrhagin'
Severin' all ties, sayin' like goodbyes
Momentum compliments, we can't prevent them
Energy burnin', keep on growin'
Turning tables without spike, I'm now knowin'
Get back what you give, invest in a hug
Those tatoos told me he's not even a thug
Those bodily ornaments make her a pink cushion
Their pockets are buffed from the weight they been pushin'

[ Key-Kool ]
I can go out in an instant
Wiped out from my physical existence
[ LMNO ]
Hey, don't dish us no resistance
Cause we're all about persistence
[ Key-Kool }
Assistance to witness, take a stand, right over wrong
Without a pipe or a bong I'm feelin' Most High
Most tried to deny livin' in a lie
Until right before they die realize they're gonna fry

[ both ]
Guess, take a guess
Who's comin' with the mic bless
With the positive hypeness
V-i-s-i-o-n-a-r-i-e-s with emphasis
On less of the typical rip-it flow
A video could never replace a live show
Ohio to all of those wakin' up
Selfishness gets groups breakin' up
Guess, take a guess
Who's comin' with the mic bless
With the positive hypeness
V-i-s-i-o-n-a-r-i-e-s with emphasis
On less of the typical rip-it flow
A video could never replace the real thing
( ? ) to all of those wakin' up
Selfishness gets groups breakin' up
Selfishness gets groups broken up
Selfishness gets groups broken up
