(B.G.)
Ohh man, you fuck that girl friend

Verse 1: (Juvenile)

Girl look at you, with you big fine A$$
What you need to do is let a nigga get behind that
I'm find that spot for you, make it drip
Once it get wet enough for me, I'm let it rip
Now bring it to me, toot it up, don't grab me
She said ooh woo, you doing that daddy
Now take it out, put it where it should be
I don't want nothing but mouth you understood me
I'll hit you with the knuckle hoe, I'm from the 3 (3rd Ward)
Where they say fuck a hoe, fuck a hoe, what I mean is
Get your it right hoe or that's you issue
I been holla at your potna so a nigga ain't gone miss u
Good rittens, matter fact if she don't know how to act
She gone be on the next thing smoking

Verse 2:
I play the game how it go
A different hoe everynight in my condo

Chorus:

Verse 3: (Juvenile &amp; B.G.)
Broads I use to fuck with be try'n to get me killed now
Now I gotta carry that thing on the battlefield now
I could slow down with my girl and try to keep it real now
Hoes use to play me close I wonder how they fell now
They don't have a man that's gonna help with they bills now
Begging me to come back tellin me they gonna chill now
You know I got a mill now, climbing up the hill now
Shining up my grill now, protected by the steel now
(B.G.) 
Hoes know Lil Duggey (B.G.) ain't right
