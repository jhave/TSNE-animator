Yeah

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala 

(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was like six-foot-nine 
So I can get with Leoshi 
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine 
You know I see her all the time 
Everywhere I go, and even in my dreams 
I can scheme a way to make her mine 
Cause I know she's livin phat 
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball 
So how am I gonna compete with that 
Cause when it comes to playing basketball 
I'm always last to be picked 
And in some cases never picked at all 
So I just lean up on the wall 
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls 
Who came to watch their men ball 
Dag y'all! I never understood, black 
Why the jocks get the fly girls 
And me I get the hood rats 
I tell 'em scat, skittle, scabobble 
Got hit with a bottle 
And I been in the hospital 
For talkin' that mess 
I confess it's a shame when you livin' in a city 
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name 
Glad I came to my senses 
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach 
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together 
Right? 
So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type 

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala

(Skee-Lo)
I wish I had a brand-new car 
So far, I got this hatchback 
And everywhere I go, yo I gets laughed at 
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back 
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat 
But that's flat 
And do you really wanna know what's really whack
See I can't even get a date 
So, what do you think of that? 
I heard that prom night is a bomb night 
With the hood rats you can hold tight 
But really tho' I 'm a figaro 
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello 
Well so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday 
Well then I'ma have to get in my car and go 
You know I take the 110 until the 105 
Get off at Crenshaw tell my homies look alive 
Cause it's hard to survive when your livin' 
In a concrete jungle and 
These girls just keep passin' me by 
She looks fly, she looks fly 
Makes me say my, my, my 

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala 

(Skee-Lo)
Hey, I wish I had my way 
Cause everyday would be a Friday 
You could even speed on the highway 
I would play ghetto games 
Name my kids ghetto names Little Mookie, big Al, Lorraine 
Yo you know that's on the real 
So if you're down on your luck 
Then you should notice how I feel 
Cause if you don't want me around 
See I go simple, I go easy, I go greyhound 
Hey, you , what's that sound? 
Everybody look what's going down 
Ahhhh, yes, ain't that fresh? 
Everybody wants to get down like dat 

(Chorus)
(Skee-Lo)
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala
I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her 
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat 
And a six four Impala
