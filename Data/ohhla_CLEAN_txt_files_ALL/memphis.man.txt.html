Now There's This Little Place Across The River
We're Talkin' Tough
'Cause Men And Women Over There
They Believe In This Stuff
They'll Lay There Hearts Down
In The Arkansas Rain
And They'll Jam The Nightclubs
Down By The Waterfront
Every Night Of The Week
Just To Play That Jukebox
As Loud As They Want
While Over In Tennessee
Things Are Never Gonna Be The Same
That Rock And Roll That Keeps Everything Loose
Has Got Us Dancing While Were Singing The Blues
This Memphis Sky
Will Never Fall In
This Memphis Sky
Is Where It All Began
This Memphis Sky
Has Been Here All The Time
This Memphis Sky
Now Jennie's A Dancer
And Her Mama's A Saint
She's Got All The Answers
But Jennie Ain't Gonna Wait
She'll Turn Those Engines On
And Make You Glad That You Came
Hopeless Romantics, They Could Never Sit Still
As Long As They Got Those Tennessee Hills
This Memphis Sky
Will Never Fall In
This Memphis Sky
Is Where It All Began
This Memphis Sky
Has Been Here All The Time
This Memphis Sky
Remember Elvis And What He Gave Me And You
Just To Bring Us All A Little Closer To
This Memphis Sky</pre>
