[Snoop]
Yo.. uh-huh
I'ma try somethin different on this right here
but I know y'all gon' feel it
cause I know y'all feel me
It's some real shit right here, y'knahmsayin?
I ain't never did it like this before
Check this out..

[Snoop - singing]
I'm the kind of G that everybody knows
But I'm so low-key, when it comes to hoes
I never break the rules and that's just how it goes
All my friends and foes - know that's just how it goes
I can flip the script but I chose not to this time
There's so much to say with so little time, but I like it
(Yes I like it)
I'm gon' dip dive socialize and get high
I wish my people had, other ways
I'm thankful, that a brother's paid (that a brother's paid)
But how can I be happy?  My hair is still nappy
I miss my grandpappy
I wanna do right but the world is wrong
That's why I'm singin this song

[Chorus]
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
Y'all niggaz better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I'm tryin to stack a dollar pop my collar while I'm singin my song
You bitches better leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)
I think y'all betta leave me alone (I think you better leave me alone)

[Snoop - singing]
There's so much goin on out there in the world today
All these - ladies, players, gangsters, and suckers
I get caught up sometimes, some of the people I hang with
they turn out to be snitches, bitches, yeah they switches
But you know like I know I can't stop doin, what I got to do
I'ma keep doin what I got to (I'ma keep doin) y'know!
Everywhere I go, the game is the same
People lookin at me want me to say somethin
want me to do somethin, but I don't know nuttin
If I ain't gettin paid, I can't drop no rhymes
I can't do nothin for you no mo', I ain't got that kinda time
and they know..

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Snoop - singing]
I try to be to myself, and try to stay.. away from the world
But the world just keeps runnin after me (runnin after me)
I try to shield myself away from all the wickedness
but somehow, the wickedness is in my circle - what am I to do?
I try to ask God to help me get through this
what am I to do to this?  Just do this, let's do this
So I, continue to mash, day by day (day by day)
I continue to play, play by play
And I con-tinue to spit my manuscript (spit it)
and say what I want to say (say it)
And I do it to ya ev-ery-day

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Snoop Dogg]
Leave me alone, I think you better leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone - better leave me alone
If it don't pay you wrong, leave me alone
I think you better leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alonnnne, leave me alonnnne
If it don't pay you wrong..</pre>
