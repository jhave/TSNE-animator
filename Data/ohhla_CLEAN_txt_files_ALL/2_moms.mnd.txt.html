[Verse 1: Kimani]
Dear Mom
First let me just apologize
For the foolish lies and all the times that you've cried
For the times that I said things I really didn't mean
Basically for my entire existence as a teen
It's been 27 years since my birth here on the planet
And I know that at times you think I've taken you for granted
And granted, at times, I don't show my appreciation
But know, everyday I give thanks for my relation-ship with you
Even the times that I've bitched at you
For nagging me, I know that there's only love behind it
Like the time freshmen year that I came home in tears
As you whispered those words that helped to lessen my fears
You put your faith in me
You could relate to me
You gave me love when I saw the world was hating me
So now I'm giving you thanks for the thousands of hugs
And those times that you told me not to play on the rug
Because sometimes I burned my knees
I learned decrease
Maturing from a boy to man
You know my chosen plan
Is thanking you, for the love and support
Saying sorry for the pain that I caused
Thank you for all those times that you took me around the world traveling
And stirred me with hope when my world was unraveling
Helped me with bills, when my shit wasn't happening
And taught me how to stand like a man
Up on my own two
I guess I thought it a lot, but never told you
I hold you in the highest esteem
You're my inspiration
When this world is causing me frustration
I rely on the gleam in your eyes to help survive
Thank you
For being both my mom and my dad
And I'm sorry if this world ever treated you bad
If I said the wrong things, or wrote the wrong words
For the things you never had in life I know you deserve
You make me proud, I pray to God I make you the same
Spirit of the warrior, it runs strong in my vein
It's all in my name
Thank you for loving my wife
Most importantly thanks for giving me life
I love you mom

I remember (I remember)
A warm December (a warm December)
Through the cold times you nurtured us with sunshine
No need to worry no more, I think you done fine
We give thanks that we were fashioned after you're design
You're one of a kind, you're love keeps us all alive (3 times)

[Verse 2: Oracle]
The year was 1576
A little young boy was put on a slave ship
How could he know that soon he would be
The most important link in my entire family tree?
Skin like burnt brass, hair like lamb's wool
Looked like young Jesus trapped in shackles
Watching his mother get tackled
By some Portuguese merchants
As she screamed out African curses and spells
Condemning them to Hell
For thinking they could sell her first born child across ocean tides
She yelled out to the people from her tribe,
"Make sure my little boy can stay alive"
Cause she planned to die right in front of his eyes
So the warrior spirit would forever cry
Inside his heart and soul and he'll break the mold
Of living timidly for the sake of reaching an old-
Age. That wasn't the way she was raised
She'd rather pass on this day than be a caste away
Getting hit by bare fists and leather whips
"May I feel no pain" were the only words from her lips
She gave her son a glare, that of a lioness
And began to wrestle the merchants like she was tireless
Biting, punching, kicking
Being guided by spirit and intuition
Could you imagine this vision this boy had to bear?
Trying to tear apart the chains
But it was all in vain, he just screamed her name
Over and over again
Trying to send angels of God to go and protect his mom
His voice penetrated the musty air
And cleared the atmosphere for three spirits to appear
And they hovered above his mother
The boy cried to them how much he'd love her
And he couldn't live without the hugs she gave
He'd be a slave forever
As long as they took her to a better place
His heart began to race
As he saw his mother's spirit leave her dying body with grace
And her essence shined in the presence of the divine
And she looked down at her body getting beaten at the same time
A look of disbelief was on the son's face
As his mother's spirit came over to him and gave him an embrace
The boy felt as if he was in paradise
All the other people on the ship saw bright lights
The merchants ran in fright
Calling for the captain
There was no logic to explain what had happen
All the Africans in chains started clapping
Cause the boy helped his mother's spirit find Heaven

I remember (I remember)
A warm December (a warm December)
Through the cold times you nurtured us with sunshine
No need to worry no more, I think you done fine
We give thanks that we were fashioned after you're design
You're one of a kind, you're love keeps us all alive
You're one of a kind, you're love keeps us all alive
You're one of a kind, you're love keeps us all alive
