Hey sugar how you doing huh
Your pretty face don't match that nasty attitude
What you mean where my girl
Probably with your man
Can we fuck?

She won't let me fuck (babyyyyy)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhhh)
She won't let me fuck (honeyyyy)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhhh)

It's so flustrating yeah
Being a man
All these sexy women
Don't understand
Things we need to do yeah
Every other day or two
Like take you home baby yeah
And make sweet love to you
But you you won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck (You say the mood ain't right uh)
I really need to bust a nut (I know that pussy's tight)
She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (ohhhhh)

Her heart is still broken
Her emotions are sore
She's trying to recover
From the man before
Her ex boyfriend
He probably can't see
That it was easy for him
But uh he made it hard for me
Cause she she won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (you know just what I need yeah)
She won't let me fuck (girl you eating all my food
girl drinking all my beer)
I really need to bust a nut (you're smoking all my weed yeah)

You rub your ass against me
On the disco floor
I asked you for your number
And you said hell nooooo
You always hang around me
Everydaaaaaay
Different women wanna kick it
But you scare them awaaaay
Now I get up ended
When you come around
Cause I'm tired of my organs
Going up and down
That sucks
Cause she won't let me fuck

She won't let me fuck (oh give it to me baby)
I really need to bust a nut (don't play with my head again)
She won't let me fuck (let me hit it baby
yeah let me hit it baby)
I really need to bust a nut (are you a lesbian)

Oh let me lick it baby
Yeah let me stick it honey
I'll give you my money
Girl you can have it all
Go ahead and have a ball
If you want you can take em both
Baby

In the year 2000
I see thousand
Of pretty young women I found arousin
Grocery store shoppin
Magazine browsin
Many different ways to keep their hair styles in
Full of boredom
I walk toward em
Get em close to me
Cause I'm suppose to be
Male aggressor
Female impresser
Say the right things possibly undress her
But that's the post game
This is still the pre game
Silly woman she game
Baby what's your name
Even though I'm a freak
I play it off like a college geek
Crack a smile and politely speak
With intelligent to the women I select
Hoping that she don't detect
My egotistical chauvinistical lust
I thrust till I scream like Mystikal
YAAAAAAHHHH!
The wrong message I hope I'm not sendin
Laughin and pretendin my dick's not extendin
Can't be over zealous she might discover
She's walking away BITCH! blew my cover

She won't let me fuck (you know I love it)
I really need to bust a nut (please don't change the subject)
She won't let me fuck (we could've fucked all night long)
I really need to bust a nut (but you telephone number is bone)
She won't let me fuck (girl you got a lot to give)
I really need to bust a nut (you dress so provocative yeah)
She won't let me fuck (I can see your lingerie from real far away)
I really need to bust a nut (bitch! you must think I'm gay)

Aw don't make me beg
Baby let me rub your leg
Don't make me cry
Look into my eyes
Girl you so damn pretty
Stop acting so ???
Let me rub some oil on your ti hahaha
Yo I'm up outta here she don't want to fuck cuz</pre>
