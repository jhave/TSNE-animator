Song:   Cold and Empty
Typed by: tim_timbo_2003@hotmail.com

Maybe I've been on the road too long
Living my life through these songs
I guess loving a music man
Really wasn't in your plans
Does it matter if I'm sorry again
And why should I apologize
You knew all along this was my life
You know my in's and out's
All of my fears and doubts
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without

And this whole world seems cold and empty
Someone please turn on the lights
Lord if there's an angel you could send me
I could use one here tonight

Where am I supposed to go
My only home was in your soul
I know that I can't stay here
And drown in a pool of tears
Should I pack my pride and face this life alone

And this whole world seems cold and empty
Someone please turn on the lights
Lord if there's an angel you could send me
I could use one here tonight

Maybe it's me who's cold and empty
And in my darkness I cannot see the light
Please God if there's an angel you could send me (if there's an angel)
Cause there's one missing from my life

You are my heart, you are my soul
Wherever you are, that's where I go
You know my in's and out's
All of my dears and doubts
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without
Baby it's the life I love but it's you I can't live without
Yeah, the life I love, the life I love, but it's you I can't live without</pre>
