[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous
So when you see me I'm just gettin paper, paper
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous

[Verse One: Bun B]
Say! I'm a trill ass nigga, wait let me define
I'm down for my issue with that bread on my mine
I'm built for that big boy shit like Depends
And outside of the fam, we ain't got no friends
I got a couple priors a couple pendin
We know you ain't a gangsta hoe so stop pretendin
I checked your resume it don't compute
If ya bought this and sold that where's ya loot?
I know you don't wanna compare ya hustle game with me
Your cards two years old and your chain is three
Bitch you can't hang with me, and it's plain as day
Your niggas ain't got it in 'em then swing this way
Your reputation is built on bullshit
So the four fifth I pull quick and give you the full clip
I didn't want to but I had to do it
Since I did it for the hood I was glad to do it, nigga!!!!

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous
So when you see me I'm just gettin paper, paper
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous

[Verse Two: Webbie]
Look! I'm trill young savage I'm the youngest of the fam
Bad bitch long hair good weed in the air
Got a ounce of that kush no seeds up in there
Virgin bitch tight puss had to squeeze up in there
When a nigga hit the do' you know it G's up in here
It got cold all the pussy niggas freeze up in here
Me, Slay, Bad Azz, Bun B up in here
Four G's see we all blow trees we don't care
Mac 10 snuck it in for the clowns 'round here
Make a motherfucker sit they ass down somewhere
Had some niggas outside waitin 'round somewhere
Headline on channel nine you got found somewhere
I'm a laugh my ass off blowin a pund somewhere
With two big flippers and some gowns and some slippers
Hot metal like the weather more clips than the Clippers
Savage Life in stores now 'gon get it nigga
SO!!!!!!!!

[Chorus: Nicole Wray]
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous
So when you see me I'm just gettin paper, paper
H-U-S-T-L-E Get yo' game up, game up
Don't be walkin 'round tryin to blame us, blame us
We be everywhere we street famous, famous

[Verse Three: Lil' Boosie]
Look! Some say I talk alot of shit well I was raised wrong
Coke dealers who got tired of bein broke niggas
I'm walkin outside with the four five yeah!
I can't be scared drinkin purple to the head
Permit the scene yeah we leanin in that boot nigga
Heroin got niggas gone so we shoot quicker
They call us country cause we thuggin in a small county
City folk they ain't grateul for their good surroundings
I run that shit that make the real nigga stand up
It's Boosie Bad Azz trap like and what!!
Asylum signed me, now a nigga find me
On B.E.T. with W-E-E-D
I.E. Ninety eight, I'm an underground hard hitter
How you spit how you spit it? God nigga
Kay Slay I'm underrated and I promise you
I'm fittin to hit the rap game and this what I'm a do
Fuck I don't love like Rosa Parks hit the bus
Niggas in the south spittin but them niggas ain't us (THEY AIN'T US!!!)
We drank tusk, smoke purp with the DipSet
Grip teks, and hit niggas in they flippin neck
All I want is my respect, I ain't 'gon say nothin else
I'm a let the case rest Boosie Bad Azz!!!!!!!!</pre>
