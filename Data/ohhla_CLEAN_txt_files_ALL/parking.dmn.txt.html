Chorus (Domino &amp; Ms. Tasha):

(Domino)

This for all us
That ain't gettin' jiggy for the club cuz we tennis shoe ballers
Domino game tight, so when they at the door with the simpin'
I'ma be 

(Ms. Tasha)

Parking lot pimpin'

(Domino)

This for all us
That ain't gettin' jiggy for the club cuz we tennis shoe ballers
Is your game trump tight?  If they at the door with the simpin'
What you be?

(Ms. Tasha)

Parking lot pimpin'


First Verse (Domino):

Jumped in the shower after the tossin' up that ass she was droppin'
Then I start dialin', callin' up the homies cuz it's poppin'
Loc got the fire and the weed
And niggas puttin' flies on the beamers and the jeeps
Hey, hey, hey, like Dwayne say
We be lovin', when bitches doin' the Butt like they fuckin'
Can't wait til' tonight, cuz
Tryin' to find me a tight one and lookin' for the right one
I put cash for that ass so I'm lookin' for the status
Some of these chickens got asses like jackrabbits
It's all good when you dick the twat
I hope you pimp the twat
Let me tell you yo I pimped the twat
Money can't buy love, it's all bases
You lookin' for it in the wrong damned places
So take a ride with D, I be V.I.P.
And then I mention that I'm pimpin'?

Chorus

Second Verse (L.S.):

Now they can tell how I'm dressed that I ain't fuckin' around
I'm Meoshe'd out the game, George grippin' the ground
Chevy red baseball cap on flamin'
Just to let 'em know that I'm still maintainin'
Trust me
If I don't bust a hoe, a hoe gone turn around and bust me
Don't play on games, don't say no names
Don't wear no skirt if you ain't go no strings
Gold thangs on the Eddie Bauer
Plus we out here ballin' to the highest power
And give a fuck if they let us in the club
But not, because the real thug niggas in the parking lot
Don't hate, congradulate a nigga if he score
Take the next man hand if he bust a hoe
I'm lookin' for a dime
Not a three, not a five, not a seven or a nine

Chorus

Third Verse (Domino):

Damn, I should've known it would happen
Niggas need to go on with the gat
Activate the violence or parking lot pimpin'
I'm tryin' to get mine 'fore these niggas start trippin'
Now they runnin' from the sirens, 'fore my beamer skirt out
Baby jumped in with her skirt out
Banked a left turn we at her house
Fuckin' with this indo, this hendo
Three bitches, one came late with her kinfolks
Now you niggas know why Diggady made that bomb hit "Ass for Days"
Fuckin' in the sauna 
I ain't big on the weed, but these bitches got marijuana
And hennessey
Drinkin', livin' large, and talkin' bout freakin' things
Bustin' guts while we're watchin' Mitsubishi big screens
Woke up the next morning, hungover now I'm walkin' with a limp
Parking lot pimpin'
