[Iriscience] 
Uh, Platform Squadron 
Dilated Platoon, Evidence infantry 
Babu heavy artillery 
Rakaa Iriscience communications, stealth operations 
Platform Squadron, Soul Assassins, The Alchemist 
Suckers are hidin 

[Evidence] 
Yo turn the power on, insert the disk 
Tonight you ain't the joint if you ain't Muggs or Alchemist 
Most kids shoulda listen, my catcher should warn ya 
(Fuck down the center, it's about brushin the corners) 
Evidence, the main element to mystery 
Try to seize the moment, the future just was history 
Intelligent, they gasped, the industry detected 
I knew superstarts who now can get arrested 
Love rhymes off the shit I thrive 
Tried but couldn't get in to see KRS live 
Document my thoughts in order as they come 
(That's the sound of the man!) Obsessed wit drums 
Beat up the one, kill the two-three etcetera 
Four starts the war, repeat the loop, beats competitor 
For better or worse, edit my curse, still explicit 
Vocals intact, your logos could never diss it 
So check it out, exhale the blown trees 
Don't miss a thing, dot my I's, cross my T's 
From seven seas yo yo to seven continents 
From the alphabet, vowels and consonants 

*Babu cutting up sample* 
"Suckas are hidin" [B-Real] 

[Iriscience] *in background* 
Now you know, suckas be hidin 
But they can't dodge or they can't camoflague 
Platform is in full effect 
Evidence, Iriscience, Babu 
The Alchemist on the track, pushin buttons 
Pullin strings, the Dilated Wild Style 

The globe trotter, earth, wind, fire and water 
Turnin local rappers into neighborhood martyrs 
Platform's home, the city and spot blown 
I got poems that burn more ears than hot combs 
I motivate, live on stage, there's no debate 
Babs, you got time in the pocket, throw the break 
I take it to the brink when decoding the snake 
In Holland, next to Fat Beats, rollin the dank 
Dilate, build upon the Aquarius dawn 
And they how they call the Hollywood branch to Magic Juan 
The specialist is on, my people have been scarred 
Basically, Babylon where Barbie and Ken star 
Assassin got Soul plus self control 
Breathe how they breathe and slip past patrol 
Appreciate the art so I use my bow 
Maybe load a poison dart in the tube and then blow 
I make crowds explode wit the beats and rhymes 
When it's time to overthrow then you'll be assigned 
Exercise caution, speakin revolution 
I could do alone it but together we're too strong 

"Suckas are hidin" *Cut and scratched by Babu* 

[Iriscience] 
Ahah, Dilated, full effect 
Stealth, makin moves, unseen but felt 
Uh Babu, uh uh Evidence roll out 
Uh Alchemist roll out, Iriscience 
Soul Assassins, Muggs </pre>
