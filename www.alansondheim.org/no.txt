Cutting the Timber

A man lay down across the threshold of the kitchen outside, head within.  
He was to represent the saw. Two players now took hold of his feet
outside, while two others caught his head and shoulders in the kitchen.  
They pulled against one another, forward and backwards, as if they were
sawing wood, until one pair proved too strong for the other.

- Irish Wake Amusements, Sean O Suilleabhain, Mercier, cork, 1967, p. 82.

get anyone else to go with her and later she water-skied into a diving
board.

How those years have passed away! Memories are all I have and I know

How those years have passed away! Memories are all I have and I know
they're real! I'm not making anything up, I'm not fabricating! They happen
just as I tell them!

I remember Dina Raker's breasts and saying I was sad her dad (maybe it was
her mom) died and she said you're not you don't care at all.

How those years have passed away! Memories are all I have and I know
they're real! I'm not making anything up, I'm not fabricating! They happen
just as I tell them!

I remember sitting out in a gym exercise and blaming the others for the
action and feeling shamed afterwards for my cowardice.

How those years have passed away! Memories are all I have and I know
they're real! I'm not making anything up, I'm not fabricating! They happen
just as I tell them!

The only way I could peel out with my mom's Plymouth was in reverse.

just when he wasn't looking 
you were out of sight
should the poor boy leave the town
because you're good looking
in the middle of the night

i've fallen victim to officialese.
i believe strongly that because there are substructures to my work, 
that it far and away deeper than yours.
i believe that the codes and protocols that accompany my pieces
make them stronger than yours in every way.
i believe that the escape within the officialese, codes, and protocols
in my work is based on their presence which gains them immeasurable
strength.
in order i believe that human choice all the way around is weak,
that a degree of machinic intervention is absolutely necessary 
for the production of meaning today.
i have been seduced by this belief, for which i offer few apologies,
it is the machine within me that holds back.
almost as a young girl on her first date.

Work


(Adapted from State of West Virginia Department of Mines Inspection Report 
Number 14, 1956)

I keep a weekly record of old works, airways and escape ways.
I make air measurements every two weeks and keep a record with pen or 
indelible pencil.
I see a travelway with the air intake to all sections in the mine, and a 
hoist when the intake is a shaft.
I examine idle and abandoned sections of the mine three hours before 
employees are permitted to enter.
I do not leave a dangerous place until it is made safe.
I wear a hard hat and hard-toed shoes.
When I am grinding, I wear goggles and when cutting, welding, or striking 
where particles may fly I wear other eye protection.
I remove the front ends of cutter bars while the machine is being trammed.
I use roof bolt drill bits less than one and three-eights inches in 
diameter.
I confine the roof bolts.
I remove all cuttings from drill holes before explosives are placed in the 
hole.
I use only one kind of explosive in a shot hole.
I do not use coal dust or inflammable material for tamping.
I stem holes tightly and full to the mouth.
I use wooden tamping bars.
I do not use fuses of squibs.
I use metal scrapers attached to wooden tamping bars not more than eight 
inches in length.
I insert blasting caps in line with the explosives, not at an angle.
I keep the leg wires of electric blasting caps shunted until connected for 
firing.
I fire shots promptly after charging.
I warn persons that shots are to be fired so that they may withdraw to a 
place of safety.
I warn persons not to return to the face after a shot.
I shoot coal from the Solid-Places Rock-Dusted to the face.
I roll up shooting cables when not in use.

notes towards a phenomenology of motion-capture manipulation


the linkages in mc are graphs characterized by connectivity and linkage 
length.
the linkages in mc are contingent to the geomatics of the body itself.
the mapping is fuzzy and one-to-one.
mappings can be changed. from an _external_ viewpoint, affine and other 
transformations: scale, rotation, translation.
from an _internal_ viewpoint: fold, cut, split, join, and any conceivable 
remapping, including those approaching the implicate order.
from an external viewpoint: identity read from equivalence.
from an internal viewpoint: the potential of inversion and other 
topological mappings.
in the graphs, all nodes/linkages are conventional; by virtue of 
contingency, they have the potential to fly apart.
flying apart: _stack_ or _heap._ in the stack, order is preserved and it 
is a simple matter to reconstitute the mapping.
in the heap, order is chaotic; reconstitution depends on the links 
remaining intact.
consider the linkage _parasitic_ in relation to the nodes: holding 
dispersion in check. in this sense order is parasitic on disorder.
neutrality: any mapping is equivalent to any other mapping.
responsibility: nodes are responsible to their linkages. linkages are 
responsible to their nodes.
abandonment: a node may be abandoned. an abandoned node has no linkage.
a linkage exists by virtue of its nodes; there are no abandoned linkages. 
metaphoric: every remapping inscribes the ascription of meaning.
culture is discovered in the remappings. what is applied to mc of the body
is applicable to any mc, of any named entities. 
the graphs of any entities including bodies are rigid designators.
there is a fuzzy boundary where the designators fall apart; at this point 
entities and bodies disappear.
all disappearances carry the weight of political economy and inquiry.
there is no first and last node. there are no first and last linkages.

short sequence of west virginia mine bldgs. i'm embarrassed about these, i 
didn't do anything, just photograph them for whatever purpose, i'm not yet 
sure, i'm sure there's a background in the foreground somewhere, i'm not 
there yet, i've just been here a few days, but i've been in coal all my 
life, well that's not true, but i was raised in the anthracite district, 
well this is bituminous, still these resonate, heavily reduced in size, 
the moire patterns and indecipherable signage are a guarantee, perhaps 
these are a punctum in barthes' sense, i'm sure that's it, you're getting 
an insight into me, i know you're not particularly interested, my family 
wasn't a mining family, retail in a mining community, you'd hear the mine 
whistles blow, read of the deaths and cave-ins, mine closings and every 
day which mine would be operating when, the miners would check in and 
always polish on the radio, but i'm not embarrassed about these, i found 
them out, i framed and photographed with care, i'm certain of the reason, 
there's a foreman in the background somewhere -

dismemberment is a state we come to.

Text Manipulation (for Center for Literary Computing, WVU):


We need to implement with a simple interface if possible:

Please note many of the following overlap -

Input: Text of any sort
          keep spacings / eliminate spacings
          keep tabs / eliminate tabs

Input placed within: single file
                     array
                     hash

Output: single file of manipulated text
         with original file intact
        "core dump" of file with protocols / processes attached

Manipulations: substitution (similar to awk)
               word for word
               letter for letter
               line for line
               etc.
               In other words: Y for X

               reverse line (similar to rev)
               reverse file
               reverse words (words in reverse "reverse in words")
               reversed words ("sdrow ni esrever")
               reversed lines (etc.) (similar to tac)

Eliminations:  first instance word / letter / line < rest eliminated

Functions (Doublings etc.): Given X, then f(X)

Fields: Reordering fields (similar to awk)

Filtering lines / words / letters: (similar to grep)

Randomizing: Generating (lines / words / letters) > texts
              Various Grammars
              Various Lists (nouns / verbs / adverbs / etc.)

Randomizing: Filtering (ability to set parameters - for example:
              randomizing field order
              randomizing elimination order)
              etc.

Topological: Folding Texts
             Splitting Texts
             Joining Texts (end to end / side by side)
             Internal block removal (see emacs)
             "Crumpling" Texts

Numeric and code: Translating texts into hex, binary, octal, digital
                    f(X) on hex, binary, octal, digital
                  Translating full text file / inodes etc.
                  Codes - see /usr/games Unix/Linux directory:
                    Morse / figlets
                    Caesar (rot 13 as special example)
                    pig / bcd / ppt / banner
                  
Later: Embedded Babel etc. translation
       Pictographic translation (Dongba, hieroglyphic, etc.)

Reviews of books I like and more -


Paul Graham, Hackers & Painters, Big Ideas from the Computer Age, 
O'Reilly, 2004

This is a rather frustrating book, because there is a great deal of
information buried in a fairly flat landscape. I'm not sure why it wasn't
edited down to a more concise format. The author talks a great deal about
programming, languages, and sites such as Orbitz which is written in lisp. 
The chapters that fascinated me most are near the end: Programming 
Languages Explained, The Hundred-Year Language, Revenge of the Nerds, and 
The Dream Language. The author extols hackers and user-friendly 
languages, and has made me want to learn lisp; he writes extensively on 
its advantages. I like lines like "There are worse things than having 
people misunderstand your work. A worse danger is that you will yourself 
misunderstand your work." On the other hand, there are far too few 
examples - parts of the book might be already too simple for programmers, 
but parts are also too simple for humanities-based theory. I'd recommend 
this book to anyone interested in thinking about the issues raised, but 
not expecting too many answers.

The Works of Mencius, translated etc. James Legge, Dover edition. 

I'm on a slow-reading email list for Mencius - the book is terrific, even
after millennia have passed. I had expected a much drier text - it's not
at all. A tremendous guide to early Chinese culture as well.

Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers, Harvill, three volumes 
(paperback). 

If you read anything in the philosophy of mathematics - or philosophy for
that matter - or the history/phenomenology of symbols - or the
historiography (not to mention history) - of computers, you should run out
the door and buy these. They're critical. First volume, early history;  
second volume, modern number-system, third volume, computer and the
information revolution. On top of everything else, they're exciting to
read.

George Dunnington, History and Progress of the County of Marion, West 
Virginia, 1992 reprint of 1880. 

I've become fascinated by the history of West Virginia - ranging from
Native Americans through the mines and mine war. Fairmont in Marion was
the home of Israel Forman, who made the cabinet cards I have in my current
exhibition here (around 1889). Now it turns out that a fire which
destroyed the downtown in 1876, just around the time of the Centennial,
was discovered "burning up the stairs leading to Foreman's (sic)
photograph gallery" and that it was most likely deliberately set. The plot
thickens but nothing remains, not even of Main Street, which seems to have
disappeared altogether from the town, probably through renaming.

Stefan George, Der Teppich des Lebens und die Lieder von Traum und Tod mit 
einem Vorspiel, Georg Bondi, Berlin, 1915 - probably first published 1904. 

I just purchased this for $8 at a used bookstore - what fascinates me is
the early sans serif type - the outside is typical art nouveau, as is the
title page - but the poems themselves are set in another style altogether.  
Anyone know the history of sans serif?

Robert Karl Reischauer, Early Japanese History, 1969 reprint from 1937, 
only Part A, 

and no, this isn't _the_ Reischauer, but a brilliant book documenting the
subject year by year, as in chronicle form (gathered from a great number
of sources), as well as an outline, diagrams, and tables - if you're
interested in this subject, I think this work would be indispensible - you
can get both volumes on abe for as little as $40. Even if you're not
interested in the subject, these are amazing reading.

Volney's Ruins, or Meditation on the Revolutions of Empires, translated 
under the immediate inspection of the author from the sixth Paris edition, 
to which is added, The Law of Nature, and A Short Biographical Notice, by 
Count Daru: also, The Controversy between Dr. Priestly and Volney, Boston, 
1835. 

Has anyone read all of Volney? I'm fascinated by this work, which I'm
dipping into - I'm sure it's been republished - it's available all over
the Net - influenced the Shelleys - he knew Washington - hysteric
romanticisms, orientalisms, fantastic accounts, dialogs, everything -

Alan Sondheim, recent work, 

has involved motion capture bvh files created for Poser; background is
supplied by images from Cooper's Rock and Gentile Glass company. The
result is the dismembered high-speed post-modern body as the contacts are
remapped onto bodies plural, as well as floor-heaps and straight-forward
topological splits/joins, etc. The background of the recent pieces
attempts to impose a narratology, if not a narrative, upon the results.
Other work has involved the creation of a filtering program for ascii
texts (with the aid of two c++ programmers) which will use mathematical
functions as its basis.

"difficult to get carbide"


difficult to get carbide, calcium carbonate, necessary for the two miner's 
lamps; the bottom chamber is filled with the same, water drips from the 
upper, acetylene is produced which escapes from a nozzle, burning, a lime 
residue is formed. but the lamps are outmoded, and apparently one needs a 
permit for the substance, which is part and parcel of West Virginia 
history; i want to illuminate bodies with the same, technical apparatus, 
works; i want to see the reflective glow of heat on skin from fair 
distance to fair distance.

the program is to eval an expression in x over a text, filtering out the 
hits after taking the int. strings are needed in arrays, input and output 
files, and the two programmers working with me, undergraduates, have been 
three days at it, the room is cool, thermostat fixed so we're back at a 
homeostatic temperature independent of the external world.

the project is to provide tools for working between code and the real, 
thinking of any entity as filterable; one might eventually move from 
[a < filter > b] to [<a filter b>] to [filter(b)]; in other words the 
ontology moves from objects (a,b) to process/object(b) - which reflects on 
states replaced by operators, entities replaced by processes etc., shades 
of Whitehead here.

everyone born in WV that we've talked to has worked in the mines or has 
relatives who have done so. one of the people we've met spent years 
preparing lamps for his father and grandfather; i'm hopeful he'll be able 
to help get it working again. he mentioned a place that still sells 
carbide.

impure


suffering indescribable, dead raccoon by the roadside, her babies starving 
in the woods, there are new dead birds under the overpass, sad chirpings 
of starving babies, nature is one vast wound, and we are the progenitors, 
we tear each other in two, to fuck, our dreams fuck our dreams, we are 
furious, but not with ourselves, we claim everything, we claim nothing
