[Intro - Faez One] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels) Yeah, uh huh
Been a lot of shit that I held back
But I'ma let you know now
Blackout, it's gettin' dark in here

[Verse 1 - Faez One]
Turn on the light, let me see what's in front of me
All of a sudden, this picture I painted just turned ugly
I'm tryin' to do good, but the devil's fuckin' wit me
'Cause I ain't ever had no beef, but now I need some fuckin' heat
It seems like every time I get it I lose it
Get it, abuse it, and what I'm left with is useless
'Cause three years in a row, I felt like the world was mine
And three years in a row, I lost it all in the blink of an eye
And I believe what I do 'll come back one day
But why am I still losin'? I can't take the pain
Am I to blame? Please excuse me for my rotten ways
I'm just tryin' to do what I gots to do so I get paid
Get down and pray to the souls from up above
And hopefully my guardian angel will show me some love
Forgive me for my sins and all the shit that I did
And hopefully she won't let it reflect onto my kid

[Chorus - Faez One &amp; Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)

[Verse 2 - Crypt The Warchild]
Y'all don't know what it's like bein' born with stress against you
Only feelin' in this world is the life within you
You'd have to be damn near dead to see the nights I been through
Damn near dead to feel the wind beneath you
Envisionin' so much, my minds an open window
Where I gather all these thoughts for all your broken info
If seein' is believin', then there's more to live fo'
My only reasonin' is breathin' and I live to just hope
What you know about bein' bedside next to your girl
On poison control IV's 'cause she can't stand the world?
And what you know about no heat and no electric?
I sold my MP to pay the bills, I'm so pathetic
I wake up and go to work, back aches and my shoulders hurt
And what's it worth? I'm easily checked and don't control my earth
Still walk these hollow grounds, bein' lost but never found
Say to the Lord, "I'll die for music", but there's never sound
Screamin' in vein, everything be seemin' the same
Ask my mom, "What's the problem, why am I feelin' this way?"
Ask my pop, "Can you solve it?", this game, I'm bleedin' to stay
More then willing to give it up if I can't live it up
Hand in my clutch, gun in my lap
Doin' a buck and some change, not knowin' where the fuck I'm at
I try to maintain, the pain is unstoppable
Put my son on my back and I maneuver through the obstacles

[Chorus - Faez One &amp; Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)

[Verse 3 - Vinnie Paz]
1988, pops died, middle of the night
Forty-six years old, middle of his life
My mother ain't have a job, poppy was on his grind
And we ain't got no money, so she lose her fuckin' mind
Lenny helped out, and that was real
But he had a little daughter to raise, and that's the deal
My other brother, I won't mention his fuckin' name
'Cause he ain't worthy of my bitterness or fuckin' pain
Me and my mother, all we needed was some love
And my brother, all he needed was his drugs
How could you look at us with a job, we was poor
It's your mother birthday, you don't give her a call?
You have two nephews and a beautiful niece
But they don't think of you as Uncle, they think you deceased
I'm so fuckin' mad that I got a slug for you
But Mommy raised me better, I got love for you

[Break - Vinnie Paz] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
I'll see you on the street, dog, we gonna handle it
One on one, beat you down and then hug you
Tell you I love you, daddy, but now, fuck you

[Chorus - Faez One &amp; Crypt The Warchild] + (Tony Perez)
(The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
They say, "One day here, it'll make sense"
That's why we get high and stay bent
Even the rose grows from the pavement
Tell 'em, Tone (The rage of Angels)
