[Snoop Dogg]
Four tires, dayton wires
We got that kind of shit to keep the Ward on fire
We blow trees, count G's, so get it how you live
From the streets to the sweets, nigga, I'm the executive
I give to the needy cause I run with the greedy
I split it in half like a muthafuckin' diddy
Nigga with that West Coast life
We coast like I drink all day down MLK
With a bitch in the back, breaking up the blunt from my muthafuckin' sack
Pass my yack, where the limp be at
Bring strap, and uh, turn up the music
You know how we do's it
Dogg house, no doubt, No Limit nigga
We used to get seven but now it's eight figures
Get what you want from the works about that ak'n bad
On they ass with this come back

The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg

[Lil' Italy]
Snoop it ain't no different way from me, I'm on a one way course
Barely breathing baby on life support
It's like that, I gotta get back, so when I kick it and gig
Now I'm on a new page, will they looky here
Flash floods, no offense, flow friend flash that photo, gotta go
Anotha dogg, so ride episode
There ain't no caboose baby troops and we fall in line
And I'm gettin' my due respect because it's bout that time
I can't tell if they a friend or foe
Or a lady, or a tramp or a new wavin' bows
It's about dedication, loyality, pawns and rotees
Castle sticks, blue prints, known celebrities
So it's all up to you, what the fuck you gon' do
How you gon' whip when you ain't got your crew
So you better believe 'em, Snoop Dogg, and managa Don Datta
Did you recieve it, hey there, nigga's coming hotta
Dogg's ride

[Snoop Dogg]
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg

[Don P]
Give us this day, our daily bread
You need to fuck with that like you need a hole in your head
From the eight to the dirty south, you know how we do
Don Dadda, Lil It, Doggfather Snoop, No Limit smash Jenny Lou
And I'll betcha bottom dollar we gon' ball harder than many do
My flow intoxicate more bitches than the henny do
When them tank doggs ride high is what you better do
Every verse I kick back like a action movie
Cut the baddest groupies, duckin' busta doobies
But if you need me dogg all you gotta do is whistle
And I'll be there wit' a blunt and a pistol
When dogg's ride

[Snoop Dogg]
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg
The sky's all grey and I'm draped in blue, what the fuck you gon do
You better ride dogg
A nigga talking shit about me and my crew, so what the fuck I'm gon do
You better ride dogg

You better ride dogg
What what, you better ride dogg
You better ride dogg
You better ride dogg</pre>
