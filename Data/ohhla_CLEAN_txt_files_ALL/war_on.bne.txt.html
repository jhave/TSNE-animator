[Krayzie]
We so thuggish ruggish (the motherfucking war is on)
You better suit up and do like Krayzie Bone 
Cause the motherfucking war is on
What you gon' do what you gon' do do

Say nigga we marching stompin in the big black boots 
With my niggas in the fatigue suits ready to shoot
Running with the AK-47
Niggas trying to survive they ain't trying to go to heaven
Motherfuckers shooting they ain't even asking questions it's these
Young ass niggas they straight up thugged out 
They killas like that little soldier boy cause we livin in the killin field
Tombstone soldier rest in peace a real warrior
Nigga been ready for war we are
The motherfuckers on the street with the heat 
Knockin them hoes off they feet
Say boy it's a jungle out there 
Get a couple casualties every year
The goal is to stay alive
The mission is to make money
The enemy the police
We gotta bust back at 'em make some motherfucking examples out them assholes
We're not even concerned strike a match drop it on the gas 
And let the motherfucker burn burn burn baby burn
Army strategic and I pledge allegiance to the 12 gauge mossberg
I'm that nigga Mr. Sawed-off  Leatherface got a big gun in your face 
Behind that bush and when they roll by we jump out the bush make a push
Bustin why they runnin buckin everything comin murda y'all ain't said nothin
Got a couple of niggas for that 
Stay strapped from the front to the back and the extra clip off in my jacket 
so when I run out I restack it and pap it some more 
We ready for war

chorus:

So what nigga pull your gun 
That's exactly how we play
Screaming bloody murda mo all day 
The buckshots spray daily all day

[Snoop]
Money makes murders sex lies crimes fo-fives
Nines heaters jackers killa 
Cap pealers and drug dealers
Snitches snakes bitches fakes
Bad breaks and heartaches
Give and take shake and bake
Boy I gots to stack my plate
Bad news travels fast 
Real mashers always mask
Give a dog a bone send him on he bound to come home with some cash
Get you shit stack your chips
Tuck your heat watch that bitch
She might be cute but listen here my nigga that don't mean shit
Duck and dodge camouflage
My entourage is way in charge 
Krayzie Bone and Dog Capone
Yeah you know the war is on
Break a bitch shoot a snitch
Fuck a trick get your grip 
Smoke some dank pass some drank
And get off into this gangsta shit
Laying fools down Dog Pound Bone Thugs 1 luv 
And we banging from the streets to the club

chorus

[Kurupt]

Gangstas hoes I suppose 
Dip and dash cock and blast
Kurupt and Snoop Krayzie Daz
Layzie blazing up the hash
G'd as fuck gangstafied
High as the sky gangsta for life
Fuck a bitch hit a switch

I'm a G DPG DPGC OGDP
Ride on niggas blast on niggas
Dip and put the smash in niggas

[Layzie]
It's a war It's a war (there's a war going on)
When the was pop off where the fuck you gon be
In the front or the back city under attack
Every nigga from the nine nine front line marchin with a tech nine nigga 
where my thugz at
If you scared go to church motherfucker 
matter fact while you at it say a prayer for me
I'm prepared to heat
Heat a nigga in the streets with a gotdamn beat my heat lose to me
Khakis suits and fatigues
Nigga dressed to kill 
Nigga yes I will put a slug in you 
Nigga what you wanna do 
Cause I'm ready to shoot
And my high tech boots got me feeling bulletproof
I'm a superman nigga GI Joe like the wind blowing through a niggas area
More dead enemies I count up the merrier
And you ain't heard no collaboration scarier
I'm a walkin nightmare and I'm born to die
It's a war goin on what's happening
If you disrespecting my family it'll be hell to tell the captain 
Fuck all you playa haters and you po-pos 
Fuck all you politicians this war
Dedication to the criminal nation
Let the real thugs even the score
