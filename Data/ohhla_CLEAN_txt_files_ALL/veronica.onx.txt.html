[Fredro Starr (Sticky Fingaz) {Sonsee}]
(Yo what's up baby?)
Ay yo Stick man, shit is fucked up!
(Who the fuck this?)
It's fuckin Fredro man!
(Yo yo yo, turn the muthafuckin music down god.)
It's my fuckin word, Sticky, man!
(Yo what's up nigga?)
Muthafuckas wetted everything out there.
(What the fuck you talkin about?)
Muthafuckas is dead, son!
(Yo yo, calm down nigga, calm down!)
Word to fuckin mother man!
(Just tell me what happened, god.)
It had to be about eight o'clock (Uh huh, uh huh)
When niggas sprayed the block, it's mad hot
Yo half the spot got locked
(What? Who got shot?)
My little nigga Bill from down the hill
We had a one through five
I heard he might not survive (Aw, damn)
He caught one in his leg
Two shots hit him in his upper (What?)
Part of his chest, two inches above his vest
Heard you next (I'm next?)
That's the word in the projects
(What? Them niggas ain't no threat
 They'll whole set'll get wet
 Yo go get the AK, and my two nines with the silencers
 And at seven thirty, y'all niggaz meet me at Veronica's)
Aight, no doubt, yo be safe, yo nigga I'm out
{Let me talk to him, let me talk to him}
Yo yo Stick hold up, yo yo yo Stick, talk to Son
(Aight, aight) Don't even wet that done, yo I'm bringin mad guns
{Ay yo Stick, that's my word
 It might be them niggas from Riverside
 Cuz I heard they knew somethin
 About how my little nigga died}
(Who who, little Dave with the red car?)
{Yeah, he had beef up there
 With the same ones we seen at the strip arcade
 With the scar by his head}
(Aight aight, get the big shit, no bullshit, it's time to flip
 And I'll see y'all niggas later, be safe)
{No doubt, aight kid}

Then they jumped in the Expo
Aiyyo Son slow down, we got mad techs yo
Fuck that I'm vexed yo!
Yeah I know, I know but chill, let alone and chill
We meet the gods so we can bill on these niggas for real

It was a half an hour drive 'fore they finally arrive
Veronica came to the door, she smiled and said

[Veronica]
Hi, hi! Step inside, get out the rain get dry
Sticky's in the back playing pool by the sauna

[Fredro Starr (Sticky Fingaz) {Sonsee} *Veronica*]
We stepped in the back all I smelled was marijuana
(Yo what's up?) Yo nigga what's up
(You know I don't give a fuck
 Them niggas time's up
 You got them two nines or what?)
No doubt, I bought it all out
{Kid I'm ready to go to war!}
(Ay yo yo yo, chill let's play it smart
 And catch em by surprise
 We'll do it on the ninjas
 In the mornin before the sunrise
 Ay yo Veronica, *Yes?* yo gimme some beers
 And cook me some food, I'm starvin)
 *Ok, alright darlin*
Yo Stick, what's up with this bitch?
(I'm startin to like this chick)
Yo she a bad bitch
{Yeah, plus her dad is rich}
(Yo fuck it, rack it up
 C'mon lemme bust your ass
 Nine ball)
Yeah aight, put your money where your mouth is
Winner take all
{Ay yo, I got next, pass me a Beck's and a philly
 Cuz this L we bout to puff is for my nigga Billy}

A hour passed
 
*Dinner's ready* What's to eat?
*I made spaghetti in clam sauce*
(See? She know I'm the damn boss)
*I'ma go upstairs and lay down
 You guys enjoy your meal*
{Yo how many rooms this spot got? This crib is ill}
Ay yo this food is slammin, god
She cook like she black
(Yeah, and after this I'ma go upstairs and tear out her back)

*It's me, Veronica. Yeah they're all here right now
 Ok, alright*
(Veronica? *Huh?* Who was that?)
*Oh, oh just my dad*
(C'mere my little freak dog, why you lookin so sad?
 You want daddy to cheer you up?
 You know you like when I spank you
 So bend over by the bedpost and grab your ankles)
 
(After three nut, then fell the fuck out
 Cuz in the mornin gotta take care of this b-i
 No doubt)

Wake up motherfuckers!

[Fredro Starr]
Oh shit! What did I see?
Five niggas pointin guns at me (.?.) and Sonsee
*Fuck that! Shut the fuck up!
 Nigga get the fuck on the floor!*
Hit me dead in the jaw
With the chrome four four

[Sticky Fingaz]
Woke up the next mornin, couldn't hardly sleep last night
Oh shit my two nines is missin, wait somethin ain't right
Where the fuck that bitch go? Damn that hoe!
Wait, I know, that bitch in the kitchen praly makin me something to eat 
But still wearin my heat
Fuck it I'ma wake these niggas up so we can go hit the street
I went downstairs, couldn't believe my eyes
I seen Veronica with three guys twice my size
They all had guns but I was gatless
Last thing I saw was the kid with the scar
And then I seen blackness
Remember thinkin, how the fuck they know?
Oh, Veronica

Oh, Veronica, Veronica
