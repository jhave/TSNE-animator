{*a parody of The Fugees' song "Killing Me Softly"*}

Numbing my brain with that singer
Echoes for days in my head
Killing me slowly with this song
Killing me slowly with this song
Ruined my whole life with this tune
Killing me slowly with this song

Hi, you're tuned to WDUM, this is Moronic Mark.  
Comin' up this hour we got The Fuglies, and a 
little later we'll hear "Let's Do It" by The Polar 
Bears, then we'll probably hear The Fuglies again.  
If you've got something you'd like to hear, good 
for you.  Put it in your CD player.  And don't forget 
about our daily contest.  Give us a call and guess 
how many times today we're going to play this song.  
The person guessing closest to the actual number of 
plays without going over wins a crisp new 100 dollar 
bill printed right here in our studios.

I heard them play a dumb song
On WDUM
And then play a commercial
Then that same song again
And when the song was over
It echoed down my spine
Numbing' my brain with that singer (1 time)
Hear it for hours on end (2 times)
Digs in my brain like a pitchfork
Killing me slowly with this song
Goes on for hours in my head
Killing me slowly with this song

I felt nauseous and almost
Threw up in my hands
I thought I had a migraine
And then they played it again
I prayed that God would kill me
But I just kept on living
Numbing my brain with that singer (9 times)
Drops my IQ just a bit (12 times)
Killing me slowly with this song
Playing it over and over
Keeps going and going like that bunny
Killing me slowly with this song
(Yo, take it to the bridge...and throw it over the side)
(This song goes on, in fact it doesn't end
'Cause we're never gonna end the song )

Numbing my brain with that singer (87 times)
Don't even know all the words (142 times)
Threatened to blow up the station
That didn't stop them, or this song
Heard it that whole night in my sleep
Killing me slowly with this song
Numbing my brain with that singer...</pre>
