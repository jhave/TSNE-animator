[DJ Quik]
Yo, I say me smoke the Bombudd like it's going out of style

[DJ Quik]
Yo, I say me smoke the Bombudd almost each and everyday
Smokin the Bombudd me keeping doctor away
They homies see me comin and they know me spend cash
They jock my reggae rhymes so they double up by bag
Sometimes me get load that's the time I pull a twist
Me love to shake the dice punk these suckas for a hitch
Me never use a clip cus my finger nails long
Cus me smoke de any kind except the homegrown
Me like to smoke the bud but my eyes they get all red
My senses get dull and me forget what I said
Me find my joint now and me want to take a toke
Let take a long hit, hold the smoke until me choke!
