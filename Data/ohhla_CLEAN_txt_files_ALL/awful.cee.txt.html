I ain't leaving, I ain't leaving
Came to put the God in your body this evening
You can't run, you can't hide
Buckle in and enjoy the ride
For beyond all space and time
Jump on in y'all we wasting time
If you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

It's OK, it's alright
Came to put the boogie in your body tonight
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Just grab my hand and hold on tight
I'll be the light that will guide you there
You probably hate me but I hardly care
'Cause if you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

I said a sham a lama, shama a lama ding dong
You put the umm, whaw, whaw
Back into my smile child
That is why, that is why
You are the suga didi dip girl
If you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

Heyyyyyyy, everybody have some fun tonight
You got to give the groove a chance
Don't hesitate the time won't wait
You might not have tomorrow to dance

Now get up, and get down
I didn't come this far to be fucking around
Hey you and you too
Why you over there acting shy
Have a hit and let me get you high
Don't let this feeling pass you by
If you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing

Sham a lama, shama a lama ding dong
You put the umm, whaw, whaw
Back into my smile child
That is why, that is why
You are the suga didi dip girl
If you can't hang it's an awful thing
Such an awful thing</pre>
