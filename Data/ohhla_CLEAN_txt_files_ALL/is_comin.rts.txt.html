The Roots is comin' (16X)

[Black Thought]
I rip the vocal backflip yo the kid is a bad bro
I can drip it hipper than dip into calyp-so
A-dios, amigo, which means I gots ta G-O
Makes you wonder bout my number
Guess my address or my P.O., here's a hint:
I'm from Phila with a Del but not the Rio
Well, I'm guessing here is like exactly where the Phi go
Now, we got the Phila-Del-Phi why not top it off with an A?
The Philadelphiadic rhythmatic way I'm straight from Philly
Silly but rugged then a hill-billy
Just like I said before I sport my skully when it's chilly
My cap is from The Lay Up, my bows from The Gilly
The Roots, is out to blow up like a clip from out the milli
or the oo-wop, I do drop, gizzantic, the crew wop
From out the darkest field I goes to pick the funk crop
You can't deny the props so stop before your fronts
get loosened, introducing, The Roots y'all..</pre>
