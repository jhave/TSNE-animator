[T.I.]
Ay say K.T., I remember bruh, standin out ten of us
Flip a bird, split it up, antenna stickin up
For crooked cops patrollin if the red dog rollin all the dope
I'm throwin, fuck a jail, I ain't goin tonight
Quick to pull a fo'-fo' in a fight
Under the street lights rollin the dice
We were so enticed, by niggaz like slick money and ice
We figure prison it just come with the life, along with losin your life
And there was no way we thought
We'd go to jail for e'ry case we caught
For all the yay we bought, not a dime did we say we borrowed
Bought damn near every pair of J's at the mall
Had our way with the broads, hit the rink but we ain't skatin at all
Seem like every other day we'd brawl, that A.K. on call
When I think about all we done
It's amazin to see how far we've come
Remember? Ay

[Chorus: Mitchelle'l]
Ohhh! Oh-ohhh!
I remember walkin (walkin)
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket (in my pocket)
Now I'm watchin stocks like what's the options (options)
Uh-huh (uh-huh) uh-huh (uh-huh) how life's changed
I remember hustlin (hustlin)
Tryin to keep these crooked cops off us (off us)
Now I read about it in my office (in my office)
Uh-huh (uh-huh) uh-huh (uh-huh) how life's changed

[T.I.]
Ay say C-Rod, remember days we was slangin the hard?
In a crib with no lights we used to stay in the dark
Remember Cap and Mac Boney man, they were retarded
I don't know who kept us laughin the hardest
Since our stacks is the largest, didn't take us long to corner the market
I remember every day was a party
15, 16, was dreams of bein cocaine bosses
In pursuit of that we made so many terrible choices
Like the time we made away with that millenium
From the dealership before our day, wasn't we killin them?
Late nights, gun fights, high speed chases
So close to the good life we tasted
Damn the consequences pimp, if it's a chance we'd take it
First case a month in juvenile and get probation
When I think about all we done
It's amazin to see how far we've come
Remember?

[Chorus]

[Scarface]
We started small time, dope game hustlin that cocaine
Interstate traffickin, high feelin no pain
Numb to the fact that we was poisonin our own kind
I ain't give a fuck, he gettin his so I want mine
Young'n with that attitude, somebody finna give me that
I ain't give a fuck, how I got it, it was real as that
So if I had to peel a cap, somebody was dead then
Since I'm a killer that's the condition my head's in
Can't work too hard to get my money, I refuse to
Slave for the next man who raised nigga, fuck you!
These streets are 9-to-5, you want it we can get it for ya
And even though they steady changin this is still a hustle
Still got them same rules, may not be the same game
We done found some brand new money, still we maintain
The same integrity we upheld in the street light
Livin a motherfuckin dream nigga singin like

[Chorus] w/ Scarface ad libs</pre>
