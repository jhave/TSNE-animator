(singing)
Krayzie Bone and the bone, with my mighty-mighty warriors
With my mighty-mighty warriors

(chorus)
Cause this is all real, what you see
I said it's all real it's just the thug in me

(verse 1)
Nigga just because Krayzie quiet speak less 
Don't be mistaking my kindness for weakness
Humble but ready to rumble 
My violent side I can't deny
I'm like a Jekyl and Hyde gemini
Look if you see me quiet 
then I'm plotting to riot why tell me why tell me why in the eyes
I'm labeled a menace but I like it 
Destroy ya paranoia will make me blow you away but hey
Nigga got too close to me and that ain't how it's supposed to be
Nigga want respect but what do you show me you 
Playa hate and anticipate the day that you can see me fall
Better act like yo know I'm rolling with Mo posse up
Do damage and manage to wiggle our way out of handcuffs
As we strut as thugs we must doin our best to obey god violent in these times
Got to do what you gotta do war till ninety-nine
Slim nigga gotta get up and come and get it if it's really coming                
Now I got it and I'ma floor the niggas acting crazy
the safety's off come and get it if you really want it
(Hey, hey, hey) It's hating baby they gotta be so cold the gotta be heartless
In certain situations like retaliation

(chorus - 2x)
Nigga we keeping it all real we keeping it all real with the real
If it's real if it's real then stay real and be real

We come with nothing but the real thing baby 
Krayzie got nothing but the real thing baby 
We come with nothing but the real thing baby
 Krayzie got nothin but the real thing the real thing

(verse 2)
Baby now this is the sound of me and my trues we put this down way down 
So now if you hear me releasing some shells
Hit the ground with the quickness lay better stay down on the darkside 
Take a look and you'll find true niggas like no other kind
Nigga say fuck the wine indo inside swisher sweet get me high

(2x)
Ain't nothin get to nothin somethin got to be real real somethin got to be 
real

(2x)
I still be thuggin in the khakis boots and skullies 
And since I'm weed fiend for the green nigga gotta make that money man
 
(8x)
It's real always

(verse 3)
Last night I P.O.D'd next to me Ouija, Ouija
and I fell in this fucked up state of mind
Slipped in the dream and I see demons screaming telling me it's time to die  
Why me I see some niggas they coming to get me they creeping outside of my window  
I'm ready to bang bang bang aim the 12 gauge pump and my lead go       
Give it up for the bloody murda mo bloody murda mo mo mo
See a nigga when he go through the window had to put a bigger hole in his soul
If he get away running out my backdoor with me sawed-off swinging
Get ready to duck now to the guts buck pap pap pow

(2x) singing
I claim my thang to slang 
(murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo murda mo)
Them bloody bodies kill 'em all send them hoes up in flames 
Krayzie insane to the brain 

(verse 4)
Now I know I done did some dirt in my time 
cause the devil was stressing my mind 
messing with my mind nigga
Bone don't know every day they lie 
Turn to realize that everyday I can do it if I only pray
Maintain cause a nigga was lusting
For money had to get it cause a nigga was struggling
I hit him with the Mossberg y'all heard about Mr. Sawed-Off 
Leatherface till them lay round after round after round
They'll fall down down
May they lay may they lay from the eruption man
We putting them six feet deep we buck we bang
