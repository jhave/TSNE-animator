Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Go ahead and toot your shit
That party I'm a handle it
I took you down when you want it
I'm never turnt down, that's on me
I'm never turnt down, that's on me
Turnt down, Annie that ain't me
I'm never turnt down, that's on me
Turnt down, annie that ain't me

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
Ay, Annie I see you
These sweet niggas don't know what to do with you
I'm a act a fool with you
Because Annie you so damn bomb
You see other Annie's hating on you
They bomb in they own way
So don't act like you don't know
Bomb bitches on the floor

[Bridge: TeeFlii]
And they dangerous
And they dangerous
They dangerous
So Annie, girl

[Chorus: TeeFlii]

[Verse 2: E-40]
He tryna get his chalupa
His cheddar, his cheese
His fetta, his gudda
In the ghetto with Rugers
To soil the block
In the project like Supra's
Serving them knocks
Underground we're like rocks
In the hood with them chops
Looking out for the cops
Lifesavers up in their socks
Posting with that [?] like a shower
If you [?] clock get pushed back an hour
He trynna get laid, [?] persuade
[?]
She know he push pounds, she know he drink Crown
She know he stay turnt because he ain't never turnt down

[Chorus: TeeFlii]

[Verse 3: Kay Ess]
I [?] all gas, no brakes
Turnt up motherfucker, tats on my face
Fly every day, my jewelry like bling
Looking like a nigga came right out of a bank
And I don't talk none like deaf people
I just throw up gang signs like [?] people
Now if she want it like she say she want it
Then she gon' have to blow me like a fucking trumpet
Cause I'm knowing

[Bridge: TeeFlii]

[Chorus: TeeFlii]</pre>
