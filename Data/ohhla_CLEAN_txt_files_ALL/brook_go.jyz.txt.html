[Verse One: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap, there's no fear in my eyes where they lookin at
Better look on map, Besides, mi nah like to eye fight
Mi nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (CHRIST!!!)
But if a man test my Stuy, I promise he won't like my reply
Boom Bye Bye like Buju I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some gettin use to
Chain snatchin, ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrididge
Fatherless child, mama put double shifts
So the number runners was the only one I hanged widith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith
Fit no orangutans piddeals ciddaps like orange's I'm dangerous
PLEASE!!! Tell me what the name of this is

[Chorus: Santogold] (Jay-Z &amp; Santigold)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them
I Jack, I Rob, I sin
Awww man, I'm Jackie Robinson
Except when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, lucky we, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets I'm the Black Branch Ricky
From Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie
I pity, the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With long history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin, tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this!!!!

[Chorus: Santogold] (Jay-Z &amp; Santigold)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)

[Verse Three: Santogold]
While I'm doin my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge is the consequence
Once pretend now I paid my dues
Risk takers we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin
(BROOK-LYN!!!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin like we good color
Rip it to the core, underneath it or we oughta
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step one step give it up more
All this stuff and the streets are a mess
With big ass dreams and a sick death wish
Probably like the commercials says
Kill the voice screamin in my head

[Chorus: Santogold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!

[Outro: Santogold]
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!</pre>
