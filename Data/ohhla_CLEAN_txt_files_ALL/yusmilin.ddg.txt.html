[Andre Nickatina]
Man I'm F-I double L-M-O-E
I'm like Seabiscuit baby you can bet on me
I like Ben Franklin on bills
With cold c-notes on hotdays I chills
I don't know why they grinnin, them suckas ain't winnin
I can tell you this right from the beginnin
Baby, real rap cat in the flesh
I don't go to jail, I get house arrest, word life
In Cadillac I bring ya back
Man, on my birth certificate it says, "Born to rap"
And I'ma holla at you to get you goin
Orange Man, ball out like I'm Billy Owens
If you ain't knowin, I flip the script then dip the 'Dolph
Man, homie you can take a loss but I'm flip the cost
And like butter pancakes on the grill
With cold c-notes on hotdays I chill
You can see my greedy nature baby from a mile away
It's like Vegas baby even if ya in the Bay
You put this cold game down on a diva
A Quarterback lookin for a brand new reciever
Hut-hut, I break it down and roll it up
I like the rubberband do' before I fold it up
It's still lane enough, I gotta ride it tough
Because I'm lookin for another horse to saddle up
Man I spit it til you get it and ya had enough
And when you wake up there I am with the blunt, like what


[Equipto]
Let the real game carry on
I boss to call shots like Harry O.
And mad, cause I end up in your stereo
And she, sing along to every song
I got game by the six pack
Gift wrap ya up and sent rip back
Pimp taps and cut, mo' mileage, strike in the piggybacks
Gimme that weed quick when he let me rap
Any whack track I'm a monster
Ain't hard to find you can see me in my concert
Lean back posture, the game like a joy to me
I'm royalty, I threw away my royalties
I'm too cool like a silk through roof
With no radio play I'm still full proof
I live out the booth, see I don't need groupie flukies
Go bad on a choosey Susie
I rap in the back of the club with the Yak and the blunts
'Posed to make a toast with macks and thugs
And no love is the model, many ya live by
Huh, it's all there when I get high
Buckle up, sit tight full contact is a fist fight
Real deal get spilled by the rib tide
Why scream like seen through a fish eye
Good luck gettin this fly, bitch try


[Andre Nickatina]
It's like a roller coaster ride that you could ride again
I turn back like Picaso with a powerful pin
I don't know why the grinnin, man them suckas ain't winnin
I can tell you this right from the beginnin
Cause it's how many licks to the lillipop
I cop two pairs the first day the Jordan drop
I let my style run wild like the wind
Ride it like a surfboard all in the Benz
You can see my concentration baby when I roll the blunt
You keep starin I'ma spit about this game and stuff
I gotta put you in the mix right now
Quicker than a fresh young thorough Greyhound
Man I sport leather like a NBA basketball
I'm a hog, I could never ever pass to ya'll
I got it goin on, freak what you hoin on?
Man get the money movin baby we can blow a zone
Because its cats tryin to copy like Kinko's
My suits stay creased you'll never see wrinkles
Me and my comrades are just like the fashion parade
And never men wear houses only tailor made
I like to put a spin on it like a bowling ball
A rollin ya'll, the synphony is loaded ya'll
I spin it back to back man like a hit contract
I'm poppin that for that, you better get that scrap
Cause I rise outta bed like a cobra
Arch my back homie lift my shoulders
Play it like it's craps God, tell the freak to roll again
Shit, now she feelin like she born again, it's live</pre>
