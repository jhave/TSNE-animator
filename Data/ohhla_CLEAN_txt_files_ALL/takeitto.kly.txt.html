[Kelly]
Keith, Keith
They not ready for this

[Keith]
Ayo I can't hold it in, I gotta let it out
Girl, I'll take your love to the head without a doubt
Listen baby, do you think you are for the action
I give chicks butterflies like Michael Jackson

I'm so immaculate, there is no equivalence
Treacherous, imperial, impertenant, impeachous
Come a little closer, let me kick it in your ear
Keith Murray, Kelly Price, and take this to the head here

[Kelly]
Stepped in the room I saw you
Instantly knew I had to
Present my game and keep it cool
Wanted so much to kiss you
To let you know I miss you
I just laid back and let you move
But you keep

1 - 	Frontin' like you don't want me
	And actin' like you don't need me
	But it's okay, that's just your way
	There's a physical attraction
	Cause a chemical reaction
	So come on boy

	Inhale, exhale

2 - 	Breathe it in, breathe it out
	Flying high, ain't no doubt
	I take it to the head, your love
	On a ride, in the clouds
	Feelin' good, won't come down
	I take it to the head, your love

The time is right for romance
And I want you for my man
I know you want me for your girl, baby
Baby I know you're willing
So let's not fight the feeling
Give in to me and rock my world
But still you keep

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

Don't have to feel you (No, no)
Just when I'm near where you were at
(I get a) contact
Got my head spinnin'
I'm in a worldwind of your love
And it's got me all choaked up

[Keith]
Girl you off the hook, you banana's tonight
I gotta push up, cuz that thing look right
Oh no, say it ain't true, say it ain't so
You frontin' on your man Murray, that's alright, though
My crew is gutter, gutter
Rip their monkey ass like a hot knife ripping through butter
Don't let nobody tell you different, you and I was meant to be
Getting busy most beautifully

I shall until I succeed
To spoon feed y'all and give you exactly what you need
So don't cheat yourself, treat yourself
And put that player cool attitude up on the shelf
And relax yourself, and respect yourself
And protect yourself and respect yourself and
There's nothing further more to discuss
Take this to the head and feel the rush

Repeat 2
Repeat 2 with 1</pre>
