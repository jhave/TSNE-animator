R-e-s-p-e-c-t

Screaming out The Congregation off the whip
Popping clips

Pimping got 'em breaking out
Stop 'em with these dicks
We ghetto building on my block and stuff
Break 'em off when we getting buff
Stepping off in this thing what
Too much for the ???

Verse 2: T-Mac

I wonder what would Jesus do, if he was in my position
Would he grab for them gats
Waiting for ammunition

Killers and cons
Dirty South affiliated
Niggas with guns

Verse 3: Eleven Twenty-Nine

I'm making flashes to the man in the booth
To get 'em crunk
So you know just what I got up and did
I got 'em crunk

So if you ready say you ready

Riding dirty to the flo'

Verse 4: T-Mac

At 16 I was hustling trying to get paid
Trying to make a damn dollar for I go in my grave
Pimp a been paid
I was only short in my days
The way I been paid
Only cause I'm ducking them feds
This world of crime
Kept me in the street trying to grind
Bumping my mind
Cause that's how the system designed
I'm sick of struggling
I'm sick of hustling
I'm sick of running from the feds trying to bust again
I'm trying to maintain
One foot stuck in the game
I'm living lavish man
I'm use to having thangs
But cause I'm down for whatever
Cause T-Mac show no luv
2 gats on my side
Cause this whole world dying
