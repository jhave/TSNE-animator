[U-God]
Driving down the strip, and you see my spokes
And I rip off my shirt, like he's the Hulk
And I squeeze off volts, just to please your folks
And hip hop, yeah, needs a jolt
Then you fall to your knees, when I squeeze your throat
Cuz these hip hop fiends, they need they dope
And I puff on weed, then I blow out smoke
He's so feroc', now here's a dose
Now throw it to the left coast, whatchu expect, bro?
I let my tech blow, no, it ain't techno
You get your neck broke, python strong
You want problems, now bring it on

[Chorus: U-God]
Hear the sounds of the titans clash
Sucker M.C.'s try to bite this fast
Jody gon' put it on smash
It'll happen so fast, kick ass
The rap world thought that Wu won't last
Sucker D.J.'s keep playin' that trash
Jody gon' put it on blast
It'll happen so fast, kick ass

[U-God]
I been through 'nuff shit, and I paid the cost
Now I wear big hats, like I'm the boss
Knock you off your high horse, with no remorse
In hip hop, there's no need to floss
Those who don't believe, I leave you scorched
Peel out in the porsche, with dual exhaust
U-God is the name, the game is torched
Upside your head, you get banged with force
Throw it to the left coast, whatchu expect, bro?
I let my tech blow, no, it ain't techno
You get your neck broke, python strong
You want problems, now bring it on

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
