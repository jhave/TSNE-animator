[Tech N9ne]
Aint no way you bout to stop this sickness
From the deepest darkest part of Missouri
Psycho alpha skitzo get ya chest, ya diggin me
A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E P-O-W-E-R see me clownin
Look at all you playa hatas frownin
Raw, God said kill 'em all, Tech's backs to the wall 
Fightin for my life and I'ma bust back 'til they fall
And I ain;t even slangin them thangs
I'm hollerin ONE-EIGHT-SEVEN if you trippin wit Strange
I'm really real wit it, like my homie AJ say deal wit it
Pushin and pullin fightin for the meal ticket
In a minute I'ma do it like a villian 
I'ma get 'em in the middle of a bomb
Put 'em on the spot 
Till the funk go pop and they'll never have other calm
Tech Nizzle, when I'm fizzle this who be you
Rollin wit Dave Trap, Violet Brown, and 3DQ, hootie hoo
For those not knowin Missouli true
I'ma tell you like the Swedish would say it, "Sig Min Kuk"

[Hook]
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power, Absolute Power
Absolute Power! That's the only way to roll
Absolute Power! They love us everywhere we go
Absolute Power! Tecca Nina's bout to blow
Absolute Power, Absolute Power

[Tech N9ne]
I do HIP.. HOP.. and I mix it wit the HARD.. ROCK..
Cause I'm in this rhyming for climbing
Tech N9ne he's unwinding the shining is blinding
Greedy so we constantly grinding
I been in the game 16 years makin rap tunes
Raisin hella havoc up in the classroom
Now in '02 you can watch me clownin and diamonds shining
Watchin DVD's on the Hoshitoshi (It's all Jesus)
Now I keep the crowds pumpin they jumpin
Get back to the telly we rollin and stickin somethin
Racin to the main line 
Absolute Power is havin Halle Berry &amp; Juliette Lewis at the same time
OOO!, thats how Strange niggas run
Listen to the villian wit a kinda sociated tongue
(We're close to the end) but not done
The Tech's just begin begun begining to begin to have FUN
The curse is tryin to put me in the hearse
But I will not tumble first things first 
Talk a lot of shit and I cant take more
Fuck Jay Ferus and everybody down wit him and fuck JCOR

Thanks to Strange Muzik I'm comin
And all my enemies they runnin
Now all my hatas bummin cuzz I was summoned
We Kansas City playas and we bout sold game
We make it so Tecca Nina is a household name
How many point you got, I got 50
Heres a question to the Cencorship Committee
Whos the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
My villians are gritty 
Big Scoob, Texas, Will, Bakari, rest in piece Short Nitty
Growl wit the evil ways, power what the people say 
Rebel yellin we're felons and my pockets are swellin
This beats from Berlin Germany
Throwin up MizzIzzy so aint no other city concernin me
I teach it and I speak very loosly 
Stamina gunnin got playa hatas runnin profusely 
Now I got the parents pissed and ready to noose me
Cause they know that Absolute Power corrupts, ABSOLUTELY!!
