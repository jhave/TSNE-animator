[Intro]
I'll be damned
Ay this my favorite motherfuckin song on the album mayne
Y'knahmsayin it's a weed song, a pill song
All wrapped into one man, weed blow and pills
Man let's go

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Weed, blow, and pills (what we slangin)
Weed, blow, and pills (what we fightin fo')
Weed, blow, and pills (what we live fo')
Weed, blow, and pills (what we get high all day on)

[Verse One]
Rappers get so high like they Tony Montana
Voice be so damn slurred talkin ghetto hood grammar
Need to take a seat when you takin all them pills
Passed out on the street your body rollin downhill
This dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed up
Dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed...
This dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed up
Dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed...
This dope got my voice soundin like I'm chopped and screwed up
I passed out on my feet, so I'm crawlin to this cooler
So just to get a girl I gotta keep my buzz flowin
You wanna get high with me man, keep this shit potent

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Yessir I grab me a gram up out the drawer, I break it break it down
Keep it in plastic I hit it hard, shake it shake it down
Grind it down fine, chop it up, make it powdery
Cut it into lines on the plate, with the razor-y
Razor-y, listen closely, must be done on smooth surfaces
No wood, you get the splinters in your noses
Get the straw, cut it short, slant it at the end
Two inches long, now you're good, go on dig in
If it's your first time you probably won't feel it
Don't worry about it cause it might take a minute
Before I leave I got some more advice to tell
Rub it on a hoe clit, make her cum like hell YEAH~!

[Chorus]
