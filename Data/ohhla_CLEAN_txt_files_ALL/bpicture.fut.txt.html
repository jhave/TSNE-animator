It ain't all about da ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed (yeah)
It ain't all about dese hoes, I know how it feel to go broke (yeah)
It ain't all about da cars, I grind and I grind hard (yeah)
It ain't all about dese clothes, my nigga dead God bless his soul (yeah)

[Verse 1 - Future]
Er since my grand daddy died (what), I ain't been da same nigga (nope)
And sickle cell (where) all inside my lil sister
I'm fucked up inside, put mo lean inside my system
Every day I tell God I wish Snoop was still living
I ain't forgot about ya nigga, Free band gang winning
I do shit fo Lonzo, a junkee stabbed my nigga
Dat could of been me serving, you don't know da half my nigga
Da weight I'm dealing with, I just might start killing shit
I hit da studio vibing, spitting da realest shit
I shoulda seen a psychiatrist, I was built fo dis
On da road of riches ain't about a bitch
No DVSs, no wink &amp; kiss, paid dues are overdue
Dis shit ain't bout my neck or wrist, real shit (true story)

[Hook]
It ain't all about da ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed (yeah)

[Verse 2 - Shawty Lo]
It ain't all about da glitter
And da gleam it ain't what it seem (yeah)
But I'm grinding like a blender
I'm a whip into I get dat cream (yeah)
I keep it G who keep it G with me,
I fuck with who gon fuck with me (yeah)
It ain't all about dese bitches, death to you snitches,
I'll die by dese riches (yeah)
I'm on ah countership with Ceelo, Rest in peace to Prime,
And free my nigga Auto (yeah)
You niggaz wanna be LO but you can never be LO 
Cause you can never see LO  (yeah)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Future]
Thousand dolla shots on my face, I'm coolin it
I rock da gold, keepin it basic it ain't bout da gliss
I want da type of check I can make my niggaz rich
Alot of people talk dat loyalty don't know what it is
Have you ever been so broke you don't even wanna live?
So fucked up to da point dat funerals can share da tears
Gotta grind so fucking hard da shit bring ya to tears
Forgot to call my momma on her birthday God bless da kid
Phone barely ringing now it's ringing till it's dead
I'm bout ta run dem m's up mutha fuck da feds
Got my money in a wall, ain't fucking up my bread
I had a talk with da Most High and this is what He said

[Hook]
It ain't all about da ice, all the nights a nigga sacrificed (yeah)
It ain't all about dese hoes, I know how it feel to go broke (yeah)
It ain't all about da cars, I grind and I grind hard (yeah)
It ain't all about dese clothes, my nigga dead God bless his soul (yeah)</pre>
