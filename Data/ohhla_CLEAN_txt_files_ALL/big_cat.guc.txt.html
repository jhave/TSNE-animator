[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gucci Mane in the building
Big Cat Records, Laflare Entertainment
(Big Cat, whassup?)
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em with this one
Ahhh~! {*echoes*}
East Atlanta stand up (East Atlanta stand UP!)

[Gucci Mane]
Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bentleys, big boats and jetskis
Cristal and Dom P', the kush, the PT
Two facts about me, bitch ask about me
Big Cat's around me, keep stacks around
Baguettes around me, the thrax around me
Purple packs around me, no sacks around me
I smoke like Marley, my niggaz ride Harleys
I hurt ya daughter feelings Miss Jackson I'm sorry
I'm pimpin like Goldie, and ballin like Kobe
These haters get found floatin in the ocean for no fee
Your bitch she choose me, you mad she choose me
I'm glad she chose me, she gave me her do' key
Did time on White Street, did time in D.C.
Gucci the O.G., they put me on TV
I'm gutter like B.G., I'm reppin the B.C.
The jealous ones envy, got somethin against me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You fuck with him, you fuck with me
You fuck with them, you stuck with me
Big Cat, Laflare, we don't fight fair
Big Cat, Laflare nah we don't fight fair

[Gucci Mane]
Got major flavor, no major label
We major niggaz cause we got major paper
Ball hard like we Major League Baseball players
Who is Shirley Franklin cause Gucci Mane's the mayor
I run the city uhh, I am the city
Bad Boy but I never did sign with Diddy
I bake the cake, I make the cake
Thirty-six what I cop like Jacob plate
My team the champs, yo' team the chumps
My squads the Spurs hell your squad the punks
I load the pump, unload the pump
Explode the pump then reload the pump
Big wheel in the trunk, you fit in the trunk
You sit in the trunk 'til you stank like a skunk
The city of thieves, drug dealers and G's
My niggaz they gamble, all my niggaz smoke weed

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
My money got a mouth so I let it talk for me
Half a mill' worth of ice what it bought for me
I'm on that bubble kush man that's a rich high
I order Crist' by the case, I'm a rich guy
I'm 25 but I ride like I'm 67
Plus when I ride man I ride with a Mac-11
A quarter pound worth of purple thrax to smoke on
So iced out man I think I need my coat on
The young nigga with the shades and the gold fronts
Why you stunt so hard? You only live once
I'm in the club real high and I'm real drunk
I'm on my third bar tonight and I'm on my eighth blunt
I'm leavin with your girl plus I'm parked right in the front
Ride on them 28's but we call 'em Warrick Dunns
I'm from East Atlanta man this is how it's done
We rock them old school verse under the Georgia sun

[Chorus]</pre>
