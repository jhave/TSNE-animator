Yo, yo
Uh huh, uh huh
Make em feel this beat
We ain't seeing nothin but some ass wobblin'
Goddamn
Goddamn

I like to watch them hoes twurk shake and shake that ass
See this girl know how to work catch my flow when I splash
Nigga out on the floor bout to get on her head
Bootie bop then pussy bop and you know how they playin
I don't wanna lose control (Why?)
But I been drinkin' alot and I still wanna go and see these hoes
It's goin down in the Dirty make your way
Bend ya knees baby work it like you gonna give it
Look at her legs partly bowed so you know she's a fool
That ol' bobble like she straight went to bobblin' school
Arms up, ass out, g-string in her butt
I tell ya I'mma bout to pass out from on all that needin' of her
Hold up wait a minute
Let a nigga get up in it
I can't wait 'till ya finished
Mammi got my head spinnin'
That bootie be lookin tight
I'm ready to hit it right
No need for you to fight
Cause I'm gonna hit it all night

[Hook x4]
Goddamn
Goddamn ya makin' me hot
So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop
Bootie bop

Now hit it the wall, show the world, girl I like how ya move
Take of your dress, I wanna fuck ya, and toss you up wit' my crew
Likin' you, likin' you with a hell of a curve
This woman's gettin' fifty, mammi need to be served
Block party gettin' naughty and we off the chain
A full bang and shake, pull it sideways
Your body be lookin' good when it get all sweaty
Like that nigga Jubilee I got you hoes "gettin' ready"
Let a nigga put that wood in ya life, alright
And baby if that pussy good you can ride it all night
Bootie bop, bootie bop, shorty turnin' me on
Who's hot, drop me hot, now I'mma give her the bone
I like em 36-24-36
But most of all I like 'em with they take that dick
I got that Hennessey and that fire off top
Now you can drink to ya bop-bop-bop-bootie bop

[Hook x4]
Goddamn
Goddamn ya makin' me hot
So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop
Bootie bop

[x4]

So won't you bop-shi-bop-shi-bop-bop
Bootie bop

[x4]
Goddamn
You makin' me hot
So won't ya, so won't ya, so won't ya
Bootie bop
