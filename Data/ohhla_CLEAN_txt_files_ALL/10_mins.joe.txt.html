See what I'ma do is, like...
I just kinda wanna be able to, you know...
Smoke by myself,
Without kinda being bothered by what a motherfucker had to ?
Without really havin' to do nothin'
So I'ma go buy this pack, of 100's,
Take me about 10 minutes to smoke a whole 100
Yeah, I'ma snip one upside down
And I'ma take one out and I'ma light it...

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Look, now 'is a couple dudes that don't wanna see me poppin'
They sarcastically ask me 'when your CD's droppin'
Gotta keep my game face
They don't leave me no options
Can't lose my cool I know the streets keep watchin'
Dudes wanna see me lose it all
But I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
And I ain't gotta walk around with my clip and nine
A real nigga just open his coat to me and said his is mine
He said call him with his problems
But he don't know that there's always problems, it only gets worse
Like, some dudes get threatened they can't stop me
So all they do is threaten to pop me
But go and get your weapon and cock, G
See it's real here, I dun been up and down the block all week and I'm still here
Look, you wanna know where the booze and coke at
Gangsta's, gorillas, damoo's and locs at,
Where the bricks, where the dick, where the X, where the morphene be,
Take the turnpike to 14B
But now it's back to this pussy dude threatenin' to hurt me
I didn't know all of this came with reppin' Jersey
But now it's no secret
If the thought of jump off doin it makes you so heated nigga so be it
But certain beef will be handeled if you're special
Only marble in the crib, is the handle on his special
My guns in the hood
I can't run from the hood
Nigga my sons in the hood
That should tell you what's what
Soon as I feel good you retards remind me
But son, it ain't hard to find me
I'm at ringside any time the fights on
And I'm in the big black truck with the carolina lights on
Or you can hop on the Pulaski Skyway
I'm in the strip club almost every Friday
Kats is cornballs
Y'all dudes is bitches
Like I ain't got enough problems with this music business

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)
Some days I just miss my father
Some days I wanna relapse on redline
Cuz he'll be gone for 26 months fed time
I try to maintain through all this
And pray to god pop keep the same clean date and 4 dicks
My pockets flat kid
You do the math on $5.15 an hour full time after taxes
That wasn't good enough to keep my MO
Shit that wasn't good enough to complete my demo, for real
Some days I don't wanna be seen
And some days I don't shower, I don't wanna be clean
Look, sometimes the truth could hurt you
So I blow my cig smoke right at the Truth commercial
Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
And even if by a miracle he makes it half way out
It won't be parole y'all, it be the half way house but NAH
That's not the right path for a Budden
Cuz we're addicts, addicts can't do half of nothin'
Some days I'm reachin for the thing in the dresser
Some days I'm not invincible and I feel the pressure
Like if everyone's dependin on me, and I just stop
...
Then what the fuck happens?
I can't take that route and girl out
And sometimes I don't wanna hear my girls mouth 'cause
My hectic schedule, she ain't considerate
So all I hear is the complaints and bickerin
Radio's, studio's, photo shoot's
She think I'm fuckin every girl that say I'm oh so cute, cute
Don't appreciate a man and you lose him
Worst thing to do to an innocent man is accuse him
And I ain't with beefin' with home's
Bran Nubian style, I had to love ma' but leave her alone
It ain't workin out, I'll see you aight
Just let go and let God see if we reunite
Cuz with yo shit added to the dudes that wanna see me fall
Nah, fuck it I won't fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes prayin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall, fall
But listen, I'm fucked up now
Don't ask why y'all
Sometimes the best medicine is just to cry y'all
Know what I'm sayin?
Excuse my voice fans, that should be a sign that I identify with what I'm sayin
Cuz it's these type of thoughts that'll kill ya
If you smokin' with me right now, then you a good way from the filter
And I won't front like I ain't stressin'
Sometimes I need a hug, real shit, pain shit is pain lesson (nigga)

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace

Give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace

Give me 10 minutes
By myself, you the boys at home
That's all the time I really need to enjoy my bone
If you sparked when the song was beginnin at that time
Then your stoge should be endin with mine
And to you know who...
Ma, I never saw me being with you
But sometimes y'all dreams come true
I'm like your number one fan
Damn, I ain't think Joe would see you
You's a fantasy
I wasn't supposed to meet you, NAH
Chances of that were so unlikely
And if we did meet, you wasn't supposed to like me
But look, I rap now and it just so happens
God put me in a spot where that was just so happenin, see
She had a man, I had a girl
I broke up with mine and around that same time
We was hangin out she never laid a hand on me
But I could tell from the way she glanced at me
Her looks said baby boy somethin hampers me
And it would go down but I got my man with me
Lord how can it be?
You know I never been the dude to come and break up a happy family
And these 2 looked so happy on the outside
They could've only been happy on the outside
We eventually started creepin'
But for me it's just sex
For her it's cheatin'
It went down, one time, two times, once more
Talkin real passionate, every time it jumped off
I'm in deep y'all she's more than a jump off
We both catchin' feelins, both startin to want more
But guess what, she can't leave him
Maybe it's somethin' I don't know about, maybe she needs him
Means I still gotta front like we ain't sleepin'
Still gotta shake his hand, I still gotta see him
How's he supposed to look, supposed to feel for me
He gotta know I'm feelin you, and you feelin me
How am I supposed to look at that man with respect
With Bleek singin 'Is That Your Chick In My Head'
Dru Hill - 'Somebody Sleepin In My Bed'
Aaliyah - 'If Your Girl Only Knew' reversed, but look
Here's why I'm down and out
I'm kinda worried y'all
I ain't heard from him much since he found out
??? it wasn't mine y'all, she's still in the brain
And I know wherever she's at, she's feelin' the same
So 'till my fantasy dame pop up
Everytime the cell rings I'm prayin that her name pop up, for real
I know y'all, I ain't supposed to wife her
But it's God's fault, I wasn't supposed to like her
Sometimes I think, why'd I have to meet chick for?
And some times dog, be careful what you wish for
Some times I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father
He's stuck in the system
Treated like a dude that's heartless
And they just transfered him, brought him up on new charges
Yeah folks i'm back to that
So I light another one and smoke back to back for real
I'm chain smokin' if you ain't on my page, listen
I'm stressed out, hopin' this one'll taste different
Dudes hopin' that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Let me talk to all of you dudes wishin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall

Nah, I won't fall
Hopin that I lose it all
I won't fall, nigga (nah)
Hopin that I lose it all
I ain't come this far to fall
Nah
Nah, (aint come this)
Some days I don't wanna be bothered
Some days I just miss my father (damn)

Just give me 10 minutes
I just need 10 minutes alone
To not deal with a thing, to not answer my phone
Just to ig' my 2 way, ig' the shit in the streets
Just let me smoke this one cig in peace
Give me 10 minutes
Without y'all comin at me with that bull
Sometimes that's all it takes to ruin my last pull
And right now, that's what got the kid at peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace (peace, peace)</pre>
