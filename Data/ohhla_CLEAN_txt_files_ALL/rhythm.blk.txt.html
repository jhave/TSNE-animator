[CHORUS]
Rhythm Sticks
Rhythm Sticks
Get 'em
Go
(Repeat 8 times)

[Verse One]
Go from out the gate
The Great
Create the styles that dwell within
The flow no doubt will wake you take you
Acres aways well within
The sacred space
The place
Where we awaken
From this hell within
If you ain't heard about my crew
I guess I have to spell it then
B
B is for the beat you knock
While puffin on you L
L is for the lyrics on the beat that have to get to
A
A is for the absolute that dwells
Everywhere you can't C
C C C C
C is for creating that is if you're in the K
K is for the knownin' which will bring us back to A
A as in another A and then another L
I hope you follow me me me me
I as in myself
Myself and me
C cultivate and capture
Put a cease
To I
Ignorance cause ignorance must die
Die die die
Fly away make us free
Free free free
O
O is for the oneness that is U
U U U U
U is universal like the sound your listenin' to
S
Essence of the spirit in the music that opens up
The Chi Chi Chi

[CHORUS]

[Verse Two]
Up and
Down the trails
Of many styles we can go
What's in
Store for the future
Doubt that we can know
But in
Ourself we can create
And we can grow
To be a vessel
For these days days days days
Touchin'the moon and stars
With such a cosmic glow
Rushin'
MCs that end up in the hospital
It's nothin'
Sometimes it's simply how it's got to go
That's if you suckas want to play play play play
It's such an
Inebriating feeling
To be creatin' really
It really makes me feel free
You think this ain't the real thing
Then you just can't be listenin'
To what my ears are hearin'
There ain't no way way way
Pitchin'
So twisted if you're hittin'
Nigga it isn't pretty
Wittier inner dealings
Committed venom deadly
All in your inner city
I'll spit it when I'm ready
Don't make me spray spray spray

[CHORUS]

[Verse Three]
Now this is not
Your average
Everyday tune
It is in tune
With frequencies
Speakin' through me
And keep reachin'
Way out to you
Seekin' to find
The triple I
Mastery through
The rhythm sticks
Given to listeners
Rendered prisoners
To the mu-mu-mu-mu-music
Inner centered
Vessel astral planning travelers
Sent to this dimension here
To inform the whole planet earth
Time is runnin' out
At any moment death it can occur
Celebrate the moment fully
This is what you have it for
Avid rap fanatic
Magic
Add it and subtract it
Rabid
Mathematic patterns
The sporadic
Manic anthem
Static
Cannot have a chance
Enchanted random
Valiant chantin'
And some
Gallant cabbage grabbin'
Stackin'
Hammer slammin'
Captain
Stabbin talent lackin;
Yappin'
Slackin'
Rappers
Smack 'em
Backwards
Ballads
Tackles
Actors
Savage
At this
Bammer crap is damned and banished
Lavish
Fans will go bananas
And command
Some Gab
A master at this
Transcendental gathering
Of rhythm sticks</pre>
