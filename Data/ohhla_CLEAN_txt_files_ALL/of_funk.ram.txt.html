[Note: a cover of Afrika Bambaataa's "Renegades of Funk" with lyric changes]

No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now..
No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now..

We're the Renegades of this atomic AGE..
This atomic age of Renegades!
Renegades of this atomic AGE..
This atomic age of Renegades!

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
Right down through the Middle Ages, planet Earth kept going through changes
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always Renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X
They were Renegades of their time and age
So many Renegades!

Hook:
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

From a different solar system
Many, many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation, a new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land, singin' electronic chants like
Zulu Nation...Revelations..
Destroy our nations..
Destroy our nations..
Destroy our nations..
Destroy our nations..
Destroy our nations..
Destroy our nations..

Now Renegades are the people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the Renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
C'MON!

Hook:
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

With Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin' and sockin' and rockin' and puttin' a side of hip-hop
'Cause we're poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' puttin' a side of HIP-HOP!!


Hook:
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!


We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

We're teachers of the funk and not of empty popping
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble, the horns, and our vocals
'Cause everytime I pop into the beat, we get FRESH!!

[*drum break*]

C'MON!!
[guitar riff]

C'MON! There was a time when our music
Was something called "The Bay Street" beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a Renegade in those days..
To take a man to the dance floor..

[Zack with a sample of the Soulsonic Force]
Say jam sucka! ("Jam sucka!")
Say jam sucka! ("Jam sucka!")
Say groove sucka ("Groove sucka!")
Say groove sucka ("Groove sucka!")
Say dance sucka! ("Dance sucka!")
Say dance sucka! ("Dance sucka!")
Now move sucka! ("Move sucka!")
Now move sucka! ("Move sucka!")
Say jam sucka!  ("Jam sucka!")
Say jam sucka!  ("Jam sucka!")
Say groove sucka ("Groove sucka!")
Say groove sucka ("Groove sucka!")
Say dance sucka! ("Dance sucka!")
Say dance sucka! ("Dance sucka!")
Now move sucka! ("Move sucka!")
Now move sucka! ("Move sucka!")

Hook [with some weird humming]:
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!

We're the Renegades of FUNK!!
We're the Renegades of FUNK!!</mailto:kirenamloh></pre>
