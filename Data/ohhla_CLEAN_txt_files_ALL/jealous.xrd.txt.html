(X-Raided)
Nigga
While you do this shit for fun
I do this shit on wax
Getting paid for my raps on my income tax
Stack G'z, shippin CD's nationwide
California to Alaska
New York to Nebraska 
Ride, when it's necessary
Otherwise I'm at the record company flirtin with the secretary
That shit you speakin on is obsolete
Irrelevant issues
You a wannabe 
And your crew is softer than some Kleenex tissues
Me next to you is like Mike Jordan next to Mugsy Bogues
You mug me rollin in Buggy cuz we rollin Vogues 
Jealous fellas must be hatin it cuz I'm havin mine
Yo animosity got me knowin I have to have a nine
And half the time I paccs mac with two Gloccs
I sport a vest, fucc that shit they did to 2pac
Don't take it off for shit when I'm in a foreign land
And can't no white Lac creep up on my Caravan
When you the man you gotta roll with major ussalama
You never know who's plottin
Be ready for the drama
And recognize when you slip you slide till you die
By homicide, when they got the element of surprise
Open your eyes and it'll infect you like so poison ivy
Have you in an ICU connected to an IV
Lungs collapse perhaps it was premeditated
Then niggas hated cuz I'm Raided nigga
  
X-Raided: They say fellas is hella jealous
                 In Sac-Town
                 So I don't fucc with 'em
                 They Say
Dott Dog:  Fellas is hella jealous
                 In Sac-Town
                 I know what's up with 'em
X-Raided: Yeah, they say
                 Fellas is hella jealous
                 In Sac-Town
                 I know what's up with 'em
                 Fellas is hella jealous
Dott Dog:  In Sac-Town
                 So I don't fucc with 'em

Now you gots to be cautious
One-times' in the hood tryin to hawk us
You can't slip cuz if you slip they aim for the heart
So after dark I'm on the under in a Skylark
Them dogs bark
And sellin wolf ticcets but I ain't buyin
Tryin to have me in a casket
My nigga I ain't lyin
Get that ass kicced if you come to close to the head colas
Tryin to have you gone takin your head smooth off yo shoulders
Somebody shoulda told ya
Soldiers march till the bass kicc
It's like NASA, you gotta give me space bitch
Enemy cliccs, orbit the hood like satellites
Knights stay cuz they on the saddle through wars, battles, and fights
They try to get you
Especially if you havin cash
Hatin to see you with hoes and shit they never had
You mad cuz you broke but whose fault is that
Them jealous fellas is the reason that I brought a strap

(X-Raided)
Ths ain't no game
Studio gangsterism promoted sayin they ridin
But residin to Southern Dakota
You get checced
Cuz you neglectin yo duties as a warrior
You get no respect
I only got love for the neighborhood destroyers
That put it down with a passion
If you got funk, you got action
No hesitation when we smashin
And the destination's your barrio
You better be ready
Make your brain look like spaghetti
Then we run faster than Mario Andretti
It's on...in a major way
Playa hatas watch yo bacc, it's yo day to pay
We ain't gon play nigga
We serious as a heart attacc
Bustin through offensive line bringin the Quarter bacc
Concusion sustained
Bringin the pain like Reggie White
And every night we strapped ready for a deadly fight
Like Daniel Boone, paccin the big gun that goes boom
Premeditated niggas hated  cuz I'm Raided
It's yo day of doom
