[Intro]
Yo this is Mr. Wyclef Jean (Yeah uh huh)
This is your 911 man (Uh huh) your Gone Till November man (Uh huh)
Your Two Wrongs don't make it right man, let's go, let's go (Uh huh)
Let's go (Uh huh) Let's go(Uh huh) Let's go, let's go (Come on)

[Chorus]
Senorita, when you wine don't break the speaker (Hey)
Let me see you go down a little further
Wine your body show style they never heard of (Bounce sexy girl)
Senorita, you make a shotta wanna bawl for murder (Yeah)
The way you throw that curve up, senorita push a little further

[Verse 1]
To the fat to the slim such a nice little thing could a
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Every man in the dance wanna dance with the queen could I
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Walk in the party everybody irie, no spanish yo but te quero
The way that mami shakin, she got me hallucenatin
Got, ground breakin the whole California earthquakin
The way she move it groove it lose it to the sound of music

[Chorus]
Senorita, when you wine don't break the speaker (Hey)
Let me see you go down a little further
Wine your body show style they never heard of (Bounce sexy girl)
Senorita, you make a shotta wanna bawl for murder (Yeah)
The way you throw that curve up, senorita push a little further

[Verse 2]
To the fat to the slim such a nice little thing could a
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Every man in the dance wanna dance with the queen could I
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
Yo, hot, girl, doin your dance
I don't know what to call it but I feel a romance
By the way you glance I think I stand a chance
Thug Passion 'gon leave you in a ambulance
It's all love you the number one dub
I ain't even play you yet I'm waitin for the clash love
Come on get it get it get it get it non stop
After the club we 'gon take it to the roof top

[Chorus]

Senorita, you make a shotta wanna bawl for murder (Yeah)
The way you throw that curve up, senorita push a little further

[Verse 3]
This one goes out to the fine senorita
Bubble to the bassline and wine to the tweeter
Bonita Chiquita drinkin champagne by the liter
And I won't stop singin, until she surrenders

[Chorus]
Senorita, when you wine don't break the speaker (Hey)
Let me see you go down a little further
Wine your body show style they never heard of (Bounce sexy girl)
Senorita, you make a shotta wanna bawl for murder (Yeah)
The way you throw that curve up, senorita push a little further

[Repeat Verse 1]
