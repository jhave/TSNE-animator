[Pharoahe Monch]
Aiyyo Uptown (WHAT?) the Bridonx (WHAT?)
Long Isle (WHAT?) Stridong (WHAT?)
Yo Brooklyyyyyyyyyyyyyn (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)
Yo (WHAT?!)

Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Yo where the fuck is Queens? (WE RIGHT HERE!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Yo where the.. yo yo
Yo where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Yo (WE RIGHT HERE!)

We can face the fuck off like hockey or Face Off like Travolta
Face off like car radios with the mind of Minolta
Face off like Treach if you're fuckin with Vin Rock
You still pop shit?  I face off like fembots
And I'm the six million motherfuckin dollar man
with a six million muh'fuckin dollar plan
For thug niggaz and pimp players and drug niggaz
Your technique, I sweep under the rug niggaz
Out of Queens, shit I serve with the fiends and bug niggaz
I'm above niggaz, but all in all, I love niggaz
like my man Benny Rat (uh) showed me the rap game
Told me never to act sane on a record or rap plain
Now the name reign supreme, seen major creme
Rhymes, sicker than lyme disease and gangrene
I'm the most obligated, nigga creatin havoc
Check the meaning for Monch, the meaning becomes tragic
RAW - if you want it
RAW - yea we got it indeed
Yo actually I'm just tryin to eat
FOR SURE - if you need it on tour
Yea we ready to bleed
I'm sayin God I'm just tryin to eat

Aiyyo Compton (WHAT?) ??CRson?? (WHAT?)
Whattup bwoy? (WHAT?) It's keep bouncin (WHAT?)
I say Long Beeeeeeeeeeeeeach (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)
(WHAT?!)

Where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
Now where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
Now where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
Where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
Now where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
Yo, yo, now where L.A. at? (RIGHT HERE!)
C'mon! (c'mon) (RIGHT HERE!)

I am the master of the ceremony
So my territory be off limits to gimmicks and niggas with trash lyrics
And tracks that lack spirit so pop ya collar
Fuck ya dollar I'm extra tough and hard to swallow
Hard act to follow, never a role model or what-not
Set-up shots, slipknot my way to the top of the pile
Then changin the direction of it
From the niggas that hate it to niggas that love it, what'chu want from it?
A [?reputation?] of the luxurious life
Baby find you a hooker you can transform into a houswife?
You loose stripes and you a sight through your windpipe
With action, cameras and lights and your shit ain't tight
You're short on sight, thug rugged, the love of it
Push it or slam it or shove it in a vein with dope
Remain with smoke, remote with Tash and Rass Kass
Don't prevoke me to revoke your visitor's pass

Basically y'all could get eight twice like Lynn Swann plus get ate like 
pussy
Get ate like Mickey D's after the hydro when you push me
Get ate like cannibalism and sliced surgical
In any extremity y'all get infinity vertical
Every line to word of mine will be verbally placed to murder you
The master, flippin convertible flows irreversible
Unobtainable to the brain it's unexplainable what the verse'll do
Pharoahe's the sperm your mind's the eggs I'm burstin through
Y'all heard of me, I pack macs and crack vertebraes
Leave niggaz with third degree burns and back surgery
Mics guns knives, pick declare which object, flip
Have niggaz runnin like the Blair Witch Project
RAW - if you want it
RAW - yea we got it indeed
Yo actually I'm just tryin to eat
FOR SURE - if you need it on tour
Yea we ready to bleed
I'm sayin God I'm just tryin to eat

Aiyyo Uptown (WHAT?) the Bridonx (WHAT?)
Long Isle (WHAT?) Stridong (WHAT?)
Brooklyyyyyyyyyyyyyn (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)
Yo (WHAT?!)

Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)

Yo where the fuck is Queens? (WE RIGHT HERE!)
Where the fuck is Queens? (RIGHT HERE!)
