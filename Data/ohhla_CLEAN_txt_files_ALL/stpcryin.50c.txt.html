[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie
Yeah~! I am N.Y., no lie

[50 Cent]
They say they do it like I do it with no mask on
Nigga get the fuck outta line you're gettin blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
But I'll stomp your fuckin head 'til it's under the surface
Now I need you to get it through your bloodclat head
Before I put a bullet through your bloodclat dreads
These niggaz ain't made of the same shit I'm made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favor
I let a nigga slide, he came back and almost shot me
Then he was thinkin I was scared, naw nigga not me
They don't understand I was raised by the vultures
Killed laughin like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Called grandmomma Mommy cause mommy already dead
And daddy been missin since I was a little kid
Now who dare goes there playin games with the orphan
They know my pedigree, test me, I'ma off 'em

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Stop the bloodclat cryin
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lyin
Don't cry, dry, your eye
Don't cry, dry, your eye

[50 Cent]
That first body drop, we just gettin started
Death come in threes; AR-15, M-16
Semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade in your flesh it's an emergency
Your love leak, heart open, call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend, I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the altar
See I have an advantage, I don't care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin when them casings start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
Nine bullet wounds now a nigga half crazy
What is that, a tear I see formin in your eye?
Why are you so frightened? We're all gonna die
You could say a prayer when I'm comin like the Reaper
Starin through that sight on the top of my heater
{*click-clack*} Now

[Chorus]</pre>
