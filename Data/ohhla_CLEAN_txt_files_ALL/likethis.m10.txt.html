[Mack 10]
Am I a hustla?
(Yeah!)
Say what
(Oh yeah!)
Yeah
(Yeah!)
(Yeah!)
Well this must be the hustlas anthem
(Yeah!)
Who bangin'

[Verse 1: Mack 10]
If it start off soft I can cook it to hard
Then hit the boulevard then drop top with a broad
I walk the green impart and push fast cars
With a fetish for bank wads and cuban cigars
Yo! peep the way I do shit I'm young, fly and flashy
I'm so L.A, so hood and so classy
You looking fo that good stuff don't hesitate to ask me
Bet I got what you need, so be sure to run it past me
But just in case its on keep the blue steel in chrome
My niggas hop in and roam with khaki suits on
And be real with it holmes these rap niggas is clones
Fuck around with Mack dime and get one in ya dome
As for my resume respect it or be sure to check it
I got a batch of that aqua that sure to get you naked
So play your cards right and win before you deck it
When I heard this beat knocking fo sho I had to wreck it, come on

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Disrespect, get checked
Snatch you up by yo neck
Young money tryin to be the man to quick
Nigga this ain't checkers this a game of chess
Why do I do it like this? cause you like it like this

Talk a lot of shit cause I do it the best
Some of y'all don't like me but you give me respect
When I'm lyin in a grave I guess I'll give it a rest
Why do I do it like this? cause you like it like this

[Verse 2: Mack 10]
I got a large clientele from the shit I sell
I don't guess the weight, I tell with a digital scale
I got money tucked for bail but before I see a jail
I'm a change clothes and roll like J and Pharrell
I like to switch up my game and rotate my hoes
Park the GT bentley and pull out the Phantom Rolls
And I pack the kind of guns that you can't expose
So my stash box is closed with fo fos and calicos
Your nigga 1 - 0 is ever so gun ho
No scope, I get up close, my vision tunnel
Got that white by the bricks and brown by the bun door
Wit a crew of broads working its never just one hoe, (Oh no)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mack 10]
(Repeat 2x)
I know you like it like this
Like I said, if it ain't ready I could rock it like this
Fo sho, I'm a have the hood poppin like this
Mack 10 got that bomb shit droppin like this

[Chorus]

(Yeah!)
Am I a hustla?
(Yeah!)
Am I a hustla?
(Yeah!)
Ha, ha, ha
(Oh yeah!)
Nate Dogg
(Yeah!)
Rook, you still there homie?
(Yeah!)
Mack 1 - 0
(Yeah!)</pre>
