[Quiet voice in the background]
What the fuck is this?? Bullet holes Tupac.
{*gun shots*}

[Chorus]
Unload the barrel and blast
I'm puttin lead in yo' motherfuckin ass

[repeat Chorus 3X]

[Knumskull]
I'm broke as fuck in this life that Im livin in
I'm watchin niggaz bubble an the jealousy is kickin in
I wanna pull licks but that jelousy don't fit me
let's bet on the set, I'm a vet runnin from Fifty
It spell out, so I'm a post to the fullest
Only servin then, the Ice Cream Man is out again,
It's jealous niggaz on the lurk still
We had a treaty, so now they goin back on they first deal
(Awww now they ready to put the lead on ya
how would you like it if a nigga was broke an came fed on ya??!!)
That's why I'm still on my P's an Q's, readin fools
I'm known as a shista deceivin fools, (see quit pagin me!!)
snoopin around found trouble, fo tryin to fuck up a niggaz bubble
don't bubble mo than he got
cuz now he know that if he get rid of you
then that's more cash in the pot
I got a rival now,
tha turf is showin what it's worth
I gotta pack a gat fo survival now
they juss won't let me be, all I can be, so all I can see
is victory, I'm struggle master, so
the doo-doo that you do will only make me wanna bubble faster
no party-poop cuz this troop came fed-eral
slappin hoes in they neck juss to let em know
it's all clear now why
it's so hard to say goodbye
you broke, I'm gettin high
don't make me put the lead on ya

[Chorus] - 2X

[Dru Down]
Here I come, I'm outta jail, fresh in the air
nigga need a come up, so nigga didn't care
so let me think, nigga, I need to pick up pace
nigga need a lick, nigga need no safes, so ah
let me get straight down to business
I need me some distance to run when I carry gun
an I'm a be like quick on my feet
you try an be a hero
my nine milli, you an me
an even if you're the chief of police
nigga you will still catch some heat
cuz I'm juss.... one of the killaz in the town
a niggaz know they call me Dru mutha fuckin Down
so homie step back, this is a jack
nigga make a move an that ass will get jacked
because I'm loaded, I'm loaded off the dank-quid
an Jackie you will get me high juss fo free see
juss call me.... S-I-C-K
I love to kill fo play
cuz like Cube it was a good day
an I'm a be like strictly on my Q's, P's an Q's
I'm puttin quarter holes in fools
so don't you even fuck wit my rep
my rep's too big
an leavin you diggin fo days
an I'm a get ya
nigga if I want ya
I got a gun you run nigga
I'm a pop ya
because I'm broke I need to fill me some ends
give me yo pocket book so I can break it in
I goes to Wells Fargo, Bank of America
an if your a woman, don't think I still won't put the lead on ya
BEEITCH!

[Chorus] - 4X

[Yukmouth]
Hell yeah I'm on welfare, G-A checks
keeps me paid like a mutha fuckin vet on the set
let, my mail stretch an gets up
to even the point where my bitch be choppin zips up
I whips up the cream
twenty-eight grams on the triple beam
chefs hittin clean, how much clean??
four-fifteens, an the zap-co
the rap-go slip an made a weak move
don't sleep dude, I pull licks every week fool
but ain't no Bonnie an Clyde nigga
cuz if a bitch set up a lick, I get the money an slide nigga
I hit the crap game first thang, leave if you shot yo
cuz bein broke is the worst thang
check this out man, cuz you know I ain't that type niggie
I scoop the dice, once or twice then the riggie, riggie
dangle roll shot, is a fa sho shot
no shot, I mean it's so hot, I'm snatchin hella face from the block
I got the glock
sixteen on my waist juss incase
never hit 6-8's, know the haters at the gate
when I shake the dice-a, nother one bites the dust
they mad as fuck gettin struck by the shista
I shoulda known, cuz rule number one
never roll craps wit some niggaz from a track you ain't from
they young an claimin they broke, but they forgotten
that I got they mail, an I can tell they plottin
but shhhhitt, they'll get licked like a popsicle
don't fuck around an get sent to the hospital
lil niggaz think they slick, but they already sawin
popin at y'all takin raw shit
let me raise up from these cowards turf
yeah, cuz lil do they know what's below the Eddie Bauer shirt
niggaz mean muggin me but what that do
I'm a soldier til it's over
6-5 on my tattoo punk
so if you want funk you be a dead homie
cuz I be down if you pull a 2-elev homie
now all the niggaz gettin lit up
I told ya live in yo house wit out yo strap is a rigg up
cuz I'm a put the lead on ya
punk ass nigga
