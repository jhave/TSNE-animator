Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Well, I'm gonna make a lot of money, make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this, quit this crazy scene!

Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave
Cause I'm a

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene

Oh, well I guess got problems
I dropped out of school
Ain't think about college
So my apologies to my mother and father
To be a stubborn ever since I was a toddler

Well I'm a quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired, y'all pray for me

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene

Oh yeah, you said it could be worst?
Oh here, step into my shoes,
Put yourself in my shirt!
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this Earth
I'm a:

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene

Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus
So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
Cause my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I'm a

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Make a lot of money)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
(Quit this)
Crazy scene

It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna:

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene.

It ain't a question to me
Look at me
I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all
I'm wrestlin' beasts
But pretty soon
I'll be restin' in peace
I'm a:

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene.

Come y'all, y'all actin' like I can't feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigga issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene

Look
A lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas
So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I'm a:

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene.

Oh, how can I not?
... niggas the game, when game is all I've got
The car of your dreams we're pushing off the...
I'm smoking the most expensive pot
Baby I'm trying to:

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene.

Well, I'm not quitting
I bought my niggas...
Trying to tell them before
For some reason or another
They will not listen,
Tell the driver we smoke and raise the bar...

[Chorus]
Make a lot of money
(Then I'm gonna)
And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this
Crazy scene</pre>
