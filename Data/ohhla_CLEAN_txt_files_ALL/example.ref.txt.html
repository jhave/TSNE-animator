*Yeah*
*Talib Kweli*
*Black Star*
*Reflection Eternal*

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I am what you want to be but you can't though
Prime example
You cats can't flow but you get an "E" for effort
[from mah say till efforts we stay?] together reign forever

[Talib Kweli]
Please
You think I give a fuck about your Clown Posse?  You insane!
You acting like a journalist and racking my brain
since I was tagging my name on the back of the train
like my man in [Lahane?] packing the same
Little Gat that put me back in the frame of mind to say "Fuck the Five-O"
Let me explain the rhyme
Yo, cut the nice flow like Bob Marley
I'm the black star they probably follow my every move
like I'm the son of John Gotti
Escape to Paris like a jazz man round midnight
[Queen?] banging like Josephine Baker raising the kids right
Attack the dreaming
Rap through the demons
See the situation and extract the meaning
Internationally known trees actually grown
through the cracks in the sidewalk
See it in my walk
Hear it in my talk
Bet you cats feel it in my rap flow
You can throw me a spliff but you can keep your tobacco

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli]
Are y'all with me tonight?
Et vou avec moi?
Y'all love the children and dance like a [labor?]
Say Ma where you goin with that flavor
These cats ain't in my league, this here is major
Mind state of the art
Yeah I play my part with razor-sharp words
shot straight for the heart
Beautiful like chords played on a harp with trumpets blaring
Angels preparing for the fate we all sharing at
one time or another through sunshine or thunder
Ain't got no time for the blunders
Then bond with one another to make the classical track
*What?* The battery in my back
I'm Eveready already plus magical [adapt?]
like mushrooms from the plush womb of the sweet
The city workers pushing dust brooms in the street
We complete the cipher
Push up your lighter
Throw your vanity in the bonfire
*word*

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
