Straight off the block with it
Eagle street to be specific
I'm peepin at your people different
I'm pay my dues you keep the difference
I can see the end and the beginning
So I'm not racing I'm just sprintin
Cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish I replenish
Scientific
I'm out this world hoe
I wear bright red like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since 12:30 A-M
Weigh them if they short take them right back and spray him amen, yea
I just do my Wayne and every time I do it I do my thing, yea
Believe that like a true story
Rims big make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out - that be suicide
No back seats call that paralyze
I don't have a spine I don't fantasize
I mastermind then go after mine
You see I handle mine I dismantle mine
I told her tool box bitch it's hammertime
So excuse me as I nail em to something
Just repeal em I'm kill em
Someone tell em that I'm a kill em
I'm a feel his mother's mama can't tell em when doctors can't heal em, I'm a kill em
And we sell em I know you smell him
So if you want it you could just yell it
Be in the morning at your tele
Hole keys go for twenty, half a key go for eleven, after me there will be nothing
I am legend and I will smith
Now that's how ya let the beat bitch

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
Now that how you let the beat build bitch

Just a snar in the 8 0 8
Weezy baby on the mic hear away
Ok I'd like to thank kanye and my nigga dezzle
for giving me this diesel like a F-350 tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Usta think my shit didn't stink boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'm take it one two way back
Like a silver wife beater and a wave cap all the way through
The blue bayou and I wave fool as I blew by you
Hello hi you I can buy you but I wouldn't try you feed you to piru
I know wat I'm doin I show improvement, show improvement
and I know just to go thru it don't amount to your influent, whatever
How you wanna do it? we can do it like we late ah wait dezzle let me get the 8 o 8
As I hit the kill switch
Now thats how you let the beat build bitch

[Chorus]

Now everybody say...
I am the best rapper alive
I am the best rapper alive
And I will eat you alive; think I'm lyin?
Damn I'ma get in a nigga chest like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fuckin ram on the hunt for lamb
I'm a dump 'em man in a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier ask Uncle Sam, hair nappy like Kam
Nigga fuck your plan, fuck yo' man, you ain't a pimp
unless you get the same bitch to fuck your man
and fuck your plan, and all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh god damn there's my sound, po-play likes it's my band
Gotta get it cleared suck my dick with red lipstick and don't let it smear
And I got a lot of tattoos
I meant every tear and I'm still on that street shit back to the beat bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch

[Chorus]</pre>
