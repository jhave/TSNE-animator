A yes yes y'all
It's too fresh y'all
A little b-boy blue
You know it's too beucou

I've been from New York to Cali
Spent two days in the valley
And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind
And if I think 'bout it one more time
I'm a blow my stack
See ya out the back
Give me some room that I can breathe in
Now I'm a start weavin' spells like a wizard
King of the lizard
My mojo's risin' like my nature should
Not everybody can relate to hood
But I used to roll with high frequency
Had a habit of juvenile delinquency
If y'all could see all the things I did
When I was a kid
Ya might flip ya lid
'Cause...

When I was the age of one
My father gave me my very first gun
When I was the age of two
I was pullin' out records with the SD Crew
And when I was the age of three
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me
And when I was the age of four
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore

See...

CHORUS (X2)
Day to the night
Night to the day
Up around where I stay
We do things this way
You got to watch how you act
And watch what you say
'Cause their ain't no stallin'
When the death come callin'

CHORUS II (X2)
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun (gun)
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come

Yo, all you duns packin' guns
Fightin' for ones
It's time to get these hons
Start raisin' some sons
Plant your seed in some fertile soil
And watch me start bubblin'
Like I'm 'bout to boil
Like Olive Oil love Popeye
Just won't stoppa
I got to keep rockin'
Ticks keep tockin'
Time keeps slippin'
My mind keeps trippin'
I'm in the road less traveled
Sure got lotta stones

CHORUS (X2)
I say day to the night
Night to the day
Up around where I stay
We do things this way
You got to watch how you act
And watch what you say
'Cause their ain't no stallin'
When the death come callin'

When the death come callin' (X2)
Watch me break it down

There's a red house yonder
Just over the hill
With my name carved into the window sill
I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down
That's what me and my old woman used to say
We used to lie in bed and make love all day
Now I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down to the ground

CHORUS II (X2)
The man that lives by the pistol
Dies by the smokin' gun
I think I hear a steam whistle
Lord, when my train gonna come</pre>
