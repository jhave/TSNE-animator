[Hook: Thyra]
No more paaaiiinn, No more pain for my dead homiiieesss
No more teaaarrsss, No more tears for moms to cryyyyy

[Mike Jones]
Mike Jones
I Cry for my ghetto cuz we keepin us down
Instead of helpin each other we behind backs talkin down
People killin, jackin, stealin, for material things
Takin the risk of gettin caught with a hole in they brain
My name is Mike Jones and I'm on the microphone
Let it be know we the reason we get picked on
Now tell me, how am I supposed to be feelin?
When I never seen my dad my whole life of livin
Thats why I'm givin everything that I got to my momma
For raisin me and my brotha through the days of drama
No more ghetto cries here momma wipe away ya tears
Cuz by this time next year it's gon be off this year
No more ghetto cries here momma wipe away ya tears
Cuz by this time next year it's gon be off this year
No more ghetto cries here momma wipe away ya tears
Cuz by this time next year it's gon be off this year

[Chorus: Thyra - repeat 2X]
Ghetto cry, Ghetto cry, Ghetto cryyyyyy
Ghetto Cryyyyyyyyy

[Magnificent]
Check it
It's like the world gettin colder by the minute
It's ashame niggaz in this game gotta flip boulders for some spinach
Just to survive and put clothes on they back
Niggaz in the street will kill for some fo's on they 'llac
Leave holes in ya back
You seen the news dog, po-pos still attack
To despose of us black
So I flow fo my stack
I'm doin it the legal way
But if I have to, I'll do it just an evil way
But I don't want my momma to cry
I rather get life and then book slice till my ??? to fly
All I really want, is drama to die
Fuck beef I'm tryin to make sure the tires on my hummer looks fly
But I really hate death in fact
I hope I never see a Black suit
Unless I'm watchin Men In Black
I'm Magnificent (who?) but the world will never be dat
I prayin for tomorrow just so that I can see dat

[Chorus] - 2X
