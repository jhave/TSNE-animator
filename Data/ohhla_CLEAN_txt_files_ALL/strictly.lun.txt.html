[Lunasicc]
Now who the fuck can hang with this westside crook? 
Put niggas to sleep, swing with a left counter with a hook 
Jook niggas like Barry, bodies bloody like Mary 
Too scary to even look at when that ass gets buried 
Gettin' carried away put to death by the vet 
I'm a rider, Sac-town, Southside og timer 
Gangsta for real, I peel hoes like peelin' oranges 
A warning 
Don't run up on these crazy Californians 
I'm on ya, like leeches out the mud on yo ass 
Pull out the strap, cock it back, unload on yo ass 
Dodgin' the cops tryin' to get my props, pop 'em like a pimple 
Like 3X Krazy, ain't it all so sick, ain't it all so simple 
Pistola packin' 
See some marks then I'm jackin' 
Run up on him then I smack him 
Put one in his New York jacket 
Ridin' away peepin' the rear view 
Lettin' you bleed in the middle of the street 
motherfucker we don't fear you 

[Killa Tay]
Uhh 
Nathan soft 
I breaks 'em off 
Like Bo and Lurch 
If you scared to do some dirt, go to church 
Fuckin' with these cap peelas 
Niggas that stack scrilla 
With the mack in the back of the van 
for the man that run up on the Killa T-A-Y 
Do or die 
Twist Dosia to keep me high 
Sleepy eyes 
Creepin' up with no disguise 
No surprise 
When I draw down, instantly bustin', touchin' brains 
This, ain't no fuckin game 
Kill 'em up ain't nothin' changed 
Murder one is my specialty 
Death to niggas that step to me 
I take it to the next degree 
Take 'em sicker than leprosy 
Inevitably, I'm steadily dodgin' task 
Heavily pervin'', servin' corners when I'm mobbin' on the gas 
Nigga I'm a cap peela 
You fuckin' with a real nigga 
Drug dealer with a nine milla puttin' jacks down for the scrilla 
Fill a, nigga with lead 
Leavin' him dead 
So rest in peace 
Light him up like a torch 
from the South to the North from the West back to the East 
We riders 

Chorus: (all lines simultaneous) X2 

[Mississippi] This is for you haters     
[Luna]	Up jumps the boogie 
We gonna ride tonight
	Straight gone off doobies
Tonight we gonna ride
	This is for the loochie
This is for you bustas
	Hoes give up the pussy
We gonna ride tonight

AWOLin and ballin' with a
	This is for you bustas
Unlimited game and fame
	We gonna ride tonight
So quickly strictly business
	Gonna ride tonight

[Killa Tay]
I stay stuck like Chuck, choppin' it up on the homey's faulty 
flossy with the flava, major haters trying to solve me 
cross me 
In the game you get your life took 
We be hurtin' 
Puttin' in work 
Like a bg can't see me like a right hook 
To the brain too much game for you to match about my scratch bitch 
Nigga don't need no practice 
Show me the loot and I'm at this 
Gat up under the mattress 
One up in the chamber 
Real gang banger 
Ain't no stranger to this danger 
For dangler, fade ya like the major Cali chronic 
Niggas that test the west gonna rest in peace and that's a promise 
Got 'em hooked like phonics 
Shakin' 'em up like I'm Mystic 
Wicked when I'm with this stay in motion like a stick shift 
I rip this 
Burn 'em up like syphillis 
Let 'em know I'm locced, leavin' 'em broke like it was Christmas 
Stompin' in my steel toes, always down to bo-guard 
We hoo-ride on tight tracks got sacks like a nose guard 
That capital I-N-D-O got me faded, affiliated with ballers and thugs 
Movin drugs to make a profit, pockets swollen
rollin' blunts up fatter than your dick 
Sick approach, puttin' in work with my folks Lunasicc 

[Lunasicc]
I got no time for you bustas I'm born and raised to be a hustla 
We creep in the night puttin' it down on you suckas 
Murder motherfuckers 
And when I come I'm a dump 
Jump out the back of the van 
with the mack like man where the funk, punk? 
I keeps it poppin 
Non-stoppin droppin' shit like a seagull 
Blastin', without no mask kill 'em up fast when I mash my Reagle 
Flashin' quicker than faggots at a disco club 
They bow down, when I come around 'cause I'm oh so tough 
Shoelaces tied so ain't no reason for me to trip 
When provoked I choke a bitch until she gimme that grip 
Murder I wrote, like movies make the whole crowd scream 
Runnin' through the back door bustin' like I'm jackin' for cream 
Nigga duck down 
I'm 'bout to pound like some cake 
Psycho, schizo, to the nymphos can my nine get ate? 
Nutty like the professor 
Pullin' out weed like dressers 
Make 'em all fall 
When it call for laws I change like draws 
Into a killa 
Fuck the world I'm out to get my scrilla 
Don't give a fuck about bitches, don't give a fuck about niggas 
My trigga pulls like pimps, with they hoes on the strip 
'Bout this money, ain't nothin' funny when I'm clockin' that grip 
Bag 'em like they some groceries 
You niggas don't know me 
Tight like blue Nikes, I'm kickin' this funky shit like Shinobi 
Might go do life for bustin' I'm bringin' ya death 
Kill at will, bitch, with the steel until there ain't nothin' left 
Psycho 

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
