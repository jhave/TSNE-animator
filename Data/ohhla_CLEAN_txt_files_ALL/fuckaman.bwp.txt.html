Intro:
[L]
Yeah, fuck all you sorry ass punk motherfuckers out there
Last week you slanging and banging and holding your motherfucking dick
And this week you trying to be positive and shit
Fuck you sorry motherfuckers
You suck our motherfucking dick
You soft sissy punk ass pussy motherfucker, you

Verse 1
[L]
Now, my man out fucking another bitch
Gonna come home and serve me his leftover bullshit?
But I'm not the type to get mad, I get even
[L &amp; TM]
Kick him out, bitch!
[L]
Yeah, 'cause I ain't leaving
Rush to the bank, withdrew all his cash
And a bitch like me got a foot on his ass
Now I'm out to get what I can
It's a hard enough world, so Fuck A Man
See, I don't give a damn about another
'Cause another ain't my brother, and my brother's a sucker
[Young Child]
I don't want my daddy to be a sucker
[L &amp; TM]
Yeah!
[L]
He was a sucker
He was a punk ass, lowlife, yellow motherfucker
Then he dissed, I had to get a payback
And bust a cap in his little fucking yellow back
When I snatched him, I was high as shit
And you wore the Prada, bitch
Don't get me wrong, because I love you
And don't ever let a motherfucker tell you
About the day that we got paid
Connected the I.N.S. where he laid
Down in a bed with a stiff dick
And the bitch start plotting shit
Yo, I told him: wear plastic
But he said he couldn't feel it
Great fate, my period already late
[L &amp; TM]
Put him on a hook, bitch, serve him like bait
[L]
A tip from my lip: don't step to me
'Cause I''m a get your money, B
I don't give a fuck if you can't understand
Here's how I'm living
[L &amp; TM]
Fuck A Man

Chorus:
[L &amp; TM]
Fuck A Man
(4X)

Verse 2:
[TM]
Yeah, I was walking like I do I treat my man like a bitch!
I make him cry, and all that shit
I spend his money 'cause I know he's just a sucker
Take a key to his Benz  and go fuck another brother
[L]
Tanisha, word?
He  don't  say nothing?
[TM]
Picture that nigga saying something!
So I step inside when I finish bugging
Out all night,, with another nigga fucking
[L]
Did you even feel guilty?
[TM]
Hell no, bitch!
Cause fucking that nigga, I just ain't with
II let him lick, do I look dumb?
He spent the night sucking that other nigga's cum!
I don't give a fuck who can't understand
Here's how I'm living

[L &amp; TM]
Fuck A Man
(2X)

Verse 3:
[TM]
Yo Lyndah
Niggaz is getting scared 'cause you let them bitches do they shit!
Why don't you drop something for those
"Too black, too strong, too positive" motherfuckers
Who was just last week slanging and banging and holding they dick
And this week they all positive and shit
Fuck them niggaz up, Lyndah!
[L]
A positive man, they ain't no such thing
They only good for one thing: b-b-banging
Always down to drop science, and preach to each
[L &amp; TM]
Ask them if they paid their child support last week!
[L]
Kick it, 90% fact, to answer the truth
I'm gonna school you
Tell you what my daddy do: nothing
For something he could never get
And all I could see was the back of his head when he stepped
After all these years, he got sick and died
Not a fucking tear fell from my eye
So no matter how they drop it, stick it in your pocket
'Cause I got some land, two trinkets and a locket
To sell you
They only out for self, trying to teach
[L &amp; TM]
When they need help?
[L]
Now a positive sister, now I can relate to
Single parent homes is what the world came to
So savor the favor, it's just a sample
But check it, another example
They yell, "black, beautiful, fight, unite"
But you took a black woman in check with a white
You say you're proud to be black, and then stand tall
But in the videos they ain't no sisters at all
You're all a bunch of sell-outs, fakes and frauds
If it ain't for the money, it ain't for nothing at all
Overnight black man, yeah my heart moves
But you're all piss colored, with something to prove
Now Dre said it best, you got acne
Your words mean exactly shit!
[TM]
Exactly
[L&amp; TM]
So Fuck A Man

Verse 4:
[TM]
So Fuck A Man, it never   cease to  amaze me
I think all the motherfuckers are crazy
Last week my man  tried to pay me
When I told him I was having his baby
He got mad, and act like a dick
[L &amp; TM]
What you gonna do?
Keep the shit!
[TM]
And haul his stupid ass down to court
[L &amp; TM]
Make the nigga pay all that child support
[TM]
Don't run and cry to your mother for bail
[L]
Motherfucker, your ass going straight to jail
Eighteen and life, that's your ass
Spend the next 20 years of your life paying cash
Pay to a motherfucker bitch you hate
But a sperm is a terrible thing to waste
I heard you say, "yo, I'll never work"
You''ll be a broke motherfucker, you dumb ass jerk
Amount to nothing, you'll ask why
Why the fuck I stick my dick inside?
Was it worth the pussy, or even a cum?
But yeah, motherfucker, you sure had fun
You're the worst motherfucker nightmare come true
You fucking fool
Now I hope everybody understands
Why B.W.P. say

[L &amp; TM]
Fuck A Man
