[MC Lyte]
Some say I'm SHADY (that's right) That's me
Complicated rap star, meet Lyte the MC
You see I'm on to you baby and your mechanism
How you hit it when you're in it, so hot you keep it sizzlin
No ooh-achie-koo, and all of that too
Keep me wetter than the waters of Kalamazoo
Nigga who you comin wit?  Where your posse at?
I leave the boys alone, tell her you won't be back
I got the cheese baby; my cheddar's better
I got that milk, for that Amarett-ah
Trust-You-Me-I'll-Blow-Up-Shop
Have a little nig' callin the cops, watch!
