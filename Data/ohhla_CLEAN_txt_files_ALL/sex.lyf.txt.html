[Intro]
Ay yo' you
Now see most cats, would take advantage of you right now
But I ain't gone do that yo'
Imma give you the game, right
Imma give it to you because
I would want somebody to give my little girl the game
When she done found her S.E.X

[Lyfe Jennings]
Life's a trip
Heard you just turned 17 and finally got some hips
Hustlers on the block go crazy when you lick yo' lips
But they just want relation
They don't want relationship
(welcome to the real world)
It ain't the same
Fellas old enough to be yo' daddy know ya' name
Everybody's talkin' bout how much that girl done changed
Can't quite put ya' finger on it
But you feelin' strange
Like it's fire in your veins

[Chorus]
Girl it's just your
S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And Daddy gone go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X.
Take a deep breath
And think before you let it go (let it go)

[Lyfe Jennings]
The block is packed
Baby gotta attitude and proud to holla back
Momma's givin' advice but she ain't tryna hear that
Not because it's wrong, just her delivery is wack
(Shay get ya behind in this house, if I see you with another boy, I swear)
Life is rough
You say that you're not ready for sex, but you're in love
He says if you really loved him, you would give it up
Mamma says that's just a line guys use to get yo' stuff
Which one will you trust?

[Chorus]
Girl it's just your
S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And daddy gone go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X.
Take a deep breath
And think before you let it go (let it go)

[Lala Brown]
Ay yo' Lyfe, she might take it better comin' from a woman (give it to her)
See he'll tell you all kind of things to get in your pants, yeah
Baby it's a fact, that once it's gone you'll never get it back (never get it back)
Hold on, to your innocence
Use your common sense
You're worth waitin' for (You're worth waitin' for)
Be strong
Honey don't give in
Blessing come with patience
Until we meet again, I'm praying, for you

[Chorus]
Girl it's just your
S.E.X.
Mama's secret
And Daddy gone go crazy when he finds out that his baby's found her
S.E.X.
Take a deep breath
And think before you let it go (let it go)
