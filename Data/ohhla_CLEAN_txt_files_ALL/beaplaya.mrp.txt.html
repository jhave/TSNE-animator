[Master P]
Ya see, wenches be messy like Marvin
My homies be ballin, pimp tricks eryday, from L.A. to the Bay
to New Orleans, the original big baby, like Big Mike
Don't make me Tina Turner one of you wenches and hit you like Big Ike
UHHHH, pimp shit, Cadillac with the vogues
Hoes got no souls that be for flare without ya coat
Star sixty-nine could get you whipped, uhh
Momma told you never mess with a, Southern bitch
I got this pimp game from my grandfather Big Daddy, he said
"Keep your fo' inches in your candy painted Caddy
 Keep your cattle, all in one stable
 If a wench jumps off at the mouth, keep it cool, then you play her"
Get your cash, then you creep, check a broad, enemy
Ain't no love for you freaks time to tenderize the meat
Then we, be tradin women like Eddie Murphy Tradin Places
I got, baitches cleanin my house shinin my gold, doin my shoelaces
I got, wenches runnin errands goin to stores
dressed up like twins, I mean in the same clothes
Stayin in the same house, bangin en on the same couch
Real G's in dime hats, know what, I'm talkin about
Uhh, be up playa, don't pay for the kitty kat
I mean if you bout it bout it, give her some change, then take it back

Chorus: Fiend, Silkk

How to be a playa main
        You gots to be a playa mahn
(repeat 8X)

[Silkk the Shocker]
You gots to be a playa, but rule number one
in the how's to be a playa never profess to nuttin what ya done
Believe me, or should I say, believe in I spittin
See me talkin to a trick, ask me then I hit em
You never can give em no slack, cause you gots to be in it to win
Be safe and grab her hand, slap dem, cause they'll try the shit again
It's give in to they demands and that's a simp thang
But to get them and they friends, now that's a pimp thang (pimp thang)
You wanna learn som'in?  Well take a picture of this G
Look in the dictionary, under player, you'll find a picture of me
Uhh, cause I don't sleep, and players can't cause we ballin
We can't be trippin, cause a player's pimp can't be fallin
I leave em with the hurt like B.B. cryin like CeCe Winan
recline and watch TV, game feel like a CD
Nigga make appointment when they see me, don't call back often they beep me
Gotta be a G (how you get the drawers) get the drawers off, easy, look
Silkk the Shocker fool, nigga I pimps and roll
(What you ride?)  Cadillacs and vogues, uhh

*chorus*

[Fiend]
See I'm bout to smack me a bitch, cause all my money in here
Told em clear, for me to slid arrear, gotta pay for the year
What I look like a simp?  Girl I'm a No Limit pimp
Got the ones you least expect supportin me for the length
I pass crunch like blunts, treat your man good like a wench
High hoe on the ranch, I spray and smell dogs by the branch
Keep a broad doin splits, next gon' be doin the clit
One girl gone so bad, want me to Western Union some dick
Put em on corners and curbs, breakin new ones outta nerd
Bringin daddy Fiend the money, while all I do is choke herb
I spank em and thank em, leave em swollen and kiss em bye
And just think, cause them extra them knowin my fist size
