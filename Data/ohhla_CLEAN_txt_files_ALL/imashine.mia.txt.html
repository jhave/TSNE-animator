Verse One:

Playaz meet me at the club cuz it's goin down
Master P got a party and you know we gone clown
It started at 10 ends when you leave
So I guess that's tomorrow if you party like me
I can't see the dancefloor cuz so many feet
But dead smack in the middle's where I'm trying to be
Valet got my Benz parked in VIP
No doubt that's the section for the cars all paid out
We in the house niggaz screaming T-R-U
More ice on our bodies than an igloo
Can we get you anything to make you feel at home
All expenses on us
Get your eat and drink on
Money really ain't a thing 
That's why the name's No Limit
Known for goin all out to have you all up in it
So let's get it started 
And the real tru playaz gone shine at the party

Chorus:  repeat 2X

Imma shine at the party
Sportin like 10 karats
Flex like seven figures
Me and all my niggaz
Gettin jiggy in the club
All eyes on us
And as far as money goes
Yall know what's up

Verse Two:

My girls mix hennessy with alize
We in full effect
Now we got that rowdy crowd
But all playaz ain't nobody tryin to get knocked out
The guys got the poker game goin on in the back
The ballaz baby the niggaz with the briefcase kinda cake
High stakes fo sho head bustaz at the door
You can't look in without four figures or more
The place is like a fashion show
Everybody's feeling right
Big face Frank-i-lins falling from the sky
It is our mama first lady of the tank
Major crazy bank straight flossin think I ain't?
Can't do how we do cuz we all tru
Imitaters try to but that's on you
Boo a party ain't a party unless we give it
Cuz the party don't stop

Chorus:  repeat 4X</pre>
