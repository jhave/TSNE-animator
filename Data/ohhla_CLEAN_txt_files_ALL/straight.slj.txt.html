[Soulja Slim]

We about to tell ya how we get down ya understand (ya understand)

[Chorus: Soulja Slim &amp; Damien]
This dat shit dat they don't get but they all been waitin' for
Real niggas its cool you can grab a bitch &amp; head str8 to the dance floor
An make her wobble dat thang nigga (wobble it, wobble it)
Make her back it up nigga (back it up, back it up)
Make her catch dat wall nigga (catch it, catch it)
Back it up &amp; make it fall nigga (hey, hey)

[Soulja Slim]
It's the C-O-M-I-T-T-Y
I be Cut Throat muthafucka til' the day that I die
Tha Lac park outside if you want a ride
But I gotta get some skull once ya off inside
I'm the P-I-M-P of the 2G's
Niggas don't tempt me I'll leave it empty
I'm from where the souljas be
Magnolia project off of Willow Street

[Damien]
If You can work dat thang baby
An you can back it up baby
Then you can ride in my truck baby
An let me off in them guts baby (hey, hey)

[Soulja Slim]
I'ma project dog wit the lease off
You niggas wanna know the game I'm gonna teach yall
I'm the nigga put the cut on the hot sauce
An got the bitches in the club wanna take it off, now drop dat (drop dat)

[Chorus]

[Trinity]
Real niggas in the back here's whatcha do
Grab a bitch, grab a gat &amp; raise the roof
An if a nigga soulja hatin' on ya let 'em go
An if this hoe is kinda diggin' on ya let her blow
Bust nuts like we bust gats
You niggas better watch ya dome fore' we bust dat
Cut Thraot Comitty to the bone &amp; we don't play
Hundred round drum cocked makin' headway, whodi
Bitch nigga get somewhere
Fore' this thang go off &amp; you get hit somewhere
Don't check me check dat hoe, she chose
Fore' she get yo chest pumped fulla bullet holes
We can do it civilized if it want be
Pop Dom P, ball til' I fall, me
Swap a hoe nigga fuck a hoe, they can ride
It's gon' us til' the pakin' lot pimp outside, right

[Chorus]

[12 O'Klock]
Look ma I find it hard to let you walk by
I know you sick of these lame niggas that talk fly
Probaly sayin' I'm ghetto because I spark lye
Tryna take ya from the burbs to the darkside
You wanna ride we can slide in the Expedition
Play ya cards right &amp; you can be the next to glisten
Before we bounce make sure to tell yuor ex to listen
When in the Marriott tryna find ya best postition
You got me lost the way ya back it up &amp; wobble on it
Ma I'm willin' to put up 5 &amp; my bible on it
Catch in the game but it'll change if I get up on it
Beat that thang up like me &amp; you was boxing opponents
Gettin' paid cause you in for a long night
Don't be ashamed cause boo you put on a strong fight
But game is game &amp; 12 O' Klock don't make no promises that he can't keep
An ain't a corner darker enough to were we can't creep

[Chorus]

[Damien]
Come on, back it up don't stop, back it up &amp; don't hurt yaself (4X)</pre>
