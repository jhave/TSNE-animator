Guys they always wonder about me (yeah, I hear ya "T")
Cause everything I have is my own (I'm feelin' dis)
There's no other way you can doubt me (and I'm listenin')
Before I trust you I'll just be here alone
Can I tell ya, can I tell ya, can I tell ya
Gosh golly dern so you still haven't learned
Well I'll be a damn fool
See cause it's headaches you've honestly earned me
You're jackin' da plan I'm like who are you man
Peter Pan but it's still cool G
Slack off my back slip da hell out
My knee and yo correct dat effect
I'm not feelin dis G

[Chorus]
I can depend on myself
I don't need anybody else
To be on my back like that, to be on my back like that

Guys they always wonder what's with me
(say what, say what, say what)
I never let them get in too close
I have my own control
I can't be bought or sold
And I never have to do what I'm told
Yo ladies are you feelin' what I'm sayin'
Well smoke okey doke as if this was a joke
Cause you think you got balls of the great n' black jaws
But your leg I will poke like an egg crackin' a busted yolk
It's a negative cause I won't pause
Til you truthfully see are you
Listenin' to me til you truthfully
See indendently like I handle myself
I need nobody else

[Chorus]

A fist full of fate how much more can I take
This is 6 minus 7 plus 1 ending none you should go to
Where I'm comin' from take your turn tryna teach
A dumb-dumb so it be just a bad memory
Til you truthfully see are you listenin' to me
Til you truthfully see independently
Like I handle myself I need nobody else

[Chorus]

I can depend on myself</pre>
