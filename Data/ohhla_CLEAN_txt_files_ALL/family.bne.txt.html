Yeah come on come on  come on,  this is my family this is my family

[Layzie]
Lord  help me make up my mind
which way do I turn when there's so much stress
surroundin' me daily? This world's so cruel and shady
and I really do miss my baby baby boy, oh boy
me and yo' bigger brother we keeps it realer
You'll always be our lil' nigga, and I know yo' mama miss ya
Picture the day when I get my callin' but until then
I guess I'm stuck [Oh Fuck]
Little T know I miss so much when he get to heaven baby
Boy what's up? We can ride and roll, I know
without this Po-Po trailin', bailin'
All the way to heaven betcha that's a promise
Comin' with tha bombers, niggaz can't test this
creep defeat is all ya meet
Rollin with tha niggaz that pack the heat
and the sack of weed straight out of control
Test tha souls, hoes, nigga rolls, playa haters
and tha po-po as well
Figure (?) everybody need (?) and we livin' in hell
nigga really can't tell, so why?
Prepare for the worst and hope for the best
and the rest as written, some wanna treat my
like I'm forbidden, but I'm just lookin' for the shit that's hittin
Could I be? Come a little bit closer
why you cautious when  you approaches?
Is ya scared of tha fact we soldiers Mo' Thug
breakaz fittin' ta take shit over
Under my halo pray mo' say Mo' Thug wit love
to tha depth that tha game goes
Die all you hoes, foes, and you propose.

(w/ Ken Dawg) Nigga better roll than get rolled over
we shuttin' shit down, and you
know a nigga love to get buck wild
pow come fuck wit me now [now, now]

it's necessary, necessary for me to get down for mine
so I creep and I (grind) (?) give it up but get down
And I know that shit was wrong but
