[Aesop Rock]
My every little step set in a star
Retina Scarred; tread in a sled of bedbugs got my dead head in a jar
Crazer camp stamp blank on the mug of settlers registered
not protest nor approval regarding every morn futile
My experience with a spirit alignment interference
assigns division from clearance to ample scrambling
Let's note the magnificence in the difference
Okay, see two canaries on the wire aspire
to separate lullabies both of which had me drifting
Every clan ghostly orphan scared stiff in the bliss
and list picking from the arrangement under burden
Bust, wallow in will to split the privilege cluster
Lackluster as if a journey choice grew on the nearest chuckle path-dispatch trouble
I've never seen the water so high in my poison life
Social conduct, twenty pace, about face, self destruct 
I know the key locations, sharp enough to catch those subtle signs cause,
well, this here alley cat's been around the block a couple of times
Lifting every tin can, sifting every mess; 
one man's trash, you know the rest, live it (Live it)
Pitching a battered platform out of mass hysterics perished in the blizzard 
When it's finished I plan to sit and observe the twister pivot
Sleep and sleep well; sleep with a sacred array of fevers
ake as a pertinent version of a pipe dreamer
Y'all can find me if you lookin for a friend
I'll be the only iron-clad oracle in a city of tin
It's like that

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
I was born where crooked demeanor seemed to spawn merit
I was born where all the king's men couldn't mend a broken spirit
I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall
to live and die as a brick brick brick in the wall
And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
and I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall 
And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all

(Repeat 4x times)

[Aesop Rock]
Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the path
Assorted orphans coursed in a morbid orbit forward the traps
I make a tentative promise to flash frequent 
the most sacred abrasive based in allegiance to the makeshift mason's secrets
Water basin leaking, plug it up
The simple triple ring performance shoveled subtle imperfection
I rung a life's worth of saturated costume gear over hell's balcony 
to nullify the drought and still the martyr farmers shout at me
And so the epic went and every cirrus hung
The bow breakers turned a cradle fatal, every spirit clung
Croon for the slick Icarus brain children busy splitting the givingtree
building fresh canoes for freaks to cross the spill in
I'm frantic
My plan is dwindling with every pulse bump
Gods and monsters yield the lump sum of the dolt clump
Be wary when the stratosphere tints
I scout like Atticus Finch, inching up slow in the games of reconnaissance
Now cause to amend the Zen memorandum has surfaced in every Holocaust citadel fix it plan
Twelve easy steps to better picket line demeanor
Gumshoe
Stick stone conglomerate activate massive
But the sky is falling, fuck you
I've hired sweatshop labor to hold candles to the solar panels 
stitched in the back of my neck for nickels and sour milk by the week
Cheek to the heartache
At the center of my anthem lies a blend of temper tantrums substantial for me to lamp in.

I was born where it don't matter if you stand, sit, or fall

And I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall
and I'm a brick brick brick brick brick in the wall 
And I'm a brick in the wall, drop in the bucket, yes y'all
