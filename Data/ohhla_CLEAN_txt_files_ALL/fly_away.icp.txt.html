Spread your wings
Flying over frozen mountains
Crystal rivers and geizer fountains
????
Float with the breeze and cross seas to shores
Deserts, cactus, and tumbleweed
Irish meadows and fields of green
Glide through cities of brick and stone
Broken arrows of ancient roan

Fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Won't you come fly with me?
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Everybody

Haunted woodlands, forbidden trails
?????
Castle halls, underwater falls
Pyramids crumble when nature calls
Skies of blue become black with stars
Lightning bugs kept within jars
Sand moves slowly through the hour glass
Wings spread, we can all fly last

Everybody come and fly away
You must believe that you can fly away
Spread your wings and come and fly away
Just believe that you will fly away

Rock will melt, coal crystalize
The clouds and skylines materialize
Wings spread take flights over northern lights
Wolves howl over blood-red moonlit nights
We're Kings and Queens within our dreams
The sky rains down into ruby rings
Oceans river lakes and ponds
Lions unicorns birds and ???

Fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Won't you come fly with me?
Come on and fly with me
Come on and fly with me
Everybody

Martians travel to the land of Mecca
Atlantis hidden deep under forever
Iceland golden tombs of pharoah kings
Rainbows trickelin diamond rings
Voices cry now echo carries
Angels dance with the cryptic fairies
Gates of Afterlife open swiftly
Stay if you wish...
But come fly with me

Everybody come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
You must believe that you can fly away
(we could fly together, come on)
Spread your wings and come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
Just believe that you will fly away
(we can fly together)

I'm hoping your imagination (imagination)
Beyond anything conceivable (anything conceivable)
Allow the unbelievable (unbelievable)
To take complete control of your soul (let it take control)
Levitate 3 feet above ground level (3 feet above ground level and raising)
Allow yourself to raise and amaze
Drift higher and higher into the moon's rays, come on

Everybody come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
You must believe that you can fly away
(we could fly together, come on)
Spread your wings and come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
Just believe that you will fly away
(we can fly together)

Everybody come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
You must believe that, you must believe that you can fly away
(we could fly together, come on)
Spread your wings and come and fly fly away
(fly with me, come on)
Just believe that you will fly away
(we can fly together)

Everybody come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
You must believe that you can fly away
(we could fly together, come on)
Spread your wings and come and fly away
(fly with me, come on)
Just believe that you will fly away
(we can fly together)</pre>
