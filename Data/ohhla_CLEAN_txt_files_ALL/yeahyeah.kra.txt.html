Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I might walk a lil funny but my walk is me
I might stutter when I talk but I say what I see
I don't agree with every other li'l thing that's proven
I do a lot of things that I shouldn't be doin'
I'll ruin everything you mighta had in mind
I'm a consistent, belligerent, solidified find
Rhinestone freak, suburban star
I ain't got no money and I got no car
I might make par if it don't take much
See I don't ride very far cuz I ride on luck
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should
And I do it for the love of everything that's still good

[Chorus 2x]

I don't know why I come here
But I know I'll never leave
It's the only place I wanna be yea, yea, yea

I'm a long way gone but I ain't short lived
I got deep deep pockets that leak like a civ
I give 110 throughout the course of a night
And if I don't go home then I did things right
I'd like to settle down but I ain't that guy
Cuz everything I ever did I always did on the fly
I like to ride the wave 'til the tide don't swell
I don't like cocaine but I like the smell
I dwell in the place you might see unfit
But there ain't nothin' you can ever say to make me give a shit
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should
And do it for the love of everything that's still good

[Chorus 2x]

I'd like to say that I don't do them bars
But my street called straight don't stretch too far (uh huh)
I'm on the move goin' nowhere fast
And you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass
I'll take a pass be the last in line
And if it takes 10 years then I'ma be just fine (ah!)
I saw the signs in the grass ain't green
I found love at the bottom of a bottle of Beam
See comin' clean just seemed so jaded
And bein' underrated is underrated but I don't hate it
I stay stuck in a rut like I should
You know I do it for the love of everything that's still good

[Chorus 2x]
I don't know why I come here,
But I know I'll never leave,
I don't know why I come here,
But I know I'll never leave,
I don't know why I come here,
But I know I'll never leave,
It's the only place I wanna be yea, yea, yea,
It's the only place I wanna be yea, yea, yea!</pre>
