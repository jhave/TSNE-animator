[Childish Gambino]
I am the shit, I hold heat like cigarettes
No one else is doing this, work this hard you get respect
I don't sleep, I dream awake; swear this life like make or break
I don't make I fix mistakes; your life good, my life is great
This game is a bitch and I'm different, dude
I'm tryin to fuck this bitch, she ain't in the mood
Seduce her quick
Everyone talkin 'bout the game needs change ain't changin shit
Talk don't make it happen; I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Too tight need muscle relaxer - I'm what's next, just ask 'em

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
All I know, it's what I came for - glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory, yeah

[Childish Gambino]
I wanna do this right, leave my heart on stage when I hold a mic
And the game OT, no end in sight; so I write in my sleep, I don't say good night
This must be how the angels felt, I hope that I don't Corey Haim myself
I know that I drink an insane amount
cause it helps with the joy and the pain of wealth
These guys don't seem like the friends I need
And they hang backstage drinkin beers for free
My mom and my dad in the balcony
The one time that I hope they look down on me
Cause they proud of me, they call me a role model
Even though my hand's glued to that gin bottle
I keep my career goin full throttle even though the pain will follow

[Chorus]
