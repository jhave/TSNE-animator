[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, Big Will
Ay lil' homey you need to {*"pump ya brakes"*}
Real talk, we came to have a good time
We ain't got all that time for all that
Man homey look {*"pump ya brakes"*}
Now slide right, and just {*"pump ya brakes"*}
Wanna holla at you in a minute
F'real, ha ha {*"pump ya brakes"*}

[Verse One: Will Smith]
All this excess, stress I can't take it
Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid
Why you gotta be all up in the face kid?
The AVS'll get you numbers and a name, kid
I mean really, houndin on girl
Was that really necessary, see your itinerary
is all awe, you need to be hauled off
She start flippin, she ain't trippin, it's your loss
This a simple case of a anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentlemen and try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if you actin like you just got out a kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal and, pump

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
If your girl in your face and she out of place
What you need to tell her is {*"pump ya brakes"*}
Now if you out but your girls they pressin you hard
What you need to tell 'em is {*"pump ya brakes"*}
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is {*"pump ya brakes"*}
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is {*"pump ya brakes"*}

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Outside the restaurant, girl sees boys
Girl likes boy, girl meets boy (boy)
Boy doesn't know that girl thinks he's fly (fly)
Boy's a nice guy so boy says hi (hi)
Boy's girlfriend returns from goin to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark (what?)
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumping of the brake should start
Girlfriend thinks that somethin's goin on
Girl tells girlfriend nuttin's goin on
Boy in the middle of the commotion beginnin
Girlfriend mad cause boy keeps grinnin
Now why is he grinnin?  But that's beside the point
Girlfriend she chill 'fore they rolled up in the joint
Jumpin to conclusions get you nowhere honey
Pump ya brakes and be a crash test dummy

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Rule #1, is just like 2
The who-dos and what-nots and what you should dizzoo
No loud talkin, no back talkin
If you do either believe it you back walkin
I hate to sound rude but then again I have to
My rap bang and my mack game it'll smack you
Click-clack you, spit at you
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I GAT to
I gotta question to ask you
Would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let him smash you?
If I was you, and you was I
Would you keep it G, or would you stay fly?
If you was rich, in a ditch, livin low, would you push the button
keep it cuttin, or would you just let it go?
Calm down lil' homey
And know what you dealin wit before you run up on me

[Chorus]
