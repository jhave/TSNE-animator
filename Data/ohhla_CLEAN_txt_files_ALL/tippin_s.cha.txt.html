[Chorus - Rasaq]
I'm tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow

[Verse - Rasaq]
-Yeah Yeah..
Tippin' slow in my low, 55, 54
TV screens in my do', paint drippin' on the floor
High-cappin' on these hoes
mad that I got my dough
Didn't like me when I was broke, tow-down and po'
Now I'm slidin' on 4's, ridin' on 4's
Crushin' all haters, and all those who oppose
Shinin' up my golds, watch the diamonds glow
The young Napolean straight blindin' all these hoes
(I'm Tippin' Slow) Sittin' in the road
(Tippin' Slow) Sittin' big and bold
(Tippin' Slow) Rose gold chain
(Tippin' Slow) Rose gold rose
(Tippin' Slow) J's on my toes
(Tippin' Slow) Starch in my clothes
(Tippin' Slow) Swangin' lane to lane
(Tippin' Slow) Ya boy actin' throwed
Color Changin' got it sold
forget what you've been told
Suckers don't know, busters don't know
I'm sippin' moet, throwin' up my set
I'm in the Impala, Twin in the Vette
Them haters better get
we holdin' on them tech's
Playa I'm just tippin
I ain't lookin' for no plex
I'm lookin' for some reds
I'm lookin' for some yellas
They better show me love
and then to my fellas
Nigga we better, stop actin' jealous
Do as I do go out and get ya cheddar man.

[Chorus - Rasaq]
I'm tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow
tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow, tippin' slow</pre>
