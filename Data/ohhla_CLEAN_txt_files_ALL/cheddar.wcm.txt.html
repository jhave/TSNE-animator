[Cube]
Uhh uhh Come on...
Got to get the scrilla got to get the scrilla
got to get the cash hey come on got to get it (huh huh)
[repeat 3X]

[WC]
Ridahs please callin' on all ridahs please
Blowin' through the wind like the sticky green breeze
Back once again straight faded off Henn'
It's that nigga WC with the pocket full of spend
runnin' all the gators with the new chrome feet
checkin' through my rearview with my hand on my heat
Cause hatas can't stand to see a nigga doin' good
but fuck Hollywood I'm a still bang the 'hood
Gettin' my stalk on walk on loc I'm all about the paper
hoppin' out the Navigator with braids &amp; Chucks Taylors
A regulator scopin' the field like a commentator
Dodgin' investigators haters &amp; salt shakers
the cookie baker the 64 pancaker
Bitch my whole entourage is full of kit makers &amp;
gators trip makers to Vegas from bird breakers from skyscrapers
tippin' nobellas cause loc we's all about the Cheddar

[Mack]
See we down for whatever
It's all about the Cheddar
I put that on my life &amp; the 23rd letter
[Cube]
Everybody get yo' scrilla
Don't worry 'bout ya time zone
homie get yo' grind on
[Repeat Chorus]

Better
bounce baby baby bounce baby baby bounce
to them outta town niggas I still got 'em 9 an ounce
Can't rely on no label to send my kids to college
so after I rock the spot meet me in the parking lot
Now call it what you want but the game got me cheese
with bitches on my dick since my last CD
I went from young black &amp; broke bro' to dub the inevitable
turnin' over three decimals bangin' the oyster perpetual
let it go rags to riches buckets to Phillies
I went from no dough to mo' dough
to still gettin' these switches
I'm wicked for digits forgive me God for the truth
but I fiends for Cheddar like a smoker with a sweet tooth
Got game from Legit &amp; 40 C Mac &amp; Short
Cube told me the key to it all is to keep hustlin' loc
Put your family first &amp; the rest will endeavor
Stay focused &amp; forever we can get this Cheddar
Come on...

[Mack]
See we down for whatever
It's all about the Cheddar
I put that on my life &amp; the 23rd letter
[Cube]
Everybody get yo' paper
Don't worry 'bout ya time zone
homie get yo' grind on
[Repeat]

[Cube &amp; Mack]

From the ghettos of Cincinnati Europe to Killa Cali'

Lookin' for the Cavi' yet caught in a drought
connected with the Don &amp; copped one from SuaveHouse
Betta bet ya stepped on it cause last year ya slept on her
but now I'm up on her givin' golden showers to my opponents
Grindin' til I'm paid in full
Pledgin' allegience to them dollar bills

Only true playas can comprehend what I'm talkin about
