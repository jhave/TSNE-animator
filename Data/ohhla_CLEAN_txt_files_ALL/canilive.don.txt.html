[Intro]
Well alright. It's like a celebration of life. Can I live?
 
[Verse One]
I'm bout to hit the scene
I'm bout to make a scream
I'm bout to see my face in every single magazine
I'm kickin' in the do'
And smashin' all these hoes
I got my eyes set on cribs, whips and flashy clothes
I've been here too long
It's bout time I bounce
I'm tryin' to lay up in a city that I can't pronounce
Black ass hell, lyin' in the sun gettin' darker
The juice is sweeter over here, I match a Magic Marker
I made a little change
Bust listen here mommy
I'm still ghetto, I ain't chasin' mixer with Bacardi
No one here's beefin'
My whole team is eatin'
Yeah we beastin', got an album out for every season
And now it's my turn
And they don't like that kicko
Cause I'ma Pain In Da Ass just like them Jigga intros
Son, I'ma milk this game, until the well runs dry
In record time and do it all in one try
Ya know
 
[Chorus]
I'm bout to take it all, that's what I'm here for
I got my eyes on the prize, I'ma make it y'all
I've been patiently waitin', now it's mine for the takin'
Now watch history in the makin'
Whoa
Can I live?
You can't be serious
Can I live?
 
[Verse Two]
Yeah, I know it hurts to see a new nigga cakin'
Sweatin' in the kitchen for years and still bakin'
I don't mean no harm
Pardon my steps
Am I confident? Chaundon is a 5 star chef
Inspired by the likes of Rakim &amp; Kane
B.D.P., Slick Rick, Doug E. Fresh &amp; Dana Dane
Therefore the torch has been passed
So of course if you mistake me for less I'm forced to torch yo' ass
Can I live? Is the question I ask
So what I borrowed from Jay
He don't care, he's makin' money all day
I'm just tryin' to make me a meal
And besides, you ain't heard the old sayin', "All great artists steal"?
Huh?
So I'm ask y'all again
Can I live?
I ain't lookin' for permission, let a nigga do him
So as long as I'm alive there's another rhyme to scribe
Mic to grab, stage to rock and a crowd to wave 'em high ya know
 
[Chorus]
I'm bout to take it all, that's what I'm here for
I got my eyes on the prize, I'ma make it y'all
I've been patiently waitin', now it's mine for the takin'
Now watch history in the makin'
Whoa
Can I live?
You can't be serious
Can I live?
 
[Verse Three]
Listen
The game remains the same, only the players change
Numbers get retired, few get to keep the fame
Many lose the fortune, won't get another break
So I play it smart then I learn from these niggas mistakes
I want the lavish life
And meet the baddest wife
It's the American dream, yeah, sho' yo' right
I want rappin' money
I want actin' money
Porno, casino and keep stackin' money
Hand over fist
Damn it I'm rich
Indecent Proposal, hand over your bitch
Check out my blueprint
My foundation is strong, I'm bout to have a run 30 generations long
Many will follow, I'll lead by example
Takin' over New York, I see it as a sample
So to my Source, XXL and Vibe readers
My name is Chaundon
And it's nice to meet ya

[Chorus]
I'm bout to take it all, that's what I'm here for
I got my eyes on the prize, I'ma make it y'all
I've been patiently waitin', now it's mine for the takin'
Now watch history in the makin'
Whoa
Can I live?
You can't be serious
Can I live?</pre>
