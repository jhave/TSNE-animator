[G-Child]
Hey, this is the G-Child, spaceketeers
Are ya in the house baby, are ya in the house
You know what I'm sayin, cuz its that time
For you to kicks the funk online as we rewind, then it will combine
 
[Mista Grimm]
Smokin on the bud, feelin kinda high
Sippin on the gin, feelin kinda fly
A Warren G production sits in the tape deck
As Mista Grimm raps over laps, don't say shit
Just, listen and recline for a spell
Pass the fat spliff back and forth (oh yeah)
Stuck, unable to breathe through the Chronic
Cloud that somehow prevents me from installin fresh air
 
[Warren G]
Ahh, Indosmoke
Pass me the joint so I can take a toke
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feelin real high
Leaning to the side in my muthafuckin ride
With the OG gangsta glide
Woo!, hey now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
Breakaway, come again like this
The LB to the C two times to miss
Cuz if you do, you break you get broke
Me and Mista G and the indosmoke ("smoke" x4 in background)
 
Chorus: Nate Dogg (repeat 2x) 
["Are you high yet?" (repeated in background)]
Whatever you do muthafucka you betta not choke
this ain't no stress, its the muthafuckin indo smoke 
 
[Mista Grimm]
Fee, fi, foe, really doe
I'm still smokin and sippin, talkin like a pimp
Freakin, seekin new lands without transport
Cuz indo smoke is a man's sport
I never feel stressed and thats the realist
Just a proper herb for my chronic illness
Please, let me go on with my day
Relax with phat tracks and a real fat J
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Astounded from what it did sended me far above
On a fly cloke I can brag for days
You can't swim with Grimm
Because my tidal wave's - high
And that's no joke 
Because Mista Grimm takes flight from the indo smoke ("smoke" 4x in background) 
 
Chorus x2
 
[Mista Grimm]
Ignition to remission blast off through the cos
Most of the voyage I enjoy is just a cause
I sonic boom when I return back to earth
Birth of a new rhyme will take no time
I'm prepared, papers and a lighter to provoke
A comical scene to watch Mista Grimm choke
Then gain composure, compose a symphony
From C-H-R-O-N-I-C and Mista G mixed together nicely
Combining lick the linings vaula
A fat Chronic sack you can put in your jaw
H and R puff the stuff in ya lungs
Smokin on the Chronic, gettin straight sprung
Stretched, taken to the extreme feelin
Dancin on the ceilin like Lionel 
If ya hear me on some vinyl
I break em till they can't be broke
As I soak, in da indo smoke ("smoke" 4x in background)
 
[Nate Dogg]
["Are you high yet?" (repeated in background)]
Take a trip with Nate Dogg to the Eastside
We will show you wether our gangstas love to get high
We get high on every street in Long Beach
So don't come to my hood thinkin' that you can save me
 
Niggas from (?) foreign (?) land (?) wanna come to the East and reveal (?)
I gotta viscious left hook and you're damn right I will steal
Shots go out to my nigga Mista Grimm and you know Warren G
I gotta nigga named Gangsta Rod, you know B-Tip you know me
My name is Nate D-O double G and I'm comin straight from the East
Don't think you dont know where I'm from, I'm from 213
 
[Outro: G-Child]
