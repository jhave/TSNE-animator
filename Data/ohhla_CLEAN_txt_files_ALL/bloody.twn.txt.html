[Lone Ninja]
I had to bear pain, and fight back the fierce flame
The skies cracked as I hijacked the airplane                 
You're side tracked and fair game I create a diversion
The greatest emerging you're jaded
When you're facing the whirlwind no escaping, it's curtains
You trapped in the heart of darkness I say this for certain
You amateurs are just harmless in my glorious days
I swing the warrior's blade I'm at the podium
And I'm getting audience praise, In the budokan 
I don the suit of armor I came to do you harm
And baby you's a goner it's gloom and somber
I enter the desert with tanks your doom's upon ya
I'll sever your veteran rank I move and stalk right
Through fort my fuse is short your troops lost by
Brute force so who's boss, the world hero you're curled in fetal position
The twirling torpedos is hitting       

[June Marx]
I brought upon the rawest form
The word on the street surface,the war is on
The herb brought the beast verses,its foreign born
These birds defeat the purpose their thoughts are wrong
I got you, press play for my resume
No rudeness my mystique fly,the rest decay
So ruthless since knee high, suggest you pray
My truth is in a deep lie expressed in ways
I'm ill, armor and steel slaughter and kill
Sippin quarter water lord I'll blow you out the port of brazil
Roll the recorder I'm scorching the reel, all for the meal
Realize lifes truth when the false is revealed
My force is unreal, realer in the physical form
Y'all the typical norm, a bunch of pitiful pawns
Your spirit is gone, hustle everyday in all sort of spots
You forgot here's another fuckin warning shot</pre>
