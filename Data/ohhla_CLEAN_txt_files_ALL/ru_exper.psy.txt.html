[Chorus: B-Real]
We'll all rise to inform masses, engage
encounter extreme passages, enter return insideeternal neglect
cycles encouraging survival

[B-Real]
through hallucinations escape
now every wicked ordeal regenerates disgrace, emotions ruined
intellectuals seduced including nations
founded under loose lock
evaluate friends, foreigners, enemies concentrate to
penetrate, reduce our time, elminate chances to
yell out, utlize, realize, survival
essentails, lifestyle fundamentals
attantion to all nation youth, continue our struggle
trust no one, maintain, and tell truth, end ridicule
war, hunger and terror
vicious invidual clever to often rule you
whether individuals love, loathe
behold enslavement, order united retaliation so
fear in God hold true, to obstruction
thoroughly handing enemies'
destyruction, elimination, avoid the humiliation

[Chorus: B-Real]
we'll all rise to inform masses, engage
encounter extreme passages, enter return insideeternal neglect
cycles encouraging survival

[Sick Jacken]
fughting original underground generals hit their
weakest intervals two hundred
sentinels, infiltrate levels effectively not taken
warning except automatic preparation, override negative systems
and new democracies
secretly under battle, lost inside mystery, intaining nuclear actions
lethal combat overdoses excessive so
involved that civilians assist, never trippin' after killin'
ecery casualty opening mental position, let elite take eventual
control owning nation to reveal only love
of violent expansion, retalation
to higher elevation, witness old revelation, lingering dication

[chorus: B-Real]
we'll all rise to inform masses, engage
encounter extreme passages, enter return insideeternal neglect
cycles encouraging survival

[Mr. Duke]
battle underground intelligence leaving the defenses
all numb and defenseless on restless
grounds adolescent negligent intend
zero evidence years of underdeveloped
races street technique, raises enemy encases
tasteless authorities run
mazes in elite space and places rearranged
evidence pages all revealing establishment
traces order in courts
taking away kingdoms, endless
anti-civilian tactics
indicate overthrowing national assassins
guaranted actions increases the nation's
securities tensions, abusive badges, uniforms and stations
inject vaccinations of elimination armies unauthorized
to hide or rewrite institutional treaties in every state
die no mistake</pre>
