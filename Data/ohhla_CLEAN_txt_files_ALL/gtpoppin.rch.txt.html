Here I come

[Chorus]
When niggas get to poppin
Get get down, get get g-get get down (down)
Get down, g-g-g-g-get down
When niggas get to poppin

[Verse 1]
Money, cars, stars, they be ballin
Playas, pimps, dem hoes, dey be callin
Microphone check (check), one (one), two (two), four (four)
Who? Da fourth is you
I shut da whole block down like motherfuckin' P.D.
Niggas wanna be me, dey friends come and see me
Crack, rock, da block is hot
Dem niggas hate'n on me for da hoes dat I got
But I ain't even trippin off a trick as bit
Cause ya'll motherfuckers ain't hittin off shit
Broke ass nigga, joke ass nigga
Mess around and be a little smoke ass nigga
Rich Boy chillin
Polo chillin
What mo' can I say, we bout millions
That's what we get, we got it good
And you know we in yo hood

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Dem boys stillin, dem boys dealin
Up in da hood, dem boys killin
I'm cold, put ya sweaters on like lil Charlie Brown
I got enough rounds to lay da whole place down
35-thousand dollar watch, 100-thousand dollar drop
3-million dollar spot
One, two, it don't stop...bitch
Getcha money hustle up
Bubble 10 double up
You a motherfuckin squirrel tryna get a nut (nut)
From top to bottom, dem hoes, I got em
Don't ask me how, don't know who shot em
You snitch ass nigga, bitch ass nigga
Mess around, getcha self killed little nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Rich boy chillin, Polo chillin
What more can I say, we bout millions
Dats what we get, we got it good
And you know we in yo hood

[Outro]
When niggas get to poppin
Get get down, get get g-get get down (down)
Get down, g-g-g-g-get down
When niggas get to poppin...
