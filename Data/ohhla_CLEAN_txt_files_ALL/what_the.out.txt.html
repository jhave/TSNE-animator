(Sample) Bill Withers - "Don't You Want To Stay"
"Busy hanging curtains
Children in the way
Whoaaaa!! That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?"

[Planetary]
Back in the days on the boulevard
I use to take small steps cuz the hood was hard
Use to walk down fifth to anoint the street
Use to play rock this funky joint in my sleep
Always wanted low sweats Addidas stripes
Use to chill conversate wit all the thieves at night
I done been thru a lot, dun seen a whole lot
Done cracked many jars and put food in the spot
Seen my grandfather get buried in a box
Dun seen pop cry, seen shots fly
Nigga I came up raw, living wit these stains and scars
My parents separating was hard
I don't speak on it much, it's nobody's bidness
But I don't eva lose touch, I maintain my pivot
I been thru the scrabbling, lost all gambling
Selling CD's like I'm poor panhandling
I walk street wit a chip on my shoulder
Cuz I know life's hard and I can only get older
I remember what a wise men told us:
Fight back like you drunk but think straight like you're sober

(Sample) Bill Withers - "Don't You Want To Stay"

[Crypt the Warchild]
I wanna know what the future hold?
Will I be subject to numbers? Will I lose my soul?
Will I lose those who love me as I move the globe?
If I'm gon' on the road will I lose my home?
I made my sacrifices gotta deal wit the devil
On the verge of losing my mind I let it settle
I seen it all thru the eye of a needle
I came across niggas who murdered their own people
I talk to an Angel she told me to be peaceful
There's a lil man at home and in life he will need you
I'ma break the cycle on the outside looking in
Trying to contain the Beast that rages within
Trying to seize the grieve that races within
Trying to release the pain that cages us in
You ain't nobody till somebody hates you
And if word gets around it'll probably make you
Here comes a black cloud they no longer escape you
You had some brighter days so you praying to Jesus
You get one life; I only wish I could take two
And turn back time and realize what these snakes do
