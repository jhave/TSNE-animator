Take to the heaaaaaaaaaaaad

Are you down?

[Pharrell - whispering]
All that huffing puffing that you do
You got somethin on your mind
All that rocking that you do
You got somethin on your mind
I can tell by the way you move
You got somethin on your mind
It seem like you got somethin to prove
You got somethin on your mind

[Interlude]
We got a connection, some synergy
Ain't no other woman please, it's just you
Somewhere intersection, I feel energy
It's like tingling, it must be true - that's because

[Chorus]
You're my temple, get on my knees
And I come to you, yes I come to you
It's just that simple, your lovin heat
like the sun would do, is why I run to you

[Pharrell - whispering]
{UHHH~!} Yeah
I like bush (take your panties off)
You're in motion in the mirror as a rainbow dandelion
I suspect you know what it does when I see yo' pantyline
All that lotion in your hands
You got somethin on your mind
And all that fixin in your pants
You got somethin on your mind

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Pharrell]
Yeah, I know you had, your ups and downs
But look at you girl, you're on top now
You're so attractive, it's so magnetic (I'm attracted to you)
This thang is gettin deeper, now do you get it?
Say yeah (yeah!) Uhh
Say yeah (yeah!) C'mon
Say yeah (yeah!) UNGHH! Ohhhhh
Say yeah (yeah!) yeah..

[N*E*R*D]
{UHHH~!} Say ooh, no hands
I like the way that you dance listen to me now
Ooh, no hands
Girl shake what'chu got in them pants listen to me now
Ooh, no hands
From Florida to France
Say ooh, no hands
Tonight's the night you got plans

[repeat 2X]
Take to the heaaaaaaaaaaaad

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Pharrell]
Yeah, I know you had, your ups and downs (your ups and downs)
But look at you girl, you're on top now (you're on top now)
You're so attractive, it's so magnetic (I can't stay away from her)
