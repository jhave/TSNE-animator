[Hook]
This is the town where the clowns put it down baby
Moma say stop or I'm gonna tell poppa
Close the door befo ya child here the sound baby
Moma say stop or I'm gonna tell poppa

* - Tech raps these lines in between at double speed

[Tech N9ne]
The killa clowns in ya town raisin all hell
* Tecca Nina wit the stamina comin to damage ya
  Buckin the bammer when I bust wit a bang
And it aint no clause that say fraud aint no tall tale
* Women love when I hit when I cover the booty
  They givin it to me but it aint no thang
We reppin KC MO fellas and the ladies know
* That we comin wit the killas I'm wit the gorillas
  The villians that get ya when you disrespect us
Even the babies know Tech Nina got crazy flow
* We be givin the women the willy we sick of the hatas
  Wanna pays us betta get this record
This is important we be courtin every place we go
* Get you up in the room and drippin up wit the groom
  I give it to you anyway you wanna have it
Baby is a horse and yes of course I'ma have to break the hoe
* Leavin the kids at home I wanna bone alone
  We hoppin up and down like jack rabbits
So many kids put this on they daddies mind
* Never will I ever put 'em out there like that
  Feelin that I did Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin 'em that they mommy's boyfriends Tech N9ne
* Don't be lookin at me like you really wanna fight cat
  All Tecca Nina wanna know is where the mic at

Abracadbra, 151 and coke is viagra
* Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
  Gotta real love from havin the bed shook
Look I'm hella fed up wit all the silly rumors dawg
* Sayin that we got dropped JCOR
  That never ever happened I mean what do they know
We kept our head up and now moneys comin to us all
* We kickin it wit Strange wollowin fame
  Givin the game only when I say so
So crack some bud wit me, demons get some love wit me
* Doin what you gotta do to get what you gotta get 
  It gotta get it all Tecca Ninas on a roll
Get on some shrub wit me, two cases of bud wit me
* What you gonna do to get the women on crunk

[Tech N9ne]
One, then comes the two to the three and
* That was the anthem no this the anthem
  Hella rockin the planet again you can't stand it again
Huns, they then comin through to see me man
* Then I de-pants 'em and I bust at random
  In a bit I'ma land 'em, dock, women I ram it again
Raise, I love to get high and get paid
* Why do I wanna stick 'em wit another hit out of abyss
  Baby you don't wanna miss the ISH
Babes they love to come by and get laid
* Why am I at the pinnacle when I rip it I'ma kill 'em in this
  To the hatas I gotta send 'em a gift
Bump this in your ride or in the club
* Givin everybody what they need
  I give it all so they give it all back to me
Hatas don't you hide just show some love
* Do you dig it I'ma rep the B
  And never ever let the C get the best of me
So many kids put this on their daddies mind
* Never will I put 'em out there like that
  Feelin that I did Tecca Nina take it right back
Tellin him their mommy's boyfriend is Tech N9ne
