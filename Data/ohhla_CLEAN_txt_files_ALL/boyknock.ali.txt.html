[Tatyana]
Uh, uh, uh
Oh, oh yeah
Baby

[Tatyana]
From the moment that I saw you babe
All I think about is loving you
Every time that you are near
I just can't help but stare
I'm dreaming of eternity with you
So maybe I can

1 - [Tatyana]
    Run away with you
    Imagine all the things we'd do
    Call my name
    And make this fantasy for real
    Run away with you
    Imagine all the things we'd do
    Call my name
    And make this fantasy for real

2 - [Tatyana]
    Can't hold it, I can't fight it
    Want you and I can't deny it
    It's all about the things you do
    Boy, you knock me out
    Can't hold it, I can't fight it
    Want you and I can't deny it
    It's all about the things you do
    Boy, you knock me out

[Tatyana]
Can you feel the vibes I'm sending, baby?
All my energy and thoughts towards you
There's now way I could let go
Of all these dreams and hopes
Anxieties so deep, feelings so new
Just maybe I can

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[Tatyana]
Falling for you, this love's a TKO
Falling for you, baby
Falling for you, this love's a TKO
Falling for you, baby

[Will Smith](Tatyana)
Uh, uh, uh
Here it is a groove slightly transformed
Again, but with a Tatyana Ali spin
I knew ever since she was ten
As Fresh Prince from back then
I had a synch she would win
Whatever clique she was in
Now she's all grown up not Ashley
Mad sexy, true but classy
She in the fast lane under my wing
Kissing the sky
Tatyana Ali, girl you knock me out
(Cause boy you knock me out)

Repeat 2 till end</pre>
