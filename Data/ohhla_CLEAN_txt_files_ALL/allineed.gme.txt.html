All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

Lemme tell you a story bout these punk rap niggaz
Play tough but they whole fuckin life made up
I'ma start wit 50 cause I used to roll wit him
He neva smoked weed so how could I blow wit him
Shoulda knew he was a fag by the way his clothes fit him
Tight G Unit jeans brought out the ho in him
Had one lil girlfriend and that was fixed
Somebody musta told Vivica her boyfriend like dick
Lloyd Banks knew, he told me that shit
I told Buck and Buck told me he ridin wit his clique
So I start ridin wit Fat Joe and Kiss
Made a good choice cause afta that Yayo bricked
So I gave away my chain and decided to keep movin
Now I'd ratha burn in hell then yell G Unit
Thats the truth nigga word to Seagle
Sleep on The Game and wake up to a gold desert eagle

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

50 what happened to ya movie, the soundtracks
Chicken Little killed you niggaz you'll never bounce back
I paid 19 dollars to see that shit
My bitch said you was naked I ain't see that shit
You and Olivia in the shower, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle &amp; Flow and a damn coward
I had to sit there for 80 minutes
The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This ain't New Jack City and it can't be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G-Unot and that made you finished
I put two quarters in and I played you niggaz
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Tell niggaz come get me, I got a glock nine
I'ma window shoppa cause I ain't got drop a dime</pre>
