[Verse 1]
Brandon got beef, I STILL roam the streets. (Mmm!)
Take another loss, I'm a murder for hire
Niggas too hot, Everybody drop
Funk in the spot. (Mmmm!)
Tried to keep it cool. B, you a fool. (Damn!)
West, what it do. Still hold the 2. (One hunnit!)
Fuck what you heard, bitch, I'm still what it do. (Feel me)
I don't give a FUCK, I'll rob the dopeman too

(Basedgod-Basedgod. Nyeah)
(THUGGIN!)

[Chorus]
Bitch Mob Killa, USA Killa
Task Force Killa, I'm Fo' Realla
Ski Mask Killa
Scared of no bitch, I'm ready for the funk

Bitch Mob Killa, USA Killa
Task Force Killa
Get Your Mind Right, Bitch, I'm Fo' Realla
Ski Mask Killa
Scared of no bitch, I'm ready for the funk

[Verse 2]
If you ask me, bitch, the game been deep. (Mmm-Hmmm)
Once you turn creep, we gon' ALWAYS have beef
Don't be like me, I be looking over my shoulder
Got a chip on my shoulder. I fuck with the 'Nolia
On the back streets, now I slide through central (Mmm!)
I ride presidential, LOOK AT ME, BITCH. (UHMMM!)
I'm RICH OFF MY WRIST, NOT TALKING 'BOUT THE DOPE. (Mmm)
MAC-11 strap get dirty like a ho
MAC-11 strap make you look like a child. (Basedgod)
I play a dirty game that your ass will find (Ksssssssss...)
I feel violated like that nigga Yo Gotti
That nigga tried to stop me, Dumped the bitch body. (Basedgod)
I'm Luni Coleone 'cause nigga, this that Thug Shit (Feel me)
"No mask, no club" shit, This that real goon shit
This that "I really rock, and I feel your fucking word" (We fuck with you, Basedgod!)
Protect what you earn and, bitch, respect my fucking nerve

[Chorus]
