Much love, much love, mo thug, mo thug, mo thug

Eternal thug
Much love, much love, mo thug, mo thug, mo thug
Come follow me if you want to feel the thug love

And yo, we're good humble people
On the grind to teach the world to be a thug in harmony so peaceful
We're so thuggish ruggish
And to, we're good humble people 
On the grind to teach the world to be a thug in harmony so peaceful (peaceful)
