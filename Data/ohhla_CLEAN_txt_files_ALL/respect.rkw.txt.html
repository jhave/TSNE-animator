[Intro: Raekwon]
What's up Big Chris?
Goin to the store to get the papers. *echoes*
Got ya, a little love on this one here.
Huh! *laughs* Word on. Word on.

[Chorus 1: Raekwon]
Commerical rap niggaz get they domes smacked outta
We tired of these earthlings acting like they cowards
When you fuck up, we gettin down for ours
Coast 5 million niggaz, sky 'em like twin towers

[Raekwon]
Hennessey, dick kisser
Slang lord, verbal pain commissioner
Light fire to names, dame sizzler
Multi, 40 karat bow tie
N.Y. national league of big guys with stolen 5's
Albums cloud him, phantom of the opera style
with loud phones, system, 100 thousand watts in em
Rock rocks, delight exchange like stocks
Bars made like Comstock, dead man's glock
Holdin name down, spit a 100 in change now
Range spin out, damn check The Weather Channel
Throw the Gilligan on, just strain now, smack lames down
Fuckin with checks, throw the ringer on and blink out
Link out, how the fuck this money come up short?
What? You sniffed a half a quart?
Dart designer, emblem blow, seat recliner, rewind
Black caught an old timer, gold miner
Spread love to golden glove, foamed up
Blood, hibernatin with snubs, never rock Lugz
Chill, run tracks like Harriette Tub'
Bugs, spit cum all in ya girlfriend's mug
Motion picture novel, Donna giones' third brother
What? Bout to buy estate floodin with clubs
Wrapper around me, what's in my lap could seem astoundin
Broke, but with no hands gone, sleep but soundly
It's cold water, rotti tried to drown me
You and ya boys surround me
Meet the sleeper, static-free Downy
Slang, wildin up, the nigga found me
Sick gowns, rock a sick gown, 4-5th brown
Ready to pop shit now
The Earth spinnin like a windmill
Workin ya swords, get ya link down
Hit down, cavalry ain't shit now
Valerie, number one asian, ancient from the pink cows
Now we know how the fuck you think now
Take off a nugget ring and think how
Bullet tank out

[Chorus 2: Raekwon]
Commerical rap niggaz get they domes smacked outta
We tired of these earthlings acting like they cowards
When you fuck up, we gettin down for ours
Coast 5 million niggaz, sky like twin towers
Cowards, you gonna learn to respect power
We burn by the hour, one burst the remmy got us

[Raekwon]
Crank shit, Shawshank Redemption scholar
Roll up, based on dollars, baseball hat, big collar
Chill, watch everybody crowd us, we bout it bouters
Rockwilders, rockin swim towelers
Burst the 45 power, skate across the Isenhower
Kangol, 50 iguana, nugget trimmed, ice down iguana
Split it in half, holdin my anaconda
Black Marizana, true Don daughter, hide-out
Stashed in Ghana, guns about the size of ya mama, select drama
Trauma rap, birds fall asleep, Ghana
Caeser czar, come out ya rap par'
Fiddle with y'all car

[Chorus 2]

[Outro: Raekwon]
Once burst the remmy out us...
Once burst the remmy out us...</pre>
