Yes
You know I had to make a weed song for the album, bitch
This Smoke-A-Lot on mine, ya dig
I stay puffin lah, ya dig
What
What what

[ VERSE 1: Yukmouth ]
When I wake up in the morning I'm always puffin, my friend
Before a nigga finished ???? I'm rollin up one again
Stuff ???? again cause I love puffin, my friend
I check the map cause I keep smokin and won't fuck again
So now I hop in the big body Benz, my friend
Bend a corner to the weed spot with ends to spend
Park the Benz, jump out like 'what's up, my friend?'
He plugged me with the chronic buds that make mi platinum teeth grin
Let us begin: why, what, when or where and when
A nigga spend so much cheese on this weed, my friend
Cause I'm a fiend, my friend, a dopefiend, my friend
Plus all around the world smokin weed make friends
From Italy to Japan smokin weed make friends
They don't know my language but understand my weed, my friend
From here to Amsterdam smokin weed make friends
Smoke Afghanistan hashis overseas, my friend
Come again

[ CHORUS: Benzalino ]
Lah lah
Always seen me smokin lah lah
I'm always puffin on lah lah
Always seen me smokin lah lah
I'm always puffin on lah lah

[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]
Everywhere a nigga go I'm smokin 'dro, my friend
Mi like to blow and then mi blow until mi need mo' again
And so I go again, go and get the endo, my friend
Hit the liquor store and get the optimols, my friend
Come again, I take a piss test on parole, my friend
That's why mi keep ???? golden seals and blunts pre-rolled, my friend
Cause I can't let the p.o. kknow that I ???? smoke it again
Mi on mi third strike and mi no wanna go to the pen
I tell em mi don't like the drugs, they like me, my friend
Ecstacy, mi even roll up shrooms with weed, my friend
Mi tell em mi don't like the drugs, they like me, my friend
Plus all around the world smokin weed make friends
The bodega man he love me cause I spend, spend, spend
I buy QP's ???? purchase and a twenty-twen-twen
I say the weed man he love me cause I spend big ends
He plugged me up with somethin lovely, made mi platinum teeth grin
Come again

[ CHORUS: Benzalino ]

[ VERSE 3: Yukmouth ]
When mi travel out of town I be on missions, my friend
I don't discriminate on bammer, let me hit it again
Then mi go ask him where he get it and cop my own, my friend
Cause I'm a nigga that smoke zones to the dome, my friend
Come again, let's take it back when I was young, my friends
I used to tell em not to smoke, it make you dumb, my friend
You're gonna flunk ???? smokin blunts, my friend
Now I'm that nigga rollin dutch after dutch, my friend
Check it out, that's how it began, on the bench, my friend
He told me you can hit this, my man, if you just pitch in that 10
And they some fiends, some dopefiends, my friend
They do everything from fry to codeines, my friend
So I'm like, "Whoa, just let me buy some trees, my friend
So I can be about my business and let you be, my friend"
The principle caught me chokin smokin trees, my friend
He told me: "Let me hit that, boy" - smokin weed make friends
Come again
