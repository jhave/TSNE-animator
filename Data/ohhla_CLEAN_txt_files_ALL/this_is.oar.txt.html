[Verse 1: Trials]
Ahhhh what you wanna say, I probably did
And if I didn't say it already it's probably shit
See I'm sick of rappers saying they're fresher than whatever
When my shit fresher than Fran Dresher in maid dress up
I'm nice from the neck up, butt-neck jam
Skin colour keg brown and my stomach gat round
The trap packed out like Sandra Sully's rack out
When they heard Peepshow bought the gimps back out
FU-NK-OA-RS too stank for the sweet smell of success
If you see me in the street, one fucking shoe on
Don't mean I lost one - mean I got a new one
Using a coupon, don't you know
I'm still broke but they know why I'm like 'leave me alone'
I'ma self-sabotaging expert marksmen
Son of a gun shooting my mouth off to seargents
One for the drinks that I had last night
Two for the drinks that I have tonight
Three for the drinks that I have tomorrow
And four for the money that I have to borrow

PEGASUS
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"

[Verse 2: Hons]
I've been dope since two thou when I burst on the scene like an appendix
Still drinking like an Irishman on St Patty reckless
K Federline pennyless
Might be seeing Seth Green or the Sherminators taking on apprentices
You know, the set redder than a break light
Certified Funkoar, so every verse I lace tighter 
than a plus-sized mole in snug-fit jeans
Ain't shit gonna change 'til I conquer the scene cos
I got plans for world domination like the Mongrels
Hons crowned the king of the concrete jungle
We smash it, hit up the hit like Babe Ruth
Still working 7 years so I guess I paid my dues
Still running with that same crew, Funkoars
You may have heard of us if you like that rap shit from A.U.
S.T. underground, let 'em know now

"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"
"Sposed, sposed, sposed to sound"
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"
"Sposed, sposed, sposed to sound"

Hospice
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"

"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"
Cross-Bred
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"
Clandestine
"This how hip hop is supposed to sound"

[Verse 3: Sesta]
Ay, 25 summers into this mother fucker
Still staggering stuck-ups, still labelled a fuck-up
Ill-rated and such
Who rates greater than us? *croak croak*
NO-ONE'S RATED GREATER THAN US
You can line up for a date with the nut
But be nice and speak nice and lye safe for the nuts
Serenate but no getting engaged with the nuts
Play your cards right and you might take 'em straight to the guts
"Sesta tone down your lyrics
My kids feel it's a little to explicit for them to listen"
Listen. I'ma God-fearing Christian 
I'm even giving praise when I'm pissing -- "JESUS CHRIST!"
It burns, cos I drink and I scream and I curse
like I'm cursed with a birth defect
And infects me like I'm injected directly
to the vein with scotch, then I'd be a Pepsi

[Trials]
This how hip hop supposed to sound
We tear them other cats posters down
This how hip hop supposed to sound
"It's about time for Masta Ace"

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
Yo this what hip hop supposed to sound like
Any flow not like this don't sound right
So take that back to the lab
cos I'm mad that's the one CD that I happened to grab
That shit is going back to the store
Yeah the package is torn but it's already back in the bag
You ain't got the talent to spit
And you just don't fit like Shaq in the back of a cab
Every line's an accurate jab
Write a verse about me, that's the same thing as smacking your dad
That'd be a bad result, you'll get sent to your room as a victim of a bad assualt
It's all about the flow
Don't let a rapper get up on a song and say it's all about the dough
Tell me your the MC who holds it down cos
This how hip hop supposed to sound</masta></pre>
