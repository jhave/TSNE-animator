[Chorus]
She was just a groupie (She just a groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (A groupie)
She was just a groupie
She was just a groupie (All she wanted just was Snoopy)
She was just a groupie (Yeah just a groupie)
She was just a groupie

[Dat Nigga Daz]
Beotch! (Beotch!)
I come through with the humps, I'll thump the shit out your block
I'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop
Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch
The Riviera skated, my interior's the shit
Fifteens humpin', dropped the top some more
Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggaz got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny 'cause I get pretty
It's all about game... 
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (ya know)
To the heart you're just gigolo (ya know)

[Kurupt]
I was off in Vallejo
Peelin' hoes like Idaho Potatoes
What am I to do when life as a G
Bein' from where I be - D.P.G.
It's manifico, ran into this pretty ass skirt
Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'ma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
Someone's at my door, baby who could it be?
Someone wants to score, and get laid by the D-O double-G
Hey girl, what's your name? You wanna go a couple rounds with me?
I told her Nate Dogg is just the same, but she kept screamin' out Snoopy

[Warren G]
What's up baby, my name is Warren
I'm down with the Pound, 'cause I get around
So let me scoop you, swoop you, and take you
Give me a chance, and I'ma break you - 
down - to the very last compound
With my homies from the Dogg Pound

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Now you know and I know
Rule number one, you can't trust no hoe
Now you can get caught up in the mix real fast
The hoe gon' slip away, get away with all your cash
You gots to stay up on your toes when it come to hoes
I bust a brand new hoe at every video
That's on the Pound and the Row, and like the wind blow - 
I pass a hoe to my kinfolk - and then smoke
She say she was no groupie, coochie lookin' juicy
She say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me
But before she do me, I blaze up a doobie
Then turn on some Snoopy and uh - heat up jacuzzi
And, later on I just might turn on a movie
so you can regroupie and re-do me, just for Snoopy

[Chorus]</pre>
