{*a parody of the Beck song "Loser"*}

In a store full of heath food you buy the crap 
Twenty little fixes of cancer in a pack 
With a college tuition's worth of taxes placed on 'em all 
Russian Roulette, you and the Surgeon General 
Kill the lungs and the throat and the head 
Cigarette flamin' with a loser on the other end 
Don't have a match so you use a blow torch 
It's forty below and you're smokin' on the front porch 
Don't cry to me when you're buried down beneath 
Go away and try to hide the yellow stain on your teeth 
You don't believe that it's bad for you, mac 
Well I challenge you to run a couple laps around the track 
So stuff your face with a nicotine pack 
But save a couple bucks for the day you have a heart attack 
Yo, smoke it 
Smoke Eight packs a day 
I'm a smoker, baby 
So why don't you kill me (repeat) 
(Puffin' on a Death Rod)  

Wrinkles on faces from an all-day puff out 
Toxic waste pourin' out of your mouth 
I wonder why you like to smoke and you say you like the taste 
Well, do you also like rancid meat and human waste 
Sittin' there lookin' like a human exhaust pipe 
Blow it in my face and I'll punch out your lights 
So much smoke it's like your brain is in a fog 
Listen to your voice you sound like a dyin' frog 
Gotta have a smoke with every meal, every breath 
You'll be buried with a carton when you're curled up at death 
Which'll be here sooner than you thought 
If you keep puffin', and chokin' on a filter 
Smoke And nicotine 
My throat's decaying 
So why don't you kill me (repeat) 
(Get crazy with the menthol) 
(Brain dead smoke addict) 

Yo, break it on down Smoke... 

Smoke Eight packs a day 
I'm a smoker baby 
So why don't you kill me 
(I'm a nicotine idiot)
