Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1 - Jeezy]
I got some partners doing thirty for playing with them Birdies
I ain't even been to sleep so how I'm waking up early
Top floor chillin with some light skinned girlies
Tryna get my last nut damn right I'm feeling squirrely
Partied so hard last night hangover
Forgot everything Damn right hangover
Breath smelling like straight Swisher Sweets and Liquor
If I died last night you coulda Blamed it on the Liquor
Middle finger out the window weaving when I past by
Lord knows ion need another DUI
Living in a City where you do or you fucking die
Both hands out the top I can touch the sky
Look at ya hommie living life like the movies
Still hit the club in make a muthafuckin movie (yeaaa)
Wish you was right here with me If I had a wish
You feeling down my nigga just picture this

[Chorus]
Hat cocked Top Dropped Breezing through Traffic
Pocket full of money shit I even got plastic
Know the weed good and the Bitches Fantastic
And I'm dead ass fresh I need a Muthafuckin Casket
Keep ya head up it ain't nothing but some time
Gave you ten years it ain't nothing but a dime
When its all said and done hommmie we gotta stay true
What I'm hitting up tonight dont have a clue
But I'mma do it for you

[Verse 2 - Freddie]
I'm just like every nigga Thugging in some Number sevens
Rocks in my socks got several felonies in my possessions
Smith And Wesson gotta go to court today my mama stressing
Just wrote my dawg in the Feds I hope he got the message
Ill be right there to make sure the system don't break you
Wishing that you can do the rest of yo time on Papers
Wish you never got caught Wish we never had to serve
Most niggas sell dope forever never make it to a bird
Or make it to see they thirties shit so dirty these days
Its honestly [?] we do dirt to get paid
So I stay blowing on the loudest shit found
Cause my nigga simmey took me from zippers to Pounds
Gave me hella game &amp; dog I love you for that
I blow this reefa smoke this hash smoke to heaven when I roll up my sacks
Cause of these paragraphs I'm pushing police all on my back
But I stay twisting swishers by the pack and I'mma always Keep my

[Chorus]
Hat cocked Top Dropped Breezing through Traffic
Pocket full of money shit I even got plastic
Know the weed good and the Bitches Fantastic
And I'm dead ass fresh I need a Muthafuckin Casket
Keep ya head up it ain't nothing but some time
Gave you ten years it ain't nothing but a dime
When its all said and done hommmie we gotta stay true
What I'm hitting up tonight dont have a clue but I'mma do it for you

[Verse 3 - Jeezy]
What I'm hitting up tonight ion have a clue
And everybody in here you know I brought the crew
Don't matter where I'm at I'm straight balling
Damn right Chris Paul New Orleans
Sitting up Rimmed up got my dealer tag
Trued up strapped up thats my dealer
No clouds let my nigga see the sunshine
Let em out for one day just one time
And I'mma have them bitches in there like swim where ?
So much money on the floor they can swim there
We use to kick it in the crib with the marble floors
What was in and out of there only the Marble knows
Catch me riding through the city with these model hoes
Badd Bitches need this thats how the model goes
Have you right here with me if I had a Wish
You ever feeling down nigga just remember this

[Chorus x2]
Hat cocked Top Dropped Breezing through Traffic
Pocket full of money shit I even got plastic
Know the weed good and the Bitches Fantastic
And I'm dead ass fresh I need a Muthafuckin Casket
Keep ya head up it ain't nothing but some time
Gave you ten years it ain't nothing but a dime
When its all said and done hommmie we gotta stay true
What I'm hitting up tonight don't have a clue
But I'mma do it for you</pre>
