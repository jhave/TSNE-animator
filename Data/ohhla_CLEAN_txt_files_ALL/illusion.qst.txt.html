Hi I'm just a regular guy
It's just an illusion I made from the outside
Inside I got a sick mind
When the mask goes on just prepare to die (2x)

Strange thoughts my mind begins to scatter
Recover from depression I don't know whats the matter
Well I'm mad like a hatter and I'm clearly insane
But my life is an illusion so I'm hiding the pain
Its strange to be normal but I'm trickin em all
Cuz what goes on in my mind is like off the wall
Lasting as I tick tick tick I be a lunatick I need help
And I wanna kill myself
But I wanna kill everyone else
But I know I'm a nice guy you can't even tell
That I'm a psycho Michael find someone to rain on
Stalk her for months just to scare her
Walk in your house I creep
Sit there all night just to watch you sleep
And I'll sneak out the door just before you wake
The puppy tried to bark but I chewed up his face
I tried to escape from the realm of insanities
Sick of people sayin theyre understandin me
You can't understand cuz I dont't even know myself
I have a disease I need psychiatric help
But I'm in denile you see me happy and smilin
But inside my mind already died
Maybe I'm depressed from feelings ive repressed
Never expressed but oh I'm obsessed with death I guess
Something went wrong down the line
I can't control the ill thoughts in my mind
I look like a nice guy wouldnt hurt a fly
But its just an illusion I created on the outside

nobody can know, nobody'll know till the mask goes on they'll see

(Chorus)

The voices in my head forever taunting me
Demonic laughter from hell haunting me
I tried to shut them up I bash my head against the wall
And I'll be laughing hard after I bruise and blood my skull
The voices the voices they make my brain numb
Tellin me to do sick shit in voodoo tongues
I'm doin what they tell me just to shut them up
You think youre my friend but I'll stilll fuck you up
You thought I cared about you that was an illusion
You don't understand its my mind that I'm losin
The man that you thought you knew was a mirage
I'm clean cuttin body parts up in my garage
Im the cryo clone you never thought woudl run into you
But I'ma slash you hide you out put you in a tub of tub of vinegar
You want me to kill ya cuz you don't like the torcha
But I sorta like to see you in pain
Insane what I am but I always wasnt like this
Back in the day I wouldn't even write this
Used to make songs to party and have fun
But now my ill joints make insane clowns run
The law was changed wheh I was on the brink of insanity
So I saw a shrink he said hes gonna help me reach to my inner self
Instead I reach for his throat and strangle to death
I left his office with blood on my hands
Peoiple in the waiting room all screamed and ran
But I didn't sweat it I tried to forget it
And nobody knows that I'm a crazy from it
Its hectic to create the illusion of a sane man
Cuz I'm insane man
hahahahaheheheheh

(Chorus)

Prepare to die
haha you thought you knew me
It's all an illusion</pre>
