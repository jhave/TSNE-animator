We The People Are United
The ones you never look in the eye
We The People, The Uninvited
The ones that see right through your lies

I'm living in peace decease all evil
Honesty's the policy it never be equal
Sinful people fall down first
Disperse my actions they speak louder than my words
Observe, learn, it always comes back
Like a mouse in a maze you're caught up in a trap
Feeling the vibes that you can't escape
Intake injection poisonous perfection
Calm down, concentrate, I can't relate
Loves great when you only got time to tell fate
A place to lay, some tape to break, some goods to bake, some babies to make
Don't take it for granted, you got one life to live
I know you didn't plan it, so you're forgived
We were put on this earth to show goddess to the youth
Test the planet and speak the truth

We's The People Stress Originality
They's the people got you down on your knees
We's The People Tryin' to Legalize Weed
While you digest the bullshit they forcibly feed
We's The People Drawing Lines in the Sand
A chemical hate poison greed drippin' plant
They control they tax they possess this land
One nation indivisible united we stand
We The People...

We The People Are United
The ones you never look in the eye
We The People, The Uninvited
The ones that see right through your lies

Listen carefully to what they be tryin' to tell us
Marked up 800 percent what are they tryin' to sell us
Propaganda in the can got your hand in the fan
I run my own planet live my life rebellious
The people propelled us
Mary Jane's who compelled us
I got fat sack for all the fans who felt us
The ones who smelt us
And called the police, time to legalize weed
Signed the Kottonmouth Kings

I got the universal key so I had to unlock it
??????????? blown up like sky rockets
Anything you can buy I had mad fat pockets
??????????? playa haters can't stop it
See I got values that are different than you
See you bought lies now not so true
I keep this beat planted in the deepest of roots
??????? close minds like a broke parachutes

We's The People Stress Originality
They's the people got you down on your knees
We's The People Tryin' to Legalize Weed
While you digest the bullshit they forcibly feed
We's The People Drawing Lines in the Sand
A chemical hate poison greed drippin' plant
They control they tax they possess this land
One nation indivisible united we stand
We The People...

Get it straight it's a herb not a drug
???????????????? society's glove
Locked up restricted deemed highly addictive
Labeled pot heads now we're all afflicted
But why? cuz we like to get high?
Expansion of the mind you should give it a try
Chocolate Thai, blue thunder, white butterfly
Super silver, purple haze, and the northern light

Getting major, major, blaze a few times
Puffin' on homegrown, King Klick stay stoned...

Getting major, major, blaze a few times
Puffin' on homegrown, King Klick stay stoned...

Hey loco! D-Loc's on the vocal
I stepped out my closet pluckin' my hydros
I packed a bowl we smoke original flavor
Sweet leaf, Kings Blend in the chamber

We the people got a right to be pissed!
The right to say "Fuck You!" and "Suck my Dick!"
The right to say "I think I've had enough of your shit!"
The right to walk over and bust a fool in the lip!
We the people we from the street!
We know how to low brow
We know how to creep
We the people got our right to be open
This is one motherfucker that you won't be controllin'!!

We's The People Stress Originality
