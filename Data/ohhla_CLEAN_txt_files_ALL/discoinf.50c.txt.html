[Chorus - repeat 2x]
Lil mama, show me how you move it
Better yet, put your back into it
Do your thing like it ain't nothing to it
Shake - sh-sh-shake that ass girl!

[Verse]
Go, go, go, 50 in the house
Bounce, y'all already know what I'm about
The flow sound sick over Dre drums nigga
I ain't stupid, I see Doc then my doe come quicker, whoa!
Shorty hips is hypnotic, she moves it so erotic
Girl watch, I'm like bounce that ass girl
I get it crunk in here, I make it jump in here
Front in here we'll thump in here ohh!!
So gutter, so ghetto, so hood
So gully, so grimey, what's good
Outside the Benz on dubs, I'm in the club wit the snub
Don't start nothing, there won't be nothing, uhh!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's party! Everybody stand up
Everybody put your hands up
Let's party! Everybody bounce wit me
Some champagne and burn a little greenery

[Verse]
It's hot! Disco inferno!
Let's go! You're now rocking wit a pro
I get dough to flip dough, to get more fa sho'
Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie I don't dance, all I do it this
It's the same two step wit a lil twist
Listen punk I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention boy I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Goose wit a little Dom Perignon
And a little Hennessy, you know we fin' to carry on
I'm hollering at these shorties in the club trying to get right
We gon be up in this bitch till we break daylight

[Chorus]

[Verse]
You see me shining, lit up wit diamonds
Cause I stay grindin, uh huh!
Homie you can catch me swooping
Bentley Coupe and switching lanes, haha!
If you see me rolling, you know I'm holding
I'm bout my paper, yeah!
Nigga I'm serious, I ain't playing
I'll embed it in your brain, I'm off the chain, G Unit!!
Next level now, turn it up a notch
Em and Dre sent me to tear up the spot
Front on me, oh no, you know I'm loco
Hands up on the dance floor, okay let's go

[Chorus]</pre>
