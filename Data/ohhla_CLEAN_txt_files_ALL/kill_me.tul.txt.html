Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm like a rebel, I can't seem to stop
Who am I kidding? Bitch, I am on top
Parted buds in my flashing cameras, give me a shot
Seven days a week and the party goes on

Making great marching angers
Can't come through to make it in though
You can taste my flavor
Of my worse behavior

Fortune teller predicted
My career gon bewicked
But my love life ain't shit, cheers
Let's drink to it

I've been here before
And I know that I'll be back for more
I'm just living my life
And I hope it don't kill me tonight night night
I hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I'm just living my life
Hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I hope it don't kill me

How did I get here? I'm out of control
Out every night, I miss taking it slow
Drinking like a fish til I'm feeling sick, cleansing my soul
It's only Monday, I'm already gone
Driving, head high the window
Pon demise down the main road

House in store for the rebel
I don't even need my bloke

Fortune teller predicted
My career gon bewicked
But my love life ain't shit, cheers
Let's drink to it

I've been here before
And I know that I'll be back for more
I'm just living my life
And I hope it don't kill me tonight night night
I hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I'm just living my life
Hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I hope it don't kill me

Thank God thank God thank God...

It started to make me feel much better somehow
I'm starting to feel like nothing matters right now

I've been here before
And I know that I'll be back for more
I'm just living my life
And I hope it don't kill me tonight night night
I hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I'm just living my life
Hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I hope it don't kill me
I hope it don't kill me tonight night night
I hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I'm just living my life
Hope it don't kill me tonight, no
I hope it don't kill me tonight

Thank God thank God thank God... (I hope it don't kill me)
Thank God thank God thank God...</pre>
