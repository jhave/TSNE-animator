[Intro: Kanye West] + (AutoTuned vocals)
Yeah, uh (sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
Me and the RZA connect (breeze driftin on by)
Yeah, me and the RZA connect (breeze driftin on by)
Uhh... (it's a new life for me)
(For me, for me... oooh, oooh)
Uh (And I'm feelin good) Yeah, uhh

[Kanye West]
And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit the strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

[Chorus: AutoTuned vocals] + (Jay-Z)
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin on by
Breeze driftin on by
It's a new life for me
(Me and the RZA connect) For me, for me
(Me and the RZA connect) Oooh, oooh
And I'm feelin good (Yeah)

[Jay-Z]
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin ya
Sins of a father make yo' life, ten times harder
I just wanna take you to a barber
Bondin on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me twenty-six years to find my path
My only job is cuttin the time in half
So at thirteen we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

[Chorus: AutoTuned]
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
Breeze driftin on by
Breeze driftin on by
It's a new life for me
For me, for me
Oooh, oooh
And I'm feelin good

[Outro: no longer AutoTuned]
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin on by, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin on by, you know how I feel
It's a new life for me
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Oooh, oooh
And I'm feelin
Birds flyin high, you know how I feel</pre>
