[A.G.]
Uhh, uhh
I know, I mean
I be tellin them niggaz man
The niggaz, the bitches
I even be talkin to the kids man
I'm just tryin to let them know

I let 'em know about the crime side, the robberies, the drivebys
Puffin on lye lye, actin like wiseguys
'Til you see your man up in the coffin
Nah he ain't comin back cousin we lost him
These streets will eat your soul, spit out your flesh
Try to burn you alive like David Koresh
But this is worse than Waco, Tex'
This the concrete jungle, and ain't nobody humble
And everybody hustle, but ain't nobody leavin
It's hell here, we live and dwell here
Hell yeah we transport coke, to buy some dope
And more drugs, now we pumpin X in the club
Bet, the nigga that sold that crack just bought some weed
And the nigga that sold that weed just bought some liqs
And the liquor man, he fiend for nicotine
The cigarette man is cashin in on the bigger dream

[Chorus] - recorded too low to decipher, especially with all the ad libs

[A.G.]
We let 'em know about the snakes in the grass, the crabs on your team
Scheme on your fall, like your enemy
These streets will hurt your pride, break up your home
Have you murder your man and discuss it on the phone - huh?
And what I heard he did it just to get known but
Ain't nobody famous, everybody anger us
Kids even carry twigs, chicks holdin bangers
Associate with stranger, fall in love with danger
So we learn to be a menace here
My little man was slugged when he was 8, woulda been 10 this year
Retaliation that's a fact, payback's a bitch
So is her sister and brother, Nina and Mac
So forth and so on, it's like a cycle that go on
We struggle daily to hold on but we hold on huh
We so strong but we born in the struggle
So my heart is with the sisters and my niggaz in the struggle

[Chorus]

BITCHES~!!!</pre>
