[Teairra Mari]
LL, uhh, Teairra Mari

[LL Cool J]
You seem like the type that wanna do a couple things
When I look in your eyes I can tell you ready to swing

[Teairra Mari]
Slow down baby, I'm way more than a fling
And I'm up on the game that you O.G.'s brings

[LL] + (T.M.)
Damn it's like that, chronological attacks?
You talkin real greasy, easy, that's a trap
(You need to fall back) What'chu sayin, I'ma rap?
(Yeah right I ain't no trick, I ain't with all that)
Now see, you talkin real bold, your vibes is real cold
You better smarten up, slide on in the Rolls

[Teairra Mari]
I'm not the next chick, you can hit the exit
Everything you sayin is just what I expected

[LL]
Hearts I've rejected many more than you've collected
Life is a movie I'm just tryin to direct it
You know like I know, you would wanna stay connected
Hip you to the rules of the game, shorty check it

[Chorus: LL] + (Teairra Mari)
The chain on my neck (preserve the sexy)
The O's in the check (preserve the sexy)
The crib and the whips (preserve the sexy)
Cash, the chips (preserve the sexy)
The honey on my arm (preserve the sexy)
The ice in my charm (preserve the sexy)
Teairra Mari (preserve the sexy)
It's your man L on this beat (preserve the sexy)

[LL] + (Teairra Mari)
You really should let me, keep you in Giuseppi's
Frankie V's, H. Findel, Chanel, this is L
(You doin a lot of frontin) But that ain't hard to tell
(You tryin to flip me) Nah B (this I see)
Uh-huh, we'll see, spend a little time with me
By the time I make my move you be sayin finally
(Ain't no moves to be made) Too many games get played
(Too many chickens gettin laid and watch they reputations fade)
Where you from? (Detroit) What that mean? (I'm on point)
Relax, we talkin, don't get your drawers out of joint
I wanna see you smile, elevate your lifestyle
Cop a yacht, hit the South of France (not a chance)
Keep your little advance, this one's on me
And the chef's on board, you can eat for free

[Teairra Mari]
Slow down sweetie, my waist is 24
I'm far from greedy (you're gonna love it, believe me)

[Chorus]

[LL]
Cats sippin venom and spillin it on my linen
My baby smooth leather is softer than most women
Everything is crisp from my cuff to my trimming
Words can't describe all the garments that I been in

[Teairra Mari]
I been had Cartier, switch whips every play
My little Jack Rusell know how to hustle
I stay with canaries on, platinum on every song
Hate it or love it, then respect how I does it

[LL] + (Teairra Mari)
Uhh, well I'm not dem, that's how I got gems
Cost a quarter million dollars for them like shiny rims
Understand me slim, this how the game begin
If he was me then he'd do the same to him
But L's the real deal, so tell me what you feel
Tell me one of your secrets, I'll keep my lips sealed
(That's for me to know and you to find out)
Long as we both know what we talkin 'bout, cool

[Chorus]

[LL] + (T.M.)
What'chu wanna do? (Preserve the sexy) {*repeat to fade*}</pre>
