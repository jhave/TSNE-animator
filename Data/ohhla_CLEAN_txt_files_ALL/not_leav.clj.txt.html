Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Farmer's Boulevard

[Verse 1]
I'll be by your side when the chips are down
I know you had some problems but I'm here now
You'll never be alone long as I'm around
Good hearts don't belong in the lost and found
So I kick up the pieces, erase your frown
And I show my true colors when we paint the town
I hate to hear you cry, I don't like the sound
So my love is turned up, sheets get turned down
I know it hurts now, the drama's the worst now
It's forth in a hundred but love's a first down
A quarterback to come back right now
When a hail Mary works the world, it's like wow
You down for the count, I ain't having it baby
They can all go to hell, I know they callin me crazy
But you're my sunshine when the world gets shady
A toast to the first lady

[Chorus]
You shouldn't be (you shouldn't be alone) alone (nah)
I'm not leaving you tonight
Love you know, I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight
(Fits in the tantrums ha?)
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you tonight
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you, I'm not leaving you tonight

Farmer's Boulevard

[Verse 2]
Turn yo back on it and the sun still shines
Grapes get old and they turn into wine
The deeper the roots, the stronger the vines
These lines on my face just a sign of the times
You could cry on my shoulder if you're inclined
I used to be a Casanova in the lunch room line
That is more important things occupying my mind
Like being there for you, breathing the air for you
Keep trust false and truth to dare for you
The weight of the world I'm prepared to bear for you
The haters get cynical and call you spoiled
Not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
The numerous pit falls, the tussle and the toil
The farmer still want me to put seeds in the soil
And here comes the harvest, this part's the hardest
I'm still here in darkness

[Chorus]
You shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone
I'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)
Love you know, I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight
(Nah nah)
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you tonight
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you, I'm not leaving you tonight

[Bridge]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call

[Chorus]
You shouldn't be (I'm still here, baby) alone
I'm not leaving you tonight (And you shouldn't be alone)
Love you know, I'm right here
I'm not leaving you tonight
(Nah nah)
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you tonight
Go away, baby
I'm not leaving you, I'm not leaving you tonight
