[Intro: Excerpt from an interview with Super Cat]
It's di heartbeat of di people, di ghetto people
And when I say ghetto people di people who cannot afford to go to di big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they cant afford cable
Some of dem can't afford a radio, so di only ting they can listen to is di music
People from di ghetto, people from di projects, street people
Heartical ghetto yutes who know what it is to sing about sufferin and reality.......

[Sample from Super Cat]:
New york girls dem a mad ova we!!! New york girls dem a mad ova we!!! 
New york girls dem a mad ova we!!! New york girls dem a mad ova we!!! 

[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat] (Nas)
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!)
New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!)

[Verse One: Nas]
Smokin the escobano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don't catch a hamo, gross and I net
Simultaneously makin the crime higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me
Fuck sadness, has this been you, havin this lavish
Habitual happiness that mean you wouldn't look back
Would you would have sex on, condominium roof decks 
So anyone moves next, I hit you with two tech's
Rock the Roberto Cavalli no show no Convertible Masi
My columbiano mami ridin beside me
Every tat mean somethin that's my word on my body
I have to lean somethin with that Moshberg shotty 
My niggas is ig'nant, put led in your pig meat
Just 'cause y'all was mad of all the years I was gettin it
In 9-7 the six, 9-8 the Bentley
And now it's the ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but...

[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat] (Nas)
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City 
New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!)

[Verse Two: Nas]
Army jacket swag army jacket green and black
With the square pocket that snaps, where the gas at
Pass that not you, you hold cracks in your asscrack
I never did that, my socks where my stash was at
Yo! I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cuttin school where 'Preme Team and Fat Cat was at
Feature not crystal clear yet back a rat
Now I'm the one who's reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers, surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out their jeans
Twenty years in this game lookin seventeen
I don't need no codeine, pro, meth or Z
I just blow green pick which bitch to blow the king
Although he's on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
RRRRRAHHHHH!!!

[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat] (Nas)
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City 
New York City-City, New York City-City (YEAH!) (YEAH!)

[Verse Three: Nas]
New York is like a island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens
It's all about survivin, same old two step
Try to stay alive and, they be out robbin
I been out rhymin, since born knowledge
Like Prophet Muhammed said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than a blood of a mortar, so I'm a
Keep it on 'til I see a bilion dollars
Keep your friends close and your, enemies closer
Love model chocha, mami pop it like she 'posed to
Eyes red shot, like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, indonesia dozer
Mini me's you can hold up, before you end up wet up from my soldier
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the don Super Cat the Don Dada, understood

[Chorus: Sample from Super Cat] (Nas)
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don
Nas di don Nas di don Nas di don Nas
Inna New York City-City, New York City-City 
New York............... </pre>
