What's up man?
These Hot Boy$ back at it again, ya heard me?
Oh and it's Guerilla Warfare time
We got these ol' bitch ass niggaz scared
Look here

Luxury cars on chrome, I play that
Five figure bonds on charges, I'd paid that
Ounces of coke at a young age, look I weighed that
My click done blewed up you know haters, they hate that
Come around me with a bad bitch, you know I'mma take that
Put a chopper in my hand, and watch how quick I sprayed that
Drop a track watch how quick I go and lace that
Cash Money I don't think y'all niggaz could really faze that
Beef with me, I don't think you ready to face that
Put money in front of me and watch how quick I chase that
Nigga give me the weed and I'm ready to blaze that
I'mma man and if its my charge, I gotta take that
Mouth off yo brains, and I'mma have to waste that
K bullets burn, you talk and watch you taste that
I'm so large, I gotta phone, the fedz can't trace that
You gotta respect I'mma fool, how you love that
