Chorus :
Don't be no punk, grab yo cup and fill it up
I'm almost drunk and you know I wanna fuck
Don't be no punk, grab yo cup and fill it up
I'm almost drunk and you know I wanna fuck

[Mac Dre]
Game drank candlelight
Baby need to take a break from a man tonight
She gon hit dem E she gon see
How we gonna get down on the Ecstasy
Then laugh off one and a half
Rapes getting faced in ma bubble bath
She make a nigga laugh the way she fall
She can't take it all is her only flaw
Then a ball all down the hall
She nibbin on my ear while I pound the wall
12 15's three o'clock I get every damn thing but eat the cock
Lingerie Tangaray baby are you sure you can hang with Dre
I got a lot to feel but before I did lets pop another pill

Chorus :
Don't be no punk, grab yo cup and fill it up
I'm almost drunk and you know I wanna fuck
Don't be no punk, grab yo cup and fill it up
I'm almost drunk and you know I wanna fuck

[Mac Dre]
