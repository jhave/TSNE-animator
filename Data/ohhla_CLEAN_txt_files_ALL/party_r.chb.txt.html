Get up

[Verse 1]

Ten ???? for admition what are you drugin'
For clubbin' you want a house party called ?hundred?
On a long day joint I arrive at twelve
The crowd will yell then ring my bell
People this is no treat em right type sequel
But we gonna give it to those who use a deedle
Not the drug one, but the Technic 12 one
Keep it cleen the LP, my realy ?soul soft?
From the 54 days, Madona days
The feever, the ?Rochie?, the Roseland ?Grates?
Wether you chillin', raw ???? or housin'
Gettin in here, the scene where rap arousin
Rap records chartin, major labels barkin
Hearts heartin when they ? ?
The goove, the flow, the women was so tight (party right)
Ha-haa party right

[Chorus]

Shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up

[Verse 2]

It's been a dacade since the club seen straight
It's friday night and kids just got paid
That was the lyrics and that was the fraze
The Latin Quater was more than a faze
Hard rocks and the girls are all thorough
Raw core, it's all about the borough
And ridein' for 9 to 5 Long Island
Keepin awake at the wheel, (stuckin/suckin) ??
Yes the ???? did showin up just flesh
No crack, no coke or budah ses
On the mic was the best of the best
The best of that best all had success
I'm the bass drum you is the kick like ?
Front all night with the same Heineken
If the beat got h??? and you had to fight
It was head up all night
You done right

[Chorus]

Shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up

[Verse 3]

The focus, the ???? you must zoom the path
Acknowledge a cat the brothers on Troy Ave
As for rob, scheme ?? ? me
The bond that you've lovin I hope we stay free
Friends to the end and our knees won't bend
I wrote my first skit with my man Dave With
And I'm off to the heavens
We gotta roll 10 deep cause kids get ill after eleven
He's lonley, he's dry let's handle our beef
Blood and teath will decorate the street
Peace to my man Donie Barel and his mom
I know you in a better place tranquil and calm
Peace to Little Red with the ? from the one
198 now where we takin it from
Brooklyn you get your ? tookin
If the party was cookin, yeah

[Chorus]

Shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up

[Verse 4]

It's all about our ? check the reverb is Digitech
I got my flavors in your ear and (DOC/DLC) is a deck
You better peep your goin up shits creep
Every week this style is too simple high
Sesamy-What? Street
Big burder in your verb
Go ???? drive a Range Rover
Your PBS played back shit you over
My phonic's type sonc jump up with bionic slang
Push 'em pain paths and over boodah bang-bang

[Chorus]

Shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up tonight ooo-ooooh
Show you how to party right
Shake it up, shake it up</pre>
