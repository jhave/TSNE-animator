[Intro]
{*crowd cheering*}
Oooh!
Oooh!
Ooooooooooh, oooh! (LET'S GO~!)

[Prevail]
Prevail the merciless mercenaries of militance
No resemblance to any other assembly's heritage
Despair will be the downfall of arrogance
Repairs will be necessary too much heavy damage, counter intelligence
Spy craft flies past, P's the aviator
Resuscitation reincarnation I'm the reanimator
Greater mind power than Einstein
Genius and insanity, we walkin that fine line
Talkin 'bout prime time exposure, face remains poker
Overload the road to stardom like exploding supernovas
Maintain composure low visibility violent turbulence
You hear the voice of a surgeon and wake up in an ambulance
You're out of your element, a graveyard of skeletons
Elephants in a caravan cross the mountain like Hannibal
Light the firing wicks, make the air thick with cannonballs
Nothin that I can't resolve, chemicals meant to dissolve

[Mad Child]
(LET'S GO~!) Greed, pain and torture
Locked inside my room, I'm an insane sorcerer
("You're mad!") What I'm saying, Shane's forceful
You don't want to fuck with a vain Cain Korso
War master on a chosen path
You don't wanna laugh at the sociopath
Don't try to act hardcore, just stay soft
A unchained pitbull'll rip your face off
Backpack with a axe and a chainsaw
Madchild's back, I'ma grab what I came for
Masked bandit, skin been branded {*gunshots*}
Smoke clears I'm the last man standing
God blessed me with a gift, I'm so grateful
Bent out of shape but I still stay faithful
Purified poison, strength of gorilla
Mentally killer, meant to be iller (LET'S GO~!)
