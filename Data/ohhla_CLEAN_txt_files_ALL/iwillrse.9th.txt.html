[Intro: 9th Prince]
Yeah, 9th Prince, BP

[9th Prince]
Yo, I was locked up for one thousand days
In the yard blowing haze, life was like a maze
Niggas walk through with a twelve gauge of rage
Turn the front page, it's me with an AK
Summer time, walking with twin nines
When I rhyme, I blow like land mines
This ain't a Broadway play, shit is rough
Like the hallways of raw way, verbally your ass get laid
Niggas out of bounds on my stomping grounds
The power of the trey pound, is loud like a thunder sound
Bitch niggas is my target, yeah, and I take no bargains
I leave niggas on the 'trailblaze' like Portland, warlord sportsman
Bitches come in the clubs with minks on, hopping out of Honda Accords
What type of shit is that for a broad, fake stink ass whores
Things covered with swords
Yo, 9th about to hit that, yo, yo, chill whoad'

[Interlude: Anti-Social speaking in Urdu (9th Prince)]
	Translation:
9th Prince has come home, money is ours in 2009
Don't come in our way, fuckers, these streets are ours, money runs this world
(Yeah, word up, 9th Prince is back, muthafuckas
Ya'll niggas get a hold of yourselves, about to blow)

[9th Prince]
Aiyo, Killarmy for life, even after death, peppermint breath
While I'm shaking your right hand, I'll shoot you with my left
The 9th Prism, yeah, I shine like a ray of light through the Iron Mic
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No, it's me, high as a fucking kite
Catch me in the 40 Deuce, sipping on Hennessey and juice
I had to smack this 'cat in the hat', looking like Dr. Seuss
The Great Adventures of the Granddaddy Flow, watch me blow like a snow blizzard
Smart as a computer wizard, plus exquisite
And my girl got an ass like Deelishis
I 'rock boats' like Aaliyah, twin desert eagles
I call 'em Tamera and Tia
Granddaddy Flow sneakers, yeah, low dark Caesar
Vagina pleaser, hit her from the back then skeet all over
Playboy Mansion, in the back of the Range Rover
True rap genius, menage a trois with Serena and Venus
Smack your girl in the face with my daddy long penis

[Chorus: Thea Van Seijen]
I'm on the rise, on the rise
I'm on the rise, on the rise
You seem to challenge me
And there is so much that you don't know about me
I'm on the rise, on the rise
I'm on the rise, on the rise

[RZA]
They smile in your face, now with trials on your case
On the prowl is the jake, the wise owl and the snake
Loose lip and sink ships, force fingers to grab clips
Bullets jump in all direction, you can't trust it
Total devastation, now face the separation of your head
From your shoulder, there's no reperations
Zig Zag Zilla came, voice blow like a hurricane
Don't love a ho, but I'm in love with Mary Jane
Or marijuana, you run like Sarah Connor
Pursued by the Terminator, carrying a pair of bombers
Grenades and C-4, head for the detour
Be picking real simple, Simons sails from the seashore
Bob Digital, God squad is lyrical
See the Digi mask on your iPod Video
I'm on the rise, like ninety quarter dies
Sling a thousand crack, found the cause in arms and pots
In N.Y. City where it's gritty and groggy
We still get that Cash Rule, windy or foggy
Snowy or breezy, for me it's so easy
To move on up like George and Weezie
Just looking out of my window, watching them ask for dough
Can It Be All So Simple, I'm getting paid for my flow

[Chorus] </pre>
