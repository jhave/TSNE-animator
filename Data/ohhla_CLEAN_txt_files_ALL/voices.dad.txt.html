[Puffy]
Sometimes I don't think you motherfuckers 
Understand where I'm coming from
Where I'm tryin' to get to
Sometimes I hear voices
I can't see it, can you see it?
Turn the lights on
Check this out

Make money's the motto, staying desparados
New chance of hitting the lotto
Let's take it to the neck wit this bottle
Get in the Eldorado
And break from this bitch at full throttle
You like fuckin' fashion models? 
That only waddle with cats that flash stacks
Or squabble with niggas that flash gats
Then squirt hot pellets out their nozzles
And leave a nigga hurting on the block 
Sounding like when you gargle
Them hero niggas that plot
Them zero niggas get got 
And never get a chance to bust shot
Curled up in a knot then forgot on the spot
Then I'm on the run wit a gun smoking hot
All around the world's where I go
Places that only I know
Goodfella not gunshotto
And I'm tellin' niggas, make money's the motto
Fuck the niggas that squable 
And I hit them back and fourteen hollow, take that

1 -	[Carl Thomas]
	I hear voices inside
	And I see crime, don't die
	And I need changes 
	Oh, please, please, please
	Don't go Don't go

Above while:
[Puffy]
I'm just trying to get my money, right
Don't fuck wit my money
I won't fuck wit your money
If you fuck with my money
I make you like one of them presidents
Feel me?

Representing my money for the love of my money
I leave a man stiffer than the mummy
Now don't miss it, if I catch them coming for me 
When I try to tell a dummy
You took it like I was saying something funny
Took it like my word wasn't shit, like I wasn't legit' 
What occurs is gonna be hard to forget 
That's something I'll never permit
When I feel my eye twitch things happen 
And my voice start speaking a diffrent pitch
Trying to keep things low-low
They don't really know, though
Bad Boy the motherfuckin' logo
Stay on your toes 
They shouldn't get it mistaken
Hope they don't think I'm faking
Mess around and get thier life taken and shaken
You know the rule of thumb be 
Don't try to take nothing from me
I rule it wit a street stay slummy
Make money's the motto, fuck the niggas that squabble
I know I might be hard for you to swallow
Ya feel me?

Repeat 1 while:
[Puffy]
Sometimes I just feel like y'all don't understand
Where I'm coming from, where I'm trying to get to
Shit is really deep, my shit is deep

They don't have a direct understanding of me
Fuck what they planning for me
I just won't accept the bullshit that they handing me
Still standing after the trouble remains, it's me
If you trying to make it clear and explaining to me
And all that negative shit pertaining to me
What ya think I claiming to be
A straight heart staying with me 
I can tell it's about to go down
I told them, slow down before I send the low down
And skip out of town
And I don't wanna but I'll do it if I gotta
The situation is serious and getting hotter
You know what they say about those that slow on the trigger
Less then a second too late and you one dead nigga
So I take aim and I squeaze and deliver
Like I told them, just to let him know 'til' he figures out 
It's make money's the motto
Something ya'll should follow
And I don't got no time for the squabble
Ya feel me?

Repeat 1 until fade while:
[Puffy]
Sometimes you just get tired of shit
Sometimes you just get fed up
Don't hate me, hate yourself, motherfuckers
Don't hate me,  hate yourself
Cause I ain't never gonna stop
I ain't never gonna stop
I'll make you feel me forever
And ever and ever and ever
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it's gonna be</pre>
