It's kind of dark in here, I can't see you, ha
It's kind of dark in here, haha, freaky, freaky, I can't see you
It's kind of dark in here, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I can't see you, freaky
It's kind of dark in here, freaky, freaky, freaky, aha, I can't see you

	[Timbaland]
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really, really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl

	[Nelly Furtado]
It's gettin so lonely inside this bed
To know if I should lick my wounds or say woe is me instead
There's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone
After midnight (ooh) morning will come
&amp; the day will see if you will get some

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
I looked above the other day (turn off the lights girl)
Cos I think I'm good and ready for a change (turn off the lights girl)
I live my life by the moon, by the moon (turn off the lights girl)
If it's high play it low if it's harvest go slow and if it's full then go
After midnight (ooh) morning will come
&amp; the day will see if you're gonna get some

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
They say that girl you know she act too tough, tough, tough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so rough, rough, rough
Well still I turn off the light, turn off the light
And I say follow me, follow me, follow me, down, down, down, down
Till you see all my dreams (turn off the lights girl)
Not everything in this magical world is quite what it seems (turn off the lights girl)

	[Nelly Furtado] (Timbaland)
I'm searching for things that I just cannot see (turn off the lights girl)
Why don't you don't you don't you come and be with me
I pretend to be cool with me, wanna to believe
That I can do it on my own without my heart on my sleeve
I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find
It's all in me, can't you see, why can't you, why can't you see it's all in me, yeah

	[Ms. Jade]
I've been through many things
I've seen a lot of faces
A lot of you bet they peep begged up by many cases
It ain't my skin it's my will I'm a win
Right a will till the end
I don't brake fo' the bend
Then again, y'all done begged born shooters
In the streets like scooters, to my shakers and movers
It's looking for the green
Everything ain't what it seems
A different scene lanes leaving em with a VA lean
It ain't no magic we living up in the real world
Real deal represent for my real girls
I know it's lonely at the top and I might fall
As for now, follow the rules and turn them lights off

	[Timbaland]
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl
I really really want you to see me
So baby don't turn off the lights girl

	[Nelly Furtado]
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light
Turn off the light, turn off the light</pre>
