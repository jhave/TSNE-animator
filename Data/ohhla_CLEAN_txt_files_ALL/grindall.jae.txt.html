Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I got my own wave no need to ride joes
I'm five ten but my money bout 5-4
Pull up on the set fresh from the lock boy
How bout now hate kill yourself suicide doors
My bitch bad but the calm in bed
I come through white coast looking like casper
While I'm seeing the AKA the only thing that matters
We coby in the four tiger and the master
Shout out the nigga in simply 'cause she the baddest
Shout out being rumples for stealing my air lips
Leg out, I'm a bring it back up town
With them fly girls let me 'cause I'm so up town
Yeah she gotta ask like a full moon
And some say for her to walk in the full room nigga
Call me jay, call me millz, might as well call me bufallo
'Cause I'm bout my mother fuckin bills what it is

Grind all day, party all night
Grind-grind all day, party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night

Man man is a no-no, you already know though
Puffing all loud answers that's the matter a nigga polo
Only lighting every day, every day, every day
Like we're willin up some party like in 1968
Lighted up in June and we gone till November
Diamonds like the guff boy like... consider
These niggas ain't hot they could be my dinner
Shoot this ass back to when niggas was riding on spinners
And I go ahead, let em spin
Fuck them losers man I came here to win
Tell I wait to spark my bottles again
Bad rare bone I'm bout to fuck her and her friend
Let's begin, what it is, said I'm out of control
This whole party is out of control
Flow so straight dope like I duck curk cope
Out as grieving got my shit right about of his nose
Party all night

Grind all day, party all night
Grind-grind all day, party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night

I'm out of this world like I'm flying source
And my own rock cause nurture
Lord homie I'm a world wide scormure
Made of new joker, mother fuck you and whoever that endorsed you
You don't want that walk, we run through you niggas on my pressure
All that little nigga mad huh
Can't get right with you..
How dare you, but that bitches don't hear you
And besides that boy, be careful
'Cause I hunt you down make you outfit and will you
These little niggas don't get it
My flow been hanable just wasn't admit it
Hit your body twice with that get pack, get pack
Double up, double up, that's a give pack, leave em give pack

Grind all day, party all night
Grind all day, party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind all day, party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night
Grind-grind-grind all day, party-party-party all night</pre>
