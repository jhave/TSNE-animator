[Intro: Jay Love]
Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs

[Chorus]
I if I told you I love you
would you get on all four for me?
would you tell your little boyfriend
you're coming on tour with me?
(Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs)

[Verse 1]
Is it your upperhead or is it the lower?
I've been wondering if you've cut your grass short when you give it the {?}
And since I was hoping that your head would visit some more
I keep my rain forest clear if you're kissing the boa
I'm in a position to show ya, it's mad important
What a cat just sportin, keep your ass for shorting
You don't want to call about her, I'm in the lab recording
And spitting a hairball out like a cat that's coughin
I've seen enough nights between the up-rights
To know how to feed the lovelife to keep your muf tight
I want to see a cut like your in the marine court
Or a burf so shiny like you're swim for a team-sport
Of course your lover means more
And it's enough that I don't have to change exsistent puff
But I'll fix it up a bit....with the bigger than just a scissor-cut
{???} less clip of us
This isn't just to keep the yatch in between your dock
I'm thinking outside girl, I'm not just a bee in a box
You want me to treat your crouch?
Like a pair of lips, what makes you think I wanna share a kiss? {?}

I need a clean cut when you're with me

[Chorus]
I if I told you I love you
would you get on all four for me?
would you tell your little boyfriend
you're coming on tour with me?
(Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs)

Yo tell 'em Jay

[Verse 2]
First time I've seen her was the day she was hired
Digits exchanged before the day I was fired
Sexual harashment, she {???}
She kept play with her scurf, rasing it higer
Can't tame my disare, she had flame to the fire
Girl, I wanna see how you shave your vagina
I give a good {??} I'm a self-made designer
Plus I eat out, I ain't talking about the dinner
I opened up the window slow, for the wind to blow
And lift up her scurf like Marylin Monrouge
Well I never let her go until we finally bin
In a hotel or motel or holiday inn
well, it's gotta be a sin the way she walks around
The {?} now, the only girl that's stalking town
I'm feeling awkward, the restraining order is out
Just because she got a dim' back in lost and found
I toss around the idea of a heavely puss
I hope she don't have a throwback seventy's bush
She probably got a hip of moustache, snip and snatch
In a land of strip over Brazilian wack

I need a clean cut when you're with me

[Chorus]
I if I told you I love you
would you get on all four for me?
would you tell your little boyfriend
you're coming on tour with me?
(Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs)

[Verse 3]
If I tell you that I love you would you dance for me?
If I tell you that I want you, you're my fantasy?
I've been staring at your ass, can it last I see?
If I tell you that I need you like the air I breathe?
If I tell you that I've never felt this way before?
Will you tell your boyfriend that you wip me on tour?
Would you {?} me with brains, dress if it gains
have sex in the rain, 'till the questions remains? ('till the questions remains)

[Chorus]
I if I told you I love you
would you get on all four for me?
would you tell your little boyfriend
you're coming on tour with me?
(Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs)</pre>
