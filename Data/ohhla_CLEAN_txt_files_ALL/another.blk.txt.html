[Talib Kweli]
We fantastic, flippin on tracks like gymnastics
Small brats get they ass kicked, me and Mos smash it
Top gun like what comes after the, fist rockin' knife
Check the keys that get played on the roads of life
Yo the rhyme is so heavy like a load of my chest
Travel on these mc's, leave 'em broken like house pets
Priceless like the streets I'm on, my word is born
You like Paula Abdul-ka-ka compared to Sarah Born?
Sayin, what did I do to be so black and blue
Mc's sayin damn what got it goin after you
Slam my microphone and do just what I have to do
Aiyyo, I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through
You know I'd like to stop and chat but I'm just passing through

[Mos Def]
I'm on my way back to Louis Avenue
Inside Brooklyn the b-boy capital, lot of cats travel to black eratical
Say, my response is invatically yes
We invatically fresh, you dramatically stressed
These mc's proceed to cease the presidential palace
And burn Babylon like a ?
Strive to maintain balance
With the God given talent
Articulate the article, eliminate the fossical
Black Star Line shine remarkable, they style ain't even talkable
These socalled criminals is fictional they make the party turn miserable
We document the memorable
Then break 'em up like syllables
Straight down to earth like minerals
Your style is foul like down? chemicals
We five-dimensional, audio, visual, physical, spiritual, lyrical
Another world

Another world, y'all
We transmit another world
Another World, y'all
We transmit another world
Another World, y'all
We transmit another world
Black Star 'bout to shine from what

[Talib Kweli]
Yo Mos, ain't it a shame how these people treating life like a game
Ain't gonna give you no fame by callin out your name
Just explain how I do it and, lead by example
Stay away from repetition don't wanna sound like no sample
You can't handle this Messiah
My shit is classical we get bug' like Umfufu, "You treat me like animal!"
Just 'cus you got money, don't mean you made it
Just 'cus you make it don't give you the right to be a ?
Matter fact stay out my face
I can't take it like them stupid big horse bills
Your defense is nill, my chatter, shatter your forcefield
Kweli and Mos Definition with more lines then a petition
Yo my mission is to break shit in half, like intermission
Then get missin' with Hi-Tech or anyone like that
Costin' one million pounds 'cus it sound so fat
Lay you flat like the carpet
Take the tobacco out my spliff before you spark it
The only tye I rock is chocolate
Makin profits like Spacely Sprockets, you can't stop it
The topic, we always gonna be black like markets
From the underground, look around and tell me what you see
Another picture painted perfectly by yours truly

Another world, y'all
Say what, another world
Another world, y'all
Say what, another world
Travellin' through, time and space
On the the Black Star galactica
Yo, another world
'nother 'nother, 'nother, 'nother, 'nother world

[Mos Def]
Never never never soap opera
Whether you, indian, dominican, jamaican or bolivian
No matter what disc recorder or part of town you livin' in
I recommend you listenin' to these distinguished gentlemen
Who take the proper measurement to represent
The solo's ? chrome is known to built on
Gleam on the measurement
Master mc carpentry
Talib kwa, the Kweli in quality
Put the groundation down properly
You can't trespass the property
Ain't takin' or breakin', robbery
Got the whole owner blast-back policy
Follow me, descendant of the grand master armery
Where cats rock the Wallabe and Kangols, mc's exchange flows
The same goes on, they'll be here when we gone
Hope they heart stay strong for
The other world

The other world y'all
Say what, another world
Another, 'nother 'nother 'nother
Say what, another world...
'nother 'nother 'nother....</pre>
