[Carl Thomas]
I was born by the river.. in a little tent
No just like that river I've.. been running ever since
It's been a long.. a long time coming
but I knowowwwww.. a change gon' come
Oh yes it will..
It's been tooooooo hard living
but I'm afraid to die..
Cause I don't know what's up there, beyond the sky
It's been a long tiiiime.. a long time coming
but I knowowwwww.. a change gon' come
Oh yes it will..
And I go.. to my brother (yes I do)
And say, "Brother - help me please" (well well)
But he winds up, knocking me..
I got on my knees, oahhhoooohhhhh
There's been times, that I thought
I wouldn't last too long..
[C] Capone-N-Noreaga
.. but I think I'm able
[C] Son we gotta do this
.. to carry on..
It's been a long..
[C] It's been a long time coming
    It's been a long time since you heard Capone-N-Noreaga right?
a long time coming, but I knowowowww..
[C] It's like you my nigga though
A change gon' come..
[C] We starved for too long baby
Oh yes it will..
[C] Mami and Mambo..</pre>
