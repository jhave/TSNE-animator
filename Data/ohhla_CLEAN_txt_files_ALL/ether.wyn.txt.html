Call me bad Wayne and I'm like Max Payne
The sickest shit to hit since anthrax came
I leave you with a tampax frame all bloody
Just stand back man y'all dont want it
But damn that man I come thru and do my Grand Theft thang
My cran-ap tan cap slant back thang
My hustle game up plus my flow that ugly
Just call me Mitchell and Ness I got throwback money
I got that um all good if its no crack money
I got that hes all good he dont need to show that money
I blow that money cause I know that money
Hit the club and wild out and go and throw that money
If that bitch on 21's then you know thats money
I'm a pimp I'm bout to perm it out and bullrush somthin
You a snitch you probably hit the court and burn dude
Thats that Weezy the shit that make yo soul burn slow
