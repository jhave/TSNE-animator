Song:   Sunny Day
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: (2x)]
What's a sunny day without you
Just another 24 that passes by

As I sit upon the grass in the shade
I remains on what we had the romance
That's we shared strolling through the park
Two people in love walking hand in hand
But now that your gone I feel so alone
All I do is think of you till the
Day you return it doesn't mean a thing

[Chorus x2]

It's funny how you learn from your mistakes
Sometimes we take things for grated
But now that I have a change to make it right
I wanna give you
I wanna give you all my love oh oh

But now (but now)
That your gone (that your gone)
I feel (I feel so alone)
All I do is think of you
Till the day you return
It doesn't mean a thing

[Chorus x4]

What's a sunny day without you [x4]

[Chorus till fade]</pre>
