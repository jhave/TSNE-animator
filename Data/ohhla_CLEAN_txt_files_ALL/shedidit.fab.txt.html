Song:   She Did It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Yeah you got it girl, but what you doing with it
Make it snapback, fuck a fitted
You know I got it, and you can get it
I told her do that thing I like, and she fucking did it
She did it, she did it
She did it, she did it
I told her do that thing I like, and she fucking did it
She did it, she did it
She did it, she did it
I told her do that thing I like, and she fucking did it

[Verse One]
Do what I say, fuck what Simon says
Club Rolex, you know what time it is
Is this the Players Club? Cause shorty fine as Diamond is
Ass fat, hair long as Pocahontas'
My whole circle shining like a diamond Bezz
We making money, them niggaz making promises
They business minded, but they in the wrong line of biz
Cause they busy minding mine instead of minding theirs
I got some medicine that should clear up sinuses
Got some Ciroc, you know what kind it is
She said, "It's yours babe, let's see how mine it is"
Let me test that head out, I wouldn't mind a quiz

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Make it snapback - Mitchell &amp; Ness
I'm telling Khaled when I see him, cause bitch you the best
I get you that fly, I get you that fresh
I buy you some clothes just to get you undressed
I love a girl who down to do all the shit you suggest
Doing that thing that I like ain't gon' get you no less
You a G, but that letter don't fit you the best
Girl you got all them curves, so bitch you an S
Them other niggaz coming 'round don't get you impressed
Them losers looking sad, they gon' get you depressed
You wanna ride, but I can't ride with you unless
You take a nap in my lap, girl get you some rest

[Chorus]</pre>
