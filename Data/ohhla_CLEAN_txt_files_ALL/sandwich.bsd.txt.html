Speaking on sandwiches kinda fickle
She can be white or wheat, or even pumpernickel
She don't even walk around bein discreet uhh
On the contrar(y), she walks around lookin for the meat
Or, lett-uce pray, tomato cheese pickle
Mustard, ketchup, two black olives man
Mayonnaise your hands off of it
Punk, you understand?
I don't think so cause these freaks keep on bothering me
You don't know so cause those hoes keep on pestering me
Something's gotta boil up my bone they won't let me b-ah-be
Huh, yeah
I don't think so cause these freaks keep on bothering me
You don't know so cause those hoes keep on pestering me
Something's gotta boil up my bone they won't let me b-ah-be
Ha-ay, that's why

Once again on guitar, Mark Nash
Dope... period

Girlie, you're treatin me fowl like a rooster
But I Boo-Yaa, gusto me gusta
I'm sick and tired so you fired I don't want you no more
You snore furthermore you're rotten to the core
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
are some of the girls that LL knows from around the way
I know some hoes, that will always give up the play
But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh
to find that cutie with that nice fat booty
so I can do my duty, and she will smile like Tudy
from the Facts of Life that used to be on NBC
However recently you've got to catch the repeats G, uhhh
Back to the issue at hand understand I am a man
who can burn you like a fryin pan, more dangerous than quicksand
Proud to be black, I'm a meal, not a snack
You want to put me on wax?  But that's why

	[Bass-D *singing*]
        I, got a feeling
        I, got a feeling potnah
        I, got a feeling
        That sandwich is gonna turn you out, uhh
        I, got a feeling
        I, got a feeling potnah
        I, got a feeling
        That sandwich is gonna turn you out

[Count Bass-D]
U-ke-le-le baby baby you're a groupie word to Snoopy
I'm delighted and excited to know you would like to do me
It's kind of tempting please don't feel I'm condescending
I'd like to touch you in a place that makes you uncomf-ortable
Uhh, that rapper's full of bull
C'mon with Bass because I've got lots of pull
Don't fabricate, he ain't straight, I'm an is, he's an ain't
I'm full of oil, he is just a waterpaint
Never de too much, never de too much
Never de too much, never de too much, such, and such
type of words bein spoken
When you ride the train you must have a token
Four o'clock in the mornin, I was awoken
and there ain't no jokin, when the pussy hoes are open
The previous rhyme I told him, was stolen
Lick my colon, sell you out like Colin, Powell
Whoahh hahah, like that and
and I rip shit ahhh, rip shit ahhh
Uhh, talk sounds better over beats
Singin don't talk sounds better over beats
Uhh, talk sounds better over beats
Singin don't talk sounds better over beats, ain't that funky?
Talk sounds better over beats
Singin don't talk sounds better over beats, ain't that fly?
Talk sounds better over beats
Singin don't talk sounds better over beats, ain't that fresh?
Uhh, it's like that Count Bass-D and I'm out
UHH!</pre>
