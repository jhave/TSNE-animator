Song:   Depart From Me...
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
You left me so poor, I couldn't pay to play
I filled my head with what I could to make it go away
Tears eventually cake up, inevitable break up
Laying in bed for days and you wake up
I feel the strain, am I sane or am I just not gonna heal?
I just sit sick in the rain and found Agent trying to rebuild
Wanted demented bliss, created something to miss
I know I summoned the bumout but I'm not running from this

[Chorus]
You started shrinking when my head fell apart
You slipped away, next time you see me
You'll know how small you are
And now it's over, over, over
Going over your head
It's really over, over, over
Never hold you again

[Verse 2]
You don't think that I get it, I was the one who let it
Fall apart into pieces, you cut your foot when you jetted
Just swimming around in my head, not slowing down
You said, all you need to say you can share it with the dude in your bed
You did your client career and then you started climbing
I thought it could be forever, not on my record you're dying
I got a lot rest at last, just let the world go past
Just let it go empty, I guess we just ran out of gas

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And I guess I get sold out of what I had
This really wasn't your bag
Some lunatic that reminds you of your dad
I get you were slipping from my grasp, I just didn't get out fast
You were jumping to the future from my past
Flash, you were the one who erased it
I hope my replacement gives me time back I wasted
You knew it was so hard to see my brother dying so pardon me
You just depart from me, you ruined art for me

[Chorus]</pre>
