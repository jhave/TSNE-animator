Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Bridge: Seal]
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (your heart)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me where you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Honestly, I'm afraid to give love
Deep down I'm afraid to be judged
That's why I pull back, don't speak no rap
Put on the beat, man every time we hug
It's deep, I'm afraid of heartbreak so much
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
The thought alone feels like my soul got cut
My heart's wide open, baby show me mercy
Life is a desert and for love I'm thirsty
You lead me to the water, I'm afraid to drink
You hand me a glass, still don't know what to think
Your love is terrifying, I'm standing on the brink
I'm floating in your eyes then I start to sink
Girl, I never knew that I could feel so weak
Flying on a cloud in-between these sheets
I'm one with myself, why do I retreat?
It's a battle just to try to go to sleep

[Bridge: Seal]
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's alright)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

[Chorus: Seal &amp; LL Cool J]
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (yea)
Give it to me
Just give me your heart
Give it to me baby
Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Everybody knows that falling in love's easy, timing out's hard
So I only wasn't really, raise my thoughts as God
It's crazy, I hold you in the highest regard
But us having true love? What's the odds?
That's scary, what if I get hit that hard
So hard I can't get up, heart got lit up
Too weak to move, can't eat, no sit up
Mommy used to say  don't worry, it's just a hiccup
But even she can't help
When your heart's on fire, about to melt
So everything I really feel, I keep it to myself
So I don't end up hurt like everybody else
Took love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf
With the books I never read about pain I never felt
Love is a problem, baby I need help
My card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up

[Bridge: Seal]
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (I swear)
Uh baby
Give me love
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

[Chorus: Seal &amp; LL Cool J]
Give it to me baby (you baby)
Give it to me baby (from you baby)
Give it to me baby (yea)
Give it to me
Just give me your heart
Give it to me baby
Uh baby
Give it to me baby
Uh girl
Give it to me baby
I swear all I need is your love

[Bridge: LL Cool J]
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope your mine
Yea
(I need you to know)
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
When the last chapter's done, I hope your mine
But until that try

[Bridge: Seal]
Give me love
I swear all I need is your heart (that's all I need)
Uh baby (Uh baby)
Give me love (oh love)
Tell me when you need me to stop
I swear all I need is your love

Give it to me baby (your love)
Give it to me baby (just what I need)
Give it to me baby (your love is just what I need)
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (your love, your love, your love)
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (that's what I need)
All I need is your love

Dear diary (dear diary)
I hope she feels the same
I hope she keeps loving me
Keeps loving me as I'm loving
I love er more than ever
I pray our love won't change
Let's go home
Give me love</pre>
