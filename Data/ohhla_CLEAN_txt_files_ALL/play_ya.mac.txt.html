Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh yeah, little old school shit
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky mac I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend but left him home
See I got style, so yes I brag
The things I do just make them mad
Download new kicks to my ipad
Why ya girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fag, this is forever, ladys in love with my agenda
My names something these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, thinking she can keep her secrets
One night only that's how I treat this, sleepin
Bitch please make me some breakfest
And then leave

[2X]
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky mac I don't play no game
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

Ya see I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
Girls odishon to bring them home
See I might chose, so just go with it
Her mom adores me, her dad thinks I'm a nitwit
It don't really matter I'ma have her fall in love
I need my botty brains botty? and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit
Got one night only so make it quick
You see me out, wanna take a pic
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit
I ain't that rich, but I got friends
Make a sandwich, get me fed
Decided right now don't got all night
This the life so play ya cards right

[2X]
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's funky mac I don't play no game
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right</pre>
