[Intro - talking]
Uh ... yeah (yeah)
Uh
Uh (uh), get it movin come on
Get it movin, get it movin, come on (come on)
Uh, keep it movin, come on
Keep it movin, keep it movin, come on
(Woo!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, see the flow is rare
You want to two step to it, go 'head (go 'head)
Ha, Jake One on the track
And cats want to know where I've been at? (been at)
Uh, well listen up my friend
I've been in the lab gettin it in (gettin it in)
If not there, then I'm out gettin trill
In Miami doin it up for Will (yeah)
Or in a mall on a shopping trip
Tryin to add to my stable of kicks (of kicks)
Uh, yeah, see I move that way
I'm in a different hood everyday (uh, come on)
Or you could catch me in the club with Jeff
Nobody do a party quite like us (quite like us, yep)
Uh, or run it down the line
The thing on everybody mind is

[Chorus]
(Where I've been)
Uh, I'm a tell you what it's like
When you livin that hip hop life
(Where I've been)
Uh, and I'm a tell you the deal
What it's like in the life of Skillz
(Where I've been)
Uh, I'm a tell you what it do
Cause I'm sure y'all ain't got no clue
(Where I've been)
Next town, next show
It seem like everybody want to know
(Where I've been)

[Verse 2]
We never movin slow (uh uh)
And I'm sure y'all want to know (want to know)
Cause everywhere I go (uh huh)
Two up, two down and tour (fo sho)
And I'm never chasin hoes
Just out ghostwritin these flows
Or rehearsin all my shows
So I can kick those, ya know? (uh, woo, uh)
I'm in and out of hotels (uh huh)
From L.A. to the ATL (ATL)
On my grind I works it out (what?)
From NY to the dirty south (c'mon, dirty south)
Overseas doin +Take It Back+ (say what?)
It's no tellin where you find me at
Or you can catch me crushin a tour
Fam I don't even sleep no more

[Chorus]

[Break] - 4X - w/ ad libs
I'm gone, I'm gone
Packin my bags, next flight, I'm gone

[Verse 3]
Don't ask where I've been, you can ask where I'm goin
Best believe that I'm somewhere flowin
And I'm (flowin and I'm), doin what I love to do
And when it come out, trust me you'll love it too
So (so), shouts out to my team
The places I've been, the things that I've seen
And it's, quite rare that I get off a plane
And somebody don't know my name (uh, woo, uh)
I'm livin proof for sure 
That if you want it man the world is yours (yours)
So if I ain't in a booth, I'm tearin down a show
There it is, now y'all know

[Chorus]</pre>
