Song:   When I Was a Youngster
Typed by: OHHLA

I can remember that when I was a little youth I
Wanted to fly around the world making a new life
I never thought today, I'd be what I am now

Yo, wanted to be a fireman
Than I lost the desire man
The second I got old enough
To buy myself a cider can
Yeah, I was a smart little kid
That side's departed me since
These days you can catch me
Sitting on the bench in the park with a lager and crisps

Back when I was younger
I wanted to be everything on the planet
Now that I am older
It seems the ambition has vanished
Yeah when I was a youngster
When I was a, when I was a youngster
Youngster, when I was a youngster
Yeah, and now that I'm older
I wish I could've been everything that I wanted
I'm on it

I think that if I think back back to the days
When I thought I didn't think that
Nothing that I thought would not be possible
Ha, try and figure that out
Back when I didn't know how
To settle for a desk job bring in those pounds
I wanted to live in those clouds
These days I deliver those sounds

I always thought of myself as a simple dreamer
I never tried too hard but believed it
Now all of a sudden, it's gone my way

Back when I was younger
I wanted to be everything on the planet
Now that I am older
It seems the ambition has vanished
Yeah when I was a youngster
When I was a, when I was a youngster
Youngster, when I was a youngster
Yeah, and now that I'm older
I wish I could've been everything that I wanted
I'm on it
