[Verse 1: Ark {Notch in background}]
I was raised in the slums, that's the barrio
If you heard me on the radio, that's the radio
See, I came to make a change, that means cambio
Now we got ya niggas all sweatin', here's a pano
That's a napkin
Capitan means I'm captain
Que lo que pasa means what's happenin'
If you see me with my fam, that's my ganga
Shorty got a thong on, that means she got a thanga {Thanga}
If she's dark-skineed, then she's Morena {Morena}
If you want a problem, you lookin' for problemas
And talk means hablando
Walk is andando
If you see the cops, scream "Bajando" (Bajando!)
Cause if you are a thief, you a ladron
If you got beef with me, T carry your canon
You see, I'm crazy, a loco vato
Drunk, boracho, that's a rap means tato
