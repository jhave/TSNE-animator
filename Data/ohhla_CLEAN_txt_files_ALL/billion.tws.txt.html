[Chorus: Twista]
Been go go-getters, e'ryday money getter
Gotta make a billion, everyday go-getter
Donald Trump makin big money go-getter
Fast lane ridin, young stack of go-getters
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar girl
Billion dollar boy, billion billion dollar girl
Billion dollar boy, billion billion dollar girl
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar..

[Twista]
Yeah we get that money, yeah we get that cash
E'ry day, all day, gotta make that cash
Got them haters everywhere tryin to plot on ya ass
That's why I keep the flash just to push they ass back
Twista gotta get that paper e'ry day
If you wanna play in them big league games
Stack yo' money to the sky all day
When you tryin to make a billion ain't no time for you to play

[Interlude: Twista]
Money money money, money money money
Favorite color green cause they like money
Money money money, money money money
Favorite color green cause they like money
Twista gettin dough, Twista gettin green
Countin them stacks, makin that cream
Twista gettin bread, Twista gettin presidents
Billion dollar mindstate, just for the hell of it

[Chorus]

[Busta Rhymes]
We gettin A-rab money
Let's get this A-rab money, ay

I'm bilingual, I be freakin it in Spanish
I speak English but billions is my proper language
Funny you could wrap it like a mummy with a honey
and I'll make the people love me while they hug me with they money
And I'm always in a hurry just to come and cook it curry
or bake, MORE CAKE, shinin like the day was sunny
And I knew the Lord love me, bless and bestow all upon me
While I embellish all in it, that's the basis of the story
Pardon all of my aggressions, still get it in a recession
And I got the antedote, you could pay me for the confession
And it's money in the air, hope you niggaz fill it up in here
YOU GOT IT? Let me show you how to be a billionaire

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Twista]
Steppin in the spot, GMG is the team
We don't know about y'all but we stack our cream
Haters everywhere, we don't really care
When they be talkin that shit over here you know we don't play fair
He's a billion dollar boy, she's a billion dollar girl
Money money money is the root of all worlds
Never let it make you, make that money
G's on the Louie 13 gettin scummy

[Chorus]</pre>
