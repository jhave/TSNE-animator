Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Uh... All Day... Better hide your girl for this one..

[Chorus]
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day
HEY!
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock

She got a little bit of beauty, little bit of class,
Little bit of lips, Little bit of ass
Little bit of style, dressed to kill, little bit of freak, with a sex appeal
Um, I'm so down for whatever baby, always dressed fresh and wavy,
Wanna make love, ah yea, that's gravy. late night sex get extra crazy
Ain't gonna leave em stayin, sick of all the games you playin'
Eye gazin', sex amazin, got you squintin, eyes look asian
I know I'm just a kid, ever tell me what this is
I see you shake, I see you moan, everytime I touch ya lips
You grab my hand, run your fingers through my hair
Everywhere we go there's sendin sex all through the air
Ya, I know you think I'm playin right?
How bout you take just take a chance, stay the night
You my baby right? love it when I call you that
But I follow cash, I'm a have to call you back
Just know that, you be in my mind
I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus]
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day
HEY!
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock

Ya, I'm amazed, actin like there ain't no time to waste
She a freak, lemme get her right behind the stage
My true shorty though, I've had all sorts of hoes,
Take my time when I'm with her, drink my 40s slow
And give us a second, you'll find us on the bed
Wild sex, with her legs behind her head
Turn her over on her stomach, get her from the back
She always leave a scratch, but I like that
She the type that, you wanna wife that
And she like me, cause all I do is pipe that
Buzzin' like a bumble bee, that's chillin by the hive
Love her with no limits, cause my ceiling in the sky
Feelin up ya thighs, tongue ticklein ya twine
When I get it from behind, ya say it's twistin up your spine
Baby, I'm one of a kind, that finds that spot that have ya climax
I'm that boy

[Chorus]
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
It's all right, It's okay, Seein' you all night &amp; all day
HEY!
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock
We be crushin' round the clock, crushin' crushin' round the clock</pre>
