[Intro - Tony Yayo (Lloyd Banks)]
Yeah Nigga!
We fuckin back! Hunger for More!
Tony's Home!
Yo Banks I told these nigga's man
(Ya'll done fucked up now)

[Chorus - Lloyd Banks]
Aint No click like the one I'm wit'
If the drama gets thick, It's the guns I get (Now)
G-Unit nigga's is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin' where you from then sit (Down)
We gettin' doh' everywhere we go
And it's killin' em' slow just to hear me blow (Now)
G-Unit nigga's is runnin' this shit (Now)
If you ain't reppin where you from-Sit Down!

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
By now I know you done seen me
On ya' stadium or TV, with 380 on the EV
I skeet babies on ya breezy
And I aint' stoppin', Only Jack the Jacob could freeze me
Squeeze me and its bye bye gone
We got guns like Popeye's arm
I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin'
'Cause there's one on all of mine, I'm the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for muder on every Who Kid
Kay Slay, and Big Mike, admit it the kid tight
And you aint' even put up a fight, so its back to the amateurs
Wrappin' ya' sandwiches, I'm hot now so the rats wanna stand wit' us
They hop in the van wit us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs, now I'm back tourin' Canada's
Amongst weed smokers and crap floor gamblers

[Chorus]

[Verse - Lloyd Banks]
Make sure the birds don't get brought to him
I watched Kobe go from the Basketball Court to the courtroom
Go'head try to do my harm solider
And you'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And I'll be damn if I cosign a old snitch
That was gangbangin' when Jaws was a Goldfish
Ive been named New York's screamin' on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin' on a freak, fan base leanin' on the jeep
They walkin' wit the fire
So if you say banks in ya verse, Then u better be talkin bout Tyra
From P.A. to L.A., Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis, My buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow, But hit the gas on a silly hoe
Bounce like ass in my video

[Chorus]

[Verse - Tony Yayo]
Aye yo
Uno, dos, tres, quatro'
My click eat like the Twelve Holy Apostles
We bust down models, and plush out Tahoe's
Jewels froze, look like we hit the Lotto
P89, My clip filled wit' hollows
Stunt in the club, get hit wit' yellow bottles
Don't speak ma if ya neck don't swallow
'Cause 50 push Bentley's and Dre push Diablo's
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Screws ???? swimmin' in my Castro
Yay' rap is crack, and I got the best blow, best flow
Banks' put me in the booth, Let's Go
Think like Cestro, the games in a lasso
Jump in the Benz without snaps on the petro'
God gave me this flow, so I am special
In 16 bars nigga I'm finished, Faneeco!

[Chorus]

[Outro - Tony Yayo]
We told y'all motherfuckers man
Ya'll niggaz look like us, stunt like us, but y'all not us man!
Lloyd Banks, Hunger for More!
We back nigga!
50 the General!
Young Beezy Buck!
Game!
Rap game is ours nigga!
Hunger for More!
This is rider music nigga!
This for them gangstas, them generals, and them comrades!
This rider music! ha ha!</pre>
