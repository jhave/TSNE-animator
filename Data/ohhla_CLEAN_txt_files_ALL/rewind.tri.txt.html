[Missy]
Ugh, Ugh, Ugh....Woooo!!!

[Verse 1: Trina]
Yo, I'm a diamond in the rough
See I roll from the slum
Any little old city is like nowhere to run
The game's on you till you stand on your own two
Check this out niggas---This is what we gonna do
1!!!- We gon' bang this
2!!!- We gon' sing this
3!!!- We on top of the world but we ain't saying shit
It's the movement, and the truth is
Cause Trina and Missy ain't gots to prove shit
We brake down floors (BAM!!)
Brake down doors (BOOM!!)
5 month tours just brake down do'
We brake down hoes, we brake down foes
Run through pockets just straight down yo's
M-I-A to V-A its real y'all
We shakin up bottles to let 'em spill y'all
This is Slip-N-Slide askin "What the deal y'all?"
If you ain't throwin them bows then I don't feel y'all

[Chorus: Missy]
I Said BOY!!!! REWIND THAT BACK
If you talk *shit* yo might get slapped
BRRRRRRRAAHHHH!!! Yup I said slapped
Ain't no other chicks that's gon' bring it like that now

BOY!!! REWIND THAT BACK
Up in the spot you got your glocks on lock and.
HEY!!!--This join gon' knock
Up in the club I said this joint don't stop

[Verse 2: Trina]
Y'all know how real woman come down
Low cut copes when Trina come round
Reggae DJ screamin "COME DOWN!!"
We ?? it off top but want some now
Sit back-- and praise the don diva
I'm ?? --  trust me I'm gon' leave ya
Who blows streets up? Ya man want eat us?
Different flows,flavors,hoes- No Favors!
Don't pay us we'll shut that down
What's that loud? (Owww!!)  Cut that down!
Got a CL6 but what's that now?
If he not talkin big money, Fuck that clown!
Excuse my french, I won't stress the issue
If he ain't lookin out he's just messin with you
I'm a Mercedes mami, maybe the Lex official
If you wanna get on I'll have Flex to hit you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Missy Elliot]
Damn Y'all-Da-Da-Da-Da Damn yall!
Hurtin and scurrin I'm like I took my panties off
Knuckle and Buckle em' nigga I ain't scared of y'all
You wrestle this muscle thats gon' be your damn fault
YOW!!!!!-- I make screams like Prince
Spay em' and lay em' but you gon' never touch this
Beat em' don't eat em but you gon' always need Miss (Miss)
Cause me and Miss Trina gon' always switch it like this
COME ON!!!!

[Chorus]</pre>
