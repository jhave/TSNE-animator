Extra extra read all about it
The Legit Ballers came out with with an unbelievable album
Fuck a truce put the side on the news
Got killers that'll ride from the loc to the deuce
I heard a shot proof flip nigga gimme a bitch
at the Martigra crowd flipping the trigga
You still a bitch nigga
Sticking ya head up at a meter now you die how do ya figure
Acting hard with your Capris on
I come out at the neck of the woods on ya ass nigga ease on
And where ya from no ain't shit to me
Bring that ass to the tailor talking shit sent ya ass history
Evident you you weren't meant to be
Jacking over another niggas loot and fucking up the currency
Born and bad seed outta the crowd
Like David Gunna you don't wanna see me  angry pal
I'll raise up on ya ass like a root canal
Get fucking up shit like the trenchcoat mafia
Unbelievable how we popping ya

(Chorus: Highbeam + Twista)
(H) Them state street boys will get ya
(T) Betta be ducking when you running or they gonna hit ya
(H) Them Westside guys will get ya
(T) Burning the rubber off the 20's before they get with ya
(H) Them Southside boys will get ya
(T) Ready to roll straight outta control scummy off the liquor
(H) Them Chi Town boys will get ya
(T) Throw up your guns and bust a slug and be pre scripture

(Highbeam)
Let em all know now we piece and spit
Talk about shit bout we ain't choking thangs
I gave two to the motherfucking pork chop and watch his body drop man
Let em test the skills of us niggas thats triggerly inclined
Dump off on the rocks and monica red link
while blocks young guns on the grind
Out on the field what would a tribe nigga do
In a kill or be killed situation
Drama's what you motherfuckers facing
While he running I'm walking like Jason
Shocking your motherfucking body like grave dig
Then we dumping you all the say did
I bring pain to y'all niggas who be hating
Forcification bout my nation got me sniffing up information
Gimme the body dig a ditch
Bury the motherfuckers like old ancient blue prints
Execute you use em find em hit em split em 4 to the vest
What a way make to rhinos rip through the flesh
God bless us thugs that hold our own controls
On a mission yaking the snitch know to get it on
24 hour ghetto jeep is at the door
Lynch mob made me how you and your goofy click
and your throat is gone, suffocating em by dozens
Running with grim reapers handing out some good guns
And it all kicked off some shit you said
Now look at the little pus dressed up in red

(Chorus: Highbeam + Twista)
(H) Them state street boys will get ya
(T) Betta be ducking when you running or they gonna hit ya
(H) Them Westside guys will get ya
(T) Burning the rubber off the 20's before they get with ya
(H) Them Southside boys will get ya
(T) Ready to roll straight outta control scummy off the liquor
(H) Them Chi Town boys will get ya
(T) Throw up your guns and bust a slug and be pre scripture
(H) Them St. Louis boys will get ya
(T) Betta be ducking when you running or they gonna hit ya
(H) Them Houston guys with get ya
(T) Burning the rubber off the 20's before they get with ya
(H) Them Cleveland boys will get ya
(T) Ready to roll straight outta control scummy off the liquor
(H) Them dirty South boys will get yet
(T) Throw up your guns and bust a slug and be pre scripture

(Highbeam)
Whatcha gone do when them niggas run up to you
Don't fold stroll mean mugging you with them thangs out
How you gonna play that terror roll
or let the merch unfold slaughtery act at 11 to it and then die
Laid off in the streets with a psychotic thugs wont stop playing for keeps
He waiting to get tipped for your and your peeps
Clock ticking slow its a quarter past three
Lights on lights off in your community
Your block's having problems with electricity
Beat gang and in the presence of the one you envy
So go collect strucks chains greens and weed
Burn off a little bit of rubber if you ride with me
Slipping the clip in and put your pistol back on your hip
And I'm giving you half of the wild green
Down with them niggas Mobstability
Let's keep em feeling me we bogus with vocal trilogy
Get in a game where you get crapped out
Spooking the mouses with design got them niggas pulling macks out
For the love of the green liar promotion
Hell if I expose ya mad assed out blowing some backs out

(Chorus: Highbeam + Twista)
