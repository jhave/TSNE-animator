Work your body (Body)
Change positions (Yeah), change positions (Yeah)
New position (I want a ) new position (girl)
Twerk it for me (Yeah), twerk it for me (Come on)
Twerk it for me shorty, twerk it for me

[112]
Come a little closer baby
Girl I wanna feel you body
Please ya right next to me
We can be the life of the party
I just wanna let you know
I love the way you're movin'
Never wanna let you go
Never wanna stop the music

[Chorus: 112]
Girl, na na na
Little girl what you're doin' to me
Girl, you're lookin' so sexy
When you're doin' that dance for me
Hey, we goin' na na na
You don't know what you're doin' to me
Girl, you're lookin' so sexy
When you're doin' that dance for me

[112]
Ooh, now that I've got you baby
You know we gotta keep it sexy
Touchin' all over me
Baby, it's ecstasy
Lady, won't you take my hand
Let's go to V.I.P.
I don't think you understand
What you are doin' to me

[Chorus]

[Hook]

[Method Man]
Yo, I got my mind made up, come on, you can get it
Five five kitted and a set of keys with it
I talk like I live it, til you walk like I hit it
Even handcuff your wizes for a conjugle visit
No, better yet, say I make you queen for a day
Yes, first draft pick on my team, wanna play?
Because I play to win, but when the games begin
Some women pretend, even say they on they friend
Uh-uh, no she didn't (God, yes, she did!)
Can you learn how I live, and don't address me kid
Your numbers on my hit list, mother, I'm the shit
Ma, scream if you with this, I cut you like a fish

[Chorus]</pre>
