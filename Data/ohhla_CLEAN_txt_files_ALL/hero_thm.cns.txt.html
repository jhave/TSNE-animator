[Infesticon #0]
Ooh, there's big fandango in the wrangle
Ooh, there's loads on loads of g-strings and marble bags
On this beach, leave you speechless
Like no-star Sneetches, like
Brain cells sucked by leeches
Short Beach is the best bash
If I was a woman, I'd demand a tongue-lash
Be tall and blond with ass, like that girl in Splash
Ain't life fantastic?
Switch-gender spastic
Impale the she-male, down some more champale
Bombay chicken cooked like hell
Get arrested for sluttery and make-hell
Posted testicles on virtual e-mail
I'm the nouveau-beat superstar
Super-stealin' in Manhattan
Your girl is cattin':
"I strictly listen to Luscious Jackson"
Aversion to heights, got you froze up like deer in headlights
And purple nights, like Heaven's Gate
Watch the world gyrate -- fuck it
If there's a hole in the bucket, I'll plug it
If your fat body talkin' shit, then I'll slug it
Scared of your girl's clit? I'll suck it
Cheese thick from the bricks, I'll pluck it
I like rhymin' like Mascis
My beats are like molasses
Sweet and slow like Jackie Onassis
With Alzheimer's
Social climbers
Slip on my diarrhea
MCs sound the same, like onomatopoeia

God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!
God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!

Exasperated, systemic miscalculation
Four thousand twisted roads to salvation
Choose one sand-blasted alabaster bastard
Gilded monogram, four heads commanded their commanders
Comin' up flat like South Park Marlon Brandos
Celebrates his Contradicticons
We assume question marks are for morons, but I'm askin'
What floor are we on? Where's the connection?
Disseminated web of 360 degrees of relations
On juxtaposed plantation Soul Station Zebra
This world's a two-foot closet with Taurus, Cancers and Libras
Three Trent Lotts and two Eldridge Cleavers
Five John Wayne Gacies and one Beaver
All out to get cheese like dreamweaver
They cops ain't nothing but lost believers
Hiding out in the Bronx camouflage with a goatee in the season
[scratch] "Nothing less... nothing more"

God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!
God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!
God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!
God bless the Infesticons! Fuck the Majesticons!</pre>
