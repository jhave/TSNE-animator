Chill
Dough we got this, lock this in the pocket {*3X*}
Dough we got this - chill.. {in the pocket}

I got this, you know I got this
Life is full of surprises like a box of chocolates
And it's no one to trust so I watch my pockets
Fuck a car, boat or a plane, I'm coppin a rocket
To blast off so fast you'll probably vomit
And when I press on the gas I'm not gonna stop it
I'm gettin bread on my tracks, I'm rockin the sonic
Don't make me set off a blast, or drop an atomic
That Infamous bullshit, you know that we on it
We don't take it to the next level, we goin beyond it
Everybody that's on the team we supposed to be on it
Everybody else around us is supposed to feel honored
Bow your head, salute motherfucker pay homage
Turn the volume up to the max and top the wattage
Blow the spot? Nah I leave the spot demolished
SUV's be dirty but the drops is polished
I'm solidified, that means my spot is solid
You can take a shot at me if you've got the wallet
But you better have deep pockets; then you know the synopsis
Do the starship and we don't stop it

Dough we got this, lock this in the pocket {*3X*}
Dough we got this - chill.. {in the pocket}

Dough we got this, lock this in the pocket {*3X*}
Dough we got this - chill.. {Chemistry}
{You better check your files..}</pre>
