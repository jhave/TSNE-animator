[Intro: Ghostface Killah sample (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
New York City stand up, Staten Island stand up
New York City stand up (don't you bother me, don't you bother me)
New York City stand up (old school style g.)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You nothin' but fallen stars, I see it on ya'll
Appear bizarre, Ol' Dirty boulevard
I've known global law, take his head Ceasar
Got babies like caviar, growin' evening star
God bless the dead, Tupac Shakur
You can't divide war, this slim galore
Arabian flow, at nine a gigolo
With a bad hot hoe, only cocaine up the nose
Incognito, defeat me, how so?
Rap K'd O, money green playin', go
Long ago, Protect Ya Neck video
Made me blow, on rap radio (Wu, Wu)

[Chorus 2X: Ghostface Killah sample]
Staten Island stand up, New York City stand up
New York City stand up, New York City stand up

[Hook 2X]

[Cappadonna]
Brooooklyyyyyyyyyyn Zu, came through with the baby blue
Me and my brother Dirt Dog
Mama made breakfast today, with no hog
We hustle in the street, niggaz ain't fuckin' with Wu, so roll deep
Born God Body with the vest of heat
When the Bee Sting hit, niggaz move they feet
Yo, we banned from the club, you best to not sleep
Keep somethin' on the waves, thug passion with the Alize's
Smack 85 percenters, right in they face
On some black pimpin' shit, like my dun-dun Huey
God Squad in the building, big bags of ooey
Push the phat shit like Dutch Tsasui
RZA bring all the shit, fuck these clowns
Ason Unique, yeah baby, hold me down
Original tag team, S.I. City
Ain't nothin' sweet kid, ain't nothin' pretty
Wu-Tang Forever, kid, keep it gritty

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Call me Osirus, lyrical virus
Ol' school fire, straight from lockdown
Wu-Tang veteran, straight from lockdown
O.D.B., now with Roc now

[Hook 2X]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Oh baby, dedicated to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls in the world, and the ugly girls too
Cuz to me you pretty anyway, baby</pre>
