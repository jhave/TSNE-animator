[Nate Dogg] + (Hi-C)
I don't wanna know (yeah, ha ha)
I don't wanna know (y'all ain't ready for this one)
(C'mon Nate Dogg) I don't wanna know
(This gon' hurt) I don't wanna know
(Man, feel me on this, uhh)

[Hi-C]
(I don't wanna know) if you see my girl in the club
with her ass all out straight shakin that butt
(I don't wanna know) if you see her talkin to her man
don't tell me shit 'less you heard what she sayin
(I don't wanna know) when you see her out with her friends
Flirtin with the niggaz in the Mercedes Benz
(I don't wanna know) cause what I don't know won't hurt
So don't call me gossipin with no dirt
(I don't wanna know) cause some of y'all act like G's
But if you know the truth, you would drop to your knees
(I don't wanna know) you don't wanna start losin your mind
You're only twenty-fo' but you look forty-nine
(I don't wanna know) if the other brother got mo' cheddar
With a bigger dick and he bangin her better
(I don't wanna know) why you tryin to make my blood pressure high
Bring tears to my eyes, what you want me to die?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
(I don't wanna know) don't wanna know, just let me be
(I don't wanna know) don't wanna know, you cheatin on me
(I don't wanna know) don't tell me shit, just let me be
(I don't wanna know) I can't be hurt, by what I don't see

[Hi-C]
(I don't wanna know) if you see her holdin hands in the mall
With a dark skinned brother that's six feet tall
Nah, that right THERE you can keep
Cause you know how I do it, I'm comin with the heat!
(I don't wanna know) and if I get my ass locked up
Will you turn into a freak and start givin it up? (Wait for me)
Or will you stay down for the cause
Without everybody beatin up the drawers
(I don't wanna know) if you do the gay thing wit'cha friend
Rubbin skin to skin but ain't naytan goin in
You drunk, pass out off a bottle of Henn'
Wake up and do it again
(I don't wanna know) that my lil' boy just turned 5
And some rumors circulatin that he really ain't mine
Why you tryin to make my blood pressure high
Bring tears to my eyes, what you want me to die?

[Chorus]

[Hi-C]
(I don't wanna know) that my homeboys is plottin to get'cha
And try to holla when I ain't wit'cha
(I don't wanna know) if you go for the okeydoke
and try to blame it on drinkin some liquor
(I don't wanna know) if your brother broke in my truck
I ain't playin with him, I'ma tear his ass up
(I don't wanna know) if you plan on gettin me jacked
And tell 'em where the safe is at
(I don't wanna know) if you throw po-po's up out the guns
that make you scream to the top of your lungs (ahhhh!)
(I don't wanna know) the stress'll make your hair turn grey
That's why I don't trip, I do shit my way
(I don't wanna know) and if I ain't hittin the spots
You better lie to me, tell me that I'm killin the cock!
Why you tryin to make my blood pressure high
Bring tears to my eyes, what you want me to die?

[Chorus] - 2X

[Nate Dogg]
I don't need it wit'cho secret, what you doin to me
(I don't wanna know) don't wanna know
I don't want it, I'll run from it, if that's not my scene
(I don't wanna know) don't wanna know
