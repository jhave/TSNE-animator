Pullin' out my big black book
'Cause when I need a word defined, that's where I look
So I turn to the l's quick fast in a hurry
Threw on my specs thought my vision was blurry
I looked again but to my dismay
It was black and white, with no room for gray
Ya see a big "V" stood beyond the word and
Yo that's when it hit me, that luv is a verb.

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin you can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout luv in a different light
And if we all learn to love it will be just right

Hey, tell me haven't you heard
Love is a serious word
Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you've heard
The word luv, luv is a verb

Thinkin' of a way to explain-o
'Cause ya knowin' that I'm flowin' like a bottle of Drain-o
Simple and plain L-O-V-E, ain't all that junk that you see on TV
Put soaps on a rope 'cause they ain't worth cope'n
With it's a myth that there ain't no hope and
Luv is enough if it's unconditionally
Given now ya livin' out the Great Commission.

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin you can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout luv in a different light
And if we all learn to love it will be just right

Hey, tell me haven't you heard
Love is a serious word
Hey, I think it's time you learned
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you've heard
The word luv, luv is a verb

Back in the day there was a man
Who stepped out of heaven and he walked the land
He delivered to the people an eternal choice
With a heart full of luv and the truth in his voice
Gave up his life so that we may live
How much more luv could the Son of Man give?
Here is the example that we oughtta be matchin'
'Cause luv is a word that requires some action</pre>
