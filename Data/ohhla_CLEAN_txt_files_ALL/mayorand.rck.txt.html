Song:   The Mayor and the Crook
Typed by: kill4747@hotmail.com

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build

[Aesop Rock]
Every tenderfoot cadet better they be slit-throat percentages
Chicken penmanship tied the thirteenth knot (Hangman)
I arrange panoramics of a plastic catalog
And where wild dogs sing tailor-made lullabies tried by my offspring
I'll bring the butterflies and he can bring the centipedes
And she'll bring the cadavers set em' free and let em' feed
The devil tree penciled me in, but I slept thick through my alarm sock
Slick Willy hid in the barn while farmer charmed the crops
And I'm a warden
My tongue is full of glass
Because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle
If he truly drank the poison
I'm alienating the mating man to the high ride, base tied
Face mine's and make God clones
We can manufacture medicine
Cut into five digit slide clock the essentials in (I'll be a bill collector)
My destinies resting with red worms chewin' off the carcass anyway
Let me slay artists for tips in the penny tray
By the way if that diamond ring don't shine
That's cause I bought it at the five-and-dime but don't neglect the sentiment
I'll pedal my tricycle through the F5 logistics of a twister
Soaked in the religions of a nit-picker

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and migrated east, now, let's build

[Aesop Rock]
If I botched the operation I apologize (Sorry)
The air's rooted in carbon
I'm but a mortal archer parked in amber waves of starlets
I'm fresh out of Geppetto's woodwork asylum
Cedar frame, wire-bound knuckles
Let a tug of the puppeteer steer my hustle
Well when a page becomes a squire, re-engage, clap your wings
When a noble's demoted hope it don't sucker-punch the colony
But when the catapult releases lease your claims behind the bunker
And fasten stinger pageant results to the public eye (Glory hunter)
Is it genuine enough to feel baby felon
Negotiate comradery of wills
How's this my little loom?
Perv surgeon with dirty dominion monitor boxes
Hovering inches 'bove pertinent urchin toxins
Now y'all ain't excused from table side
Till the dinner plates fly
Slurping' liquid happy citizen enhancer
I got this slicky sycamore head shaker
Mimic stitch and splinter entry
Thereby filtering citizens hit-man prior to acts descending (Tight)
Cats know the ambiance calm beyond comparison
Captive, passive spring loaded serenity
I'm trying to give this city acupuncture
Shovin' one-way pins in subway systems
Stand up where I'm layin', now that a runway vic (Push, push)
Made you go batty, spreading spawn legitimate
Spice the bishop, sever the ties, splinter the kinship
See every now and again I love life but hate to admit it
Cause it spreads the jinx on a sleeping cynic

[Chorus: Aesop Rock]
No more pencils, no more books
I built the city out one brick
I had a mayor and a crook
I made the crook stab the mayor then slay himself in the guilt
I stole the brick back and--

[Aesop Rock]
I'm quadruple six plus scruples category mayhem stems
So one overlooked the scene including loopholes
When Christ studies the return ramifications
I'll burn the campus to impress him
Then rock like Medusa glances
You ran the final mile before the blanks blow
Home alone sipping beetle juice
Just to numb and then shimmy the needles loose
I built a castle out of fifty-two cards
Plus jokers with an image
Modern theory jars us while remaining harnessed to the vintage
I'm mad at how far this is dishonoring Occam's Razor
But it seemed so being fatigued knuckle work (Labor)
I've patched the little leakage in the shell around my greed
In case Tommy Turbulence located The Matrix then impedes
Whistle b in dirge bout the boogie burst classic
Helen fell in haunted machines screened by similars
That pagan act of suicide came to the daggers surface
Due to one queen who lodged the faith inside a broken circus
Me and my stargazer from woodwork serve the furnace
Pittin and discoloring up the lung that stung the serpent
I cherish the ferris wheel revolutions
It's not because the ride enthralls
more simply to the fact that it still revolves
Nursed in a bracket televise plastics and saccharine (well)
I oppose mass panic
The repressed fantasy cadets pose with a latch key demeanor
Returning to find a home vacant with no similars to compare days with
so let's build!</pre>
