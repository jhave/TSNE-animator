Song:   Love Is My Religion
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Love is my religion, Love is my religion, Love is my religion
I'll take you to the temple tonight

All my days I've been searching, to find out what this life is worth
through the books and bibles of time I've made up my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert, this is a calling have you heard
bring all the lovers to the fold, cause no one is gonna lose their soul

[Chorus]
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
hey you can take it or leave it, and you don't have to believe it

I don't want to fight, hey let's go fly a kite
there's nothing that we can't cure, and I'll keep you in my arms for sure
so don't let nobody stop us, free spirits have to soar
with you I share the gift, the gift that we now know oh oh oh

[Chorus]

Well I'm done searching now, I found out what this life is worth
not in the books that I find, but by searching my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert
this is the calling have you heard, bring all the lovers to the fold
no one is gonna lose their soul

Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
Hey you can take it or leave, and you dont have to believe it

[Chorus: fades out]</pre>
