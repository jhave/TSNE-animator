[Glaze N.Y.]
Trackmasters.. No Limit.. Glaze N.Y., Snoop Dogg!
Easy Mo Bee got beats, high on lye niggaz
Let's get money y'all..

Chocolate tone, visualize lips on the dome
Make 'em moan, turned you out, had you zoned
Snuck me to the crib, you ain't returnin me home
Play for keeps let's get money nigga rule these streets

[Snoop Dogg]
Just keep me warm when it get chilly (uh-huh)
Or when niggaz try to swarm me baby get busy
I'ma always keep you with me, we could never lose
Have you posted right next to my family jewels, blast fools

[Glaze N.Y.]
If you keep a firm grip, my loyalty's to spit
Mick/Mallory (shit) play with my clit
First take this oath, promise I never revoke
Ever seen a bitch eat it?  My record undefeated

[Snoop Dogg]
In most cases me and you can take the block
In an all out fallout, and place the dot
Fingerbang you and shake the spot (oww)
Cause I'm the only nigga caught you and made yo' ass hot

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
Pop my clip, my glock, I click it, I cock it
My heat, in my pocket, I blast like a rocket
It's like a gangbang movie, say up jump the boogie
while you're movin from the sound of my heat
My clip, my glock, I click it, I cock it
My heat, in my pocket, I blast like a rocket
It's like a gangbang movie, say up jump the boogie
while you're duckin from the sound of my heat

[Glaze N.Y.]
Hard on?  I flow like a Don, and so on
We can bust, from N.O. to Brook-lawn
C.A. to B.K., run sprints in the relay
Only thing hold us up is yo' finger on the delay

[Snoop Dogg]
Long as you don't jam up on me
When it's time to kill, I'ma always keep you concealed
But if you start misfirin when niggaz tryin to blow me away
I'm a slang you or throw you away

[Glaze N.Y.]
Oh really?  Then watch a bitch ricochet, fall through yo' doorway
Don't love me, to leave me, must be crazy
After all we been through, chambers ran through
Held you down in the hood when no-one else would

[Snoop Dogg]
When I first met you, we clicked, and fed a nigga dirt
I held you and squeezed you and wet a nigga shirt
Six niggaz with gloves on, lead him to the church
Three on each side as they set him in the dirt

[Chorus]

[Glaze N.Y.]
Okay, you knew not to leave me, another nigga scooped me
I'm chromed out Snoop, far from a hooptie
Who's she?  Shorty bang, old glory the name
Hollow tip range, burn 'em in the flame

[Snoop Dogg]
Baby you spit like a dragon, with a slight kick
You got my pants saggin, all on my dick
When niggaz talk shit, it's a must that I draw down
And when you start spittin it's a must that they fall down

[Glaze N.Y.]
Rat-a-tat-tat, leave 'em bodied, or handicapped
Cock 'em back, first chick to fuck you back
Holy matrimony, never leave you lonely
Iron lung rung, and I'm about to cum

[Snoop Dogg]
I done fled many crime scenes with the barrel smokin
Snoop D-oh-double-G done his share of loc'n
Karaoke'n like an M-80..
With the nina ross I pawned shopped a trey-eighty

[Chorus]
