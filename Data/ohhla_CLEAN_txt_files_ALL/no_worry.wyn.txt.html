[Intro/Chorus: Detail]
You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries) {*3X*}
See the shrooms keep me up, so (I ain't got no worries) {*3X*}
You see money, right there, yeah that's Tunechi, right there (turnt up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy, right there, redbone mangos, right there
See them shroomies, right there (yeah) we ain't got no worries

[Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggaz be purrin, bitches be diggin me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleepin giant
Man yo' bitch speak in tongues, every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open, cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the do's off, that means that bitch sleek
All these bitch think they're the shit, I send them up shit's creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's okay if you turned up, just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smokin, I grew it
These are Blood gang, Piru, and all rats gotta die, even Stewart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave, so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face - I ain't got no worries TUNECHI~!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wanye]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you askin questions?" I say "Bitch you tryin to be funny"
Now take your fuckin clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swinh your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bars
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggaz fallin off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my hoe, I swear she was with my hoe
You know I fucked them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it's Tunechi and I'm out'chea, no worries, no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story

[Chorus]

[Wayne - over Chorus]
