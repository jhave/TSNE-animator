[Intro]
The strangest, straight derangest, start it J, start it J
Uh, MidWest Side, IIIDQ found laughin
 
[Verse 1]
Lets get it on, raps new phenomenon
Hitt'em up with the flips
Rupture your dome
Calm down, you say me song sound like Butch?
You say I'm washed up? Nigga what!?
This is when I kick it with this rhythm-simplistic
Fuck dem 9 rhymes, make them go blind every time
On that cannabis, edist, not for a weak mind
But the mind of a gauge
On stage cuzz minimum wage has me on maximum rage
Page mac, lets scrap, the conniseur of rap
See me, come tight like a pig in a bikini
Please! All emcees know I be on my Q's and P's
Even Run-D.M.C. is on a deadly disease
High voltage, take a look at the psychosis
Deranged, I claim, let me explain
Fatrocious, flows be cocked from KC to Wisconsin
My killer flow makes me jerk my Johnson
 
[Verse 2]
Mushroom headed keeps me pathetic,
But the ?
Treating life like I'm moving bombay
Brother with the ganja stickin it
Gonna stick it if you let it
Come here, no come?
I'll run dancing
Just call me the strangest, straight G, bombay
Distinguish the fuck of shit
From hip-hop comes this
Apocoflips got control of your hips
Its venomous, how the rap metamorphasis
MC corpsesis around me
They found me jacuzzin with my sorcerists
Fire up the paper &amp; get blowed
Then roll to a spot with bianca
Then bust holes in these hoes
Cuzz they wanna kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
On the set, no shit
Told my bianca thats what she gets
Middle West flex flows, mics to sex those
Middle West flesh holes, insane games
Never that plane Jane
 
[Verse 3]
I give myself a C-section
With a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
IN front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Julia Lewis and Angela Bassett in a casket
Trippin with the 9
Get your brain blown like a head gasket
Missouri is in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me too
They know they wicked
So I bust if you aint down with IIIDQ
Who are you!?!
Neena Tech, respect, MidWest Side
For life, grab a mic, and flip it like a dyke
The soundlab got my microchip screwed
Mounfunction, ?, now I'm cool
Pain givers, slang spitters, hang niggas, insane triggas
no shame, aim triggas, brain splitters, game quitters? NO!
Grey liver niggas, narcotical strange nigga!</pre>
