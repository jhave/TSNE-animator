[Intro]
Yeah... ten years nigga, yeah
Yo, can't say thank you bitch? Say thank you niggaz
Oh, oh! Oh, oh! Oh, oh! OH, OH!!!
OHH, OHH!! OHH, OHH!!! Fuh, die, huh, yuh

[Lil' Fame]
Funky beats and my dope beat rhymin make it so simple
We are the representation of "Warriorz" monumental
Handle your business, deal with your issues, let's make this official
Before I put my fist to my pistol and be forced to lift you
(YOU WANTED IT?) You aimin punk? (GET IT GULLY!) Before you start
I'ma POP in the name of my dearly departed (MISTER YOU)
Better respect me, it's the F-I-double-Z-Y, W-O-M-A-C-K
Motherfucker from M.O.P. (YES!)

[Billy Danze]
The First Family nigga is me nigga B.D. nigga I'm comin
M.O.P. nigga, O.G. nigga, WATCH YO' ASS!
Amazing how we handle 'em, take 'em and dismantle 'em
Blam blammin 'em like Cam and 'em, leavin them scramblin
Hopin to damage 'em, ain't no time for panickin
I lift the nose of this cannon and slam one in your face (FACE!)
I do what I gotta do, murder international
Ghetto problem we're blastin you to put you in your place

[Chorus One: M.O.P.]
[Danze] Mash on 'em, GET 'EM! Step to 'em, HIT 'EM!
You need to show love to the thugs and GET WIT 'EM
[Fame] BEATS - you send 'em, STREETS - we're still in 'em
Remember you send 'em with venom and run right in 'em, we're (LIVE!)

[Lil' Fame]
So we can wig out, before we get up out the game
Industry on my ass, can't get caught with this whack rap shit
Not the Fame! I breeze on the lames
Stash my advance money, hop the fence, drop the game
So MC-what's-her-name, try to pocket it, claimin he lockin this
(NOW!) Okay you gon' witness apocalypse
Youse a "check-one-two" on the microphone ass man
Carbon copy of Fizzy, look at him, a clone-ass man

[Billy Danze]
I got twenty on this Family, my man and me and muscle
through half your staff and cruise on snooze past the rest of y'all
True confessions y'all (UH) I ain't gon' mess wit y'all (UH)
I done tested y'all (UH) and y'all ain't got it
It was last spotted in the 'Ville, floatin through, potent too
Pure never stepped on, so it's hard to catch on
(BROOKLYN!) Rep on, Bill and Fame kept strong
Still remainin the illest ever you slept on (AHH~!)

[Chorus Two: M.O.P.]
[Fame] Mash on 'em, GET 'EM! Step to 'em, HIT 'EM!
You need to show love to the thugs and GET WIT 'EM
[Danze] BEATS - you send 'em, STREETS - we're still in 'em
Remember you send 'em with venom and run right in 'em, we're (LIVE!)
[Fame] From Ground Zero (LIVE!)
[Danze] We right here yo! (LIVE!)

[Fame] So dump (FIRE!) dump (FIRE!) dump (FI-YAHHH!)

[Will] You can believe ain't nuttin stoppin us
[Fame] No matter how they market us
[Will] We'll remain at the top of the charts
[Fame] With the hardest C-marchin us
[Will] The hardest on the market son
[Fame] With the tools of trade of a carpenter
[Will] We shook up the industry
[Fame] We got 'em sufferin, the ruckus is now
[Will] We still runnin 'em (now!)
[Will] We still gunnin 'em
[Fame] We been here for a decade, continiously flowin, it's goin
[Will] Down, so recognize
[Fame] That we still exercise them index fingers
[Will] William Danze and Fizzy
[Fame] Them "Downtown Swingers"
[Will] It's the showstoppinest rockinest
[Fame] Non-stoppinest poppinest
[Will] What we be droppin is gotten us ahead of the game
[Will] Competitors came
[Fame] In the form of dozers and lames
[Will] Fizzy (talk to 'em)
[Fame] Billy (put a spark through 'em) NOW!
[Will] You better know the mac'll spit
[Will] The whack rap shit you kick is a little inaccurate
[Will] You faggot bitch (yeah!)
[Will] We emerge from the cellar, it's the neighborhood hoods
[Fame] And the neighborhood hero
