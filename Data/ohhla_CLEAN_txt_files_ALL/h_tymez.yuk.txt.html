Its hard tymez...its hard tymez...its hard tymez
Its hard tymez...its hard tymez...these hard tymez

[Z-Ro]
My people get crushed on by poverty, got lives that scarred
Single mother selling her body, nigga times are hard
Wheres the Lord when I need a blessing
Devil's be after me supply your child with a weapon
My nigga ran up in a bank, sixty seconds for a lifetime bid
And I don't get ???, now he selfish just for trying to feed his kid
I'm living for mo', lead us out of slavery
Revolution is coming but for now we waiting patiently
Started out fiending to eat and starving together
So when we crumble, survive of this place start robbing each other
We got 'jects and those that eject, and those that die
Refuse to come up out their shit so now they close they eyes
Ask my nilla servin milla at that mexican joe
Muthafuckers ran up with AK's straight letting em go
We tried to walk straight and narrow but we end up going to jail
For selling drugs, no wonder my people out here smelling blood

[Hook]

[Trae]
These hard times really be crazy and I don't want to lose it
But the reality got the pistol b, and I feel like I abused it
Till the banks peeping through cracks hoping I see the light
So every night I praying to God, I'm beggin he make me right
True 'nuff, we gotta be our own man dying ain't part of my plan
I've been broke all through my life so struggling and new to me man
I lost family after family, sittin lonely in my zone
The only way I express myself is when I'm doing these songs
I throw the drugs I prefer to face ??? with my pain
I stay in my lane but appeal to people I'm doing the same
My brother Deeky in the pen facing three with a L
The only thing that he ever see was penitentiary cell
Through all my niggaz pass, even Big Mello too
To Mafio to Screw Up Click, we gotta ride for you
Cause these be hard times, deep down I be scarred times
I want to cry but then I can't 'cause it be bar time

[Hook]

[Yukmouth]
We got evicted so its crunch time
See me and my little sister earning free brick cheese in the lunch line
Now I'm running from one time under the sunshine
With one nine, stick to my hustle stay on my grind
With the fine mind, body, and soul
God placed my feet on solid ground, all ten toes
Like the deeper than each holes in the benz-o, it's more like a trap
To see how far you could get without getting blowed off the map
Get stabbed in the back, getting blast with a gat
In this ghetto and havoc thats when they move slabs of crack
My parents both died, how to handle that
We light candles and cry wish we had them back
Sometimes I want to commit suicide blaze the steel
My father died from having HIV, AIDS is real
Lord forgive us 'cause we hustle just to pay the bills
Struggled in the projects never stayed in the hills...hard times
