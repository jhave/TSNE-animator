[Intro: Rock]
Pardon us for the inconvenience
Due to some unfortunate circumstances
My black ass couldn't make to the first album
You see, the punk ass police had my ass locked down,
while it was goin down
Operation Lockdown is goin from the bottom to the top now
All ya punk muthafuckas, how that sound?

[Buckshot]
It all started out, one night
When I got the call from my nigga Rock
Son, I need a glock, it's twelve o'clock
But, fuck the hour, my nigga need fire power
Callin the General, to the circle to supply the need
Roll the weed, get high, let the smoke block my eye
High degree, steady regulatin P.D.R.
Permanent Dick Ridin niggas get in your car
Muthafuck them niggas that's playin the bar
My niggas playin you close, you play my niggas far
Superstar wit a glass jaw, easily broke
Hit, hit by the rubber grip, easily toke
Got psyched motherfucker cause you saw my height
Got rocked by my nigga Rock floored you right
It's some shit that's gon' happen, if it happen tonight
Crossover niggas might see the crossover light

[Rock]
Oh, oh, oh, who want to test y'all
The R.O.C.K.N.E Double S, yo
I stress to ya before, you want beef, we only set war
We'll be dressed like monks, lickin in front ya door wit four-fours
I miss ya last time, I was locked up
So flruck on ya punk ass coppers, hard rock niggas I got ya
Me and B.D. we B.C.C., tell O.G.C., parle, this one's a freebie
Fake g's please, I love you like it was your twelfth birthday
Street sweeps like beast Tuesday and Thursday
Sting ya like my sign do, I'ma Scorpio
Ask your girl, she oughta know, I make her horny-o

(talking)

[Buckshot]
Click, click, booyao! How you like us now
Brook-lan, weed style, shorty wanna fuck
But she ain't see me in a while, but it's aight
Shit I'm fuckin anyway, you know what scorpion's like
We like big asses and freaks that's wit it
The one's that never argue when it's time to hit it
This little nappy headed bitch tried to stick me for a G
Fake stripper, hit my pockets while she rided me
Shit felt like a nigga want to cum in his pants
Didn't know I had my gun in my pants
Grabbed my shit, gun on her thigh
Looked in the eye, "Pass me my money, so you're trick ass don't die"
I ain't a playa, I ain't a pimp, you a thug-a-don
Walk straight, while them niggas lift
Fuck them fake pretty niggas, my name on blimps
Poison in my tail leave them niggas hence

(talking)

[Rock]
You seen my Boot Camp, now peep my Magnum Force, muthafuckas
Dirtiest Players in the Game, ask your mother
I fuck her, dug her for a buck, and love the booty
And she told me, exactly where to find you g
Plus your girl Sleepin in my Bed like Dru Hill
You know she messin wit my head to, what shoe fill
We don't give a wiggy, what about your feelings and morals
Don't like it, you can get a dick up in your oral
So stop flauntin, you three wannabes want beef, why?
Cuz the three chicks you punks want, want me
Wit my bummy ass, you need to be shame
That's cuz I'm straight up, and y'all run to much game
And they love the fact that I'm skinny and hit like them cops be
Combos have, even my foes screamin Rocky
Rocky, Rocky, he's the greatest, you can't stop me
You're copied, you come out, sloppy
You're shocked g, about the fuck up
We beat that ass for fun, my whole crews Rude like Rick the Ravishin
I ain't askin ya enough, and I'm comin thru blastin and snuffin
Get clapped in the budgets, for actin and frontin
So stop bluffin muthafuckas

[Outro]
See, that's the most high dimensional
Muthafuckin mind of the scorpion
God damn, float like a butterfly, sting like a scorpion
Word up, muthafuckas</pre>
