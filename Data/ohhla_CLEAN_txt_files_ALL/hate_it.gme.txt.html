[50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh..

Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out +My Melody+"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
Four-four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Lana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nuttin good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (The Game)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P.)
(And I ain't goin nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[The Game]
G-G-G-G-G-Unit, on the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
and really do it, that's the true meanin of a ghostwriter
Ten G'sll take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in marshes
I stay strapped like car seats, been bangin
since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
and if I gotta die, I'd rather a homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose
When it's win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[The Game]
Used to see five-oh, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin with 5-0 it's all startin to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on shop money to lamp, sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
when there's kids starvin
'Pac is gone and Brenda still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know "What's Goin' On" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Bank had got that abortion?
I love you ma

[Chorus]
