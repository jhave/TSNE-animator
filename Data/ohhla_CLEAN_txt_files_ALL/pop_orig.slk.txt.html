(Snoop Dogg in background)
[Silkk] Uh hun
[Snoop] It's funky Soopafly
[Silkk] Yeah
[Snoop] Big Snoop Dogg
        Snoop Dogg (Dogg...)
        Silkk The Shocker (Silkk, Silkk The Shocker)
        Ain't No Limit to this (You know what it is)
        2000 (2000)
        Gangsta shit
        Gangsta (West, west, y'all)
[Silkk] It's my second home (West, west, y'all)
[Snoop] 97
[Silkk] Look
        Snoop, what up

[Verse 1: Silkk The Shocker]
It ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, you know what we bring 
No Limit, Dogghouse, ain't Nuthin' But A G Thang
You know
We think to win
Y'all think money's soft enough, y'all better think again (Come on)
Cause if it ain't about money
Then why would I bother
If she ain't keepin' it real (Come on)
Then why would I holla
She can swim by the crib with the house, come with the lake
Eat as much as you want to as long as you know what come with the plate
On my lap, a .45, in the trunk
Keep a K
In the deck, P, Snoop, Biggie, Pac, fool, just keep it Dre (Come on)
And the heat I got on me
Always gotta ride with it
Don't spend money, floss with money, cause I can't
Die with it
Project nigga
Huh, get my work on
Host MTV with a Eastsidaz shirt on
Ghetto like that
You know how we live (Heh)
On the east, it's six feet, on the west, it's three wheels

Chorus: Snoop Dogg (Silkk The Shocker)
Pop lockin'
In my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz, pop lockin'
At the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' at the Holiday Inn, pop lockin' (You know what we do)
In my Rolls Royce, Cadillac
Lincoln and Mercedes Benz, pop lockin'
At the Howard Johnson, the Sheraton
Pop lockin' with all my friends (You know what we about)

Hook:
(Snoop Dogg in background)
[Snoop] It's that west coast way we're livin'
[Silkk] Southside, southside (Money, cars, weed, bitches...)
[Snoop] It's that west coast way we're livin'
[Silkk] From the south to the west (West, west, y'all...)
[Snoop] It's that west coast way we're livin'
[Silkk] Southside, southside (Money, cars, weed, bitches...)
[Snoop] It's that west coast way we're livin'
[Silkk] From the south to the west (West, west, y'all...)

[Verse 2: Goldie Loc {Silkk The Shocker in background}]
C like that
With them Merry Yellow tux
Draped in all black 
Take 'em back like the pop lockin'
Kangol suits 
Bangin' back in the day
Just to get a little juice
Fuck the truce
Cause we can get
Cripped out crazy, blast on all you suckers
With a throw away .380
Fuck around and get bounced
In a dumpster somewhere (Where you at)
Cause them Southside (Eastside)
Gangstas don't care 
Think I won't
Fool, you don't {You know you don't}
Be fuckin' with no niggas more
Gangsta than me, tell them the truth, loc
120 proof out the sun roof 
Throwin' up
The motherfuckin' diz loose
Tru Tank Hoggs
Fuck with Bigg Snoop Dogg, Soopafly to keep them high
So they can come out they draws 
But you player hatin' perpetratin'
Niggas make me mad
So I'm mad dog you suckas
And I let my pants sag, it's real

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg {Silkk The Shocker in background}]
The gangstas bang
Do that damn thang
Me and my nephew, Dogghouse keep it true (Dogghouse)
Roll that weed
Pass that drank
Holla at your nigga, baby, bring your thang 
You could shake what you got, get your pussy real hot 
Jump in the Gator, we could slide to my speezot 
Just keep it on the leezy, I know it ain't easy 
You bucket-mouth breezy
Silkk, this bitch cute, thick {What up}
And all that {Damn}
Why must I
Chase the cat
If you was me (Me...)
And I was you (You...)
You'd probably
Floss on a nigga, burnin' rubber in a '52 {*imitates screeching*}
Most bitches do
And most niggas do too
In the land where it's all about the red and blue 
But me
I'd rather get the greenery
And smoke out the whole motherfuckin' scenary

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook Til Fade</pre>
