Consider this Evil Empire thing as a threat
Evil Empire

(Hook, Lil Wayne)
I don't need no hook for this shit

Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't

(Evil Empire)

(Verse 1, Lil Wayne)
Ah-ah-ah-ahem

Ok now shawty take yo clothes off
And I'ma hit it-I'ma hit it 'til we dose off
And when we wake up, I'ma hit it 'til we dose off
She say her pussy isn't stoppin
I'm like, if that's the case, I'ma beat it like Johnny Cochran
I'm a rocket like Houston, I'm leanin
Ain't nothin between me and you, but this bikini
Now can it I take it off ya?
Rub my tongue across ya
I do it so right, she call me an author
But I am just a Carter
Yeah, I'm just a Carter
Straight to the powder
Yeah, that's what I brought her
Man I swear, I'ma make her cheer like victory
Shawty shawty, you can get speared like Brittany, literally

(Hook, Lil Wayne)
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't miss
Shawty I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just tryina hit it-hit it like I can't</pre>
