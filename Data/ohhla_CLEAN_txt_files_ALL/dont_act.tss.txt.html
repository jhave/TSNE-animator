[Lady humming]
Why you wanna treat me
[Lady humming]

[Too $hort]
I was raised to cope with life
Make my own choices and hope I'm right
It's uphill all the way for me
I ain't goin' down or slowin' down don't play me G
I'm not the child of a millionaire born to be rich
Don't have a trust for the lust for one I get a bitch
So quick and all the stuff we have
Make her jealous girlfriends lust for cash
But fuck 'em cuz while we on a whole different level
They still be sleepin' on the floor in the ghetto
And when they realize how you came up
Them hoes can't say nothin' cuz the game is rough

[Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing]
{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Cuz you don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that you should've stuck a knife in my back

[Too $hort]
Now bitch I don't slang no crack
I can't go back to rappin' in my cango hat
You wanna put a little game on that?
How lame is that?
You fuckin' with the same ol' rats
We all have ups and downs
You're stuck with frowns and don't make a fuckin' sound
But let a nigga hit the lotto
Pop some bottles and tell everybody you got 'em
Now I done been on both sides of the mountain
For the bottom to the top and back down again
And all the way I give a hoe a fit
Not to wear it but to ??? little lonely bitch
You cryin' like a baby need a pacifier
You (pass a fly?) watchin' life pass you by
You couldn't make it to the top in an elevator
You think I want a sorry bitch?
Never player

[Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing]

[Too $hort]
You're like a little baby with a shitty butt
You city sluts they say you can't get it up
And then they say you're way too hyper
Game is lighter need someone to change your diaper
But don't stop just give it all you got
Till you're hot even if you slang dope and get caught
It's like goin' platnium and gettin' dropped
You don't get no money you get props
But you're not cuz you're really just dreamin'
I'm leavin'
I keep these fake hoes steamin'
They screamin'
She better face those demons
It's fuck season
Don't waste my evenin'
I believe him when he said the end was near
It's in the air a whole lot of pimps in here
I can't (com)pare cuz I've been mackin' twenty four years
But since you wanna go there bitch I really don't care

[Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing louder]
{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Bitch don't know how to act when she's dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I can't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
Bitch I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that bitch stuck a knife in my back

[Too $hort talking and lady humming/singing]
It's like that
That's why I treat you like that
{Don't act like that}
Bitch x2
{Why you wanna act like that?}
(Get) the fuck on
{Baby please don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Better learn the rules of the game
{Don't act like that}
You don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Don't act like that x2}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{No}
I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Why you gotta be that way?}
It's like that
Bitch it's like that
{Don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Bring me that VSOP
Passion blend
With a drop of yak</pre>
