[Syke talking]
*waking up*
Another day, another day...
Let me get up and do something

Verse 1:

Rolled out the bed about eleven past nine,
It's about that time for me to incline
Hit the shower took about a half an hour
for me to throw on my clothes I suppose,
Slappin' on my khakis and t-shirt not the linen
Low profile cause my Dayton wasn't spinnin' even grinnin'
Callin' dollars on my mobile phone,
Cause last night he stumbled home, but not alone
Got baked and toasted overdosed on Re-my
Vision me, in the land of no pity
Doin' a hundred through the city swervin',
Baby grabbin' on my thang in the suburban
Turnin', agony and stress into careless therapy
It's true overdue for the century
Could it be no more strugglin', smugglin', sellin' crack,
Day dreaming kicking back,
Doubt that's really gonna last
Put some in the stash, let time pass, enjoyin' life

Hook:

[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Enjoyin' life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Nothing else I can do, but enjoy life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Livin' the life of a boss player
[ooohhhoohhhooh]

Verse 2:

Scooped the little homie, snowmobiling, jetskiing
Offroad vehicles dependin' on the season
Needin' something exotic and sexy
Two piece bikini come undress me
Nasty as you wanna be, sucka free,
Let it hang loose when you hangin' wid me,
Unsolved mysteries on ya body let me find 'em
Fantasy desires don't hide 'em, just come,
Let it throb did I get the job done
Doin' it standin' up
Are you having fun?, don't run
Stop, get on top, it's wet, drippin' sweat
And I ain't even hit it yet,
No regrets on your mind quali-time
Wid a floss, from a playa boss
The cost is a question-ing not asked,
Just lettin' time pass enjoyin' life....
Ha ha enjoyin' life

Hook (only women sing)

Verse 3:

Can't fall off I gotta ball till the end playa
Fat crib in the loft at the thug lair
Can't let go, I know they want me livin' low,
Ambition competition got me federal been poled,
Open doors to a money journey
Conception transgression won't turn me
Mentally composed so I rose to the occassion
A celebration, everyday vacation
Optimism I put in 'em
Give 'em to the kids, love being wid 'em
Livin' what I did in the past is in the past, if you ask,
Listen my intuition say I'm moving fast
On the gas, of a big, bike sled
All my people say I'm living, past fed
Enemies want me dead,
Females calling,
Gotta keep ballin'..
Enjoyin' life

Hook:
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
What else can I do, but enjoy life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Forever ballin', ha hah
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Enjoyin' life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Livin' the life of a boss playa
Enjoyin' life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
You know, enjoyin' life
[ooohhhoohhhooh]
Sucka, and busta free
