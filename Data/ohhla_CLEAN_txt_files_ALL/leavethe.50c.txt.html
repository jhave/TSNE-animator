"COME TO THE FREAK SHOW!!"

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Fuck that~! Leave the lights on
(Girl) 68, 69, leave the lights on
(Can't see shit) Leave the lights on
Girl I can't see shit, leave the lights on
(Girl) Leave the lights on
68, 69, leave the lights on
(Damn) Leave the lights on
Zip down my zipper, play with the python (girl)

[50 Cent]
I make the bed rock like I'm on a yacht shit
Citation tint quick lick my cockpit
Time's money, check my turby{?} on movement
I'm rich bitch, I say move you get to movin
I'm a Bentley Mulsanne type nigga, I'm cruisin
Lookin ain't hard to tell who's winnin, who's losin
Got a penthouse around my wrist, I'm flashy now
A condo around my neck, I'm cashin out
I'm nigga rich, got e'rything a rich nigga get
I got whips for days; I got kicks for days
Louie, Hermes, it's hard to Jimmy +Choos+
Ferragamo, Dolce Gabbana, Red Bottom blues
Plus I got the Prada collection
I might leave my socks on sexin
Old habits are old habits, baby show me what you know
Let the freak in you come out on the low (yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
68, 69, all the time
Shorty you can be a freak for me, come and be a freak for me (girl)
Maybe I can lick yours, lick mines
Shorty you can be a freak for me, come and be a freak tonight!
Let's get right, leave the lights on
I can't see shit, leave the lights on
Damn... leave the lights on (damn)
Zip down my zipper, play with the python (girl)

[50 Cent]
I'm not into all of that S&amp;M shit
No leather spikes for me but you can get your ass whipped
Limited time, skip the foreplay
I'll be your chocolate Whopper, you can have the shit your way
Hope her head game's good, she lookin exotic
7-hour flight, she Euro-erotic
London, Paris, France, Japan
Talk to me while we fuck girl I can't understand
Let's get to strokin, bonin, moanin, groanin
Start in the afternoon, end up the next mornin
Startin the next round, lick from her neck down
So she do do fellatio, correct, wow!
I'll play "monkey see, monkey do"
So everything you do to me, I'll do to you (c'mon)
It tickles but I can't quite hear
what the fuck she tryin to say while her tongue's stuck in my ear, yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Hey, girl, I know you want me
(No?) Well why the hell wouldn't you want me?
(Damn~!) Shawty now push up on me
Zip down my zipper, play with the python

[Outro: 50 Cent]
You gon' just be like that?
You so insensitive
Hurt my feelings
I mean from the bottom of my heart
I love you, hahahahaha</pre>
