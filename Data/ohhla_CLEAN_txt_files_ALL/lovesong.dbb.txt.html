[Mos Def]
Everybody.. should get down, oh yes (oh yes) oh yes

Intro/Chorus One: Mos Def

Everybody, groove to the music
and do what you like to, oh yeah (oh yeah)

Chorus Two: Mr. Man (Mos Def)

Bush Babees (Bush Babees)
Y'all know we rock thorough (Yeah we rock thorough)
For the whole world (The whole world)
Five boroughs.. so check it out

* Chorus One seperate, then Chorus Two overlaps One *

I came all the way from Brooklyn to present my rep
Lyrically deep like sleep; I rock hard like Led Zepp
I take steps and leave impressions on planets
More complicated than life so rappers can not understand it
Talking that hardcore shit; but I don't buy it
Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet!
Cause all that noise you talk is not needed
I cut headz off at the knees and leave em all defeated
So stay seated, or get deleted from the program
Let it be known I don't follow cause I'm my own man
with my own plan, cause the mind is infinite
We got four minutes, so everybody get widdit!

* Chorus One and Chorus Two combined *

Chorus Three: Mos Def

Cause all my people out in Brooklyn get LOVE
Cause all my people out in Queens get LOVE
Uptown and Boogie Down you get LOVE
Strong Island/Shaolin you get LOVE

[Mr. Man]
You can send MC's in - squads of six and we take two each
I stand out like seeing Moses at the beach - splitting waves
My style's the newest rhyme craze
Blow up, like grenades, tint words, without shades
Hold ya lighter, the Flatbush dolla camp writer
Roll with more Dangerous Minds than Michelle Pfeiffer
Pay the piper, I lay the pipe just like a plumber
Went without a ride for one too many summers, NOW
I'm out to get the cream like Carnation
Send headz home like George Bush did to Haitians
No patience, I got ta have it, the fine fabric
I learned The Facts of Life from Mrs. Garrett
But now I'ma do it my Way like Carlito
Whether it's in sweatpants or even tuxedos
We know - if this rap thing, don't make loot
I take it back to '86, stick niggaz for they Troops

* Chorus One and Chorus Two combined *          

* Chorus Three *

[Y-Tee]
We come to tell the people dem, we're talkin one love
One are we in love, a way dem cyan't dub
They'll find it in a pub, and I said in our club
Wha-wha-one love (one love) gonna take it, gonna take it
Gonna take your jeans and your dungarees and it will be on sale
Things I can try to make you move on the wail
Aiyyo, no play yo, don't go astray yo
No matter follow me come be a one of these day yo
I cyan't believe what dem want in all de mornin
So I, I came back in all de evenin
Da same thing that made the lights out, be sing
Rude bwoy, bad-a-bing, bad-a-bing, now everybody

* Chorus One and Chorus Two combined *
