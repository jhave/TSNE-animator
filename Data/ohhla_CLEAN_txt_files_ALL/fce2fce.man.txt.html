[Chorus: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We diggin' in crates, makin' papes all across the states

[Planet Asia]
Who wanna go against the hard knock trife? Demonstration of self
Fuck what ya heard, that' how the Yard rocks mics
I stretch perfecto, poetry penetratin' through your chest blow
Wrestlin' with the written, straight spittin' about to explode
It's ocknaughtin, and I shall never be forgotten
Rappers be actin' hard but really soft just like cotton
Once I switch gears, I gets down off the cadence
My train of thought brave, rhymes with all kinds of changes
I bust faster, fuckin' with Kurt the Kutmasta
Touch my microphone is the reason you'll get your ass whipped
Razor sharp precision slash it, to get the cash quick
I heard the track murder my mental and then I smashed it
Straight coastin' - Motion Man, bam, it's settled
I'm hot shit meltin' through the motherfuckin' ghetto
Blazin', mainstream, makin' shit happen
As the first real West Coast emcee to turn Platinum

[Chorus: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We diggin' in crates, makin' papes all across the states
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
Pullin' all nighters 'cause we writers and the joints don't stop
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
And if ya hot ya hot, and if ya not ya not

[Motion Man]
Biochemical, biodegradable, biological
But not bio-sexual partna, bioracial
Switch up tones on you, smack up your facial
Chameleon, tryin' to make a million and it's on
I'm a lizard, mixed with Mother Nature's form of a blizzard
Salmonella scaly rain, swing the mic like a wizard
Don't mess with smart kids off alcohol with dunce hats to fit you all
Return siris for the whole street brawl
Send dirty ashey rappers back to the studio, like babies they crawl
Like snakes they shed, I'm flyin' that head
Doin' failure, sets of push-ups after sex in the bed
I'm ready to roll again - dip-dip-dip-doo-da, insert it in
I be strokin' like McGwire and Sosa to bypass Roger Maris
And get a day off like I'm Ferris
Bueller, Bueller, Bueller - absent from the scene
Rappers hear that avalanche is comin', won't proceed
I'm a mixer, form of a blender, add in many phrases
Chop it up, rotatin' a solid into a lyrical liquid
Get up to the plate and switch hit with a verbal bat to swing up
Knock a dent and I won't ding up, after I rip
Leavin' the mic smellin' like Old Gold from my top lip
My cut up at you like clippers to fade ya
Sit in the chair as I edge your head with Planet Asia
You might be disappointed when sharp cuts
connect to your forehead, expose your black head

[Chorus: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We diggin' in crates, makin' papes all across the states
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
Pullin' all nighters 'cause we writers and the joints don't stop
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
And if ya hot ya hot, and if ya not ya not

[Motion Man]
What's your last request you nappy Fred Williams chest
You not Shaft nigga, you more like Jimmy Walker skinny
Michael Evans, tight denim, lookin' out for Penny
I leave rappers like Florida Evans sayin "Damn!"

[Planet Asia]
With years of experience I reach my destinations
And now I'm gettin' by just off my high expectations
Dirty to the core, ghetto score to the symphony
Contemporary hip-hop crews you gets no sympathy
In this feel I follow, no woman or man or even dollar
And I put that on my next heart beat, all down the bottle
My peoples out to touch live L.A. ey yo I doubt there's
Another emcee that could probably fuck with me out there
No doubt yeah, this be that real hip-hop shit
To make y'all motherfuckers run out quick, lookin' to cop this
Back again just to slap out your taste
Na na na, face to face we came to shake down the place

[Chorus: Planet Asia] (Motion Man)
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We puttin' in work, Kutmasta Kurt break down the bass
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
We diggin' in crates, makin' papes all across the states
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
Pullin' all nighters 'cause we writers and the joints don't stop
(Face to face, we came to shake down the place)
And if ya hot ya hot, and if ya not ya not</pre>
