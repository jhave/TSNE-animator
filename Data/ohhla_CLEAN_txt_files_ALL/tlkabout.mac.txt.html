Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?

[Verse 1]
So many things to say not a lot of times that I can say 'em
I can talk about the fact that I'm a rapping caucasian
Talk about going to school and getting bad grades
Talk about breaking the rules and having bad days
I could talk about girl problems
I could talk about hoes from the ugly to the hot ones
Or I could talk abut this dream I have
Or I could talk about my homies when I seem 'em last
Say I'm the illest on the mic, how I kill it when I write
Or how the lights when they film it so bright
I could talk about the fame and the hoes
Or all the name brands on my clothes
Talk about the highs, talk about the lows
Talk about the highs that you get when you smoke
I talk about a lot of shit when I write.. because it's part of my life

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?

[Verse 2]
I could talk about the parties that I go to
Talk about how it's so different from the old school
I could talk about the pop and the whack rap
Or I could talk about some ounces in a backpack
Talk about a fitted, talk about a snap back
Something simple, or something real abstract
About the war, talk about politics
Or I could tell you how full my Louis wallet is
I could talk about a few religions
Or how to turn a Jew into a Christian
I could talk about the shit that make you cry
Or I could make it all up and just talk about lies

[Chorus]
What type of music should I make? It generates love and it generates hate
What kind of topics should I stress? I can talk about the money and the girls and the sex
Talk about life or talk about death. Living care free or I can talk about stress
What kind of picture should I paint? What kind of music should I make?</pre>
