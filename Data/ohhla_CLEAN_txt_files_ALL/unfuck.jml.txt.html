Erotic E Intro:
One time for your motherfuckin mind
yeah this is Erotic in the house with my nigga Jamal
My nigga Calif
Passion in the motherfuckin house
The unfuckwittable individuals, that's us
That's it with this laid back shit
They about to rip and by the way
my dog George Clinton's in the house with us
To get it on right
Yo it's gonna be about that time I think to lay it down
And ah as long as you as you realize...
that it can't be fucked with, you can get with this
Right check it

George Clinton:
You can't fuck with this

Passion:
I make your eardrums bleed like a 9 millimed
Niggas steppin' up like they wanna see me
I be the P to A double S crooked I 
You and your crew contenplating suicide
Your troops callin' truce when I let the flavor loose
Like a duece duece, now who want the proof?
Def Squads over here, step to the rear
I got the shit you don't wanna hear
The shit you fear, the money talks and the bullshit walks
Recognize the realest streets of New Yorks
Marley G got my back like a trigger to a mack
10 and I'm rollin' in a jet black Benz
No hoes everybody know the code of the streets
Niggas don't sleep cause niggas got to eat
Follow my styles like rituals
I beez the unfuckwittable, lyrical individual

George Clinton:
It's unfuckwittable, you can't get next to this shit
You can't get next to this shit cause it's unfuckwittable

Passion:
Yeah now as I think for a sec, wait a god damn minute
These niggas all up in it like they want it and they with it
Full of envy and testing me lyrically
I don't follow no beats I let the beats follow me
Lyrical metaphors are ready for your brain 
Coming down like rain I bring the pressure nd the pain
Fallin' on your back like birdshit you fall
Into the pits of Passion and poison stikes the membrain
Saying my name in vein causes pain
Back to reality your fairytale is over
Niggas is wishing on stars and four leaf clovers
But I be wishing apon styles and microphones
God bless the child who bites her own now
Styles are invisible, critical
Passion is lyrically unfuckwittable

George Clinton:
That's what this is. This is some unfuckwittable shit
Matter of fact this...

Jamal:
See I be standing in the middle of certain stances
That cause niggas to get they ass lit till they shit
In they drawers
Ha ha here to drop the funk hydrolic pump accupunture
Passion and Jamal here to taunt ya
Known for blow back to back we kill tracks
Niggas don't understand how we do it like that
Representation, no perpetration
All we see is trick ass niggas in the nation of playerhation
But I just play it cool instead of playin' the fool
Cause MC's get stuck like glue with the tool
For the residuals, Jamal's the unfuckwittable
Lyrical individual</pre>
