[Domo Genesis]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryin to get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hangin in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryin to smoke the finest
and get high stickin bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am gettin higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches cryin when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at?
Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?
We on top of the world, where we at?

[Frank Ocean]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurlin himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls; pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through with that
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio +Bastard+'s recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says FUCK 'EM on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughters
that's, where I'm at - now where we at?
Where we at, uh-huh, Wolf Gang, where we at?

[Hodgy Beats]
Swell motions give promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggaz let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright, might give you nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greeko mix me yo' bitch
is cummin along, yeah she hum to my song
Singin like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we weren't premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
on the floor then pick it up, out the door, door chased
an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream until it has an abortion
Where we at? Where we at?
Where we, we on top of the world
On top of the world, nigga top of the world

[Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seein
Now I bet they see that we ballin like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryin to get paid, don't you remember the days
when your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane?
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin half a Maserati
And the only thing blockin me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolexs if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinkin we slack, work hard
I got the world sayin every single +Friday+ is +Black+
Took your bitch, you ain't gettin her back
Cause she know - where we at nigga? Where we at nigga?
Uhh, we on top of the world, on top of the world

[Tyler, the Creator]
Where we at, where we at niggaz?
Where we at?! Where the fuck we at man~?!
Y'all niggaz don't know me
Huh - WHERE WE AT?
Down to fuckin Earth, huh? Down to fuckin Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fuckin per-vert
My window is a book, and I'm a fuckin crook
stealin phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fuckin deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages
that could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from tourin in fuckin Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fuckin deals
about some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No faggot, it's sold out!!
(Come on why you holding out, I though we was boys)
(Without me you wouldn't be Tyler, the Creator)
(You're from the Dirty, I can tell whenever you perform
(A leopard can't change it's spots) but I'm a fuckin unicorn
(Whatever man!!) Look; you can't stop me, I'm going +Full Monty+
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roamin where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here's some give-a-fuck cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none!) How can I wake up
on the wrong side of the bed when I don't even fuckin have one?
(Shit I don't know) When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fuckin assortment of children that's takin Ritalin
because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feelin him
You gotta be fucking kidding me...
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
and they fear it, you can hear it
when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah I'm rebel nigga, cheer it
Dead parents everywhere, it's +Smelling Like Teen Spirit+
Okay, fuck it - Elvis has left the building
