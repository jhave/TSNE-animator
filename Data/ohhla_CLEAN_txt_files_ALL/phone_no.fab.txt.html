Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You [x12]

[Fabolous - Intro]
Y'all niggas better stop playin with me
Y'all know ya aint bout that life
"SOUL tape"
niiiccee

[Chorus]
I'm callin them out
I got they phone numbers [x2]
When that money callin everything gon on hold [x2]

[Fabolous - Verse 1]
I'm having doubts, what they really believe
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle, who really be Steve
Photoshop dont make it better, it really deceive
Long hair dont care, but it really be weave
Lets get back to this real shit
That life, I'm bout
Anytime that I'm out, I keep ballin like there's no time out
On the kush I'm stoned out
On you haters, I zone out
Y'all opinions dont make me money
So what yall thinkin dont count
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude
When I be serving these niggas
You rappers platter food

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
Saying they overrated is a understatement
Them niggas is broke, look like they under maintanence
They rapping bout mansions, but from they momma's basement
Swear they in phantoms, but drive a honda station
Lets get back to this real shit
Stay away from that counterfeit
That fake-it till you make-it life, really dont amount to shit
Talkin never bothers us, sometimes it do bore me
So if ya makin movies, hope it based on a true story
Freck said "nothings worse than a rich hater"
When money call, pick it up n call that bitch later

[Chorus x2]</pre>
