[Verse 1 - Anybody Killa]
It doesn't matter what you say anymore
Things you do don't amaze me, so now I see you like you passed on
Don't nothing last long, shit ain't forever
Whatever you thinkin' of, there's always something ten times better
Don't mean to bust your bubble, sink your boat
But if you dive in and can't swim, you ain't gonna float
It's like, some people try as hard as they can
To fit in a situation they don't understand
Confused and fed up and don't know what else to do
Until they get mad enough and come after you
I wanna, take this time to figure out what I'm all about
Should I do 'em in, or just chill and shut my mouth
God forgive me for this evil takin' over
But there's situations I won't understand until I'm older
Gotta, live my life through these twists and turns
And it doesn't matter cause I'm always down to learn
It doesn't matter!

[Hook] -x2
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got bad aim
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames

[Verse 2 - Anybody Killa]
Different lifestyle, new face each day
Unplug yo mind, with words I say
No choice don't move, think hard what's next
Didn't respond quick enough, ain't no time left
And if there was it wouldn't matter, nothin' matters where I'm from
Center of the earth with the worms and scum
Ya don't want none of this bitch, keep on steppin'
All that drama that you bring with your mouth as a weapon
Ain't no one ever told you talkin' shit don't pay
The only thing that you get is the killa in your hallway
Lookin' to revert everything that you said
Turnin' your whole room red, bloody carpet, the bed
I can see a lot clearer now, than where I'm headed, there is no hate
Do or die, to try and keep my head straight
The more you think about me the sadder you're gonna get
But now it's done and over, so I guess it doesn't matter bitch

[Hook] -x2
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got bad aim
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames

[Verse 3 - Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I know that they don't like me and it don't matter none
I'mma keep actin' a fool, reppin' the shotgun
Somebody come and kill me, nothin' else seems to work
Got me jabbin' this pen in my heart for every verse
With my blood on it, I bleed on the track
You may hear me lose a lung if you listen to the playback
It don't matter, cause nobody listenin'
I am the start and finish bitch, peep the manuscripts
See, where I'm from, "Fuck the pigs!" is what we yell
When we buckin' at the precinct and the judge from the jail
Throwin' the hatchet up with ABK and the fam
Rockin' throwbacks Psychopathic, where it all began
It don't matter how I got here or where I come from
I still be standin' in the end, amongst the devastation
Fuck everybody who don't wanna hear me
Maybe it's what I say and portray is why they fear me
It don't matter!

[Hook] -x2
It doesn't matter if my shotgun splatters your brain
It doesn't matter if I'm bustin' and I got bad aim
It doesn't matter if you murder me, I'll do you the same
Send you back to Hell, to burn forever in flames</pre>
