[Phonte - Intro]
Yeah...Little Brother
So provacative, so sexy
Listen...I want you to go put on your best pair of dancing shoes
I want you to put on your favorite outfit, let's do this

[Phonte]
Uh, for this night I say, "Thank you, ma'am"
Lookin so good in that dress you made
Rollin out in or four-door Sedan
But I'ma pimp it like it was an Escalade
"Oh, that's a beautiful mess you made"
I always know if you ain't feelin alright
So kick your shoes off, just take it light
and let me give you this night, you've had a stressful day, let's go!

[Chorus]
I got room reservations, everything's paid for
Hey baby this is your niiiiiiiiight...
Friday night just got paid so, that's what it's made for
Make it the time of your liiiiiiiiife...

[Carlitta Durand]
Whether are we just, here with my man (with my man)
Make sure I look good, cause I know he got plans
Whether on a town or, in the room
Gonna have a good time just, me and you

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh! Marc Jacob cologne scent fillin the room
Thinkin bout tonite, this only afternoon
Not a moment too soon, the sun is fadin west
Got on my blazer - check! My hair's correct
And I do step, out under the stars
You the brightest one, you deserve appluase
And we do cars, people to stop and stare
We belong together - such an obvious pair, oh yeah!

[Chorus 2X]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, when all is said and done, I know you had some fun
Cause we ate together, then we played together
Then we laid together, I pray you stay forever
Girl, no matter the weather, you should never fall off

[Phonte]
Call off your job, call off your plans
Call off your chores, call on your man
In our private suite, chefs cookin up
at the Marriott, Harper hooked us up
Feel good to go out for a night on the town
and baby girl, just hold ya hand
Remind me of back in the days when we would watch the old folks
Get down to that old school jams - now how they used to sing it?

[singing break sung in style of Kool &amp; the Gang's "Ladies Night"]
This is your night, tooooonight
Everything's gonna be, allllllright
This is your night, tooooonight
Everything's gonna be, allllllright

[Chorus and background music til fade]</pre>
