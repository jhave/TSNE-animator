[Chorus: Rob Aston]
Fuck no, not today!
No chance, no way!
It's my life, my say!
Fuck no, no way!

[Verse 1: Rob Aston]
True love is the bill's and a gun
Can't stop, won't stop till it's over and done
What it looks like, I ain't the one
Hard times gettin' worse, and it's only begun
I push a cadillac, gold biarittz
I got everything you want, don't ask me for shit
I fucked your girl, You should ask about me
But it couldn't get worse, it's as bad as can be
Hypocrite, you do it the same I don't give fuck though
It's part of the game I go for mine, I go for broke
I pack a 9', let's smoke
You want to do it, we can do it, let's go
You's a punk motherfucker, get done like a ho
We roll dice, life is a gamble
Make me a million dollars, make you an example

[Chorus: Rob Aston]
Fuck no, not today!
No chance, no way!
It's my life, my say!
Fuck no, no way!

[Verse 2: Tim Armstrong]
I got punk rockers all around me
I got friends who understand me (What?)
So my enemies, they can't stop me
When the hard times come my friends stand beside me
Ahh, check it, my technique is flawless
Ahh, wreck it, a fucking lawless
Sharp as a fox and your flawless
Judge told the verdict, said "the Transplants are timeless"
Get back bitch, run for cover
Lyin' snitch, watch you stutter
T-plants, there's no other
One for one and all my brothers
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
I don't give a fuck 'cause that's my motto
So listen up man, won't you hear me now?
Roll with skins and punks and criminals

[Chorus: Rob Aston]
Fuck no, not today!
No chance, no way!
It's my life, my say!
Fuck no, no way!

[Verse 3: Sen Dog]
It's my life, my way
Everybody does what the fuck I say
I represent who'se from back in the day
Real gang bangers from the south of LA
Keep your mouth shut, cuz I don't wanna hear it
All the negativity bringing up my spirit
Matter of fact, don't even come around
Cuz I don't want people looking at me like I'm a clown
I'm serious dog, left you out of business
I motherfucking kept the pace, can I get a witness?
I ain't hearing but you telling me
But where I'm standing, you look like the enemy
Stay back, put your back, keep your distance
Mac dog been known to set track from a distance
Don't you take this funny or lightly
Might cheef, or cut, and rip a fool that might try to fight me

[Chorus: Rob Aston]
Fuck no, not today!
No chance, no way!
It's my life, my say!
Fuck no, no way!</pre>
