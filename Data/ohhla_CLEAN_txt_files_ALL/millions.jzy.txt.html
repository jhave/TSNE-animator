Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions

See your black italic car in traffic then you know it's me
See me in the club a few times you think you know a G
They send you a can you read card, tell them "totally"
Let them rappers do their rap shit, this is poetry
Polo T all black, welcome to the afterlife
Money is the root of all evil meet the anti christ
Death and tripping own each other they shout you salute brother
At the IR with his mother I'm trucker than a motherfucker
Cried a few bevador tears like a fucking boss
Real nigga, good kid ye we took a fucking loss
Ye I seen your type nigga ye I know you know me
Ye you want a million dollars what you gon' do with it

[Chorus: x2]
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions

Hussle all day, every day ye I know the law
They say you only do it for the real I tell them show your rough
Yesterday talking real shit put on a show to love
Got that thug motivation real talk flowin on
Got my first 28 hit it in my blue jeans
Only thing I can envision nigga is them new things
New coupe, new crib, new chain, new watch
Till there's all eyes on me, nigga 2Pac
Red plastic cup and they got that true serve me
If I could gut a nigga wanna tell the true for me
Got a few times nigga now let me see you get it
Get your first million dollars what you gonna do with it

[Chorus: x2]
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions
A million dollars cash, a million dollars cash, a million dollars cash
I'm thinking millions</pre>
