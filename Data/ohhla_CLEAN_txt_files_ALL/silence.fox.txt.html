[Foxy Brown speaking]
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh
My enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell
Though an army may encamp against me
My heart shall not fear
Though war may rise against me
In this I will be confident

[Darius]
I will survive

[Chorus]
Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (you taught me how to fly, fly)
When we hear, the voices sing
The book of love will open up, and let us in

[Foxy Brown]
Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me
It's like this pain is takin' control of me
Every move I make, determines my fate
Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate
The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors
The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge
When the records stop sellin'
And the crowds stop yellin'
All I have is me

Bet you thought I'd die without you
But see how I'm still living
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one
Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble
Torn apart, a young woman scorned
Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane
In the hospital, crying in the pain
All types of medications, flowing through my veins

[Chorus: Darius]
Take, these broken wings (these, broken, wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free
When we hear, the voices sing (I will learn, I will learn, how to fly)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

[Foxy Brown]
Please, understand I'm a human first
And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga
And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all
Even when I nearly lost my mind
Some remained loyal, ignored the headlines and

[Chorus: Darius]
Take, these broken wings (take, these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (let em fly, let em fly)
When we hear, the voices sing (voices sing)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

[Foxy Brown]
Story of my legacy, this can't be life
Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'
Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

[Chorus: Darius]
Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (I wanna see them fly)
When we hear, the voices sing
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Take, these broken wings (take these broken wings)
And let them fly again (oohh)
And let them live so free (let them live so free, so free)
When we hear, the voices sing (yeahh)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

[Darius]
Teach me how to fly			
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
Teach me how to fly
I believe, in the power, of love 		
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Can't you hear me, don't you hear me? 	
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
I'm calling out to you
Foxy help me sing  			
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
These broken wings
