[Ne-Yo]
OK! Bad day got you seeing red
Wanted to feel the sun on your back
But it rained on your head instead
But on the bright side despite this hassle
Wet sand makes for a better sand castle
Inhale exhale just take a breath
And know that things don't always happen like they should
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good

[Cher and Ne-yo]
Cause it's like falling down
When everyone's watching
In the final round
Fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out
But nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good

[Cher Lloyd]
Woke up from the wrong side of the bed
Gotta get the work done
And then some got a busy day ahead
But look on the bright side
Work hard play harder
Tomorrow's full of laughter
Inhale exhale just take a breath
And know that things don't always happen like they should
Noooo
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say its all good

[Cher and Ne-yo]
Cause its like falling down
When everyones watching
In the final round
Fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out
But nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good

[Ne-Yo]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah Yeah
Hey
There'll be bumps in the road
Things will go out of control
But you can't let it get you down
When the right just goes wrong
Just stop and keep pushing on
It's all good
Play it here and now

[Cher and Ne-yo]
Cause its like falling down
When everyones watching
In the final round
Fight your hardest but lose
It's like shouting out
But nobody can hear you
But when it's all said and done
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good
Ooooo
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good
It's all good</pre>
