{Chorus}
The type of girl you wanna chew all of my bubble gum (yep)
The type of girl you wanna chew all of my bubble gum
I'm the type of girl ya wanna take to ya mama house
T-T-T-take to ya mama house

{Rasheeda}
A tisk and a task it
I got them flavors like a damn fruit basket
Can't afford it baby boy don't ask it
The real thing like a cherry coke classic
Now get your grade right (Yup Yup)
I'm at it again, got them boys on deck cause I'm better then 10 (Fo'Sho)
I'm juicy like a peach, drip right off your chin
And I'm bubble-licious good make your boyfriend grin (I'm so fine)
Baby I'm a rock star I make em trick hard, now he buying me a car
Sweet like a jolly rancher but you won't get far
Wanna chew the bubble gum better play the right card

{Chorus 2x's}

{Princess}
I got the berry sweet and sassy juicy bubble gum
You can ask yo man about me bet you he'll say yummy yum
Taste some other flavors you'll come back Princess number 1
A royal chick is what you need so come and get you one
Just bank a new taste, what you need in your life
Big Bank Boss chick, make you say oh my
Yeah right don't hate Got cash no lie
Cute face, lil waste, big ass, and down to ride
I can be cool cranberry or bitchy banana
Royal raspberry passionate pineapple or an apple
Either way it goes it going to be good
They all gonna love me
Rock ma hips and get this money
Then I walk like a model

{Kandi}
Kandi Girl...Cause they want my bubble gum
Yea I got that good sugar sweeter then a honey bun
Treat me like a blow pop, you might be a winner
Eat that candy till you get to the center

{Chorus 2x's}

[Diamond]
That's right
I got ya Sheeda
You know you girl Diamond got yo back on this one.....

I'm the type of chick you wanna chew all of my bubble gum
Having niggas say honey honey baby yummy yum
Glamorous I get it done I'm hotter then this sunny gum
Any muthafucker had better come get some
[? ]
Only if you got a big account you can get one
I take credit cards but I like cash too
Hey lil buddy in the orange and blue
Hey lil buddy in the orange and blue
I'm starchy when I take em to the Grammy's
And wipe all over your starchy and fantasy
Smell like candy but taste like sweets
Line of the work from paper to grease
Hey mana lese they flirted with diamonds
My diamonds got diamonds so I'm always shining
The crown full of hollasion must be rocking
Ain't all in the can but I sure be stopping
All on the dance floor while I'm pop locking n dropping
Niggas throwin' 100 dollars in your pocket
I'll woo woo wobble on your face, I'm a park it
Diamond is the name and money is the target  (YUP)

{Chorus 2x's}</pre>
