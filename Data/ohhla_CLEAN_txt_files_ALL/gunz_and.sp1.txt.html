(Verse 1)
Count the diamonds on my 'lexe
Don't waste your time
Puttin slugs in you bitch-ass niggas comin for mine
You can read it on the paper or on the Mtv news
Diggin ditches for sheisty bitches tryin to give me the blues
It ain't no secret addicted to bitches, guns and money
But the money is first 
Nigga the bees come and get the honey
Niggas be plottin rottin dirty muthafuckas wanna put me in a casket
Fuck all you jealous bastards
While I'm hittin the weed let tell my G's
If I die by my enemies make sure them muthafuckas bleed
Make them niggas think it's armageddon
I put it down thug style like a G from the jump
And I ain't bullshittin
Steady strapped with desert eagles and Uzis
Do a shit over these fake-ass niggas see in the movies
Feel me like titties and ass (ass)
Fuckin bitches and countin cash on a mad dash (dash)
Hit the sticky laced up with hash surround myself with killers
Drug dealers and real niggas makin ?????
Hittin quick like [name] in a mob fashion
Blastin for the loot we ain't puttin up our dukes
Ready for d-a-dump and shoot for the money

(Chorus)
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Bloow!]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [It don't stop]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Speezie Ace in the house]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money

(Verse 2)
Niggas be savage bout the muthafuckin kill (kill)
Straight lightin shit up like Fire Marshall Bill
The game is deeper than a muthafucka
That's why I swim in it to keep myself undrowny
The dirty Bay'll pull you down 
If you can't float on the water ??????
Shut up nigga muthafuckas ain't goin head up
It's always some game I'm talkin bout goin toe to toe
When niggas been puttin the blast down since 1984
It was 1986 when the glas sticks came around
Flossin mob buckets flippin kilos to quarter pounds
Hella killer goin round niggas ain't playin bout they money
Make a joke about they game lookin at you like 'what's funny?'
Gettin niggas with Uzis for talkin too much shit
They gettin genuine pistol-whips rough the niggas like chips
Clips and red beams a thang for 15 down to drop seasons
Don't let this rappin be the reason
You don't spread your hustle, power, money and muscle
Takin niggas shit in a tussle (tussle)
We all struggle live this thug shit drug shit or .44 slug shit
It's all for the love of the cream that's why we buck shit

(Chorus)
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Yeah,Yeah,Bloow!]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Nigga]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Muthafucka.Bloow!]
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  
Addicted to bitches, guns and money  [Bloow,Bloow!]

(Verse 3)
They say: 'Mr. Bossalinie how you get so cold?' 
I keep a strap on the side 187's the code
Addicted to bitches, money and guns to load
Scopin the dancefloors playa haters and hoes
Friends and foes takin off clothes after the shows
Niggas lookin for they baby mama
Who knows what she's hidin there?
They've probably hittin her
But if you can't feel the drama you shouldna did that
You see the bitches go and get you both shut up quick
Don't let the trick get your wig split, it's real shit
Niggas dumpin on a regular bases 
Lookin out for unfamiliar faces
Spittin out in high speed chases

(Chorus)
Addicted to bitches, guns and money
