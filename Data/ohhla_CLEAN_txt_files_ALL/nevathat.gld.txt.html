[ VERSE 1: Ant Diddley Dog ]
It's money to make and pussy to get, so I'ma make it quick
I might offend, but it depends on how you take this shit
Real niggas know, bitch, you be schemin for your last bone
You pick em up, and they be stuck, you got your cash on
Then they talk shit, ain't that a bitch, you think your ass grown?
You ain't got no cash? I'm out of gas, walk your ass home
Goldy, you feel me when I dog hoes in Oakland city
Should I feel sympathy? (Never that) I shows not pity
To a bitch or a goddamn dopefiend
If you smoke cream, muthafucka, then you want green
So don't be smilin in my face lookin cheesy
You need me, and ain't no bargains or no freebees
I never have niggas who think they bigger disrespectin me
You try that, and I'm cuttin short your life expectency
A cold gangster, never wastin no time
You know you got to have nine triggers right in your spine, nigga
So watch your back if you don't think that you can fall, man
Fuck the laws, niggas get downed like tall cans
Ant Diddley Dog on the loose, I ain't a trick snitch
I ain't never gettin broke by a trick bitch
So if you funny style, come with a better act
Me slippin? I'm a Oakland gangster, never that

[ Ant Banks ]
I be that bad-ass nigga in your shit tonight hoe
With Goldy in the land of funk, just for ninety-fo'
So here we go, really doe, shit, I gotta burp
Rappin Ron, won't you take it, shit, my throat hurt

[ VERSE 2: Rappin' Ron ]
I flow tight on the tracks that y'all lack on
Cause I got the lyrics and the style to fall back on
So put the smart mack on, breakin your backbone
I leave your ass dead in a casket with all black on
That's what Ron'll do off the bomb and brew
Fuck up you, and your crew, and your mama too
Peace be out to you, asalaam alaikum
But if a nigga talk that shit, watch how I'ma break him
Cause I'm a vet quick to set muthafuckas straight
My rhymes are airtight, makin brothers suffocate
So brothers wait, and puff and take a deep breath
Cause with the strong jab you ain't gon' have teeth left
So run yo mouth, and you can get your chin broke 
Call your mama and your daddy, go get your kinfolk
Cause I'm quick to go into throwin you into a ditch
See I'm doin this showin you that you a bitch 
And I take ya like a cup of coffee, you're just a softie 
You better back the fuck up off me
Tellin niggas you could beat me, of course you can lie
But if you get up, you get lit up like the 4th of July
Cause you'se a weak-ass nigga, and you've done never practiced
And me fall off on the mic, never that, bitch

[ VERSE 3: Pee Wee ]
She's a seditty hoe, but she dropped the panty hose
She seeen me in videos and she jocked me for cameos
All the time I'm in the Oak, pal, horny as totem smile
And bitches let me dick em, cause I'm kickin it with pearls now
Ain't got no zinas and vogues, I just got penis for hoes
Ain't got no dough, but she owe me, the bitch is cleanin my clothes
Cocaine to powder her nose, she rode around in a rolls
With some muthafucka I don't really know
Goddamn, gettin high and gettin drunk
Nigga, I ain't a chump, but I come with some funk
Back on the track, muthafucka stayin black
Dick grows long like a fuckin Cadillac
Bitch, get with this or bitch, get with that
A stack for the cat? Bitch, never that
When a nigga's gettin laid 
Cause your ass'll get played
On the next fuckin record
Now bitch get naked

[ VERSE 4: Goldy ]
It's that yellow-ass nigga with the shadow side burns
Sittin low to the right makin wild turns
I make my rounds down the track in my drop Rome 
Droppin the hoes off, pickin the cash up, floatin on gold, not chrome
Diamonds on my fingers big as do' knobs
My hoes ride the back, my main bitches give me blow jobs
Rolex link, dressed in Cartier, carat diamonds
I watch em jock and give me props, cause the girl's blinded
Presidential 'Lex on the stearin wrist 
Parlay links are made of diamonds sittin clear and crisp
Take it from a mack, no bitch is too hard to knock
Too good to hoe, or too fine to jock
Hey you, can I do you a favor?
Give you the better things in life, cause you'se my flavor
If you're with it, drop your panties and tap your heels twice
Repeat after me and wake up to somethin all nice
(There's no place like the land of funk
There's no place like the land of funk)
Then you fall into a magical sleep and awake
Standin on a hoe stroll flirtin with Tonto 
Welcome to the land of funk where everything is gold
In the plants in the trees all the tricks know the breeze be at ease
I'm the wizard of the land, follow the golden bricks
Cause you be fuckin em, makin em men, suckin and holdin dicks
And once you kick me down, I'm breakin you off and givin you some
I'm keepin you dressed, I'm payin yo hit, and let you drive for fun
So hoe or die, bitch, make your mind up
You're lined up and signed up, but your girlfriends wind up
Collar-poppin-broke-fake-Louis-purse-wearin tramps 
Tryin to join the next nigga camp
Suck my dick like a lollypop
Cause you can't make no money with that sloppy cock
You shouldn'ta never tried to play me, I'm a clever cat
I pay you when you work, give you money, bitch, never that

Now all you square-ass busta hoes know what time it is 
With these Richmond and Oakland players, huh?
We got some real true players in the house
Let me yell em out while they in front of my muthafuckin face
We got the muthafuckin funkmaster P Double Double E
Pee Wee in the muthafuckin house
Ant Biggedy muthafuckin Bankster
What's up Big Banks, you fartin, burpin muthafucka
We got fat ass Kris
Black CD, my boy came home to his partner
Lil' Shawn just hooked up with the crew
Asey muthafuckin pimp-as player from the Richtown 
These just niggas in the house I'm just yellin out
We got big-ass ballin-ass Funktown Dave in here
Is it all good, Dave? What's up, mayn, what's goin on?
It's all good
I'ma wind it up, take it on home right now
We got muthafuckin Rappin Ron from 890
We got Ant Diddley muthafuckin Dog comin 9000 strong
And I'm out to be out this muthafucka
Out the pussy
With no rubber</pre>
