Come on, yeah
I like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will rock
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd, Run-D.M.C., and that American pimp Kid Rock
I like Willie, Waylon, George and Merle, and a lot of ZZ Top
I like country, soul, rock n roll, and I love me some hip hop

I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
I don't like no new wave techno bands around
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit

I got a bougart and west coast chopper, that sure make them bitches stare
Got a dead flamingo wrapped around this cowboy hat I wear
I like to cuss, yell, scream, fight and rasie all kinds of hell
And if you ride to live, like I live to ride, then let me hear that rebel yell

I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
I don't like no new wave techno bands around
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit

One time for your mind, yeah

I like my whiskey straight up, daiquiri's make me ill
And if someone touches my beaver skins I get mad enough to kill
I got a rifle rack in my pick-up truck, I'm a four wheelin' maniac
And if you wanna race then just name the place and I'll show you where it's at

I'm a redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
I don't like no new wave techno bands around
I'm a drink a couple dozen beers
Go out and jam some gears
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
I'm a long-haired, redneck, rock n roll son of Detroit
And this one here, goes out to my man
The legendary David Allen Coe
