[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, we see you bust a bottle at your little table stuntin
And we comin by the bar and get to fuckin up your front and puttin
PRESSURE ON 'EM, we puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM
We puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM, we puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM
Okay, we see you in your Phantom actin cocky with your missus
Yeah you ball until you see us pull up and now them bitches puttin
PRESSURE ON 'EM, we puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM
We puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM, we puttin PRESSURE ON 'EM

[Busta Rhymes]
Ay, aiyyo
When we do this shit, now tell me why is you competin?
When I be that type of nigga that get money when I'm sleepin
And when I'm fartin and shittin I cop countries on the weekends
So ambitious my accountants cop continents when I'm eatin for me
Busta Bust, the most dominant, start retreatin
Beat the street up, shit be soundin remarkable when I'm speakin homie
Huge rechargable batteries, bitch I'm tweakin only
Short circuit electric chair voltages, every feature call me!
{*gasp*} Like I'm short for breath drownin in money rushes
Fuck a blunt bitch, I'm inhalin muffler smoke from buses
I defend my money like soldiers, I come to punish
Defense mechanism from infections the way that puss is
Ain't no fuckin around or frontin, get it?
As for gettin this bread I'm like vomit, so disgusting with it
Here's my other alias, don't forget it
Call me Snowblower, blowin this bread like it's nothin with it

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Okay, Weezy F Baby, man I gotta put the pressure on 'em
Young Money the +special team+, we so Devin Hester on 'em
Right up on your girl lips, got my dick restin on 'em
Soon as it woke up, it came, and left it on 'em
Swag with no effort on 'em, quicker than a leopard on 'em
If he got beef watch me sprinkle salt and pepper on him
No Spinderella, just plenty metal for any fellow
Semi settle everything for me, end everything for me
Smokin on that G-13 and everything funny
'Specially y'all bitch ass niggaz, kiss ass niggaz
Blood Gang, six flags nigga, no rollercoaster
Real shit, we hold the bread, the hoes hold the toasters
Young Casanova, I bend they asses over
She say my dick's stronger than a six-pack of Cola
Man I'm so fly, I got arachnophobia
Pressure bust pipes, but Weezy bust twice
Ha ha!
