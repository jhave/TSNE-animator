[Chorus]
I'll never look at life this way again
I'll never let my eyesight fade again
I can't believe mistakes that I've made again
He's God, show respect cause I'm spraying for him

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what I did, the dirt on my hand the dirt on my feet
It's like I'm walking life in the sand
Thirsty for drink, the sun's heat straight on my dome
Following the shadows of trees, to find my way home
Like is a wreck, now I show folk disrespect
Couzin I'm vexed, I thought this year I'd be pushing Lex
Back to the cracks, back to the one dollar stacks
Back to the cats with bloodshot eyes and arm tracks
Those is my dogs, fam that I can't even trust
But they call me son if I take this biscuit and bust
Chicks be the lust, every other word be a cuss
Yeah my mom cries kid, but it all about us
All about the block, all about ducking a cop
All about me in ya crib and snatching a knot
But I'm small time, all I push is nickel and dime
Game's on my mind, think I got the world sniffing lines
Think I robbed every cat and came off a couple centuries
Think every time someone rhymes, they must have mentioned me
This is your world, ya weeded minds in a twirl
Word to the Ambassador that chickenhead be my ex-girl

[Chorus] 2X

[Verse 2]
I got something for the shorties too, every thugs my boo
Got two baby father's too, that I steady screw
Weed got my eyes shut glued, think I'm Betty Boop
I roll with five girls I don't even like, my Friday crew
Yeah I call myself a woman even though I'm looking dude
Even though my mouths filthy cause I ain't in the mood
Lay on my back, all in the name of some food
But I can't get a job, I ain't finish my school
Still I'm a queen, even though I look like a fiend
Can't recall the last time that I followed a dream
Can't recall the last time I maximized my bean
Can't recall anything cause my minds full of steam
Shorty ya tripped, forty to side of my lips
Can't stand a righteous woman, she a stuck up chick
Yeah I'm jealous cause her minds right, she got up out the grime life
But yo, I want the limelight, so I bend my spine right
Cause a man is my love he cover insecurity
But I want a weak dude who won't take his authority
Dazed and confused like you Dave Chappelle
The same way you blaze that bunt you'll blaze in hell
Father forgive 'em

[Chorus] 2X</pre>
