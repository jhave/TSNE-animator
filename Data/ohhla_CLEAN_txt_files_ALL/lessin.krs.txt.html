[Chorus: April S. Williams]
Ain't no stoppin what we done

Cause with power and strength we gonna take it now
Take that stand realize the truth
Knowledge intellect bringin minds anew
There's no way they can hold us down
Cause with power and strength we gonna save you now

[KRS-One]
B, R, O, N, X
See these cars, see these checks, intellect
See these thugs, ain't no sweat, intellect
A thousand miles, how do you do it?  One step
Now check out this flow, they wanna be down, but they cain't
Original +Criminal Minded+ flow, they just ain't
ready for the real, ready to peel off the paint
Your style is fake, the teacher returns to debate
You the best?  That's bull, you questionable
Highly flexible, wasn't you sexual?
Now you hardcore?  You need to see God more
I sit on the faculty; you, you sophomore

[Chorus]

[KRS-One over Chorus]
Uhh, get 'em up
Yeah, get 'em up uhh
Yeah, uhh, that's right
That's right uh-huh, tell 'em again
It go.. get 'em up
Yeah, that's right, uh-huh
Uh-huh
Another Kenny Parker exclusive!

[KRS-One]
Time to get it, now you did it, tryin to spit it
You don't fit it, ask the critics, already did it, skipped the gimmicks
I don't mimic, metaphysics, you'll admit it, better to live it
better to give it, so I spit it every minute so you get it
My lyric is wicked an' full of culture y'all
Huh?  Battle, nah - get back in your car
Either you never heard of me or you really wanna get with me
But as your teacher let me test you for a learning disability
You feeling me?  Cause you can't, get it through your head
This is, sui-CIDE!!  You're better off dead
Let me not amp you up, cause this style you can't do what
My stomach can take it and your stomach it'll cramp you up
This is, breath control, breath control stylee
I get up all in that ass that (?) heinie
Try me, back in the days you woulda had sorrow
Try the teacher today, and you won't see tomorrow cause

[Chorus]

[KRS-One over Chorus]
Uhh, we get 'em up
Uhh, that's right, get 'em up
Yeah, uh-huh, get 'em up
Yeah, ONE MORE TIME NOW!
Uhh, that's right, get 'em up
Uh-huh, uh-huh, get 'em up I HEAR YOU
Uh-huh, I HEAR YOU, WORD UP!
LOOK AT THIS!

[KRS-One]
Like a piss on the streets I exist
Not the meat but the fish
Complete the feat when I'm speakin the heat into this
Witness Kris rippin this
Don't trip on this, skip ahead if you're ready
My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you?  On the corner with rats
when we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
like some prehistoric winged creature, AHHH!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West
I be the best, Blastmaster KRS cause

[Chorus]

[KRS-One over Chorus]
We get 'em up
Uhh, yo, we get 'em up
Like, YEAH, I SEE IT OVER THERE
I SEE IT OVER THERE, IT'S.. YEAH IT'S OVER HERE!
Uhh!  Uhh, one more time we get it up
Yeah, yeah, we get it
Uhh, uhh, IT'S OVER HERE NOW!
IT'S OVER HERE NOW!  UHH!
