[Keith Murray] + (Marvin Gaye)
Must be the MU-SIC, that got me in a zone
Step until your bones make you lose control
Take hold of your mind body and your soul
Soul.. (hahhh baby, wooooo - just like music)
As I do ya, who ya
Run right through ya, like I never knew ya, ooh
Stick to your ribs like grits
I get better with time with this shit (just like music)
Aww man, make you feel so good
I rain through your neighborhood, like a sunshower
Shine light in the darkest hour
Give the weakest man the most power (just like music)
So harmonious and sacred
Without this, I don't think the world would ever make it
When negativity come my way, that thing bang
How it sound Marvin? (Just like music)

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
  (*repeat 16X: "Music" - Erick Sermon*)
Music baby, I don't worry bout a thing
Ahhhhh turn on your music, see my happiness beam
.. just like music

[Redman]
Yo, yo, yo dogg
How you doin?  I bent my back Lex tire movin
on the hood streets, hood beats, drippin down jewelry
I'm outside where the crooks meet
But God don't give me shook feet (just like music)
Yeah, untrained untamed guerilla
I'm the one to blame when the earth start goin
(insaaaaaaaaaaaane, aww baby)
  .. shake it, shake it shake it .. (woo, music)
Yo, I can't get in the club, so what?
I got a hot dame, bout to make the drawers
(fall like raaaaaaaaaaaain - all over yo' head)
(awww baby, music)
To my deputies, call me Boss Hog
When I smoke sticky, I'm able to walk walls
And I won't fall, only thing my car stalls
But I'm in the hood nigga (just like music)

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
  (*repeat 16X: "Music" - Erick Sermon*)
Music baby, I don't worry bout a thing
Ahhhhh turn on your music, see my happiness beam
