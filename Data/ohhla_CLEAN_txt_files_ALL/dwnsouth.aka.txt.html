(Akinyele) - Hook

You I'm from New York
And connected with my down south niggas
Here this year
My nigga rap bone came to tear the club up
Yo my nigga chock came to tear the club up
My nigga joelle came to tear the club up
And this shit here should get all the thugs up
It's for (the money makers)
What (the booty shakers)
Yea (my real niggas)
And fuck who (the playa haters)
Yea (the move fakers)
Ha (the immitaters)
Yo this is for who (the money makers)
Yea (the booty shakers)
Ha (my real niggas)
Yo and fuck who (the playa haters)
Yea (the move fakers)
And the motherfucking (immitaters)

(Rap Bone)
Now where I'm from these niggas dobn't pimp they pro
Nautica shirts game hats
And nice sweats
And litle niggas got through the mall like packs of wild animals
Anticipating the showdown
In my town
Pretty (?) bitches get fucked
Then they stock just drop
They rpops go bankrupt
So tell me who's pimping heartless
From Jacksonville to Charlotte
I got some (?) goddesses
On our twenty, many
A late lonely night
We coming back from some hype shit
Like FreakNik
Possibly Daytona
Chilling with hook dogs
Smelling the aroma
Drinking wine, from 1989
I'm blinding in the dinette set
And let the sunlight shine
Making vows to remain for ill and tight
Throughout all space and time
So from here to 19 ninety something
My word is as money
I hate to hear my real niggas hungry
So I'm going to represent with my shit
And hit the public
All types of angles
Strangling niggas
With electric car wire
And calling out the frauds like we fucking on fire

Hook

(Chock)
Now most chicks get they back blown
When I let my act roll
Conference on a track phone
I chock and rap bone
Joelle will pack chrome
All through your back zone
And I'm no thug
But will still aim at your black dome
And bust you
In a honda Or if I need to Augusta
You bet we going to get crunk
We pressure in a trunk
When I catch second hand from your dank whenyou flame your skunk
Then take all your bank in the game we tunk
I'm drunk, I guzzle VS, in a bubble GS
All chrome double BS
So on top look like a brother with DS
Down Syndrome
But if you want to find me come around wisdom
How do I say this calmly
You a clown kid son
And you need a check up so go get a papshmere
And if stripped to my wear
I'd have two gats bare
Only a few cats clear
On how I do that there

(Joelle)
I wreck yous down like molecules
When I play them fools
I'm just that little nast nigga
With the ladies sneaking on the jewels
The voice is calm
But my words are strong
Like hurricanes
I might spit
A little cum shit
But it won't stop me from doing my thang
I maintain
When I slangs
&gt;From my native land
Upstate South Cleve West Anderson
It's unexpected
They expect it just the same
Just get in line
Like Carolina's in the (??)
We can't be wrong
Growing up down here
You didn't worry about no ride or no high priced gear
You got to boogy say boogy
Rode in like a champ
Wearing fake gold chain and no shirt is how we pimp
On all sides
The north south east and the west
To niggas got keys got pain got fresh
Fresh went to dope
And dope went to fat
Next thing you know the fools are busting all the gats
Except the parts
So you had to deal before dark
Smoking weed in the club
They don't dance they just just party
Drinking cold malt liquor
Country ass niggas
Booty shaking
Shake
To make them asses move quicker
I picture that
We dirty like floor mats
Ride in the sports coupes big jeeps fly

Hook

(Akinyele)
I go down south to bust a nut
On a down south slut
Look her in the face and tell her girl I want to FUUUUUCK
She be like SHIIIIIIT
There Ak-nel go with that New York DIIIIIIICK
Here take a LIIICK
I beginning grinning
Cause I'm ready to hit it up
(?????????)
Point to the light
She be like
I going to go flick it up
I'm gorilla like king kong
While you niggas is little monkeys like Mighty Joe Young
Out of town I know crackers with correct ID
In other words I95 is where you find me
And buy guns from me
In exchange for crack
Road maps
Got me transporting gats
&gt;From the north
And the south tackle that
Bringing it back
To my New York money makers
Who smoke a lot and get high like sky scrapers
Down south i know girls who straight want to rape us
My niggas Rap Bone and Chock here to tape us
My nigga Joelle got some bitches flying in from Jamaica
I got some girls in LA who play like the lakers
Shiiiiiit
Because Hoes R Us
Everywhere we go mad love they show us
Even girls who don't know us
Want to suck our dicks for us
