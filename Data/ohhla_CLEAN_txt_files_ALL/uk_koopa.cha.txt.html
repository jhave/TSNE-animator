[chorus]
Koopa, King Koopa.  He's the undisputed mixtape king
Some will try to diss him, but can only beat him in there dreams
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Go back to the studio and write some more

[Chamillionaire]
I hit 'em up with the venom
the venom will get up in 'em
The Hustses we gotta rent 'em
The grave is where I send 'em
Kill 'em the way I spit 'em
Some people can't keep up with 'em
I slow it down like O.G. Ron C do when he spin 'em
What ya know about a deal with a bigger cut
bringin' money in on a wheel barrel feel 'em up
What ya lookin' at Chamill like he finna bluff
I don't bluff, I just keep it real on real nigga stuff
You thinkin' you a bad boy, like a puff biter
Serve it on ya platter pussy I can be your provider
Never was smarter, never ever was tighter
Get ya mind correct, I'm the verse and hook ghost writer
I taught boys how to master their bars
Gettin' quite, turn it up I think they askin' for noise
Not a game mayne, I don't see no African toys
Witch doctor, one of 'em will have to be yours
Been paid, boys actin' like it's never been true
College colors in the chain boy, yellow and blue
To tell the truth, Chamillionaire is better than you
Thats the only thing that hater said that's ever been true

[Chorus]</pre>
