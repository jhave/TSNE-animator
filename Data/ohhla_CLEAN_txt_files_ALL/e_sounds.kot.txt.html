There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach
Complete, unique, in all the way around
Give me a pound from East to West Bound
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round

Plant leaves from a tree descend from a seed
Growing time is a crime separation misery
Fearlessly, I'm livin' life positively
Spiritually it's evil living carelessly
Emotionally, sometimes you sit and think
By yourself consequently remembering the past
I laughed I skipped class
Eventually negativity don't last
Growing time takes time
Pure love will never clash
Potentially stay real and show skill
Fill the field, seal the deal
Cuz there's no time to kill
Hill over hill
There's a long road ahead of us
Now-a-days I'm meeting people I can't even trust
Love not lust, good things can't be rushed
I'ma keep my head up, let my karma be plushed
Watch me as you analyze my style imitate my ways
For days you amazed
A purity and pays you better change your ways
You caught up in a daze...
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a daze
Yo, full of evil rage wrong people wrong place
It's time to turn the page because life is not a phase
Day after day, what can I say I blaze like a trail, inhale and get glazed
So check it

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach
Complete, unique, in all the way around
Give me a pound from East to West Bound
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round

Cannot keep spinning on it's axis
The world is separated into two different factions
The elevated sound and the people who will follow
Cuz the people who will follow are the people of tomorrow
Now come with me on a journey through my mind
Intrigued definitely respectably you seek and you find
The answers to the rhyme meditation and some kind
Your time is right now so go an seek the truth
Dig up your roots, get to the bottom of things
My family came in a boat we didn't own no chains
But things remain unchanged different team, same game
Outcome inevitable your just a puppet on strings
We breakin' down the walls with the elevated sound
Johnny Richter, Daddy X, and D-Loc from P-Town
We ran a rough edge and with a tracer like bic
I levitate out the place with a huge bong hit

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach
Complete, unique, in all the way around
Give me a pound from East to West Bound
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round

You can't deny that we rockin' states
Picking up vinyls supplyin' in crates
Mpcs 808s in the mic
Digital soundin' shit shows tight
Bass drums and beat boxes
Ya'll can't stop this D-Loc and X, DJ B and that Pak kid
Johnny Richter bout to spark it
In the darkness, with the Lochness monster
420's no questions nothin' but cest strains
All day everyday we all about the indo
The bongs the blunts and the different kind of homegrown
Blueberry to purple ????
Cannabis cup what roll it up I'm on tour
Don't forget the show I spit and I glow
Rearrange beats in my mouth no joke

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach
Complete, unique, in all the way around
Give me a pound from East to West Bound
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round

There's Nothing in the world that can hold us Down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round
Makin' hella beats, skate with my peeps
I love to sit and chill with my girl by the beach
Complete, unique, in all the way around
Give me a pound from East to West Bound
Nothin' in the world that can hold us down
The Elevated Sound keep the tables rollin' round </pre>
