[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Yo! Yeah, it's the world's greatest (Ruff Ryders!)
Make you throw your bikes up - Double R! (bikes up)
Make you rep your hood (rep your hood)
Now SCREAM! (SCREAM!)
Whoa-ohh-ohh-ohh (c'mon!) {*7X*}
What!

[DMX - over Chorus]
Grrrrrr
We got Swizz on the joint
We got 'Kiss on the joint
We got Styles P, Sheek Louch, Mook, Drag-On
Ruff Ryders! Ruff Ryders! Uh

[Mook]
I think I'm gettin why these motherfuckers hate me
Cause I been puttin pressure on e'rything lately
And I'm hearin pressure bust pipes kinda easy
With that bein said I apologize to BP
But to the rest of y'all, it's no courtesy
I'm not a nest so won't none of y'all bird-in/burden me
Next generation of the Double R, lights up
I'm the next nigga that's gon' make 'em throw they bikes up
I literally have millions watchin me
On stage turnin dudes to a mockery
Yeah they copy me with no cam
These niggaz is chickens in beefs steady talkin 'bout they go HAM
You confused you meat-lover
I got Swizz feelin like Dre when he made "Deep Cover"
I'm the next Double R meal ticket
Make like a deck of cards nigga, deal wit it!

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
My flow dope like the methadone clinic
Pull down the Phantom window see a don in it
Glove box, you might see the Qu'ran in it
Underneath the firearm, am I wrong wit it?
I drop the roof to be captured by the sun
Relayed my bars and remastered e'ry one
Niggaz wonderin where the fuck Drag at
I'm on Twitter hittin e'rybody back
Drag to the dash, I ain't back to claim shit
I still got the same crown I first came with
If I had to do it all again I wouldn't change shit
Now I'ma shine when the rain get thick, nigga~!

[Chorus]

[Sheek Louch]
Donnie G, yeah
Aiyyo all the pretty girls go around the outside
Porsche or the Range Rover, meet me in the ride
Windows all jet black, you ain't gotta hide
Donnie, Razor Ramon, Bobby Backlund - this my throne
Cranberry silver Patrón, they love me
Hat back like I'm 15, face clean
Nice blue jeans sittin on the Louis
I used to run base and I don't mean Matsui
A long way from Dr. Jays and Conways
I still like hoodrats, some Beyoncés
Pop off, you ain't never seen AK's
Top down, Eddie Levert in The O'Jays
Whoa, Donnie killin that UFO
It took a lil' while but Donnie gon' blow
Haters seen Sheek, nope! Donnie on the go
Might as well call me butter cause Donnie on a roll

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, aiyyo
Personally I think I'm underrated if nothin else
Ask around, they'll tell you Jada is somethin else
Motherfuck who they know
It's the kid with the, diesel bars and pull they flow
It's a couple dudes I ain't get rid of yet
But ain't no rush, niggaz is butt like the back of the cigarette
Holla when it's time for the blood to get spilt
I only negotiate for thugs to get killed
Hustler, artist, CEO
On the low blowin strawberry kiwi 'dro
Sling 'caine 'til they cut off my hands
Other than that, I'ma spit pain 'til they cut off my glands
Got work all over the stove
Get money all over the globe
And the Range all over the road
The crib and the whips is lavish
Double R mob life, 'Kiss is...

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
You know me, playin 'Kiss and Ne-Yo wit'cha bitch
Or Sheek and Carl Thomas runnin a trio on ya bitch
Shoot him in the mouth, bet you he ain't gon' snitch
... Fuckin with three bad niggaz!
Or tonguin ya girl for the teabag niggaz
She's wavy, we crazy
ADHD, know where the weight be
On the scale with the guns off safety
Eyes hazy, money, mansion, Mercedes
Surrounded by killers, O.G.'s, crack babies
Loadin up the nine, dope stay a dime
Two blunts in the Watson 749
Red wine, avocado, salad with the lime and cilantro
Head honcho rockin the poncho
Way out in Mexico
Ten for the bird, I'll let you place the decimal
Turn ya ass vegetable

[Chorus]

[DMX]
Grrrr... not again!
It's the Dog with the K's!
C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! C'mon!

You the next nigga? Well, I'm the X nigga
Name still ringin bells so fuck the rest nigga~!
Do this shit for real while, y'all niggaz is actin
I'm old school like, Andre the Giant and Bob Backlund
Cats ain't never, been able to ever
fuck with the Dog, whatever the weather
When I come through niggaz bow down like Muslims prayin
I'm just tryin to understand what these fools is sayin
Don't MAKE ME, somebody better take me outta here
This is what it comes down to? Fuck outta here!
Cats gotta fear, a nigga like me
I come through in beast mode from New York to A-Z
Bitch you fuckin crazy thinkin Dog ain't got it
Dog gon' hit it as, soon as y'all spotted
I'm strapped to the death, 'til there's half of 'em left
I'm the last of 'em left, 'til the last of my breath
C'MON!
