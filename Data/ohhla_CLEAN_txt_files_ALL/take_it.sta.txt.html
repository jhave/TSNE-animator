[Intro]
"Let's take a sec to think back, think back" - Buckshot Shorty
"M-m-m-my physical frame is celebrated cause I made it" - Nas

[Break - Paula Campbell - singing]
Baby
I, I, take it all back
I wish I, could, take it all
If only I could, take it all back

[Verse 1 - Reks]
Weight of the world on your shoulders, I just added to
Your stress, benchpressed, I had an attitude
You was so young, tryin to raise a son, in the slums, where the sun barely shine
Momma I'm just thinkin of the times
I blamed you, but should have blamed me
Cause mainly I was selfish, family 
Shouldn't be distant, as a child I should have just listened
Shit I was in, you do to self kept me sickenin
Vocal smoke sniffin, daddy pimpin
I wish when daddy died, I was more convincin
Bein a better man, to better Pam, Christine, Braylon
Tryin to make amends, want to redeem feelin
Cause me admittin my wrong, not a recipe for this song
It's therapy for the soul (oh whoa, whoa), know as long 
As you livin, I'm telling ya ma
Whatever wrong I said before, I want to

[Chorus - Paula Campbell] - w/ ad libs
Take it all back
I take it all
I take it all
I take it all
I take it all back
Hey, ewww
I wish, I wish
I wish that I could, take it all back

[Verse 2 - Ea$y Money]
Yeah, hey yo, years of the drama 
Everyday I used to wipe tears from my momma
When I ran wild, didn't care for mañana 
When I used to hustle, my man would struggle, when I wouldn't spare him a dollar
Rap to the essence, my dumbass as an adolescence 
Maybe I should've asked a few questions
The court cases, nights in jail
Livin the past five years of my life on bail
When I wilded out and pop nines crazy
Beef with his mom, but not my baby
The gats that squirt, my man layin in the casket hurts
Shit even my ass to church
All them times that I mistreated my exes
Got mad at 'em and just skeet on the next chick
F's with them sleazy hunnies (baby)
But if I took it all back, then I wouldn't be Ea$y Money
Now would I?

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Royce Da 5'9"]
Kind of like coexistin with the whack when you extra nice (nice)
Livin with regrets, but regrets is life
Play the game, play the cards your dealt the price (price)
Pray for it, short tote and extra dice
In preparation for the next life
Time waits for no man, we stand by for the next flight
For every second we lose, we gain wisdom
But people try to take back things that pain gives them
Life ain't sweet, the Lord ain't say it was fair
The price ain't cheap, I'm sure that I'm payin for prayer
For granted I take and sometimes my honor deceives 
I'm only on my knees at times when I'm in need
Baptized in black lies, momma please
That shit got to be classified as some kind of greed
Sometimes I feel I might waste it all, livin with no faith at all
In God, the Devil tryin to take it all (all, all)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

(Statik Selektah, Statik Selektah)

[Outro - Paula Campbell - singing] - w/ ad libs
It'll be alright
If I could take it all back
(Take it all)</pre>
