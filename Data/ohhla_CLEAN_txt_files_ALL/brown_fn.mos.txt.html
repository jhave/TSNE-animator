Well baby here it is (here it is)
You better step to it (step to it)
I know you ready right (ready y'all)
Then baby let's do it (let's do it)
Put your neck to it, put your arms and legs next to it
Then put whatever else is left to it
See you're all in (all in) now you about to rock 'em
Got your focus man, now they got a problem
Who you talkin to? son right there
The man in the mirror, I see him quite clear
Do your thing Cav (yeah son)
Work it out dog (work it out)
Open up their minds (open up)
Be about yours (bout yours)
Silence everyone who ever try to doubt yours
Get your mind right (mind right)
Keep your sound raw (sound raw)
Heavy bass man (bass man)
Make it bounce more (bounce more)
Make 'em feel it from to the ceilin to the ground floor

How it sound y'all? I know it's crazy, right
I know it's crazy tight, don't ever take me light
It's Cav Love y'all (Cav Love y'all)
And that's what's up y'all (sup y'all)
