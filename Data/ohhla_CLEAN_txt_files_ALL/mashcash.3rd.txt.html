Song:   Mash for Cash
Typed by: Lil Hustle


[Hook]
Mash for cash, trying to overload the stash
Boy your gun gon let your mouth, overload your ass
Now fuck a ski mask, bare faced and we blast
We hit your cuts light it up, then we dash
Don't let your mouth, overload your ass
Get smashed write a check, that your ass cash
Don't let your mouth, overload your ass
Get smashed write a check, that your ass can't cash

[E.S.G.]
Now Lord help this G, the ten commandments I done broke one
Went out my way with a AK, had to smoke one
We tote guns, E.S.G. got plenty
You got beef that's weak, you best to leave it at Wendy's
Endo and henny, got my brain set confused
Tear drop tattoo, bout to get some blood on my shoes
But fool you lose, trying to play that punky Suge Knight shit
You get your hoe ass kicked, or hit with a sixty round clip
Better close hem loose lips, or get smacked like a hoe
Niggaz accurate, cause E heart ain't black no mo'
It's Wreckshop motherfucker, so keep that plex
Now fuck a vest, gattling gun and tear a hole in your chest
A bloody mess what's next, you won't see me no mo'
SKS with a scope, when you see E oooh
Cause hoes you know and I know, can't nan nigga take mine
Want some good advice, better get your ass back across that state line

[Hook]

[D-Gotti]
Lord forgive me, I done seen had to take a man's life
Another victim of genocide, I'm talking black on black crime
Wonder formaldehyde, 14 young when I did it
Most niggaz scream killa, but D-Gotti he live it
I admit it I was wrong, but life goes on
Head stone under my belt, gotta deal with it till I'm gone
It started out Monday morning, on my way to high school
Got out my do' and then some hoes, some stolen merchandising too
Bending Screw out the do', Polo to the feet
Beep beep goes my pager, 911 emergency
That's my T. hell cream, backdo' on my way
Into the house do' kicked down, and tears running down her face
Police done wrecked the place, but the merchandise I bought
It's my fault but I'm like fuck it, he gotta pay the cost
Had to take a walk, with my nine on my side
We bumped heads I'm steaming hot, he talking down I open fire

[Hook]

[Double D]
Who got the hardest beats around nigga, who keep it underground
Who make the whole town, lay the fuck down
Don't let your mouth overload your anus, you ain't famous
Mob shit fa sho', you can't tame us
I'm riding with my shit off safety, you niggaz wanna chase me
Then run up fool, I hope to God you don't make me
Get my killas and ride, too much chaos for you to hide
4-5 between your eyes, ain't no way to survive
I got killas in fo' states, and I'll alert em at will
That way you can't do no shows, without you getting your cap pealed
For real, cause niggaz ain't no bitch in me
I got the blood of a G, running thick through me
And I'm aiming for head shots, there ain't no games to be played
You in the war field nigga, with the army brigade
It's Wreckshop no guessing, we tearing holes for testing
And fuck any nigga you impressing, with that shit you stressing
