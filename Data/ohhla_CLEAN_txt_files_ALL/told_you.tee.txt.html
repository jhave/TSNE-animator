[Intro]
Grand Hustle Pimp..
Hey, whats happenin shorty
Me being a true player and all
I mean you know as a stand up guy you know
I really hate to say I told you so
But, man I told you so
Back when we said we were goin to run this shit man
When we said Pimp Squad Click, Grand Hustle was the business
When we said their was a whole nother side of Atlanta
A nother bunch of motherfuckers in the trap, y'all didnt know

[Chorus]
Man, I told you so
They thought a pimp wasn't s'posed to blow
Because I was rappin about moving o's and blow
Pimp I told you so
They thought that Outkast closed the door
And Ludacris came in and sold his 4?
Man, I told you so
The Mac, C-Rod, Kuntry and Dro
And AK had the coldest flow
Nigga, I told you so
I said the future was right up under your nose
You thought the south wouldn't explode no more
Remember, I told you so

[T.I.]
Way back when Kriss-Kross was hollering "Jump" on ya tube
They was still gettin jumped at school, we used to tote them tools
Don't get me wrong I'll give respect to them dudes
But approach us wrong, and we'll smoke them fools, ain't no joke it's the truth
Fuck a hater, let 'em do what it do
I'm busy now, but I'll be through in a few
And then I'm coming for you
So keep shit talking like it's something to do
I'll spend a 100 grand get a killer something to do
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering "Pocket Full of Stones" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
And my pops had alot of work, alot of folk he got 'em work
And ran numbers, said if he ain't wanna, he ain't gotta work
Why I sold rocks, I guess I got from pops
My uncles ? man ? a chip off the old block
The nigga you hear now the same one from off the old block
Who used to stand on Front St. and get off the old block

[Chorus]

I remember the P$C, Killer Mike, David Banner and me and YoungBloodz
Ran through Atlanta with heat, when even Atlanta was sleep
Nigga, back before you heard of me
I was middle man into serving keys when KC was serving 3
I'm on top because I deserved to be
So simmer down, calm your nerves at least
Speak your words with peace
Before you lay out on the curb deceased
Think about it, it's absurd to beef
I took my songs to street
He told me dopeboy was the bomb in the street
Since then, my name rang like alarms in the street
Who knew how long it would be
If only LA knew how wrong he could be
I told you ain't nobody stronger than me

[Chorus]

This southern rap shit of the day is something I helped design
Puerto Rico of the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
the Snowman, Paul Wall, the Thug ?
Alot of other niggaz shouldn't of even been signed
Thats a opinion of mine
Because these niggaz be neglecting the grind
Ain't waiting on nobody to let me shine, I'ma go get me mine
And then they wonder why they checks behind
Cuz TIP was 20k? back in the day, need me to press rewind
What be on these niggaz mind, man don't get me to lyin
I seen ya kind, dopeboy, and that ain't even ya kind
Ain't never sold a gram of crack, and ain't no need of ya tryin
Back in the trap, pimp I don't see him survivin

[Chorus]</pre>
