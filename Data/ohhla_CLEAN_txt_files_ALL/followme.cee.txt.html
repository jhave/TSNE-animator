[Verse 1]
I'm goin crazy. (I'm goin crazy)
Would you like to come with me? (Would you like to come with me?)
Oooh its never to late to your mind.
I've forgotten where I've come from, (Forgotten where I've come from)
I can't remember where I'm goin. (I can't remember where I'm goin)
So when you take my hand, just got to trust me eventhough I'm blind.

[Hook]
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Follow me.
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Ooooooooh mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

[Verse 2]
Are you there yet? (Baby are you there yet?)
Do you even care yet? (Do you even care yet?)
Leave that forever as long as your fears are far behind.
But first you got to trust me. (But first you got to trust me)
This is your destiny it must be. (This is your destiny it must be)
So take my hand I've seen the promise land eventhough I'm blind.

[Hook]
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me.
Ooooh I can set you free if you,
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me. Yeeeeeeah.

[Verse 3]
You've got to believe in something. (In something)
So why not believe in me?
Because of everything, you've probably seen
is not what it seems, cuz life is a dream
You've got to believe in something. (Believe in something)
So why not believe in me?
Because of everything, you've probably seen
is not what it seems, cuz life is a dream

Rock. Roll. Rock. Roll. Rock. Roll. Rock. Roll.

[Verse 4]
Mmmmmmmm yeah.
And if tomorrow is takin to long. (Too long)
And yesterday is too far away. (Far away)
Every reality of what you believe in begins to bind. (Ooooh)

And I'll come runnin. (And I'll come runnin)
Take my hand I'll understand eventhough I'm blind.

[Hook]
Follow me. Follow me. Follow me.
