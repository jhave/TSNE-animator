[Chorus - Chamillionaire]
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
Always bout my G's
You can see it in my eyes
You can see it in my eyes
 
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
Money on the rise (always bout my G's)
You can see it my eyes
 
[Verse 1 - Chamillionaire]
They say I'm doing my thing boy is you awake or what
Ernest got the 450 looking like you can taste the truck
Forget working for people getting my power and paper up
Americas top model watch is that a pretty face or what
I make a vehicle and sell it like its e-bay
You know I get my money back like its a re-bay
I drop a mixtape and they party like its they b-day
They diss jockin so I'ma call 'em dj's
Know 4 killas then trust that I know 4reala
Stay on ya turf and in dirt like a 4 wheela
4reala now everybody's a gold digga
Beer face 4 the paper I get so BITTER!
Like fat pat when I rap they say "love it man"
Prince Hakeem paper shout out to the motherland
Fat stacks that you can't fit inside a rubberband
Big straps one I can't fit inside my other hand
Club for free like the bartenders 
Boys talkin noise like you really gonna try to holla maaan
I gotta army that be on to you before you can
You tryin to stand behind a bush like a republican
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
You on the top they gonna hate ya  (hate ya)
You on the bottom they goin break ya  (break ya)
Thats why I'm always bout my paper
And it ain't no surprise that my money's on the rise
I know why you act like a faka  (faka)
I know that hatin's in ya nature  (nature)
Thats why I'm always bout my paper
And it ain't no surprise that my money's on the rise
At paid-n-full even swisha
He told me that I'm walkin with ya
Even told me that when I feel lonely I ain't the only 1 in the picture
Haters don't shoot to miss ya so wear the shoe if it fits ya
They load up the tool to get ya they throw it at you like plika,plika,plika
I know people don't understand me
They have some problems with homies then have some problems with family
But I don't ever fold it don't matter what car they hand me
Just when I thought evil had me I looked up and won a grammy
Maannn!
