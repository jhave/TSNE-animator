[Intro: Yung Joc] + (Ms. B)
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
How many bitches from the club want go
I knowwww you see it; I knowwww you see it

(How many niggaz in the club want go)
(I knowwww you see it; I knowwww you see it)

[Yung Joc]
Now you can call me tip drill, they playin my songs
Throw a couple ones, then she throw away her thongs
When she bust it open, take a picture with my phone
She love my cologne, call it perk body zone
Now she pussy poppin, yeah it's goin down
Slap the waitress on the booty, tell her get another round
And when I make it rain, money all over the ground
Fresh Force Ones, Sean John buttoned down
And then I'm like, "Ohh, boy, my click full of stars"
Big fo'-fifth, big dick and big cars
At the end of the day when it's all said and done
I'ma need fo' freaks, cause I need more than one
