[Hook - 2x]
Put your hands up, put your hands in the air
Move them hoes side to side, like you really don't care
Put your mug on mean, cause you know we be thugging
H-Town in the house, that's the way that we clubbing

[Big Pokey]
I'm a H-Town nigga, stay down nigga
Parking lot of the club, is the playground nigga
Boys pulling up, pushing sixteen switches
Five to sixes, Movados wrapping they riches
I'm in the lot barely, and I'm handling the scene
Four fifteens banging, bout to crack the screen
Jumping out clean, me Spitter and E
Paid the valet fee, and hit the V.I.P.
We hogging the set, one deep dogging the Vette
Moet and Cristal spills, all in the Lex
Hoes in check, rocking with they hands in the air
Moving side to side, like they really don't care
Baguettes gon glare, cause my piece is iced up
19 inch buttons, got the streets light up
And diced up nigga, with the monitor falling
Plus my mug on mean, cause I'm a ball-a-holic

[Hook - 2x]

[Chris Ward]
I'm dranked out and danked out, in my SES Lac
Trunk cracked niko paint, with the fifth at the back
Vogues burning and ripping, 4's turning and tipping
Poking and clipping niggaz, cause I swang when I'm grain gripping
Candy paint stain dripping, got the hoes flipping
Four 18's in the trunk, beating like a ass whipping
Bitches strictly hitting, when I pull up knocking
Southside and shocking, bouncing and body rocking
Bumper unlocking, dragging and hanging low
I'm looking like a million dollars, and smelling like endo
Gucci from head to toe, matching Faragamo
Platinum piece with iced out Roll's, got your eyes rolled
Gangstas cutting through the do', catching attention
Surrounded with ballers bodyguards and henchmen
Chris Ward, Big Poke' and that H-A-W-K
That's the gang to get it from, until the break of day
So whenever whenever what, we fall in your club
Don't hate participate baby, and put your hands up

[Hook - 2x]

[H.A.W.K.]
Nigga what nigga what, put em up put em up
While I sit on grey leather, in my 6 thoed bus
Pop em up pop em up, sip syrup Robatus'
While I makes these hoes lust, then they feel the bumrush
Pick her up shut it up, keep it crunk in the club
Do the bump shake your rump, go on show your boy love
Spitting flows wrecking shows, nigga everybody knows
When I wreck it get naked, take off your panty hose
Marble flo's matching do's, whenever ride to you hoes
I suppose you don't know, that I'm stacking payroll
I admit I'm the shit, dropping my bumper kit
So much ice on my wrist, I think my arm frostbit
Vicious lock like a pit, when I make a smash hit
And when my pen touch this paper, awww shit
Raise the roof get loose, on these vocals that I say
Body rock and Southside, with the H-A-W-K

[Hook - 2x]
