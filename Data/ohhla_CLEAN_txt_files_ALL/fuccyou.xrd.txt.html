[X-Raided]
X-Raided, say it three times
In the dark and the gun he carries up
Spray it three times to the heart like Bloody Mary
But not the alcoholic beverage nigga
I'm the type to get after the tightest dog for leverage nigga
I'm competitive nigga
I slay more people than you
And I'm a predator nigga
Way more evil than you
Spray a Desert Eagle at you
Let your flesh roast in fire
And that's [?] I'm Jesus West Coast Mesiah, what's ya'll
And recognize this
It's my life that'll make the nicest rapper
You know, bow down and kiss my Nikes
I wish ya'll, would be real
Instead of prime time actin'
Speakin' behind my back like chiropractors
I got the nitro factor
Send my ho at you
She got the gat, and that's for real
I'm a hydro bastard, like caine
Foo you ain't able to play my game
That's why you get live ones to the gun
Every time you day my name

[Chorus]
I wish ya'll had the balls to just tell me the truth
You thinkin' fucc X-Raided
But I'm screamin' fuccyoutoo
Wish ya'll quit playin' the role like it's all cool
You thinkin' fucc X-Raided
But I'm screamin' fucc ya'll too
I wish ya'll had the balls to just tell me the truth
You thinkin' fucc Madman
But we screamin' fucc ya'll too
I wish ya'll quit playin' the role like it's all cool
You thinkin' fucc Madman
But I'm screamin' fucc ya'll too

[X-Raided]
I wish ya'll niggas'll understand
We'll whack your kinfolks
If we go broke we got plans cuz we Jack-ramento
Rep your city, nigga Sac-A-Indo
Where niggas pity square ballaz
Cuz the killaz is quick to mack your mental
[?] fits at the town
Bitch we'll jack your rental
Wish ya'll niggas would recognize this, Sacramento
Step aside nigga don't you feel the Earth vibratin'
Rise up out the grave
All my niggas heard Brian Haydan
Resurrected, I'm the real nigga reanimated
And life is hectic
Strong enough to make a man be a hater
I suspected ya'll niggas was schemin'
To step to me mean
Cuz every time I see you I hear the Jeopardy theme
Then I got more answers for yo ass
Than Iverson and Alex Trebeck combined
Splatter you spine when I blast
Shatter your neck wit a nine
Add up the sets
24 plus 6-8 plus deuce-9
Equals 121 niggas willin' to grab you until you die

[Chorus]

[X-Raided]
Mutha fucca!

Livin' in X's shoes nigga
So we give all these shout outs nigga
Naw fucc shout outs, we givin' out fucc you's nigga
