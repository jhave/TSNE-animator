[Chorus]
We can have peace, some days we gon' fight
And I'm gon' stay this way my whole life
Make it out the slums doin' wrong doin' right
Everything ain't easy
And lately
It's not candy from a baby
Makin' that gravy
Don't let it hold you back
So take heed, when I was young my momma told me that
Everything ain't easy

[Verse One] [Charlie Smarts]
When you see that long arm stretch
That I.R.S.
Are we headed far? Yes
Make it out the projects
Small bills of cash and large checks
Credit card debt
Charles In Charge regardless
We don't try it unless it's our best
Smoke cigars when I'm stressed
Like them people talkin' funny with an accent
Money in that mattress
Sunny with them glasses on, and stay maxin' in
Boats and yachts and dope spots, the sho' shot
We deserve a toast cot
Haters seem to hope not
It don't stop
This is movement music
Got you groovin' to it
And we movin' units
Stackin' iceberg lettuce
Steady havin' cabbage
It's my turn to relish
Rocks with a lot of carrots and
Trips to Paris
Hits like Roger Maris
Give me an inch
I'm ballin' for Miles like Darius
Hilarious

[Chorus]
We can have peace, some days we gon' fight
And I'm gon' stay this way my whole life
Make it out the slums doin' wrong doin' right
Everything ain't easy
And lately
It's not candy from a baby
Makin' that gravy
Don't let it hold you back
So take heed, when I was young my momma told me that
Everything ain't easy

[Verse Two] [Chaundon]
There's no money that's a problem
Mo' beef, no peace
If I don't get a piece I'm raisin' heat
Word to your Jesus piece
Grew up in the struggle, stomach growlin', niggas hungry
Gotta eat, lookin' toward the booth or streets to make this money
Use the rap game
(Make a name)
Cars, clothes
(And a chain)
Fly hoes, smoke dro, till we all
(Look the same)
Honestly I ain't in it for the culture
Ain't no love in this shit no more
Game full of vultures
So I keep my eyes on the prize
Go for delf
Cause I realize I'm in this world by myself
They say I'm livin' greasy y'all
(Everything ain't easy dawg)
Fuck that I'm doin' me
(I ain't here for please y'all)
Get the picture?
I thought Kodak told ya
A thousand words will open up the minds of Minolta
And when it's all said and done
I'll be where I need to be
It won't be easy
But I'll be where I need to be

[Chorus]
We can have peace, some days we gon' fight
And I'm gon' stay this way my whole life
Make it out the slums doin' wrong doin' right
Everything ain't easy
And lately
It's not candy from a baby
Makin' that gravy
Don't let it hold you back
So take heed, when I was young my momma told me that
Everything ain't easy</pre>
