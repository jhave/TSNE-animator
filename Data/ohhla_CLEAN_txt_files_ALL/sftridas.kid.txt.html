[Frost]
(Verse 1)
Q-vo, aqui estoy
It's the new Frost
I got somethin' for the riders, that like to floss
My Chevy's lowered
And it's on Daytons
I roll down the street and the juras start hatin'
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
In a SS Impala
Dressed to kill
It's in my blood to be a real lowrider
Take a heina to the tele
And pull a all-nighter
Chicago knows that I'm brown and proud
So from L.A. to New York
My tapes play loud
Right now
I'm in the Yay
And I'm high off the big sticky green bombay
I'm with my homeboys, my ties, my camaradas
Latino Velvet clicka so pa mi no dige nada
Yo soy chingon, player
Like Al Capone, player
And real riders
They never sleep alone, player
Some of y'all be hatin' cause my game is tighter
It's not for you anyway
Cause this for the riders

Chorus:
Just a little somethin' for the riders
Westsiders
Eastsiders
Just a little somethin' for the riders
Northsiders
Southsiders

(Verse 2)
Rollin' in the calles, cruisin' in a caro
I keep a suavecito by my side like Malo
Tu no sabes nada, your game is hollow
And Big Daddy Frost is a hard act to follow
Still, you try to act cool
But you should know
It goes down in the back of the low-low
You just a peewee, you can't get none ever
You can't see me, fool
I got cheddar
And all the riders throw it up (Throw it up)
From the west to the east, we can sew it up
Roll one up
And pass me the lighter
Yeah, this is for the riders

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Dipping in the low-low, headed for the bolo
With the Convoy riders, I never roll solo
And when I go out alone
I pack
I told so, the chavalas, cous' don't never get my scratch
Everytime, that I hit the street (I hit the street)
I got to have a breezy in the passanger seat (In the passenger seat)
Just like the song
This is for the Raza
I gotta stay heated everytime I leave the casa
And when we roll out of state
On golden candy paint
Hittin' switches
And bouncin' on a scrape plate
Gangsta leanin' on them white wall tires
Slow and low
And this is for the riders

Repeat Chorus</pre>
