[Chorus: Eminem]
The days are cold, livin without youuuuu (without youuuuu)
The nights are long, I'm growin olderrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
I miss the days of old, thinkin about youuuuu (thinkin about youuuuu)
You may be gone, but you're never overrrrrrrrrrr

[Eminem]
If Proof, could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's somethin in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means suicide homie you'll never throw me, off of this course, blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin awards homie
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world when you're the only
one with the balls in your shorts to leave their jaws on the floors with no re-
-morse, 'member that when they get to doggin your boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin about bolog-na
I'm not gonna stop the saga continues, no stoppin the force Obi
I'm moppin the floors with 'em, I keep tryin to pass it but they keep 
on droppin the torch and it won't be, long 'til the sport is O-V-
E-R, Just Blaze and me we are knockin them doors and no we
ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be
careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double O-P, let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And it don't stop, ohhh
And it don't quit, ohhh
And I miss youuuu, ohhh
I just miss youuu, ohhh
I just miss youuu, ohhh
And homie I'll never forget you, noooo

[Eminem]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the "dyna" in "mite"
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC, wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Guess that the best thing I can do right now Doody for you is to rep
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah I'ma do it to death
And instead of mournin your death, I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics
Cause the way that I'm feelin to-night, everything I can just do right
There's nothin that I could do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype
Just finish the rhyme and bust it - excuse the corny metaphor
but they'll never +ketchup+, to all this energy that I've +mustard+
So God just, help me out while I fight through this grievin process
Tryin to process this loss is makin me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin me hostage, I've been patiently watchin
this game pacin these hallways; you had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em holmes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I'm goin insane without you
Matter fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me "Naw Doody you're not," layin on that table I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "Think of Hailie" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody

[Chorus]
