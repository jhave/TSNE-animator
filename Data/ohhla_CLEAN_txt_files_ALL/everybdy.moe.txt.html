Wave em side to side, like you just don't care

After the show, me and Moe is in the back

[Hook]

[D-Gotti]
I'm in Coco Vanelle
Up in the club, like it's the old K Farrell
Peeping lil' mama, in the go-go pair
Screwston Texas baby, that Southside so so for real
Baby, I love the game
Came through the do' ice, hanging off my chain
Stress is a strain, get away from me
Sugar fuck what you going through, you ain't bout to clown me
You'll learn to find me, after the show with my dick in your bitch
And couldn't care about you hollin' bout, me and you quit
Speakers are, him brawl in the streets
Catch me at the hottest spot, where the playas meet
Destined by the 3, getting winks from across the room
On a whole 'nother note, up under a fool moon
The team and Toon, about to blow like C-4
And y'all know when Gott-O, touch track that boy go so

[Hook - 2x]

Everybody, we came to party</pre>
