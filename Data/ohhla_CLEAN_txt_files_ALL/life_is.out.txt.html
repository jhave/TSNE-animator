Life is what you make it nigga
Get up off your ass and get some
Always hollering about you want something nigga

Verse 1: Young Noble

Yo, I've been abducted by the block
But I had to escape
Imagine my fate
Traveling and stacking the cake
After my wake
Bust 25 for me
'Cause I'll ride for y'all
And y'all ride for me
I ain't trying to have no sad story in the end
Me and my people all we want is glory in the end
I ain't gonna tell you again
Start thinking about your future nigga
No extra weight 'cause we ain't got nothing to do with you
If  time is money you wasting the clock
Pacing the block
They hooked now tasting the rock
Thinking of Pac and Yak
So we mash blinded
Gonna be Hell 4 a Hustla
Till the gats find me
And you can ask 1-2
He used to be on new
And you can ask swift gotti
Don't shit get by me
Ask tommy showtime if I did my time
And you can ask L Dog if I ever felt y'all
And ask rock jock if I ever chopped rocks
The block hop
Like Wayne
We remain the top spot
Life is what you make it so we making this spot pop
Life is what you make it so we making this spot pop

Chorus:

Young Noble:
Edi life is what you make it
You living to die
Homie life is what you make it
I'm gonna get it and ride

Edi:
Know life is what you make it
And baby
I'm a Made Nigga
Live it up
Give it up until my grave nigga

Kastro:
Yo life is what you make it
This Thug Life is sacred
We can't shake it
So we don't fake it

Young Noble:
Hey yo
Life is what you make it
We born to ball
I'm warning y'all
Why you think we born Outlawz

Verse 2: Kastro (Edi)

23 years of tears
I cry not again
I wake up early
Surprised I'm still living (uh)
We knowing
Choking life
Holding on
My family tree hopeless
Still I remain strong (strong)
It ain't a pastry
It ain't sweet or tasty (come on)
Bitter is bad liver
But still embrace (come on)
I take slow breaths
Exhale a slow death
Euphanasia
Ain't nothing that can save us (come on)
It what you make it
Thug Life is sacred
We can't shake it
So we don't fake it (so we don't fake it)
Space it(yeah yeah)
It ain't no time for wasting (come on)
All I
Fall I
Means we go out blazing (uh)

Verse 3: Edi

We go to hold on a little bit longer
It feel good
Look my team getting stronger
It seems like we done weathered the storm
But I know all that really means is that it's really on
Oh yes
We been out here
Trying to do my thing
So many niggas hating on us
Driving me insane
Doing that shit behind them closed doors
Talking bout the Lawz
Light some more ??
I penetrate your whole existence with precision
Splitting your wig
Making that bitch a split decision
Thug living although my mama taught me much better
I was addicted to the streets
I couldn't leave until I touched cheddar
And better than my heart
A soul of a rebel
I'm gonna do it my way
I ain't never ever gonna settle
I got my niggas and my metal
We all on a mission
The goal is to get dough
And stay cold
Keep tripping'
Come on

Chorus:

Young Noble:
Edi life is what you make it
You living to die
Homie life is what you make it
I'm gonna get it and ride

Edi:
Know life is what you make it
And baby
I'm a Made Nigga
Live it up
Give it up until my grave nigga

Kastro:
Yo life is what you make it
This Thug Life is sacred
We can't shake it
So we don't fake it

Young Noble:
Hey yo
Life is what you make it
We born to ball
I'm warning y'all
Why you think we born Outlawz

Verse 4: Napoleon

I woke up in the morning
My Tec 9 on the dresser
Glock 9 for the pressure
Get my money
Leave them niggas naked
Fuck you ??
You know you get buried
Niggas never ever learn
Facing ??
But I hop glocks
And this shit cock
You know I ain't even trying to rock
If life is what you make it
I'm gonna make your shit hot
Nigga you ain't know
I ride for the dough
Besides my outlaw niggas
I cry cry for the goal
My life is aiight
But shit gonna change
Since money don't grow on tress
Beggar get on your knees
Life is what you make it
And nigga I'm a Made Nigga
Live it up or give it up till my grave nigga

Chorus:
