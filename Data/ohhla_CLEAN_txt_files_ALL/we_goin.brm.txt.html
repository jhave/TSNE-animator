Aiyyo Mega' gimme some of that barefoot jungle shit
and let me shake a leg nigga!  (Megahertz)

[Verse One]
Ever felt the fire burn like this (burn like this)
You shocked that I've returned like this
Stern like shit'll make you firm like this
C'mon, while we make the bitches yearn like this
Pearl white shit'll make the world hype quick
and earl like knowin I'm bonin your girl like this
Act sweet (BOY) nigga we pack heat so (BACK BOY)
Stack money like a Backstreet Boy
Track sheet, never whack, bitches hittin in my back seat
Love my flick up in the Black Beat boy
So move your black feet boy, make bitches bounce to this
Don't let me have to let the mac speak boy
Track meet boy, hundred meter dash, straight to the trash
You corny rhymin on them whack beats boy (C'MON)
And you know we rock on and on
And make the bitches wanna bounce, all night long and
And to my gettin money niggaz keep ballin (c'mon)
You know we bout to take it to the next mornin

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Get your big ass on the floor!
You know we goin' do it to ya (alright)
You know we goin' do it to ya (alright)
You know we doin' do it to ya (alright) nigga 

Get your big ass on the floor, C'MON!!

[Verse Two]
The Range Ro' and everything you see is paid fo' nigga, c'mon
Change flow and then we lay low
Chase mo' money, fuck I wanna waste dough fo'
Stack peso, big money know my small money
probably bigger than your WHACK payroll
Money get your hands off of me, dance all night
Break bitches hot and sweaty take your tight pants off for me
So horny, shorty pull your plans off on me
Whylin out, while shorty ditchin her mans off for me
So simple, there go the champagne glass
When your pour, make sure the whole entire thing full
Sinful!  Still shorty puttin the somethin on me
Brushin on me, whylin and feelin and touchin on me
Whatchu play fo'? (RRAH!) When I hop up in my two do'
Great sex and do it, say no mo' (RRAH!)
Make those, know nigga we got heat big
Block sheets and shit and stay up on the hot street though (RRAH!)
Get high shit (RRAH!) fly bitches runnin the flo'
Hollerin and screamin this my shit! (RRAH!)
Count that in the amounts that amount to the ceiling
I know you love the way we bounce back nigga
Gimme my ounce back nigga, Flipmode back in the spot
You can run and go announce that nigga, c'mon

[Chorus]

Get your big ass on the floor
