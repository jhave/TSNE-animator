[Intro]
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know

Yea, I'm a be straight forward with this one baby
I'm gon cut no corners
Might as well get this out the way

[Verse 1]
It's like every other day or night
You on that Don King shit, tryna start a fight
I gave you things that you never seen in yo life
You left in my grains, I couldn't sleep right
I just wanted to keep gifts on your dresser
You just wanted to raise my fuckin blood pressure
I put you on with things like Alexandra Wang
Crocodile handbags, I showed you other lanes
Now I heard you with a ball playa
Tell him I ain't mad at all playa
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
But it's still trash though
I know I'm an asshole but you don't really wanna hear what I think of your ass hoe
I'll give you a pass though
Throwing dirt on my name, hoping that it spread out
Same girls you throwing dirt too thirsty when the club night out

[Chorus]
Thought I found love, got my soul changed
I'm on some new shit, fuck all my old thing
I got a new attitude like Patty
And a new bad bitch to call me daddy
Thought I found love, got my soul changed
I'm on some new shit, fuck my old thing

[Verse 2]
They say it ain't no sunshine when she's gone
But what if it wasn't no sunshine when she was dead
My mom said she bumped into you last week
I told er might sound odd but I don't even care
No multiple choice but baby check me out
I got a new girl better than the devil's child
She got her own house, her own BM Dub
And she don't be all groupied out, when she out up in them clubs
Real nigga, til the end of my days
Hell yea, I meant my feelings bitch, I feel played
I'm a hustler, you had me looking like a sucker
So I say this with all of my heart, motherfuck ya
I was your ladder, you was just another girl
I made you matter
I would wish you the best but honestly I don't
So catch amnesia next time you think bout hittin my phone

[Chorus]
Thought I found love, got my soul changed
I'm on some new shit, fuck all my old thing
I got a new attitude like Patty
And a new bad bitch to call me daddy
Thought I found love, got my soul changed
I'm on some new shit, fuck my old thing

[Outro]
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know
Real talk tho
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know
Mean girl
It reminds me that you know</pre>
