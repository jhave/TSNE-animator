Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohhhhh
Nah just kidding, ha....ha...ha
Ay! ay ay ay!
Welcome to the side of the world where we just do
What the fuck we want to
And smoke how we wanna smoke
And fly
Up above the sky
Fly with me as I go around the world
Boys and girls, here it is

[Chorus]
Well I'ma smoke (I'm gon' smoke)
Until I choke (until I choke)
And I'ma drank (I'ma shole drank)
Until I can't (until I can't)

See I'ma smoke (yes I'ma smoke)
Until I choke (until I choke)
And I'ma dra-a-ank (I'ma drank)
Until I can't (until I can't) oh oh
Oh ye-heah

[Baby]
Smokin hydro-phonic and I'm high as a kite
Sippin on some crissy on a Saturday night
Mind on my money and my money on my mind and i got
Freaks at the teley ready to, do a nigga all day all night
Drinkin on a bottle of that seriousness
Tell that bitch that you wit to mind her bizz-a-ness
Cause she'll be under the spreads
Givin me head in a Holiday Inn
Under the cover
Drunk as a mutha fucka
Me and her friend
Got the OG goin on til 6 in the morn'
We gon' drink, we gon' smoke, we gon' make us a porn
Now tell the TRUTH, ABSOLUT make ya wanna have SEX
But BaCARDI
Make you NAUGHTY
You don't have to use X
But weed is what you need to get yo mind flowin right
But HENESSEE is ENERGY, we fuckin tonight
And RUM'll make you NUMB
Make your dick stand strong
And CHRONIC is BIONIC, make the sex last long

[Chorus]

[Mannie Fresh]
Now, y'all see, I'm at a point in my life
Where don't shit matter to me but smokin
Ya know?
They don' turned my mutha fuckin lights off
But I got a lighter, and I'm gon' smoke
And if I had 5 mutha fuckin dollas left
And I had to eat or smoke
I'm gon' mutha fuckin' smoke
Ya know?
If, if was a 5th we'd all be drunk mutha fucka

Wooo
See? That's how I get down
I'm gon' smoke til I blow up
Drink til i throw up
And pass out on somebody kitchen flo'
Roll me another fuckin fat one
And go back to the liquor sto'
Goodnight mutha fucka! (Muah!)
Smoke on!!</pre>
