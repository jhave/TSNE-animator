Rah-rah-rah Digga
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Check it out now uh
Dirty Harriet!
Dirty Harriet!
Dirty Harriet! Yeah!
Where's my sisters?
Where's my sisters?
This one's for the brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Said I be rappin' for da ladies
What's up ladies?
But this one's for da brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Yeah check it out now

Now I'm the baby in the family
And I got three siblings
Three older brothers and we trying to make a living
So we hustle and we bubble
And we coming up fast
Ain't gon' never be the same
Since mom and pops past
The oldest one, child prodigy no doubt
Every since he was a kid used to ride a bitch out
All grown up now
Nice job, nice clout
Nice wife, nice house, try-na take the right route
Treat sis like a queen brother gave me everything
Any time I got in trouble he could probably pull some strings
Walk daddy's footsteps and career same speed
Made the greatest big brother and a father to his own seed
(Uh-oh) But something happened on the job, he started snappin'
Problems with the wifee, winging out and started cappin'
Tried to turn himself in just to make things right
Ended up taking flight cause he's not the jail type

The lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say
Because
Rah Diggaremains raw
(Follow the rules)
(Ya hear me, huh?)

Now I got a second brother me and this one was closer
Made me a little tom boy like he was supposed to
Tearing up the place blowing weed in my face
Irresponsible to death parents stayed on his case
Probably cause he wanted to be the baby in the family
Drinking with his friends, macking up
Mommy carried me, look half way crook getting crazy on the mic
Wasn't really into rap but the shit sound tight
He used to tell me all the time
Don't wet none sis
By this time next year we gon' be dumb rich
That's when I heard the ill
My physical got killed
Just a couple of weeks after signing a record deal
Now somebody gots to bust and have to get a little tough
And on the block round the clock
Niggas ain't seen nothing
Yeah right
Never seen a brother more determined or eager
Moms and pops couldn't see it
Now we not gonna see it either

The lesson of today
You have to listen to each and every single word I have to say

Now my last and final brother, kinda something out the norm
Some say part depressed some say part deformed
Record unclean since his early teens
In and out the youth house
Playing all the crime scenes
Early hangin' with fiends smoking all types of things
He used to chase a basketball now he chasing pipe dreams
From the door, shit was wrong undetected too long
Bugged out when he was little
Now he big that was wrong
Little too early had to kick him out the house
He just wanted some attention that's what dad was all about
He used to bust down the door
Moms cry, pops fight
Even family counseling couldn't make this shit right
Word on the street every body wanna do him
&gt;From his so-called boys to all the chickens he was screwin'
Anybody get the chance, who will probably unload?
How much longer sis got before the last brother gone
OH NO!

[Outro]
Peace y'all this is the first lady of the Flipmode Squad
Rah Digga (Uh-huh)
I wanna take this time out to say thanks to everybody
Who went out and copped my shit
For those of y'all who's listening and didn't go cop your own copy
I suggest you go handle your BI
Now I'm about to take this time out to plug the next
Flipmode Squad album (Okay) the Rulership album (Okay)
I wanna plug the next Busta Ryhmes solo LPAnarchy
And I'm pluggin' the Outsidaz (Hey-dey-dey)
Ya know what I mean? Bricks City all day (Night Life)
Now for those of y'all who think I purposely make my voice deep
Try-na sound like some extra hard core, whatever, whatever
Fuck all y'all alright cause
This is me, this is who I be
This is my voice and you got no choice
And on that note I just wanted to say
Cheers to another thousand years
Of shit poppin' dope emceein' and I write my own rhymes y'all
Dirty Harriet!
But before I forget don't touch that dial y'all
Make sure y'all stay tune to check out
These next couple of bonus tracks I left y'all with</pre>
