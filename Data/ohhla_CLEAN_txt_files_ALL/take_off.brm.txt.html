Take off your shoes
Make you dance in your socks
For blocks
Nigga be dippin a million.

Better pause and take a look.
There's a whole lot of whores.
Run up in a storm.
Bitch a try to take you for yours for sure.
  
Word up yo!
And just get what you can.
Catch it, so just play it on a record
And take it off until you ass naked.
  
Word to mother.
Shorty stack like a horse.
Pushin a force.
Lookin to floss.
Diana Ross.
  
Flow better.
One of the biggest seller.
Tell me what ever.
Wether a nigga stack mozzarella
  
I'm a get ya.
I ain't comin with ya.
Hit ya,

That will really split ya.
