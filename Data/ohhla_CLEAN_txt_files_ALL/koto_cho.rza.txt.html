"Koto... Chotan..." 

[RZA] 
Yo, yo, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah, I'm not reneggin' 
I don't fuck with dead pigeons or the pigskin 
You fuckin' fake 85% snake 
Derelict ass bitch, your class in dead weight 
Ain't no fire escape from hell, every devil ain't pale 
I blast like H.G. Wells: "War of the Worlds" 
Allah is Lord of all, you sure to fall 
Collapse like the Berlin Wall, while I'm just hurlin' ya'll 
Lightin' bolts ---- by writin' quotes 
Strikin' jolts that frightenin' to adults 
A to Zig-Zag you get smacked, all in a shitbag 
Bust like the spermbag, because your germ had 
You on some ol' fake thug shit 
Drunk from the drink, gassed up by the drug shit 
Wrong analysis: kidney shot cause dialysis 
While the Gods rebuildin' Jerusalem, golden palaces 
Babes in Wonderland wonderin' where the fuck Alice is 
While you're jerkin' your dick catchin' mad callouses 
Slave labor steel drivin' like John Henry 
Layin' down underground tracks for nine pennies 

[Masta Killa] 
Huh, get you amped off the anthem 
Yeah, I get you amped off the uh... 
Yeah, look, another smash hit 
My niggas from the Boulevard 
East New York Squad in the yard gettin' ripped, at least 24 a clip 
A 100 men stompin' your face the wolves barkin' 
Careful, you might get trampled, caught flashin' 
Wrap him in the maskin' tape, Jimmy Baskin 
Murder was the case when the crowd break fool 
Iron Mic Duel, held down by the poolside 
Along came a spider spun spools in the cipher 
Swing with all your might, lead spray from the sawed-off pipe 
Stenographer type, the ghetto hype slang 
Flow like water off the brim in the rain 
No escapin', Iron Maiden, check matin' 
Grandmaster Flash spinnin, P.F. cuttin' 
The sticky Ave. gooey, roll in the frontal leaf 
Jamel Irief smash teef in be 

[Tash Mahagony] 
Some people lyrics ain't hot 
My delivery is ill on the mic and I rock 
So hot, this stage should be a stainless steel pot 
Leavin' burnin' pains Neosporin couldn't stop 
On cats who couldn't rock 
Would shook 'cause I drop 'em 
Fear is a probelm in this game if you got 'em 
My mic I carry the heat for rappers playin' possum 
'Fraid that I'm a see 'em, spit a rhyme, lyrically drop 'em 
Just to say I got 'em, but it's realer than that 
I'm about more that what you see and what I speak in my rap 
So be conscious of that 
Grand told you, "Watch the quiet ones, you didn't get it?" 
You think that you could rip a chick who spit her lyrics 
Pretty rhymes so tight my lyrics did it 
Got you open and it worked it and you won't admit it 
Hopin' that we both forget it 
These ain't no one night stand lyrics, I'm never really finished 
Got you duckin', tryin' to pivot, beware 
Next time, come wit' it
