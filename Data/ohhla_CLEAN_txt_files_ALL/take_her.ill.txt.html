Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

"Looked her up and down, said hmm I'll take her"
	--&gt; Parrish Smith {*1}

[BM] Hoooooooo-ooh!  {*1}
[BM] I'll take her.. {*1}
[BM] Hoooooooo-ooh!  {*1}
[BM] I'll take her.. 
[BM] Oooooooh-ooooh-oohh, ohhh yeahhhh {*1}

Verse One: Al Skratch

Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
any girl walkin through my hood if she's lookin good
And if she's somethin fine, I'll be humpin hind
Let's get it on, ain't nuthin wrong, with a little Bump N Grind
(Bump N Grind)  Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the _Homiez_
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis
You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin
You in the mood for some Sexual Healing (sexual healing!)
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin
Starin, but not - carin, about, what you - wearin
You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo
I be the dough money-maker rump-shaker
To the bedroom I said "hmm I'll take her"

[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
     Don't waste her time, don't waste no time
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
     I'll take her, I'll take her

Verse Two: Big Ill

Yeah, well it's Big Ill, silly me, I puff the Phillie G
I make your body move, get smooth like Billy Dee
Get you hopin, make you beg for the third leg twice
Cause I _Make it Funky_ like my name was Greg Nice
Hit you off, then I'm ghost somethin proper-like
Two things I never do: fall in love or drop a mic
I'm Big Ill, now you know my style I'm glad you came
I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name
(What's your name baby?)  Sign a autograph, then I step w/ my staff
to the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom.. jockin
clockin, knockin out the box when, I perform
that's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin to get backstage between the
niggaz I was wit and the security, she didn't
Lookin from a distance I see her booty's hittin (oh yes babe)
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her
Thinkin to myself, "Aiyyo, I got to have her"

[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
     I'll take her, I'll take her, I'll take her
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
     On my knees, ohh yeah
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
     Hahhh-ohhhh-ohhh-ohh-oh-hohh-yeah, I'll take her (I'll take her)
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time
     Bring it here to me, yeahhh!
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
     Ooohhhhhh, I'll take her

Verse Three: Big Ill, Al Skratch

Yeah.. yeah.. I like your flow yo, do I say oh no?
And get it hittin one on one like a solo
I think not, cause it ain't no fun
If my homey Mr. Raspy Skratch can't get none

Hey!  I be the one with the voice that's raspy
Al Skratch see, gettin downright nasty
I pass the, girls in my vicinity
back to my man Big Ill, he got the remedy

For the..

[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
     Oooh baby oh baby
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
     I'll take her, I'll take her, I'll take her
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
