Song:   You'll Never Take Me Down
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

You aint never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down
(you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]

They wanna see me gone they wanna see me crawl
They wanna shut me up untill I cant speak at all
They wont let me up they wanna see me fall
But it aint nothing cuz I done seen it all
Sometimes I feel like I cant breathe at all
I lie awake at night I cant sleep at all
I got no strength to fight I cant shake it off
But that's the time in my life when I hear you call
You say hold tight you say hold on
You say it's alright you say stand strong
Cuz my whole life I got a plan and all
So I don't worry about a single thing that happens y'all
Say what you want you can talk on
I'm a get on up and I'm a walk on
Now I ain't giving up until I'm long gone
So why don't you step it up bring it on y'all

You aint never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down
(you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]

MTV said I was just a hater
Magazines said I was an imitator
The industry said nobody's gonna take ya
Record labels was like peace out see you later
I didn't need them man I just got
Someone to depend on when it gets hot
So VH1 you can talk all you wanna talk
Keep ya hip-hop and keep ya lip locked
I aint gonna listen now to them talk
I aint switching up and I aint gonna stop
I aint giving up and I aint gonna drop
Even when I just get stuck up in ruff spot
I aint got much but what I just got
You see it's more than I need when I just drop
To my knees and I can see that he shows up
You cant break me down that's some real talk

You aint never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down
(you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]

So what you gonna do when it falls apart
Who is the one man that you call upon
When everything that you know keeps going wrong
Plus you feel like you can't keep going on
See I know dukes your barely holding on
They wanna break you down but keep rolling on
They wanna take you down but don't let em y'all
They can't hold you now God's in control
Don't slow it down just walk it off
It aint easy I know sometimes its really hard
Please believe me I know you see I'm battle scarred
With my knees to the floor that how I battle on
Say what you want you can babble on
This I know what I got so I travel on
Don't ever stop that's why I wrote the song
So ready or not now bring the chorus on

You aint never gonna take me down
(so you see I ain't gonna break)
Your never gonna take me down
(you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]</pre>
