[Caddillac Tah talking]
Yo, that's right
Niggas just ain't, doin' it how we doin' it
Nah mean son? I G

[Chorus] (2X)
Murder INC.
Takin' flight
We go hard
Betta get it right

[Caddillac Tah]
We go hard! yeah
Player not for nuttin'
I spit fo' and leave a nigga bent up fo' sho', get low
Only got love for gangsta niggas, get doe
That's for all the hatin' niggas waitin' to see me go
Down to the bottom
Chop up crack
Playin' the blocks and
Still wouldn't matter, push the rock well like Stockton
Paper chasin', chasin' acres
Operation get rich, take money over a bitch
You see me move low in the six and magazines a flicks
Playin' hard in the porch, plush
Young thuggin' and bossed up
Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'
We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga
Really is nothing
Murder killa, we crush 'em, shit
Got the industry on romadon
While we celebrate tastin' bottles of Perinon
So for life it's murder
Ice burners, stacks and trucks
We after bucks, mother fucker!

Murder INC.

[Black Child]
Murder INC.'s the underdog
It's a blessin' to ball
We learn a lesson from y'all
How not to fall
Black Child will body a beat, this is airway robbery
When Murder INC. drop albums, that's when gangstas party
What chu know about Ferrari or Cadillac Escalade
Or bitches on Ecstasy, sexy
Eat, sleep, eat and watch freaks eat freaks
Throw it up, put it down for the streets
Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this
Hittin' hoes that's priceless
In tight icebergs shit
You can blame the drugs
It ain't gon' change to slugs
A famous thug
Pain is love, mother fuckers!

[Chorus] (2X)

[Ja Rule]
Who would've thought, we get away with manslaughter
Numerous cars, cribs off the water
A playa no longer, life's gettin' shorter
Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders
The Rule don't condone this
Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies
But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds
Y-D to O-G, the game chose me
R-U-L-E the INC. and I-G
We never gon' break free from this life we live as thugs
Pain is love, it's murda

[Chorus] (2X)

[Ashanti]
You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-C
You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood
And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit
You see the life we live, we on the murderous shit
And every time we breathe, it's Murder I-N-C
You know it's love to thug, cause thug is in our blood
And how we paint this shit, stay on that gangsta shit
Stay on that gangsta shit, stay on that gangsta shit
Stay on that gangsta shit
See what we do when we do what we do when we do it
Stay on that gangsta shit</pre>
