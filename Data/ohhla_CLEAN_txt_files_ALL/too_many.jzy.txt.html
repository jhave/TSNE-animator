Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Imagine riding through the hood nigga switches on the phantom
Squares talking crazy 'cause them niggaz don't understand 'em
Think about the square nigga I just understand them
They just bragging on their pistol nigga I just took a cannon

Half a million on the bricks I just bought a phantom
Dark beef fountain and my cocaine mount
Bought a the mountain bike just to ride through that shit
Gotta put my goggles on just to drive through that shit
When they come and serve me dinner man you know them bitches naked
Red tatted on that ass you can see it when they exit
Marble floor marble counters chandeliers on the ceiling
Strapped on the penthouse I bought the whole building
Tell them to hurry up so I met em all above
The coast guard tripping man I hope them bitches float
Know some real life niggaz smoke diamonds indigo
When they praying for forgiveness they go and see the pope
Cross my heart hope to die Lord knows I seen the due
Cross my heart hope to die Lord knows I seen the go
It's a heaven for a G nigga, hell for the sinners
2 tone chinchilla ballin for no one

[Chorus: x2]
All white drophead copped it for the summer
Move a 100 bricks buy a crib for your momma
Watch your many enemies they all full of trouble
Got money by the millions, way too many commas

Mona Lisa in the hall 3 safes in the wall
2 iphones on the killers own call
8 car garage 10 grand for the landscape
All the 10 pounds they be smoking like landscapers
Dry away your mouth man them killers own doubt
Got a small army they move like the military
M16 we buy them bitches like them military
We know we trained to go tell them go and their going
Them dome look good man especially when it's pouring
And coops look good man especially when their foreign
'Scuse me mr. Jeezy ye we might just have an issue
We know you checking in they cleaning out your own vault

[Chorus: x2]
All white drop head copped it for the summer
Move and bricks buy cribs for your momma
Watch your many enemies they all full of trouble
Got money by the millions, way too many commas</pre>
