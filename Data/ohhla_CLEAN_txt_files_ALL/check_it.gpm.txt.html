So, kick the flavor, get the loot, and let's be jetti

* Mary starts crooning *

Cause that's the way we do
[MJB] So get ready (uh-huh)
[MJB] Because you know the deal and what's the real thing

Uh!

[MJB] You know, you know I know (uh-huh)
      Puba knows, how to flow
[GPM] So bear witness to the Grand Puba slickness
      Better get your medication cause it spreads on the quickness
[MJB] Take notes to what's goin on
[GPM] Aiyyo, Grand Puba and Mary
[MJB] Won't steer you wrong!
[GPM] Hon it's just that shit
[MJB] Let's get it on!
[GPM] And on and on, and on and on
      Aiyyo, some try to flow
[MJB] But they just can't do it
[GPM] But you know how that go
[MJB] Ain't nothin to it
[GPM] But, to do it, run right through it
      Those who know the time, huh, already knew it
      I drink a Snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
      And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor
      Quick to make a buck, cause it's not beginner's luck
      Type of shit that hits, when you pump it in your truck
      Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
      Sonny or Cher, it's somethin dope on your ear
      So whether Monday
[MJB] Tuesday
[GPM] Wednesday
[MJB] Thursday
[GPM] Friday
[MJB] Saturday
[GPM] It don't make a matter
      This is the type of shit to make the pockets fatter
      It's simply splendid, the way that we bend it
      But it's time for me to jet, so I'ma let Mary end it

[Mary J. Blige]
You know, you know I know
Puba knows, how to flow (got it goin on)
You know, you know I know-owowwwwwwww (you got it goin on)
