Song:   Smile
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Smile when you cum
Cum as you please
Smile when you cum
Oh won't you cum for me
Smile when you cum
Cum as you please
Smile when you cum
I hope you never leave

Relax and follow me
I can make you feel so right
Sit back and let yourself go
I'm all alone with you tonight
I know that you know baby
Look me in the eye sweetheart
It's no surprise that we're together
How you make me feel inside my heart
So you follow me I'll follow you
You be me and I'll be you
Let's drift away like the breeze
I hope you never leave
Now my soul is running free
I can see you in my eyes
Ain't no telling what's going to happen
When I cum inside

[Chorus]

I'm addicted now
I'm addicted then
I want to see you cum
Again and again
You know it feels so right
It flows so naturally
When us two are one
Let me plant my seed
Candles light the room
Incense fills the air
Waterfalls cascade
Down your flowing hair
I'm in ecstasy
My body's getting numb
I love to see your face
Smile when you cum

[Chorus]

You know I love to make you smile each time we meet
And I hate to wait for you to come back believe
When our souls come together it just feels so right
'Cause we can make each other smile all through the night
So won't you come and smile for me
Come show me how it's supposed to be
Let's do the deed and grow together
In sunny days or stormy weather
Like shooting stars colliding in the nights wide open sky
Just make a wish girl and hope it comes true
'Cause all I want to do is watch you smile

[Chorus]</pre>
