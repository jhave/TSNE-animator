Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: x2]
Bitch I got them bails, so much clientele
Gangsta swag pop, going anything for sale
Sold so many bails like the hunned thous a year
Running up the bench, you be camping out them bails

Laid the truth I'm 30, till we go inside it's 50
Then he [?] started jinging through the city
Plus I make a whole hunned thous of a truck
5 came in, have a ticket count it up
You can pick your number when you come and shop with us
Black amigo numbers nigga, you gonn run it off
We could be flexin, wear a big necklace
Off these bail money bout to buy another mansion

[Chorus: x2]
Bitch I got them bails, so much clientele
Gangsta swag pop, going anything for sale
Sold so many bails like the hunned thous a year
Running up the bench, you be camping out them bails

A one day Shawty how I make them disappear
I really do this shit a hunned thousand bails a year
Free bands scooter, I get jiggle of the year
Numbers you ain't heart, I get price of the year
You ain't selling bails, you can't live how we live
Hoe take it off, black amigo worth for mill
That's just off for bails and our clientele
Black amigo gang, we might send em through the mail

[Chorus: x2]
Bitch I got them bails, so much clientele
Gangsta swag pop, going anything for sale
Sold so many bails like the hunned thous a year
Running up the bench, you be camping out them bails

I was in sex when the truck came in
With my baby mama buying balleys for a friend
Road runner scooter, [?] sonny
Get your calculators up, you know we blow money
One stupid price, where erybody can eat
We pull up, you see them cars line up the street
We cash out, get my partner here receipt
If that care get pulled over, you didn't get them bails from me

[Chorus: x2]
Bitch I got them bails, so much clientele
Gangsta swag pop, going anything for sale
Sold so many bails like the hunned thous a year
Running up the bench, you be camping out them bails</pre>
