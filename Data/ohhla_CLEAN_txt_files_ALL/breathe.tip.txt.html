Uh uh uh uh uh get up
Uh uh for real uh uh 
Come on
Ummah, Ummah, Ummah, Ummah

[Q-Tip]
A hard time if your motion is still
Let me move some things around because the lyrics is ill
Abstract..you know my stiggidy in here [yeah]
Niggaz get on and swear it's they fuckinyear
But yo your girl just moved
to the joint in the club, in the car if it groove [uhh]
Broad look, the movement is on
Mild mannered mami's in Victoria thongs, uh
I give my rhyme a bless
Guaranteed to make it right if your night is a bust [yeah yeah]
You Vivrant and you fresh and all
Original to say the least and you've impressed Kamal [come on]
Rappers start then they stall
Findin it very hard to make it over the wall
Hey, get your weight up, my motto you heard?
And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words, uh
So girls move it around
If you see your main dog give a brother a pound
And just uh..

Chorus: Q-Tip

Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got, and just uhh
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got
Give it what you got, give it what you got
If you on the block then give it what you got

[Q-Tip]
A thug, a thrill, you as mean as the eyes [say word]
I wanna feel you, them big ass thighs
Your Prada dress or your Gucci bag
with the Polo jeans over doobi-bag, uh
Yo hold the door a-ight?
We comin through, Tribe beef, hold it down for the night
Big Moon got the fifth
D-Lyfe he got the deally and girl you got the gif [yeah for real love]
turn it over the page
Usherin all of y'all to a brand new age, where [yeah]
status really don't matter
everbody get right to the pitter the patter [come on]
Makin moves, settin precedence
Enterin your residence, the whole scene is decadence
and the feelin is true
I'm seein me and my crew, you seein black and blue, uh [yeah]
So let's go for the ride
Strap yourself in tight and if you bonafied then just uh

Chorus

[Q-Tip]
Dunn what what bring it, bring it
A-bring it give it bring it give it
bring it give it bring it give it
bring it give it bring it give it
bring it give it bring it give it
bring it give it bring it give it 
A-where we bring it to?
Right here, right where?  Right here, right where?
Right here, right where?  Right here, right where?
Right here, right where?  Right here, here here
Right here, take it home home, take it home, right here

[Q-Tip]
Millenium, on your mind, are you runnin out of time?
Hope you skippin every line because I'm gettin mine
Move it around a bit again 
Every block every town we startin a trend [for real for real]
Eye to eye ma and toe to toe [toe to toe]
Who concentratin on killin the show?
Penetration is methodically slow
Mountain high valley low gonna find the dough [yo for real for real]
All my peoples, no matter the creed
We gonna satisfy the urge and discover the need [uhh uhh uhh uhh]
You feel, you feel the bite in this
If you think I'm type real then invite me miss
And let me say a rhyme in your ear
Dancin close you the most and you fit in here [yeah]
You feel the rhythm is right 
You know the spittin is tight
You think you won't but I think you might, uh

Chorus: 8x</pre>
