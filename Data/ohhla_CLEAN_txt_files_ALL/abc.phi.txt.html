I'm advocating alphabetic assaults on a mans amazement 
absorbing any amount of attacks from any assailant 
assassinating adversaries amputating their arms 
and astronomic amounts of amateurs up in my abattoir
 
I blast your brain with bazooka type ballistics breaking bones 
Beat you like Bruce lee with big bats or badboy black boy busting bushido 
I battle battalions with a baseball bat beat their bumberarse 
with the breathtaking bulletproof bubble burst in a block busting broadcast 
braveheart buffalo soldier with another bible basher burning like a blazing bonfire 
I'll bludgeon and bodybag you
 
I make curiosity kill the cat then creep just like a cougar 
Cripple your coalition with critical cool maneuvers 
Crack your cranium with a crowbar 
Captivating you with my coma, 
Causing a cataclysmic impact like a cobra
 
Dusk till dawn I deliver a deadly dose of dark dialect 
Destroy like delahoy with dynamic dialogue that dissects 
Discipline disciple with dramatic dynamic displays 
Desert storm and disrespect distress your DNA 
Download your disc drive decipher decode and demolish your data 
Dazzle you with death defying deliveries 
Too dark for Darth Vader
 
Evidently excellency engulfs my entire entity 
Mcs evacuate when I make my entry 
It's elementary I'm eradicating my enemies with ease 
Exaggerating emotions with an overdose of Es
 
I'm the futuristic fist of fury fabulous freestyle fashion 
Faster than a Ferrari F1 my faculties you couldn't fathom 
My fiery ferocious force like forest fires flash floods and freakstorms 
Fantastic like the four I fortune tell and verbally freefall
 
I grind you down to a gradual granual when I be grafting 
My graphical gamma grammar be leaving you niggers gasping 
With more grip than a Goodyear when I shift gear with the gift here 
Goodness gracious the greatest galactic rappers have stood here
 
I hypnotize a hypnotist giving a hologram hallucinations 
Plus my heat seeking high explosive hip-hop causes hyper-ventilation
 
Intervening like intravenous injections inside your intestines 
Interesting like an inquest and leave you impressed and 
I and I is instantaning your simpusle is impaling yo 
insert it in my ears and my ism start inhaling yo.
 
From ju-jitsu to judo I put your jugular in jeopardy 
Jab like Joes junior to the jaw I make you jerk and jump like jet-li
 
I'm killing the Ku Klux Klan round some ka kani khakis 
Kung-fu kicking your kidneys and then I'm caning your car keys. 
Keep a kalashnikov in a karan inside my kitbag 
Kidnapping and craning the KGB and make you kick back
 
Most laser guided literature it literally makes you lose limbs 
Left in the land of the lasra larynx lapped down in my labyrinth 
I leave a legendary legacy as a legitimate lyrical lyricist 
I defy levitation laws my lateral thinking leaves you lyric less
 
My miraculous murder methods are madness I'm causing malice 
With a mind of a million mathematicians I murder masses 
Masquerading mayhem in your manor like Mafiosos 
Maxing from Montreal to Manhattan like Motorola's
 
I'm nasty like Nas naughty by nature but never say never 
Navigate at night I'm the narcotic nuclear nemesis making you nosedive
 
I obliterate my opponents with an ordeal of oral onslaughts 
Your overwrought with an oratorical orgy when I'm on course 
I'm in and out of the ordinary ordinance from my orifice 
I'm out of order with orders to boot you out of your offices
 
I'm a paranormal paradox portraying pyrotechnic prophecy 
Panoramic philosophies like pharaohs and pyramid properties 
I paralyze a parasite with pen and paper perception 
The power of a Porsche at performing phenomenal perfection
 
Don't query our quest or question my quadrophonics 
I'm quicker than Audi Quatros with quality supersonics 
Highly qualified quotes will leave ya hung drawn and quartered 
And queens lyrically captured be catching the quarantine
 
I'm a rampant radical renegade who'll rapidly rupture your ribcage 
Rip up your rastclart like a rabid rottweiler on the rampage 
I reckon my rawriding riddims will give the risible rheumatism 
Representing reality rhymes we need some righteous realism
 
Suffering suckatash I stash a smash and snatch a stash 
I'm spitting science or sharpen decieving shaving your stash 
Schizophrenic schematics we're static and cypher stuns 
And super sporadic savages scavenge around my sermon
 
My triple tongue tied technique attain the turbulence of a typhoon 
With torpedo trajectory I titanically testify me tune 
With a thunderous thesis I think with a thousand tortuous thoughts 
With the tortion of a tornado I travel like a tomahawk 
I make time warp when I talk like a telekinetic taskforce 
Travelling in a time machine towards the twilight zone when I'm on tour
 
I'm an undefeated, unseeded lyrical ultra-sonical wheat kid 
With the universal dispersal rehearsals don't mean I need it 
I natural unilateral Phi-Life remain the uncatchable 
With magical mindchart minds and limbs that are un-detachable
 
My vocal volcanic verses cause invisible vacuum vortex 
My visceral vocabulary 
Venomous viper vigilante vapourising your vibe 
Verbally I'll murder thee and vocally vandalise
 
I walk from Wales to Washington D.C on the warpath of an MC 
We're surfing the world wide web and nobody is willing to --- we 
We're causing the worst water works to the worlds wackest of wordsworth 
The wickedist wizard in time with the vines time in Wandsworth
 
I went to the X games with my ex-girl in an extra-large T-shirt 
Cos I'm an extremist and no-one can play the xylophone with my penis
 
Rising like yeast this verbal beast is big just like a yeti 
Yoga floating my boat and leave it tangled just like spaghetti 
Yanking your ladies yashmak stabbing your back like Yitsak 
Shaggy just like a yak when attacking you with my shitsack
 
From Zambia to Zanzibar this zany Zulu from Zen will 
Cross the Zodiac when lyrics are zooming like a lens</pre>
