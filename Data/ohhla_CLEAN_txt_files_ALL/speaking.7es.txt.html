[Inspectah Deck]
Yo.. INS the Rebel, your highness
with 7L and Esoteric, speaking real words
Speak on it kid!

[Esoteric]
Yo, I touch the mic like a savage
The Esoteradactyl's rap style's beyond average
To say the least, I'm slayin beasts with the right plan
I'll take your hype man and beat him with the mic stand
You're like, "Damn!  I better get a resource"
I'll overpower three-fourths of your police force
You're talkin to a fugitive who'll serve your crew
fake his own death and come back to murder you
Who raps to the crack of dawn?  Who's the droid
who destroyed numerous humanoids like atom bombs?
You're nothin but a tag-a-long, that I be raggin on
7L's on the cut, while Joe is tappin on
the 3000, me I'm just loungin
Waitin for a sucker MC to start poundin
You know the deal, so check the cassette
It's Esoteric and Inspectah Deck, what you expect?

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yo, yo
I stash heat, creep past police on the beat
Keep it movin in the mean streets, I the black sheep
Roll deep with the Killa Beez, quick on the squeeze
Freeze - nobody move, just hand over the G's
Gone with the breeze, everything's peace at ease
Now I'm laid back, countin stacks, twistin the trees
My rap's scorchin - way beyond third degrees
Enemies get blown like autumn leaves
Authorities comb the block, I'm peepin they steez
After me cause the rhyme's worth about two ki's
And double that 'cross seas
Fiends buy off the heez, the result's more currencies
Them no worry we, I strike em down suddenly
Funny how they rush me, must be the money
You hate me or you love me, don't ever (fuck) me
Trust me, we can make the scene turn ugly

{7L cuts and scratches}

[Esoteric]
I'm like a man posessed that can't confess
Yes it's the Es' to bless, wicked test pressed to rest
Crab rapper, my raps shatter your wax platter
Esoteric's data can stab up the tracks badder
My words flow for the, rap cats who rep locally
Transmit poetry fit to hit em globally
Eso', yes status fresh from the get go
Sinister, ready to administer the death blow
on rap cats cause I'm takin it back
to a time when it was cool to call hip-hop rap
Cause I've been rappin, since fly sneakers were cheap
since I bought em off Koreans down on Washington Street
Since I had a cameo, since I rocked rope chains
Since I had gold fronts with the Polo frames
Since "Goin' Way Back," since pro black rap
Since the Jungle Brothers let me know "I Got it Like That"
