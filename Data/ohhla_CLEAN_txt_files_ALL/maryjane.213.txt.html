[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
One for the treble, two for the bass
She's my beauty queen, she's my everything
When I wake up in the morning gotta get that thing
This is where I wanna be with Mary Jane (sweet Mary Jane)
Ooooooo Mary Jane
Ooooooo Mary Jane

[Warren G]
Mary Jane, you are my everything
I'm in love with you
Now I realized why Rick James fucked with you
Since I said "I Do" I never cheated on you
Even when your sister-sis came through
I ain't trying to stress you
Cuz everytime I call, baby doll you be at my rescue
I can't sweat you
We just homie loving friends
Besides, I heard you fucking Snoop Dogg again

[Snoop Dogg]
G-Dub, that's my bitch, how the fuck she gon' love me?
I love that bitch, why the fuck you gon' leave me?
I'm in the green room and I'm fucking up the scenery
With my nigga Buddy Love blazing up some sticky burns
Yeah we go hit it 'cuz, have a seat and drink with us
Puff, puff, pass that shit
Smoke it all down to the ashes bitch
213 with another classic hit

[Nate Dogg]
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She is my main thang
Stay away from hooka smokes
She gives me headdaches man
And when my sack gets low
Sweet Mary swings on by
Breaks me off something proper
?That bowl king sized swagger?

That's why I'm lying
I ain't fucking with nothing but the lime green
If you smoking 'cess then dont invite me
However I rip this chronic do the right thing
I'm all she cuz ain't no maybe
We met on 21st and fucking Lime Street
Take ya fucking homey, where my girl be?
The only fucking way you can excite me
Is Mary Jane

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
I done sinned, sipped on gin with other women
But kept it respectful like a gentlemen
I spend to hit that ass or go and get the cab
So I can hit the last laugh
Tonight if it's not the bomb, then I'ma be mad
But I'm sure it won't last for long, I got a stash at home
Make love 'tween my Swisher with my half a zone
I can't leave you alone

[Snoop Dogg]
And I know that you know that I be smoking and you about to ooee
So fire it up and get high with me
And let me see if you get as high as me
Now that's what's happening
Cuz I know that you probably don't believe what you hear and you see
A nigga like the D-O-double-G-Z
So put your hands up in the air and repeat after me
213
