Huh, Ride ride, ride ride, ride, gangstas
We ride, fuck these niggas Daz, fuck 'em
Bust a bitch nigga
Please believe that

[Daz]
Motherfuckers wanna come through my block, shoot up and serve they rocks
Uh uh, here we come nigga to shut down your block
Recognize when the nine go pop, that's when they homeboys drop
With a plastic glock made his body lay cold, 12 shots
Nigga tell me what it is, y'all done lost it and forgot
Did I run this motherfucker from the bottom to top
We blast and dash with cops because we just don't give a fuck
When you see me nigga, better hide and duck
With double sight in broad daylight, better stay tight, better pray right
Watch after midnight, nigga better try to get right
Cuz we on a mission all out hunt, smoking hunts
Dip with the potion, motherfuckers acting ferocious
It's like a force I can't control it, you see it in mine
That's when you get burn and you learn, stop fucking with mine (buck, buck, buck)
We intervene and puff green, loaded and high
Cuz tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, some niggas gone die

[Chorus]
How many niggas down to ride with a nig' tonight
How many real motherfuckers in the house tonight
Not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, my nigga
How many niggas down to die with a nig' tonight
Not you, not you, not you

[Kurupt]
We never gave a fuck, so what the fuck we gone start?
Snatching arms off, bust and puncture your heart
Don't trip homie, I ain't get 'em yet
I'm a penal system vet, off of cigarettes
A mushroom high, get 'em back now sherm right out the bucket, fuck it
Pull it out and pass it around and boom boom up and down
Never knew such a thing could happen,
Fucking pistol whipping you and g nigga go head up wit me, let's start scrapping
I'm tiny as fuck, never bow down to nann nigga
Beware nigga, all gangstas over here nigga
I'm tired of these ho's, I'm a let you niggas know
The ho you love nigga gotta hell-a-fide blow
Listen Bitch, all you'll ever be is a bitch
All you'll ever be to me is a bitch
Can't help it but I keep my mind right nigga
The poltergeist nigga
Once or twice, twice as nice pulling a heist nigga
Never gave a fuck and I don't ever think I will
I'm quick to pull out the glock and pop like pills

[Chorus]
How many niggas down to ride with a nig' tonight
How many real motherfuckers in the house tonight
Not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, my nigga
How many niggas down to die with a nig' tonight
How many real motherfuckers down to die tonight
Not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, my nigga

[Daz]
I wake up early in the morning with the urge to catch you slippin'
If your bloodin' and crippin' nigga your done for and finished
Been in it since the beginning, peeling niggas caps back
On the for realla my nigga cuz it's like that
Girl it ain't but play to bone, we make a living jacking niggas
16, 15, and 7 figga niggas (all y'all bitches)
Beware, 101, Get your gun
And prepare, to get done, blast and run

[Kurupt]
That's right, that's right, pull it out let the bullets fly
Pull it back and fly high,
And fuck the rest, aim and life and live,
Till everything in this motherfucker get hit and burned to a crisp
You heard it right, murder, tonight, today
See everyone in every way
Calypso, unloading a clip though on you ho's
Blazin' up the crip though pictures get painted like Vangoh, I wanna know

[Chorus]
How many niggas down to ride with a nig' tonight
How many real motherfuckers in the house tonight
Not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, my nigga
How many niggas down to die with a nig' tonight
How many real motherfuckers down to die tonight
Not you, not you, not you, not you, not you, my nigga</pre>
