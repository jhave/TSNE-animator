Chorus (2x):
[Master P]
These boys don't talk a lot (ooh oooh)
My soldiers don't run to the cops (ooh oooh)
We got beef then we keep 'em cocked
The new No Limit, we all we got

[Master P]
Now if you in, then you in
From the streets to the pen
That shit that happened last year won't happen a-fuckin-gain
The only way out is to die my nigga
Fuck with the mob we gonna ride my nigga
See I ain't the nigga that said I'm done this year
I'm the nigga that said we run this here
And we in it for the money, fuck the fame and the glory
I ain't tryin' to get y'all to love me by tellin' false stories
This from the heart nigga, I speak the truth
You don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
And if you never sold dope, you don't know how I feel
And you ain't gotta get shot to be motherfuckin' real

Chorus (2x)

How the fuck you monkeys gonna go up against Godzilla?</pre>
