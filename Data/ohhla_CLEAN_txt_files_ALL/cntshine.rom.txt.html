[Romeo - Intro]
Are you serious man? [*laughs*]
The ice in the chain man, the ice in the watch
They must not know who I be!
We got the hood Preston in the building

["Don't start nuttin,' won't be nuttin!" 3x]

He's back!

[Chorus 2X]
You can't shine like me, you ?ain't no? rider like me
Pull dimes like me, if you ain't from the streets
I'm a hood star, you know who I'm is (ehh-ah!)
I rock big ice, you can't live how I live  (ehh-ah!)

[Romeo]
Geah, ten karats on my earlobes, chick!
BBS on my wrist, twenty karats on my neck
While y'all slidin' in the lil' bitty 06 'Vette
I'm waitin' on the runway for my G4 Jet
I'm ahead of the game, you see you boys got next
Did a lil' bit of actin' just ta stack a few chips
I ain't gotta remind y'all, how the game go
I'm the youngest wit a clothin line, first wit a TV show
I ain't in the pros and I got three Black cards! (three?)
Call the Saints ova, they can practice in the backyard (Maaaan! *laughs*)
I do it big, I guess I say I'm just the best at it (at it)
Had a mil' early man, I been learn my mathematics (heh, heh)
Uh, aw, oh, two, coped an '06
Boy stop stunnin' if I want her, I can have ya chick (what'd he say?)
Don't get it twisted Richie Rich so gutta
Youse a momma's boy, I'm the son of a hustla [*laughs*]

[Chorus 2X]

[Romeo]
See me; I'm so fly, an I'm different from them other brothers
Only sixteen and I don't, live home wit mother
Me, I keep it real! Don't believe, you can ask my brother
Kids poppin they grillz in, they think they gettin tougher
They tryna take off they shirts think they gettin buffer
I'm benchin' one-eighty and that's just wit one muscle (just one)
I see dudes tryna act like me, be like me
Dawg, even dress like me? NOOO!
Ya not me and there won't be anotha
Skip dat; let me get to the jewels and da cuddle
So many rocks on my hand, got me feelin like a hustla
Got a wizard on ya hands kinda like a Ron Butler
Who me? I just learn from the best hood star
Down South wit a mansion on the West, yes!
I got a Bentley that I don't even drive
and I just bought a Phantom just to see how it ride

[Chorus 2X]

[Young V]
Young V, check the six time zone
Throw away ya lil' jewlery, all dat fake rhinestone
My ride home, 'cause it the me in the Range
Check the bank account whodi, I'm consistent wit game
Check that paint color boy, it consistently change
Me and my big brother paid, man; we changin the game!
Look, ice in my mouth, I'm so country and gutta
I'ma hood star Rich Boy number one hustla

[C-Los]
I'm in the big GT with heavy metal on the seat
I lose the roof on twenty two's, canary yellow on my teeth
You dudes slow, I don't eva see you catchin up on me
You way below sea level, me I'm steppin' on the beach
No reach I'm ahead a you, my houses is all in {?}
Kool-Aid in the water fountain, cost about three thousand THOUSANDS
Listen, I'm thuggin' man know how I'm rockin' !
And keep me mo dimes than john Stockton, watch

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
