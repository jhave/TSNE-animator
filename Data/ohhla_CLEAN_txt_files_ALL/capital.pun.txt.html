[Big Pun]
It's mine; it's all mine you understand?  
At least me and my peoples
Can you dig that?  
21st century -- thought I'd never see it
Right around the corner, baby
Ours for the taking

Verse one: Big Pun

Yo; I've seen child blossom to man,
some withered and turned to murderers
Led astray by the liars death glorifiers observin us
Watching us close, marking our toast ??? 
purposely overtaxin the earnings
Nervous, burning down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Always in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust
Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin my own, I'm livin alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl!
She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin the issue here, so we can cross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin fired and hired as a pistol-eer
There's no longevity living off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin they hustle on
Judge singin death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin song
Word is bond, takin my life you know they lovin it
God 'F' the government and it's fuckin capital punishment!

Chorus: Prospect

Capital punishment, given by the government
System so organized they get to you and who you runnin with
Can't live alone, watch for the spies and tapped phones
Totin the llello for life, the rightful heir to the throne
We come from Kings and Queens, people with dreams, Gods and Earths
For what it's worth, we benefit the Earth with infinite worth
First it's turnin tables, open our own labels
Disable the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment

Verse Two: Big Pun

I've seen it all up close, shit out the movies you'd be buggin
My cousin JuJe, barely a juve', lost it and turned on the oven
He wasn't playin, blew out the flame and started inhalin
Barin a secret too deep to keep on the street for sharin
Wearin the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, fuck a snuff, we bust lead off!
Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans, +The Last of the Po'Ricans+
We need some unity, fuck all the jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess the motto we promise to let you homage in death your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, cause Punishment's what I resemble!
I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours
A real man can't fall, he stands tall
The Man's claws are diggin in my back, I'm tryin to hit him back
Time to counteract, where my niggaz at?

Chorus

Verse Three: Prospect

You like that, it's Pun and Prospect
We hold nines, own more treasure than gold mines, makin progress
With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed
Dues to be paid, nuttin y'all can do to behave
We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs
Even though the government, tryin to take out our sons
Rudy Gulliani trying to blind me, but I see reality
Was raised with the street mentallity
My strategy's why my battery never die
The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies
It's no surprise, but do or die if you want the glamour
Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta
While Cuban's smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas
The hammer in the palm, never shaky, calm handlers
This renegade blow through barricades like grenades
I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day
Like the twenty-four hour rotation
I know the location, it's just a little in-for-mation
From the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era
And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what?
