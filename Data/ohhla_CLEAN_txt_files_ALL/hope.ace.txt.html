Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I feel you
To every girl who ain't never had a daddy, and every boy who ain't never have a mother
To that pretty woman lost in the world, who seem to think another man won't love her
All the homies locked up in the pen, who can never seem to dodge that trouble
Hold your head up high cause there's better days, hard times I was praying for them better ways
I don't know a niggas struggle but I know pain
Cold world but a nigga trying to maintain
Still praying for a little change
Bills due and I can't pay
Or when your money low when your rent late
And doc say granny gone after thirty days
You don't even know the half of my heartache
Too many I done lost is a heartbreak
And they wonder why this young nigga goin' hard I done came too far from my boulevard
Couple war wounds, few battle scars, but I'm still here living gotta thank God
It's a cold world, it don't love you
Funny what a little faith and a hope do
Lord

And I know my momma praying for me
And my granny praying for me
I'm hustling for my family and that's every day and night
And the day I witnessed my daughter born it was the greatest day of my life, my life
Yeah take a look in my eyes, look how far a nigga came
You can search my soul, you understand my pain
Nigga trust nobody, and that probably never change
With a little bit of hope, you can reach your dreams

For anybody who done ever had a dream, you are just like me
Still beleving in myself even when them niggas hated and they told me that it could not be
You's a muhfuckin' lie, motivate a nigga when you see him on the block
Tell me how it feel when you struggle with the bills, and your momma take pills, and you never seen your pop
That put a dent right into my childhood
Still praying that I want to live good
Selling dope get you hoes and them nice cars
I'm just thinking if I really should
Small city young nigga with a mindset
Ain't never trying to be another convict
See I can't lose, and I won't quit
As long as God in my heart then I'm conscious
Remember when they said I wouldn't be shit?
People doubted that I ever had a gift
Who the fuck are you to judge me nigga? I will never let them sink my ship
Through the trials and tribulations, nigga still I stand, thank God in advance

And I know my momma praying for me
And my granny praying for me
I'm hustling for my family and that's every day and night
And the day I witnessed my daughter born it was the greatest day of my life, my life
Yeah take a look in my eyes, look how far a nigga came
You can search my soul, you understand my pain
Nigga trust nobody, and that probably never change
With a little bit of hope, you can reach your dreams

Growing up I wanted to be like Jordan
Even though I couldn't really afford it
Who's to say I can't be an Obama
A Tiger Woods worth about a billion dollars?
Everybody wanna sell a little coke
Cause it's cool to them niggas you know
Nobody wanna be another judge
Young niggas only looking for the plug (hope)
Watch your momma doing dope
Daddy locked in the pen
And you on your own
Gotta keep your head up
When you're tired and fed up
Better days gon' come
Better days gon' come

And I know my momma praying for me
And my granny praying for me
I'm hustling for my family and that's every day and night
And the day I witnessed my daughter born it was the greatest day of my life, my life
Yeah take a look in my eyes, look how far a nigga came
You can search my soul, you understand my pain
Nigga trust nobody, and that probably never change
With a little bit of hope, you can reach your dreams</pre>
