[Chorus: Joanne Francis]

We were the best of friends since we were knee high
And everyone around us could always see why
And any time I'd call he'd always reply
He'll be my best friend until the end
We were the best of friends since we were knee high
And everyone around us could always see why
And any time I'd call he'd always reply
He'll be my best friend until the end

[Verse 1: Kinetik]

Back in the day when we were young'uns
We used to kick it like it was nothing
Inseparable rebels and always up to something
But always on the same level and we would never have a run in
Considered family, we might as well had been
Had different names but to us that was irrelevant
Cause we were tight and never one without the other
In any given moment I considered you my brother
And every summer we were riding our bikes
And going missing so people had to find us at night
And when our other friends would have a beef
You and I were always clicking, politicking over a bag of sweets
And watching cartoons, playing computer games
Acting a fool and calling each other stupid names
We had a friendship and the love was always demonstrated
The realest ever and we could never be separated

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kinetik]

But then we grew into adults
Started our families and looking out for kids and the wives
I got a job, you moved away
We grew apart but I guess that we were living our lives
And after building up the trust for years
And being closer than the musketeers
We started looking at each other weird
Nothing particular, there was no back and forth
Just one of those things and life took its natural course
And I imagined us just being old with beards
Sat in the garden with the both of us in folding chairs
Having a laugh chatting and cracking the coldest beers
Sharing our stories and looking back on the golden years
So one day I thought I'd give him a call
But his wife would answer the phone and to me that was unusual
That's when she told me that my friend had died a week before
And when I called she was planning his funeral
Keep your friends close
Keep it real and keep in touch

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kinetik &amp; Joanne Francis]

Since we were knee high
Be my best friend 
[Knee high]
You'll always
Since we were knee high 
[You know we came up from like back in the day]
Be my best friend
You'll always be 
[Since we knee high literally]
Since we were knee high
Be my best friend
You'll always 
[Primary school, secondary school, college]
Since we were knee high 
Anytime, yeah 
[He's not here anymore but that's still my boy]
You'll be my best friend</pre>
