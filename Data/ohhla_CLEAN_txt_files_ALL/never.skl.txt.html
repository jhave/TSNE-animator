I used to think that I was hard
The kind of kid you don't wanna mess wit'
I'll fight you and your bodyguard
I was illeterate, we're talkin' gibberish
But never considerate of the way I treated friends
I would fight ten kids and I would fly all heads
I would even fight dragons 'til they'd be dead
I would presidents and the mayor, you bet
But it's just too bad because I ain't fought yet
You see, I took a slug at no one
But if I ever did, I'll have to show one 
That I was like, able to wreck it
I thought I knew but I didn't know
That all the talk in the world doesn't make you a pro
And so, 'cause my first real fight in the hood
I would bash a skull, if I could
But that's when these kids wrecked my world, swept my feet up
Straight got illed and I was nearly killed
It never crossed my mind

[Chorus]
I could go ten different places at one time (all at one time)
I could jump through my ears and walk through my mind (walk through my mind)

I never thought that it could happen to you
I never thought that it could happen to me
But then it happend, see
Coolin' out, chillin' with my homeboy Paul
Now we was chillin', talkin' to ladies up inside of the mall
I got a few numbers and some girl's address
So I was feelin' kinda fly and I was dressed real fresh
We was coolin' as if we didn't care
He was too busy talkin', and so he wasn't aware
That's when he caught a slug to his chest
A hole in his vest, worst of all he made a mess all over the carpet
Started to tumble all over the place
'Cause a bullet has no name, it sees no face
Anyways, this girl pulled a trigger on us
She was tryin' to kill the man who's next to the man
Who's next to the man...what?
And that's all he gots to give
He's ready to die, but I'm hopin' he lives
It never crossed his mind

[Chorus]

For my groupies, why must you do me?
You never knew me, so what makes you hot for me?
Is it fortune and fame just because of my name
You wanna tell your friends that you did it Skee
See, we can't be, because there is no us
You and I won't happen, so don't make no fuss
Now we could persist with a hug and a kiss
But I can't help but wonder "who's daughter is this?"
I'm glad you respect me, now let me respect you
If I was a dog, then I might want you
But if you want it that bad, then baby, don't get mad
Because you're welcome to share with the rest of my crew
Now that's on you
I know you fellas who ain't wit' it
You're thinkin' "like, dang Skee, why don't you hit it? do that, yeah!"
But you better think again
Next groupie could be your girlfriend
Just in case it never crossed your mind

[Chorus]

You never what could happen
Everyday situations
It could happen you're going to the store
Somebody drop a house on you and steal yo' slippers
Who knows?
Never crossed your mind</pre>
