[Verse 1]
Lookin' at this pill in the middle of my palm
Pop it, sip some cola, thirty minutes, it be on
Staring at the sidekick, words come to me
Rolling up the swisha, puffin' on the loosie
Got a nigga focused feelin' all right
With this type of feelin' I can write all night
I never had a problem with payin' attention
Popped the adderall then I wrote a verse in minutes
Play this in your ipod, noddin' on vicodin
Man, this shit legal, it must be alright then
Nigga, yeah right, this shit even worse
When doctor wrote prescription, your addiction was birthed
Turn your kids to fiends with a drug called ritalin
This is for my niggas popping xannies not rememberin'
What they did last night
Pills and orange tubes got the government right
They say there's no stoppin' from starting oxycontins
They in trailer parks sniffin' it with rolled dollars
All about a dollar, baby killers in the world
The ones that supply you when you gotta fuckin' cold

[Chorus]
I can't feel
When I'm off this pill
No doubt I done them all
Xanny bars, adderall
My mind drifts
Let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowin in the wind
Eat pills and vicodin

[Verse 2]
They say I might go out like heath ledger
Laughin' at the joker of an antidepressant
And if you can't sleep
They got a pill for that
Brown good in poppin' enzyte to get my dick fat
Fags take hormones to grow a set of titties
Got a pill to make your dick hard when you're sixty
Now tell me do that add up, g, when they lock your ass up
For a dimebag of weed
Teen girls take birth control killing off the seeds
Got her lookin' twenty when she only fifteen
They got illegal ones like x and mescaline
In my teens my homie took one, he did fifteen
My granny turned out on them blood pressure pills
And if she don't pop em, she might not be here
But is it really helpin' make a nigga shed a tear
I wonder, do they make a pill to take away your fears?

[Chorus]
I can't feel
When I'm off this pill
No doubt I done them all
Xanny bars, adderall
My mind drifts
Let it dissolve in what I sipped
My soul blowin in the wind
Eat pills and vicodin</pre>
