[Intro: sample of James Brown's "Try Me"]
Try me (try me) tryyyy me (try me, ooooooooh)
And your love, will always be true
Ohh, I need (try me) tryyyy me (try me, ooooooooh)
God'll tell me.. I need you
Try me (try me) tryyyy me (try me, ooooooooh)
And your love, will always be true
Ohh, I need you

[Bizzy Bone]
But you know if I love unconditional
This the residual, world individual
Indivisible, little old me
Keepin me lonely, no woman to hold me
Where my lady? My lady ain't crazy, my love
My lady is all that I have
Why am I low, and what do ya know?
This is the path, so narrow the arrow is pointed
at somethin and I just can't do me
It doesn't suit me, just boot me - I'll make it alone
I'll make it with Bone, I'm gon' make home
Baby I don't accept clothes
'Member the tone, the tone, the hollerin is dumb
Where is she from? She needs to be gone
My word is my bond, your word is your bond 
Whatever whatever, bring David this song and I'm gone

[Chorus: sample of James Brown's "Try Me"]
Try me (try me) tryyyy me (try me, ooooooooh)
God'll tell me.. I need you
Try me (try me) tryyyy me (try me, ooooooooh)
And your love, will always be true
Ohh, I need you

[Bizzy Bone]
What's she doin, my darling, let's get away fast
I give you no money, don't give me no ass
We upper-class players, riders forever
They never will get us so get us remember
Eleven times comin, she's stuntin, she frontin
When you ridin me then ride Ezra, it's nothin
I make him go fuck the flo', you know
Mi casa mi casa now watch, that hoe
Say boy, that ain't no money, this money is money
Johanna, you're so fuckin hungry, it's funny
Messin my body, my eight-pack and tummy
Be fast and, can you run it?
  {"Try me, you can't buyyyyy me" - James Brown}
Can't fuck with my book baby
I read the rook for you baby, ha ha ha

[Chorus]

[Bizzy Bone]
Tell them quit with that foolish, this schoolin is due
Don't mean to be rude, with no attitude
Just that gratitude, latitude, gradually after you
How could I ever be mad at you?
One in their face, with one in their place
What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight
I said one in yo' face, one in yo' place
What should I taste? Give me a woman, I'm straight man
