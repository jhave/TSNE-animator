Here comes the horns... 

(Verse 1)

Step back when I bring the swing 
Like the american pastime 
That alow deliver to stack up black night 
Makin' all funky like a futa 
Hang, four to you make more funky like a from free 
Masta, blocked like a ketshup scream 
Is so MB in sun llamas to you funk that grill 
Is the same delificius at the radios' DJ 
The fake at the album collection, lookin' lookin' 
Rusia, puro delinquente session 
&gt;From sun up to sun down on a heart is my pleassure 
Put on maleta, now I can see you 
Thinkin' to yourself, dam I wish like to be you 
Wishin' we could be fool as harvest bit club 
You pal never trust to mark wako back yard party 
That is on town, is on town... 
That grows like the weels 
Can't loco with sprees 
Marco Polo, ha, you can't see me  
Ha, you can't beat me
Fool, is so easy 
Delinquent Habits' little sun for the north 
So sit back and freest youself... 

CHORUS: 

Here Comes The Horns... (x 3)

(Verse 2) 

Faullin' yourselves to bringin' mis rolas and we collect shit 
You test a lot at your party, potion to blade this 
It's all I got a bence so that the story estan it 
Come in my side get the braise you need to stay braned 
Yo, one of this story is part of something to happened 
Some days of party enemy, don't feel the fool I cropped 
So I just began to waisted because you ever tasted 
Get up the gente hypnotic I got they last tasted 
Some skin light man give me some psychedelic 
Where all be drump and the shit, so pomp nigga smell it 
They want fiesta, fiesta is what the habits give it 
Rappin' and --- is solamente we wanna ripp it
You hit this tasted will you do to keep you suffer now 
Mio-mine, some very wine probe a good time 
They will do we though 
And all the shit we do
Los delinquentes hoo.... 

(CHORUS) 

(Verse 3) 

El ritmo latino más fino es lo que traigo 
Tu estilo, no puede conmigo, ta muy amargo 
Yo puedo más facil contigo sin mis amigos 
Te falta un poco sabor, yo te lo digo 
Calmate cuate, yo tengo razón 
Dime como quiere bronca con el más chingón 
A mi me cae bien casi toda la gente 
Si me cruzas boom te tumbo todos los dientes... 
No se que menace is comin' is poppa si yo voy check it out 
Fuckin' like a flame, my habits, watch out better bro 
Comin' and they see me brazos de steel faction 
I still clamin' kickin' lower eastside section 
If moki wanna blood, fool your better brotha 
Cuz it's checkin' a bro, proudin' con nigga brotha
Delinquent Habits' zoom at the north 
So sit back and freest youself...
