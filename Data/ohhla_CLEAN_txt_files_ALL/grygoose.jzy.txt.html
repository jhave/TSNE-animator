Yea this All Star Cashville's Prince

When ya in the club and its a hater in your face
Go to the bar, order your grey goose, this what ya tell em'

[Chorus 4x's]
I'm on that grey goose, do I know you? NO!
Do I know you? NO!
Do I know you? NO!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I'm on that grey goose, cranberry, and that pineapple (pineapple)
And I'll bust ya shit like a pineapple(pineapple)

Top down (top down) I do the damn thang (yeeaah)

A buck fifty on the way call me Nascar (that's right)
Cocaine white wit the antique tags

[Verse 3: All Star]
Aye yo I'm Cashville's Prince but you can call me Mr. Star
And ya gotta forgive me if I don't know who you niggaz are
I'm not just stuntin the vodka done it
This how a alcoholic act when he got lots of money (holla)
I started drinkin at the age of 12, in the club hollerin I'm rich like I'm Dave Chappelle
Aye yo I got them straps and I'll aim it at a nigga
We'll knock a motherfucker out and then blame it on the liquor
All Star I'm in my 2-3 zone, I got a pistol in the car that's about 2 feet long
Pockets fat as fuck yea that's what's up
Yo niggaz don't work for Exxon so why you let em' gas you up?
I'm a ball out until my casket's shut
Say bruh do me a favor, stop harassin us and
Go that a way! I told you niggaz
Man I'm on that grey goose and I don't know you nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
