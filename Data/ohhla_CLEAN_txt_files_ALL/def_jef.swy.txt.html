(Def Jef)
Somebody leave me by the name I'm able
I drop more niggas than a record label
You couldn't see me if your TV had cable
I got more juice than an orange and in a minute
I'm a have it made skill trade, going through crews 
Like a phase I hit harder than the news about a death in family
I keep kickin my shit as long as my niggas understand me
Smash ya Grammy watch em try to ban me
Like they ran me outta town nigga
You can't stop that sound from the underground 
Let me educate you when you hear it you learn
In other words I'll impregnate you with my lyrical sperm
So no matter how far you go away you'll have a piece of me with you, look 
I drop more jewels than the clumsy I'm off the hook 
I've never been took or taken bring home the loot
Forget the bacon you need to change your shampoo 
Cause you be flakin one two watcha wanna do
If you sneeze before you hit the boom
I'll tell your god budda bless you
You don't know nuttin about this hear me out
The way you wear me out I swear I might as well be an outfit
Of course I doubt if you can house it
I sit and see what you come out wit
Just like I thought, you ain't about shit
You gettin over with tracks them rhymes is wack
When you hear me mention R&amp;B, you know I mean "Real Black"
Instead of rap, you catchin flack
Ain't sayin jack I stay in tack cause that (?)
Run not deaf at budda sack and the congac
X a contract show me cash no check
Forget your A&amp;R man and your record exec
Tryin a flex, if I punched you in the ear you couldn't hear a hit
They call me Def Jef cause I aint even tryin ta hear that shit
I seen a rappers career plummet and learn from it
Money had it but couldn't hold it he aint really want it
I got covered betta than a jim hat shit
Give me the mic and a gym mat cause I'm about to flip

(Voodu)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
When I walk the night, looking for something to sacrifice
My presence is more feared than the Anti-Christ
My mental transitions cut like incisions
My intellect's deeper than moon ditches
I break a nigga down to his blood type device
Sliced leaving trails of broken mics
So what the fuck you wanna do
When I begin to construct indestructible
Brands of verbal bombardments, I'm the sergeant
When my army of words deploy reminds me of the ?law?
Bianca murders destroy all in my lane
Fom the snows of the  Ukraine to the sands of Spain
I crumple competition crushin they're outta commission
My shit be switching like sex positions
No target missin like James Earl Ray 
Booth and Oswald I assassinate blastin
(?) your eye across the walls (?) stalled keep it all in your way
Shootin ya down niggas be screamin that's a Western mayday but
No ones comin to save yo ass, you stay lost
like Amelia Earheart somewhere in the jungle grass</pre>
