soft talking:

What can we do with all this Fucking pain
Somebody stop the pain

Singing:

I finally look to paint a picture of my whole life
And for me to end it would be so nice
Somebody driving on this back street
So I could leave my shit all on the back seat
Cause I dont love my life no more
So I dont wanna fight no more
I felt this way before but it died out
So I shot my fucking eye out
Nobody understands me      HELP
But I dont understand my    SELF
I always find myself bein trapped
And my drugs that I take so Im at
That point in my motherfuckin life
Where I dont wanna live a fuckin lie
I just wanna die

Chorus:

I just wanna die
Die
I just wanna die
Die

Lets go on a journey
Boldly go where no man has gone before

Verse 2:
Buckle up and lets take a ride
I want you to watch me commit suicide
Were headed for a place in a dark land
In desperate search of that dark man
But dont you move keep it right there
I wanna bring you smooth into my nightmare
Dont be afraid of watching life bleed
Explore my every thought, come out and sightsee
Theres no man alive, that can promise breath
But once we arrive, I can promise death
And now were headed for the crossroads
Gettin deeper  in the lost coves
And once we arrive
Close your motherfuckin eyes
Cause Im about to die

Skit:
Will wake up
What, what, what, what man
Damn you aint been listenin man?
This shit is real, man, I dont give a fuck will, you payin attention
just drive nigga, damn
you listenin, will its goin down, right fuckin now

I put the pistol to my temple
See the bullet in the chamber
Cocked it back and out of anger
I pulled the crack, see the shells jump out the side
Now Im fallin back, Im seein faces but theyre all in black
Im hearin sounds but I cant hear
Im seein pictures in my head but they aint clear
My every picture flashed at full speed
And now Im feelin like Im loosin my grips on all reality
But my realitys a battle G
And I was tired of havin talks with myself about mentality
End it all I stand tall apparently I wasnt patient enough to hear the man 
call
So now I leave myself to strive or die, but Ive lost all my hopes inside,
And I just wanna die

Yo will wake the fuck up,
What, what, what, Man, Damn
Man Im talkin about killin myself man
Wanna kill yourself?
Thats right I dont give a fuck
Aight
What you think Im playin
Argumentgunshot.car crash</pre>
