[Intro: P. Diddy]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, 2001
This is the remix (Won't stop)
112 (Can't Stop)
Def Jam, Bad Boy, yeah
This is the remix, Ludacris come on

[Ludacris] (P. Diddy)
Ludacris like 'em shaken not stirred (yeah) wakin up blurred (uh-huh)
Walk butt-naked (what) talk, speech slurred (that's right)
Necks get squeezed and I can't breathe (come on)
Stop then SWITCH; next, get me (that's right)
Hon', you kinda taste like lemon merangue (lemon merangue)
So nice I add spice with the cinnamon thang
Make ya pull your own hair out
Make ya body go flat, get the spares out
Well, smack lips, smack hips, make 'em backflip (that's right)
Cake mix, fingerlickin-like tactics, tongue gymnastics
Good head make ya eyes ROLL BACK
'12 on the track so you can't HOLD BACK
Hot bread and butter, peach and cream (come on)
I only reach for the peach if it's peachy clean (that's right)
I only reach for your spot and release the steam (come on)
A-town, we release the kings (yeah, this is the remix)

[Slim of 112] (P. Diddy):
Let me tell you what I wanna do (yeah)
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you (uh-huh)
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you (come on)
Wanna kiss, wanna put my lips all over you (I like this)
Can't get enough of you (come on)
Always thinkin' of you (yeah)
So sweet, so very wet, so good girl you make me sweat

[Hook - 112] (P. Diddy)
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout peaches and cream (say what)
I need it 'cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream (uh huh)
Know what I mean?
Peaches and cream
I need it 'cause you that I'm fiend (uh huh)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley  limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean?
Peaches and cream

[Q of 112] (P. Diddy)
Never thought that I would be (yeah)
So addicted to you (come on)
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet baby, inside of you (feel me?)
Love the way you juice flowin' down (yeah)
And I can feel it all around (come on)
In the front, in the back of you (yeah)
Oooh I love the taste you, girl you know what I'm talkin' 'bout

[Hook]

[Mike of 112] (P. Diddy):
Don't stop 'cause you know I can't get enough (come on)
Wanna taste it in the mornin' when I'm wakin' up (come on)
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up (come on)
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See, them boys 112, we from the A... A!!! (ATL)
And when it comes to eatin' peaches shorty, we don't play.... PLAY!!!
So all the ladies in the house if ya peach's the shit
Put ya hands in the air, represent ya clit, get it?

[P. Diddy]:
This is the dance break
This the remix
Just want you to just...
Just, just, just bounce to this
Yeah, come on
Can I get a lick?
Come on, yeah, can I get a lick?
Yeah, yeah, come on

[Hook]
