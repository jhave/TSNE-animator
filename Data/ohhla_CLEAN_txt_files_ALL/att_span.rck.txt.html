[Aesop Rock] 3x
Every little step we take breaks the dreams
Of a warm pig itching to re-stitch the seams

[Vast Aire]
Namsayin, when I walk, I wanna break concrete!

Ox'll spit some shit that'll reflect off the mirror
My light beams are mad bright, they stay clever
Yo challenge an Ox member, get a vow severed
Found your body in the desert (Scavenger's dessert)
Yeah yeah I rap tight like Saran
Plus enter battles talkin shit like "Look mom, no hands!"
I'm tired of cats tryin to sum me
You can't add that far yet, that counting is far fetched
I treat MC like canines
Throwin words at they face to see if they bite when they catch
I told you my poetry sponsors Gillette
Now you standing there wit razors in your head like baretts
Man, if the mic had ass cheeks
The sticker in my hand would say priority seating
And man, I dunno if it was me or you
But your girl was on my dick like she was teethen
You play the role/roll, I'll play the poppy seed on top of you
The godspeed is actual, that doesn't mean I act usual
One of the first MC's to give the crowd full attention
Cuz you need love and affection

Chorus[Aesop Rock, Vast Aire] 2x
If we could absorb every star in the sky
We noticed some shine brighter than others, you wonder why
    It's the simple things in life that turn the pesants into leaders
    And we know the differences between the walkers and the sleepers

[Aesop Rock]
I boogie with picket-a-vision, carbon based stickler
City piss aroma, therapy coma, clone sitter
Itching to pigeon hole villain soul magnet
Feelings activate
Passionate the germ, and the book met the worm
I hold a book of matches captive to flashin
For some need flatline
Be a thick fatigue episdoe, brewed in batches
Flirted curse at perked nurse, broken skeleton patches
One muddy veteran collapsed the untapped resource center
Housing style pagents
My little limbs lassoed catered to wings
While mankinds babysteps break dirt and demon
I know a crossbreed strung well in the key of
Mass times weight times tame semantics
Encompassing that which splits lips but never supply and demand it
To hell wit plastic, ooh yeah it's splendid
Tap it on the shoulder, grab it, tag it, aprehend it
Lend it to the devil of a friend it, wrench it back, mend it again
It still never renders suspended but finicky picket fences
Now every toy dreams to manufacture hearts
Start with the diving parts and the blueprints
You follow the prescedence set by war pigs of a yester year
Let the tears pray
Skip a stone over the reservoir to shake the whole sharade
Hmm gun play the tumors platoon
I couldn't see
I fell asleep holding an Appleseed, woke up holding a tree
The only bridge I ever burned along this legacy at dance
Was the one that linked the cities of Prosperity and Chance

Chorus 2x
