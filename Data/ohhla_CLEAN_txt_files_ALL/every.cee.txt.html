[Lil' Cease]
What up B.I.G. what's the deal?
I hope you aight
I'm just, doin' my thing living day to day life
Yo you taught me the game, now we play alike
You taught me how to aim, when we bust gunz we spray alike
A lot of shit going on, Mafia holding on
My heart is from the start so I keep your name strong
Sittin here sippin' Hen, don't know where to begin
My album done now we're finishing Kim's
I'm tryin to get it right
Get my life back, on the right track
Walkin in street dressed in black, matchin my gat
I see my death coming, it's no turning back
Long as I see you again, that'll be that
Yo momz told me Slow down Cease, chill and relax
Get On your knees and Pray to you, you'll soon talk back
There, speakin of yo momz, thru her frustrations
And dedication, we helped her formed up the Foundation
Thank B.I.G.

[112] {Chorus}
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me 
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh)
Just to have you here with me
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G

[Lil' Cease]
Yo I remeber far back as the game goes
&gt;From the first bank rollz to the Cool Jeanz and Kango's
Breezing on the yacht, Dp's on the rock
Think of all the fly V's we used to swap
We took it up a notch
And everything that was hot, for $5,000 we copped
Little Cease, I'd a cop, rock, all types of a satch
50 G's on the watch, me and you up in the Spot
MtV was in shock, and I don't see why not
Man, we used to rock all the BET spots
Turned clubs into stadiums
And I remeber when you and Rock got knocked in the Paladium
And when we rock we do it all for you
And uh, don't gotta worry bout the names they was calling you
And I'ma tell you what we gonna do
Make hits and couldn't quit if we wanted to (yes I, won't stop)
Even though you're outta sight, you're never outta mind
I try to tell myself, when it's yo time, it's yo time
Ever since that weekend, everybody been beefin' and greifing
Losin they appetites, nobody eatin (miss you, yeah)
And it's due to all the weavin, I walked yo kidz to your coffin 
And tell em daddy's sleeping (daddy's sleeping)
But Killa he don't understand
He don't know that ignorance killed a wonderful man
You're not just another Rapper, wit money in yo hand
I think, what's the money, when I ain't got my man
That's why day's I walk the surface, feeling earthless (Oh Biggie)
Thinking was this rap shit really worth it (is it really worth it?)
And I know you didn't deserve it, It went so smooth
You thought they rehearsed it, Worst shit I ever 
Seen at a young age, it's fucked up when I see my man on front page
I reminisce on the old days, Love, Forever and Always
B.I.G. Nigga...


[112] {Chorus}X 2
Day dreaming, Said I'm wishing you were here 
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said we're missing you
Said it, I'm day dreaming (Wishing you..)
Just to have you here with me B.I.G.
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here (You were more than a friend) 
(Wishing you were here with me) (you were like a brother to 112)
Said we're missing you
Said it, I'm day dreaming (We need you here for today...)
Just to have you here with me B.I.G.
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me 
(Wishing you were here with me)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh)
Just to have you here with me
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G
Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me 
(Wishing you were here with me) (such a wonder full man)
Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh) ( B.I.G.)
Just to have you here with me( and I cant stop thinking about you)
We're missing you, (B.I.G)
B.I.G.
We Love you Always..
ooohh...
oh yeah...
112, Little Cease
