[Makeba Mooncyle]
In God I trust, but a man, I'll bust
From a little greed, I'm on pins and knees
My insanity, or profanity
Does this make me feel free?
To take what's mine, the grit, the grime
The games we play, the words we say
Singles or pairs, in the glares, in the stairs
Does this make you feel free?
To begin a race, at your own pace
I'm stating a case, without a trace
The snatch to the chase, I'm feeling out of place
Does this make me feel free?
And if I choose, to be misled
Just let me lose, and let me be
It's all a part, of being me
It just makes me feel free
So am I crazed, or on purple haze
A little daze, oh, how amazed
But nowadays, kids scared to pray
I am so free
It's perfect or plain, so I try to refrain
It's just a game, don't be ashamed
Remember my name, so you can sustain
You to can be free

[Chorus: Makeba Mooncycle]
Free to chill, free to build (if you try, you can make it)
Free to sky, free to try (reach for the sky, and just make it)
Free forgive, free for live (we're all for real, so don't fake it)
I just want to be free
Free to move, free to groove (if you try, you can make it)
Free to sky, free to shine (reach for the sky, and just make it)
Free for flow, free to know (we're all for real, so don't fake it)
I just want to be free

[Makeba Mooncycle]
The highest peak, the kings will seek
Ya'll make us weak, you try to retreat
The taste is sweet, til you feel my heat
It just makes you feel free
My words are strong, so push it along
Right or wrong, from dusk til dawn
The pressure is on, since the day I was born
I was meant to be free
It's my forte, to speak this way
I shall potray, ones that stray
I try to sway, to make you obey
So set yourself free
Is this my plight, regain your site
Remember to fight, is it wrong or right
Your guiding light, is God's in sight
Do you know what is free?
In a fit of rage, the world's my stage
Blessed with sage, I turn the page
On minimum wage, boxed in, in my cage
Yes, I want to be free
My form of speech, is meant to teach
Never too weak, I made you leap
From river to creek, I latch on like a leech
So you can be free
I shed a tear, to make things clear
I know you'll hear, I have no fear
My thoughts sincere, actions severe
We all can be free

[Chorus]

[Makeba Mooncycle]
As I proceed to take hold of greed
There is no need, but these words I feed
I will succeed, forever to lead
You too can be free
My thoughts are sick, I wear illness well
If money is rich, am I close to hell
Forever the pitch, only time will tell
If you want to be free
If life is fixed, can you predict
Where's the glitch, and where's the snitch
I try to enrich, avoiding the ditch
Yes, I fell for free
So I declare, I'm so aware
Together, alone, or solitaire
I'm hard to compare, the truth to the dare
Are you ready to be free?
Can you afford, what's the reward
I lift my sword, in the name of the Lord
Holy water is clawed, am I going overboard?
My obsession with free
With every word, I'm so superb
I thought you heard, don't be disturbed
First in line, I'm never third
You thoughts can be free
Who has won, it's said and done
From putting it safe, I continue to race
To finish mine, I begin to embrace
Cuz I am now free

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
