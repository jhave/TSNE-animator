(Kid Rock)
Bonnie shades
And a high top fade
So low you know on the mic with no aid
You didn't think in a blink no way
That I'd make the grade
But now you say I use to go to school with him
I use to go to dot dot bim
I use to know his older brother
I use to be his eigth grade lover
Talk is cheap and the speech is weak
He use to go with me, wrong you were my freak
I never gave a hoot
If a girl was cute
All I wanted was a piece and a knock the boots
And then they get dissed
Crossed off my list
Though a bend in my behind would get kissed
Just like so world the girls will go low
Just like Jock Custoe
And blow
Up come my drawers, see ya gotta go
It's to plain
Kid Rock's the name
And I run my game
From Frisco to Maine
Never fell in love
Cause I'm a girl heartbreaker
But still I built my skills and I'm the

Cause I'm the

(Kid Rock)
Stop the madness
You never had this
Wild style of my b-boy badness
Runnin the show
Clockin the dough
And Juliet get fucked if I was Romeo, but I'm not
I'm Kid Rock
Flat top and all
Not Michael Jackson spinnin singing off the wall
But making everyone how I thump like thunder
Got over like a mother
While you went straight under
And now you can't stand
The way I jam
Hold the mic in my hand
And rock the whole land
Man get jealous if you want to
But either way I'm gonna do what I have to do
Cause I work to hard to make ends match
Started from scrath
And to a lot of crap
But now I'm like a wild horse no one can catch
And I'm a bad mother fucker
Believe that
I'll pop on top more flop no stop
Makin every girl in the house want a piece of the rock
And then I'll bring a new swing
To make it understand the kid's running things
Mostly because I'm not an MC faker
And the rest because I'm the

Microphone master Super Rhyme Maker
