[Intro/Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, or the cookies
We can eat, make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just askin baby
could you meet me by the lake? (Said bring a towel)
Well baby meet me by the lake (bathing suit it's goin down)
Shit, just meet me by the lake (we could count the shootin stars)
Well could you meet me by the lake? (Summer never has to end)
With me

[Hodgy Beats]
I'ma give it to her, she want that summertime
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm herrrrs
And damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin in her purrrrse
Damn right it's me; I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in summertime, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us Venice Beachin, she wanna go shoppin
Sundown at the club cause she like to get it poppin
Sangria on my freedmind cause she likes to get it poppin
No ecstasy for her, but she wanna get it poppin
Drop toppin, I measure her pleasure
then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
summertime in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

[Chorus]

[Tyler, the Creator]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
and brought some extra towels if anyone was askin
We should take a dip, in that lake quick, and then split
Then do somethin that's beyond what we both can imagine

[Outro]
{*12X background: Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset*}
Have a drink, look in the sky
Never have to leave, look - there goes a rainbow
We can sit here, all night
School is in session, look - there goes a rainbow
Look, you know
The water's pretty deep - let's go to sleep</pre>
