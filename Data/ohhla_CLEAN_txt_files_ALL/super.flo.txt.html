Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We believed in love, when love wasn't an option
She wanted to give birth, I wanted adoption
After days and days of conversation, we decided to go with fertilization
Then came baby showers and lamaze classes, 2am phone calls, one minute contractions
But then they wisked me away like Brigadoon, no domestic partners in the delivery room

But if I was a superhero I would break free
Wouldn't need anyone to come and save me
And you couldn't make me, feel like I'm crazy
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

And if I was a superhero I would break free
And I wouldn't be in prison wherever you take me
I would change everyone that's trying to change me
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

Life in an occupied land is hard, we pushed harder
Soon to be a mom, him to be a father
Boys with guns at the checkpoint and brothel
Wouldn't let me pass when I said I need a doctor
I don't know the source of the passport errors
Or how four hours produced a miscarriage
But when it comes to populations too disparaged
Gaza's on the list, right below gay marriage

But if I was a superhero I would break free
Wouldn't need anyone to come and save me
And you couldn't make me, feel like I'm crazy
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

And if I was a superhero I would break free
And I wouldn't be in prison wherever you take me
I would change everyone who's trying to change me
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

There's something on my heart, there's someone on my mind
I never would have thought that I could be so angry,
but please give me the patience, please give me the patience

There's something on my heart, there's someone on my mind
I never would have thought that I could be so angry,
but please give me the patience, please give me the patience

But if I was a superhero I would break free
Wouldn't need anyone to come and save me
And you couldn't make me, feel like I'm crazy
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

Yeah if I was a superhero I would break free
And I wouldn't be in prison wherever you take me
I would change everyone who's trying to change me
I would see my baby, I would see my baby

Yeah if I was a superhero I would break free
And I wouldn't be in prison wherever you take me
I would change everyone who's trying to change me
I would see my baby, I would see my baby</pre>
