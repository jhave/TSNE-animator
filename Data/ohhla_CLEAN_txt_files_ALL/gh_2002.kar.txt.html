** "You're ghetto!" added before every line starting with 'you know...' **

[Kardinal Offishall]
Take it low low low
Yo, yo, yo
You know you ghetto when the money you got is dead wrong
It's royalties from biting Kardinal's song
You know you ghetto when you thinkin you a star
And you're waiting in line at the back for drinks at the bar
You know you ghetto when you try to do a ghetto song of your own down coming out down south
You thought Kardinal wouldn't buss you in your mouf
You know you ghetto when you think you number one with the flow
And you shoutin' out yourself on the radio
You know you ghetto when the polo that you rock
Is on sale at TJ Max from you head to your socks
You know you ghetto when you stuck inside a jail
And them Gators on your feets cost more then your bail
You know you ghetto when you think you represent
But them niggas in the street ain't spendin' a red cent
Ain't tryin' to buy your single, nigga hell no!
If you dubbin' this right now 'stead of buyin' my album
You're

CHORUS [Kardinal Offishall] (Circle crew)
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are, when ya think you a star
Flossin' on the street in the rental car
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think that your nice
But the opposite don't look twice
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O
(You're Ghetto)
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O

[Kardinal]
You know you ghetto when your boys push crack
And you buyin' crack from them so you can go smoke out back
You know you ghetto when your moms part of your crew
And your nigga's hanging out to get closer to her too
You know you ghetto when I don't know who you are but nigga I know your name
Cause I can read it on your chain
You know you ghetto when ya, rapping along
And ya can relate to the rhyme I'm spittin' in the song
You know you ghetto when ya best clothes, is your dress clothes
And dress is Paco jeans and Jelly slippers, namean?
You know you ghetto when ya askin' for  some cigarettes
'Cause you can't afford hash to mix with that weed in your stash
You know you ghetto when you tryin' to get your flirt on
And that cock blockin' nigga got the same Gucci shirt on
You know you ghetto when you own two cars
And you need ten from me to buy drinks at the bar

CHORUS [Kardinal] (Circle crew)
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think that you're fly
But the home girls walk right by
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think ya got clout
But your hair weave keeps fallin' out
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O
(You're Ghetto)
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O

[Kardinal]
Yo
You know you ghetto when you bring home your boys
And your auntie's lookin' at your crew like they sex toys
You know you ghetto when your brothers paid from jugglin'
And you driving his Range, talking 'bout nigga we strugglin'
You know you ghetto when ya sittin' down in class
And dang, a cockroach went and crawled out ya book bag
You know you ghetto when ya tried to rap like DMX
And you get your breddren to do you video because you can't afford Little X
You know you ghetto when rap is part of your dream
But you can't stay out past one cause your mom runs your street team
You know you ghetto when ya savin' to buy a key
But your grand pop is still on the corner pushin' that weed
You know you ghetto when you know you not Jamaican
But your clothes say Tommy Sean John nigga you fakin'
You know you ghetto when ya like every other brotha
Rappin' loud, walking down the street tryin' to be discovered

CHORUS [Kardinal] (Circle crew)
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are, when ya think you a star
Flossin' on the street in the rental car
(You're Ghetto)
Ghetto's what ya are when ya think that your nice
But the opposite don't look twice
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O
(You're Ghetto)
You're G to the H to the E to the T T O
(You're Ghetto)

[Kardinal Offishall]
Going out, to that home girl
And the house niggas
at the Burlington Coat Factory
...
Know what I'm saying
*laughter*
You're ghetto!

And by the way you are biting</pre>
