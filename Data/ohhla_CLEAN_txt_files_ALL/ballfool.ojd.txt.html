Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I came in with them bricks
I got fire with the money
I got pounds of the game
Got your bitch on the ridin
I'm a walking vault baby, I can do the willing
Pull out the bands then the bands go to papi
Ballin like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Ballin like a fool like I play with MJ
Ballin like a fool every day my birthday
Ballin like a fool 'cause I'm stupid with the cake

[Verse 1]
Bandz, call me rubber bandz shawty
50 out the sack plus no give me out in shopping
Gwap, man my pockets so gwapy
Merry shoe, gucci shoe, Louie shoe walking
My real coping wall 4, 50 for the prada
Came from the hood, so all my blood we got prada
4 pocket full, pockets own well fargo
Pull up to your trap, burn 'em murcielago
93 gap and want me to flamin piro
Weapons of the bricks, like I'm fixing up a giro
32 ENT we plug then we problo
Trap the trailer pull it up and if you in cargo

[Chorus]
I came in with them bricks
I got fire with the money
I got pounds of the game
Got your bitch on the ridin
I'm a walking vault baby, I can do the willing
Pull out the bands then the bands go to papi
Ballin like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Ballin like a fool like I play with MJ
Ballin like a fool every day my birthday
Ballin like a fool 'cause I'm stupid with the cake

[Verse 2]
My plug ain't had no bricks
So we gave me a pound of meth
Get money, fuck hoes, stay strapped to the death
I wanna go to the club but I got 50 pounds left
Rifles don't wanna sign me I got them dope boys check
I'm walking on bricks, but I ain't Jesus Christ
A load of whole van full of work don't it sound nice
Ballin' like a fool, stay strapped on with that tool
Wrapped them dudes off that fifteen
Ain't had time for no school
In the NBA where OJ shooting blocks of yae
Plus came in yesterday turned the money in a day
My partner keep that cake, if you ever wanna play
I just made history, the first meskin in the NBA

[Chorus]
I came in with them bricks
I got fire with the money
I got pounds of the game
Got your bitch on the ridin
I'm a walking vault baby, I can do the willing
Pull out the bands then the bands go to papi
Ballin like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Ballin like a fool like I play with MJ
Ballin like a fool every day my birthday
Ballin like a fool 'cause I'm stupid with the cake

[Verse 3]
Ballin with the money
I just sold a dummie
25 percentage, he thought he got 100
The AK holder honda
The minute holder honda
In my trap house, 'cause they look like we ten ducking
I had to cross a motor, boss some sell in, raid the run though
Ball, piers, numbers and we get it to you pronto
Come along mail man, bring him to you front door
Walking with the bricks but my hands are all commando
I got that fish scale like a nigga I found nemo
Got so many birds like the disney movie Rio
Caught your main girl and your buddy had a trio
Taco bells shawty selling bricks like burrito

[Chorus]
I came in with them bricks
I got fire with the money
I got pounds of the game
Got your bitch on the ridin
I'm a walking vault baby, I can do the willing
Pull out the bands then the bands go to papi
Ballin like a fool like I'm in the NBA
Ballin like a fool like I play with MJ
Ballin like a fool every day my birthday
Ballin like a fool 'cause I'm stupid with the cake</pre>
