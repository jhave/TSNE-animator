Song:   Come Into My House
Typed by: scott_rodkey@hotmail.com

Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom), come one come all
When it comes to lyrics I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove) House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house

	"Don't make me wait, come into my house"
		"Give me body"		           (Repeat 2x)

Here's a dance step, from now I'll kick a
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya
I'm the Queen, Latifah
Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?) Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool) I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum, give me some
With the Flavor Unit I've come to say "Ride the grooveline"
Don't swing the pipeline, listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hosting (What?)
Come and rock with the one that's chosen
It can't turn me inside out (Uh uh)
For those that dare, come into my house

	"Don't make me wait, come into my house"
		"Give me body"		           (Repeat 2x)

It's a new fusion I'm using
You ask what is it I'm doing?
Hip-hop house, hip-hop jazz, with a little pizzazz
&gt;From the Queen, the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from "Wrath of My Madness?"
It's my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The asiatic black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation, come into my house

	"Don't make me wait, come into my house"
		"Give me body"		           (Repeat 4x)</pre>
