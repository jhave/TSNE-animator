She wants me to break it half
So I'mma crack it like Humpty Dumpty
Her brothas want jump me
But but motherfuck a lil trick
She can get the dicka dee dick dick down south or in her mouth
Bustin' nigs I like to digs dark meat
Big booty but no cellulete
I'll grab it stab it cause I gots to have dag nabbit
Fuck it like rabbit
Wanna make it holla
Oh what the hell
Bust a right turn 12 dollar motel
Cause in the hood thats the best a nigga get
Small room smelling like cigarettes
Look girl it's a bed and builing
So stop acting like you gotta have the Hilton
It's four walls so drop your drawls and get cozy
Cause I'mma break you off something at the Mozi-Wozi

Chorus:
*Woman moans*
(Mozi-Wozi)
Mack 10 bitch
(Niggaz make a children)
Foe life
(Bitch I'll be there)
You got damn right
(If it cares to trip 'em)

Before we get busy go and take a shower
But hurry up shit cause we only got an hour
And I plan to be in it up to win it a good 45 minutes
And break that back down
Stick yo ass in the air and lay yo head flat down
Waking up the neighbors nothing can save ya
But I hope I don't catch the vapors
Cause funky ass cock is a turn off
It gets me hotter than pace paconie sauce
&gt;From New Yor City ("New York City")
You got a big ole ass and little bitty titties
But it's cool, cause I can hunt for your chest
And now we getting complaints from the front desk
At my door just to get a peek freak
Motherfucka kinda nozy at the Mozi-Wozi

Bridge: [Mack 10] X4
*Woman moans*
I'm breakin' hoes down 'till their very last complaint
Ass up face down

Ain't no frontin' on the pussy that I'm gettin'
Name is Mack 10 but fuck it I'm still sweating
You won't believe all the wreak I'm catching
I'm hard as a brick and my rubber is stretching
See a motel bed can take a pounce
When you give it more bounce to the ounce
And I'm feeling it from the way I'm hung
And I'm killing it I might puncture a lung
Now the Mozi-Wozi is the place for chillin'
But the bathroom towels ain't worth stealin'
The T.V.'s broke and the carpet is dirty
And you got till about 12:30
To have yo ass out
But don't fuck around and get drunk and pass out
Cause before I can finish this rhymes
You hear a buzzer and a bitch yealen check out time

Chorus

Bitch so don't even trip
(Mozi-Wozi)

Let's go...</pre>
