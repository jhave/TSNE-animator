Song:   Protocol
Typed by: senortre@aol.com

-I suppose you're programmed for etiquette and protocol.
-Protocol? Why, it's my primary function

My rap tone cracks domes and backbones
Shamus known as Esoteric wrecks tracks (tracts) like gallstones
You're prone to perish for biting sentences
Printing lyrics on your j-card without citing references
Crazy ill kids fill me like placebos
But I don't pull steel like Magneto
I'll leave you black and blue like Max Rebo 
Offa my cerebral, God complex but no cathedral 
I hammer heads like Momanaydon, underground like Raydon
Throw my tape on, I burn your wax down to a crayon
Word, I used to take chemistry and physics
Now I take it to your chest piece like a bishop
What is it? Shamus rippin' apart mental composites
Diagnostic, caustic, I desposit
Brains of rap stars in glass jars
My frame's composed of more species than Madagascar
I gobble suns like a quasar
You're Hailey's comet, and although low
I rock don't make me patriotic
I'm still robotic rebel alliance medic
Shamus the god awful also known as Esoteric

-I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
-Only tryin' to show you what your records keep on missin' is
-All of y'all with the gall, I will leave in a daze
-So sucka mc's, please think twice

I'm knockin some sense in kids like boxing events
My toxins dispese, blockin' your vents like oxygen tents
That club ish, singin in the break stuff is rubbish
You'll never catch Shamus Ryan with that stuff published
So stop the gimmicks and the image that you're mimicking
Cause that'll be detected like alpha toxin carcinogen
Behind me, my cortex nematode brings Strontium-90
And spits it back in your face kindly
Remind me, to stomp a silly goose
Your shit is played like the power of Zeus
A joke for those who try to produce
You couldn't be real if I turned you to magnetic tape
Oh you tried to replicate my whole genetic state, I generate
Like electricty, devastate with symmetry
Penetrate heads with metal plates I set it straight
like alignments, put your wack raps up on Ken Simon
Cause you can't get paid until you sell out with rhymin'
I'm in, a state of euphoria
Android warrior your raps are gettin' sorrier and sorrier
The protocol drugs players like topply
Tsunami and I'm ?hissed like horozami?
