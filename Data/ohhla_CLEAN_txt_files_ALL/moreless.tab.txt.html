Y'all hear that
Whats that sound
Ya know ya want it
I'ma tell um what we need

[Verse One]
More franchising, less sanitizing
More uprising, less downsizing
More enterprising, less sympathizing
More building, less destroying
More jobs, less unemployment
Let's give the devil less enjoyment
More originality, less biting off 'Pac and Big
More community activism, less pigs
More blacksmithing, def jerks less Geffen
and the rest cause the rest suck
they got the shit all messed up
More marijuana, less coke
More accountability from politician before we shouting let's vote
More schools, less prisons
More freestyles, less written
More serious shit and less kidding
More history, less mystery
More Beyonce, less Brittney
More happiness, less misery
More victory, less loses
More workers we all bosses
Of course it's reflection! (What we need?)

[Chorus: Dion]
More love
less hate
more real
less fake
more grind
less wishing

less stunting
more fame
less talking
more changes
less rushing
more vision

[Verse Two]
God bless the hood when my money always good
I can get some chicken now
thinking couldn't when I could son
I live above the rim and pay the full
like my nigga what crack his hoe
niggas wish we all wish a nigga would crack a joke
Like he want to battle for the mic
This is Brooklyn, the planet
Y'all niggas is like satellites revolve around my every word
I address the crowd like Lincoln at Gettysburg
Surrounded by the heavy herb
The crowd is more or less wall to wall here's for the pure
Hip-Hop how, I'm rocking got them dropping they jaw
Fire marshall blocking the door
Does he crack like he chopping the Raw
This is the shit the cops is stopping us for
This is the rain of the tek and the motherfuckers be nuts
Slice like nip tuck, specialize in deep cuts
It's the music that you riding to
Provided to you by Hi-Tek and Kweli the livest two
(What we need? What we need)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
The more I put into it
the less it sounds like non-sense
The more natural, the less conscious
At the same time the more bomb shit
The less a devil's got a grip
I get it loose we gotta slip away the ghetto yea
More for a dollar, more fresh goods for purchase
Less liquor stores
Less churches that be looking like corner stores
More rap songs that stress purpose
With less misogyny less curses
Let's put more depth in our verses 'til they left on the surface
While we stomp through the underground
The calm don't come around
You sort of hoping for that refection, you sort of open
I'm a heathen call 'em chosen
I don't play with your emotion
Stop acting so god damn emotional
I give you these bars free like it's promotional
This ain't no marketing strategy
It had to be from the heart in order to be reality
Reflection (What we need? What we need)

[Chorus]</pre>
