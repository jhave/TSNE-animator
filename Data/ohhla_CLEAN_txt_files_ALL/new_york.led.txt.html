Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[DJ Khaled]
This is, this is
This is, this is
I'm about Unity
Greetings from Miami Dade County Florida

Listennn

[Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

[Jadakiss]
Yo the hammer and the muzzle came together
All I had did was hold on to the pieces untill the puzzle came together
Before it all got hyped
I was in the corridor
Apple before it got ripped
So I ain't gotta act like
I'm on top of, or in front of them
If I aint the best dog then I'm one of them
Listenn I'm a different kind of boss
I'm Cut from a different kind of cloth
These niggas is different kind of soft
Everybody know it all
Nobody follow a protocal
The money's only good until you blow it all
Stacking every cents
Guliani knocked John Gotti, What?
So now he's running for president
It's a shame what the game's became
But the truth is
There's really nobody to blame
But the music
Lets give it a minute
Wtih no wack gimmicks
Just hard beats and rhymes
blow breath back in it

[Chorus: Jada and DJ khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

[Fat Joe]
Mutha Fucka i'm the heart and sole of this
You claim king, but we in control of this
Name another rapper you see on the streets
huggin the block at the height of a beef
Yellow tape and white sheets
Yea that's my back drop whenever I speak
I know alotta y'all would love to ice me
make my head jerk like I'm doing the hyphy
But that'll never happen, get on some sick shit
Like fifteen in you, and one in your infant
Joe's the business, Ask about me
In the middle of the desert
and they still can drought me
You know Coka baby he stay on that new york shit
You see weezy coming down on that forklift
And money aint a thing, unless he come off with
Then Ima have to hit em with these little bricks often

[Chorus: Fat Joe and DJ Khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

[Ja Rule]
New york, New York nigga never went no where
I just took off a couple of years
But Now I'm back on my day to day
Old school, Gucci frames like day to day
Who gone tell New york times up, Flava flav
Cuz as much as things change it remains the same
And you can gimme the city of God
And Mecca, the temple, the mas
An inspiration, the inception, The art.
Of Hip Hip was born
And the rap game was formed
From niggas dead broke, sell drugs, bear arms
Against all odds
and argue all day about who's a bigger star
Joe, Jada, or Ja
SO close but so far
So many there's no star
I can't belive Fifty Cent and NY fell off
And L.A. came back, and the south is running shit
Then one blood group, shit's all developing, NEW YORK

[Chorus: Ja Rule and DJ Khaled]
One's for the trouble
Two's for the show
Three's for the base and that limelight glow
I know, you thinking that this game is over
Oh no, the wait is over
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back

Lemme see your hands, wave em side to side
Put em up high, lets ride because
New York is back
