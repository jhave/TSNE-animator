Run-D.M.C., the Kings of Queens
and we in this month's Penthouse, Magazine
You can find out things that you never knew
About Run-D.M.C. in the April issue

[D.M.C.]
Like, I was a kid, this is what I did
I grabbed a Penthouse, and then I hid
I peeked at the pictures, but never knew

[Run]
There are a lot of def articles to read, too

[D.M.C.]
You'll find out in our interview
About what is a lie, and what is true
So now I read it, instead of just look it
You know you'll need it, to know what's cookin
So grab your April Penthouse, and put it in your hands

[Run]
It's available now at your favorite newsstand, RRRR-AHH!
