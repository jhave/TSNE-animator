Song:   So Gangsta
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Snoop Dogg]
From the hood, to the valley, from yards, to the alleys
"Wonderland" in demand and the man is "Malice"
O.G.'s blow trees, gold keys to the palace
Gangbang on 'caine maintain for the challenge
and shank ya, bank ya, levitate ya, spray ya
Butch (Cassidy!) Come with some gangster flavor

[Butch Cassidy]
On my block, I handle my deep business every day
I hustle, on the streets I do it the old fashioned way
I roll out, with some girls that's from the hood
They love me, that's understood
And we burn trees that's so good, damn, we, should
Daily, I stay G'd up with my khakis and my 'gars
Burn, then I pick up my two dogs and bend the curb
That's gangsta, gotta grab a fresh {?} bud
Now I bend it up like a thug
And my Chrysler on two dubs, plus, G'd, up
I keep it gangsta fo' sho', because it's all that I know
The only way that I roll, the only way that I'll go I'm so

[Chorus: Butch Cassidy]
SO gangsta, I'm so, SO gangsta
So gangsta - SO gangsta, we are, I'm sooooooo
SO gangsta, so gangsta, SO gangsta
So gangsta, SO gangsta, bye bye

[Snoop Dogg]
Itchy gitchy ga ga, the shit that get you hotter
So you won't have to bother or come back yeah baby father
Best save for dada, unbutton your collar
Mix the shit yup it's "Tha Doggfather"
Six-deuce Impala, hip-hop to holler
Chipped blocked and locked, hits with rottweilers
Stand out, and van out the week
I bang out, and hang out the streets
Push the line of a capo, a don
Whick-whack niggaz did black folks so wrong
Peep that out
Eastside Long Beach, grip that out
Two times on mine; see I'm a vet on the set
Steppin my step, where my weapon is kept
C-rag in my pocket yeah it's still on my left
I'ma smoke 'til my motherfuckin last breath
I'm so gangsta

[Chorus]

[Butch Cassidy]
Are you gangster? They all know
Hot doe, breaks down do's and kill at shows
Wanksta - never though
Let it go, call up hoes, I got the indo
Boooooom, watch the intellect lose her fear
Street shit they can't come near
Let 'em all know that I'm here, no more fears

[Chorus]</pre>
