[Intro: U-God]
I'm tellin' you, tellin' you, tellin' you
Ain't ready, Mark, Mark, they ain't ready, man
They ain't ready, they ain't ready, they ain't ready for me
They ain't ready for me, they ain't ready for me right now, nigga
I'm here... {*laugh*} When you thought it was safe
Ahh... ooh... give it to me, give it to me
Uh... yeah... now give it to me, give it to me
Pump... now bump bump... now bump..
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, now bump

[Chorus: Autumn Rue (U-God) {both}]
Baby, when you put it on me (on me)
Do you thing relentlessly ('lessly)
Don't you wanna scream my name? {over, over} again
I just wanna scream your name (your name)
Give you lovin' that's insane {insane}
Baby, won't you make me scream {over, over} again

[U-God]
Yo, yo, yo... now your's truly, same ol' g
Ya'll gon' see, you can't hold me
Feel my energy, my soul so free
For a half a century, I've been low key
Who is he? They call him, U-G-O-D
Real grizzly, busy as a bee
Feel it in the air, over the sea
Don't be mad cuz your ho chose me
Hazel eyes, no goatee, hold heat, rock you to sleep
Known in the streets for my platinum teeth
Cuz when I pop something, I go in deep, no bump

[Chorus]

[U-God]
Now that's right, nigga, I got those skills
Nerves of steel, sex appeal
Hand skills, like windmills
Mind bender, every time I send chills
Dressed to kill, throw 'em in the trance
Make 'em dance like ants in they pants
Check out my, battle stance, comin' down
Avalanche, war's closing and you got no chance
Hard, rock, abs, move like a snake
All that ass, make the waterbed break
Skin like a god and for heaven's sake
Why you wanna make a nigga scream your name? Spark..

[Autumn Rue]
Niggaz try to say what I want
What's the deal, let's keep this blunt
We only try'nna have some fun
How can, I get you home?
I searched, you're not the typical kind of guy
Your moves they, definetly caught my eye
I like the way you take the beat slow
After the party is on

[Chorus 2X]

[Outro: U-God]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
From the Slums of Shaolin
Hillside Scramblers, we out the garbage, niggaz
What? Huh? You ain't think I was gon' come back, huh?
Did ya? It's U-G-O-D-Zilla
That's right, that's right, Hillside Scramblers
The gram handlers is back, yo Mark, yo Mark
Yo, spark that track, baby!</pre>
