(They'll have to deal with the kingpin
Let's get it on)
(...
I'm the boss
The boss of all bosses
And don't forget it
A kingpin's the head of the Madja
The biggest crime syndicate around)

Well, I'm the chief, better known as a rap pro, and
Keep the parties pumpin even if a beat's goin
Slower than usual, I stay on cruise until
They try to dis, then I confuse a full
Amount of rappers that try to get with it
I look em in the face and say, "Forget it
I'm the kingpin"

I'm dope, fly, my style's extraordinary
Stupid fresh to the max, that's why it's necessary
For me to defeat and become elite
In a class by myself, which makes me so complete
At the top when I rock, I charge like a rhino
You're addicted to my rhymes just like a wino
Is to liquor, but don't start to hic up
Straight up and down, the best fly rhyme kicker
My name is Craig G, I keep a party live, and
The mic a jet plane, my rhyme keep risin
They won't decline, it's destination maximum
Party crowds ain't small, cause people I'm attractin em
So that they come to hear these fresh showtunes
But they probably wouldn't dance, there'd be no elbow room
In the joint, get the point? I never fronted
Your rhymes is so wack, they make me sick to my stomach
So let me ask you why you're always on my tip
Is it because I rhyme so hip
Or I'm the kingpin?

You can't have a 3-4 without the 1-2
And if you try to steal my rhymes, I'm gonna hunt you
Down, just like you was a rap bounty
I search from cities all the way to counties
Until I find you, and may I remind you
Just like a ninja I sneak up behind you
And take your life, cause I'm just that heartless
Turn up my mic, so I can start this
Entourage, or should I say ensemble?
And if you got back-up, man, you should calm them
I'm not playin, there's no delayin
Your rhymes are so old, they're decayin
That's why you're the one with the least clout
Marley Marl, I think we better peace out
Cause I'm the kingpin

(...teach you to run out on the kingpin)
(...I will return)

Well, I'm the chief, better known as a rap pro, and
Keep the parties pumpin even if a beat's goin
Slower than usual, I stay on cruise until
They try to dis, then I confuse a full
Amount of rappers that try to get with it
I look em in the face and say, "Forget it
I'm the kingpin"
