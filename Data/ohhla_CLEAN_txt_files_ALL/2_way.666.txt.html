(HOOK)-(DJ Paul)
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She goin threw your beeper when she know you asleep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She beamin up your boys for her own private creep
She's a two way bitch, a two way shit
She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit

(DJ Paul)
Now don't you really hate
when somebody be two wayin you
And plus you knowin for a fact
that you aint given them the number two
She just a groupie ass hole
That's all up on your grind
Wastin up characters
puttin shit like you was on my mind
Im hitten back, back
Look here lil momma
You wasten yo time
And plus the scats out to fuckin
House of don't be wasten mine
And especially ones
with the pages that be unlimited
that do you wrong
cause they deal
gon stay to say you did
They some two way freaks
And they out the were
Hitchu up at like 4 in da mornin
You be like god damn or were you ridin
Down the street side to side
Cause this hoe bout to wreck
Im bout to throw this Motorola out the window
Im gettin tired of this bitch
What you want from me
Gave you to my dog
But you still keep beepin shit outta me
All in front of yo man
Claimin you talkin to yo girl
He don't know
cause you specialize in this
Yous a two way hoe fo sho

(HOOK)-(DJ Paul)
She's a two way freak, a two way freak

She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She beamin up your boys for her own private creep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit

(Juicy 'J')
They call me the juice
The  no chicken lover
A gigglo at night
Dats always in trouble
I cruise around the city
I'm rollin up the sticky
I'm ridin 22's
And I love big titties
Gel and weave
Gel and weave
If she from the hood
Then she down wit me
She got gel and weave
Gel and weave
Wit a big round ass
Im yo man to be
As im rollin down the block
A player gotta beep
That said I wanna fuck
a two way freak
Her name is Rhonda perry
Who works at the dairy
Her chewin is da bomb
But her face looks scary
Im pushin down the street
Tryin to make it to her house
And then I gotta beep from my freak
Named Minnie mouse
They call her Minnie mouse
She live a couple trees
She eat a lot of cheese
If you hit she'll squeak

(HOOK)-(DJ Paul)
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She goin threw your beeper when she know you asleep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit
She's a two way freak, a two way freak
She beamin up your boys for her own private creep
She's a two way bitch, a two way bitch
She wastin up your characters and aint talk about shit

(La Chat)
Early in the mornin
My two way is jumpin
Wit da petty want some boys
Daddy want nothin
Wastin up my characters
You don't have to pay thus
I aint got no time for no
whatchu doin unless its just
Goin to the bathroom
Two way on the tv
Come back
It's my baby daddy
tryin to see whos beepin me
Dog that's a NO, NO
Get yo stuff you gotta go
Scrollin threw my two way
Its like scrollin threw my cash flow
La' Chat
In the club
Boys they be tryin to holla
Don't know how to act
Gotta two way on yo colar
Askin can you get a beep
Hell na not at all
You'll be dat dude
Dat'll make me
Throw my junk into the wall
I use it for business
Sometimes its for pleasure
I can make exceptions
When you want to
Spend dat chedda
If you want to hit me up
Make sure daddies worth a hit
Or you when like you responded
I don't mess with two-way tricks
