Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait

I have a loyal army of murderers
Some run up, some snipers
And they all follow me like the Pied Piper
Heaven ain't even an option; Hell is where I'm going
Fuck all the denial, at least I'm knowing
If my niggaz who passed did not make it upstairs
I don't break my vows, send me down, my place is there
Love is strong, some feel this is wrong
This is more than a motherfucking song
See, I pledged my loyal allegiance to my brothers
That no matter the circumstances we die for each other
And if one of us die, then we kill for that brother
Kill everything, leave no stone uncovered
Chop down family tree, burn all the lumber
Anything teething or breathing we leaving
We must magnify when it's your time for grieving
Don't get it twisted, that don't make us even
After this life you can bet I'll be scheming
Fight down in Hell, refereed by demons
Even they'll back up when they see you get mangled
I'll have you wishing you was a motherfucking angel
With pretty white wings, but let's get back to Earth
If it costs me all my money then fuck it that's what it's worth
Kill you right in the club while you're holding your drink
Brains on the floor, I see what you think
Don't trust me, keep your eyes open don't blink
Like it was battleship, your ass will sink
If my niggaz who passed did not make it upstairs
I don't break my vows, send me down, my place is there
Love is strong, some feel this is wrong
This is more than a motherfucking song
This is a pledge of allegiance to my brothers
That no matter the circumstances we die for each other
Even if we have to do football type numbers
You might see some winters, but not too many summers
I feel legs but my heart sensation is number
When feds look for clues, cremation do wonders
Agents are looking like Dumb &amp; Dumber
Like Dumb &amp; Dumber
(Like what?)
Like Dumb &amp; Dumber
Dumb &amp; Dumber
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Get it?
Heaven can wait
That's it</pre>
