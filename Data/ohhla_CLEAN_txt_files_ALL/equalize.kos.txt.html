"Hit it"

[Verse 1]
This is a broadcast from the universe
Supersonic bond, metaphor, megahertz
I'm on a mission with the mic in the holster
Spread the love from coast to coast hear the dope for editing
My only enemy's inside of me
Trying a lot of me but my degree's in the anatomy
My thoughts, they rotate, like planets round the sun
I observe them one by one, like a scientist
Once again kids be breaking the rules
Taking the school, the MCs playing the fool
What do you do, when all eyes are looking at you
For the answers to impossible questions that ain't true
That when I fall back
Recognize magnetic attraction pulling light down to this physical fraction
Makes me human, that why I humanize
I came to make the breaker, make it equalize

[Chorus]
There's no need to run
Staring at the sun
There's one place left to go
And everybody knows
Things are going to change
There's only better days coming

[Verse 2]
I'm back from sabbatical this mathematical magical stealth with the microphone
Seeing knowledge as self
Its here to elevate, regulate, or discombobulate
The weight of illegitimate fate now
Whatever the time, remember the mind's not the body
It's probably my last time but maybe not 'cause I've
Got a new style, it's what's up
Pain of the people means pop don't stop
Ladies and gents this is school house rock
Changing the plot, hip-hop with me or not
Ripping apart, its stereotypical art
Holding me back 'cause rap's not a grade of the dark
Jimi Hendrix was a hero to most
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host
All the unknowns, they were heroes to most
That's why we crown and toast the brand new host, equalize

[Chorus]

Gimmie a beat
Gimmie a beat

[Chorus]

I'm walking down this open road
I've got to shake this heave load
I know there's things in life I'll never see 'cause heaven only knows
Take this heavy load
Down this open road</pre>
