Bad habits, bad habits, bad habits

Bad habits, bad habits
Picked a few up nine years in this game
Bad habits, bad habits
Lifestyle's fast driving me insane
Bad habits, bad habits
Daily doses just gotta maintain
Bad habits, bad habits
Drinkin' beer, smokin' weed and a pack a day

A pack a day, seven grams of weed
A beer when I'm ready, y'all know me
Yeah I got some habits, I picked up a few
It's the D-L-O-C, so what you gon' do

The demons inside me are clinging so tightly
The voices in my head say you don't wanna come down, k

A pack a day to get me by, an ounce of weed to keep me high
Alcohol still numbs the pain, some things in life just never change
I don't know but I've been told, you live this way, you won't grow old, yeah
Your addiction hits so quick, these bad habits are hard to quit

Bad habits, bad habits
Everybody has them, who you got to blame
Bad habits, bad habits
Flush it all away, go and spit it down the drain
Bad habits, bad habits
Chemical dependencies have a hold of your brain
Bad habits, bad habits
When my time comes, I'm going out with a bang

I got problems that I don't tell many
Talk about bad habits, shit, I got plenty
Nicotine, weed, beer, shooting pool and playing cards
Mushrooms, pills, strange pussy, fast cars
Yeah Johnny Richter, pass the mic
Better yet dog, need to pass the pipe
I'm tryin' to hit that shit but you're not paying attention
I wanna pack a rip, don't you trip, you sittin'

A pack a day to get me by, an ounce of weed to keep me high
Alcohol still numbs the pain, some things in life just never change
I don't know but I've been told, you live this way, you won't grow old, yeah
Your addiction hits so quick, these bad habits are hard to quit

Bad habits, bad habits
Picked a few up nine years in this game
Bad habits, bad habits
Lifestyle's fast driving me insane
Bad habits, bad habits
Daily doses just gotta maintain
Bad habits, bad habits
Drinkin' beer, smokin' weed and a pack a day

Stop fishin', addiction's kinda strange to me
Gotta quit, gotta kick for my family
Cause if I crash fast everybody's outey
And that's way too heavy pressing on me
It's the D-double-dash, I bash like an army
And when it's time to mash, I crash real strongly
I always flip a pill with the three roll bent
I accomplish my task, you can't hold me

A pack a day to get me by, an ounce of weed to keep me high
Alcohol still numbs the pain, some things in life just never change
I don't know but I've been told, you live this way, you won't grow old, yeah
Our addiction hits so quick, these bad habits are hard to quit

Your eyes, they won't open, you don't know what you've been smoking
Got your whole family hoping, oh I wish that he'd just slow down
The game is dark, falling silent, where these groups are smokin' soldier
You're smoking just one, toking, now dead in the ground

A pack a day to get me by, an ounce of weed to keep me high
Alcohol still numbs the pain, some things in life just never change
I don't know but I've been told, you live this way, you won't grow old, yeah
Our addiction hits so quick, these bad habits are hard to quit

Bad habits, bad habits</pre>
