[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Y'all is dead weight, less great, always gettin' second place
I tend to race ahead of pace, dippin' while I'm dressed in Bape
Then they chase, catch me if you can, I ain't DiCaprio
This lucid dream will have you go like half a dose of Adderall
Capicola sandwich's are tasty from Primanti's
I'm a 5'7 giant, Brandon Jacobs, Eli Manning
Girls want makeup, get demanding, but they fake like orange tanning
So my girl and I be up like we some college students cramming
For a test that we ain't study for, wonder will she love me more
With money, cause if not, I'm not sure what all this money for
Feelin' like a hundred wars are goin' on currently
Soldiers sent to death on some jets for the currency
Poison, take this mercury, I'll teach you for a learner's fee
How to turn your girlfriend to a circus freak
Cool by the word of Keith, fabric by the hand of Zeus
Actin' like you fuckin' with me, that's some shit I can't excuse
Focus is on manual, control the panoramic view, universe
You got a chance, don't blow it like how a tuba works
I plan to do, somethin' that ain't tangible
Now I'm bout to hand it to
The homie Michael Rock, hear what he sayin' to you

[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
Take a trip, took a molly out a bank a populari
And the word around the city is he sittin in a Ferrari
I told my self I wouldn't get it, I'm sorry
That's my bad, I party till my cardies get foggy
Can't keep her hands off of me, got her locked, and lost the key
We smoke, make it hard to see, we go harder then Carter one
Excuse me baby pardon me, can you fuck me like the honeymoon?
Not saying its coming soon, but I want the real show
Give me the treatment that you getting all them heels for
The shit they payin all the bills for
Man I missed it, that cake taste delicious
They can't wait for vacations, paid for by pictures
I'm feeling good, I'm pulling bills I'm real as hell
I don't front I roll blunts and papers
Don't fuck with fakers
Your girl is asking me if I'mma take her
I'm straight though
You see I'm booked up til April
That's mine, thats me, I take those
You try to see some peso's than shake though
You get exactly what you paid for, stop acting like you can't go
Swagging til the ankles
I feel you baby
Hopefully I look familiar, lately

Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
It seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it because

[Mac Miller]
Life a cliche, it ain't a bad one
First the plane land and then the bags come
We walking on this planet seeking action
Breaking girls hearts, sorry Miss Jackson

Falling down the same rabbit hole looking for love
But you'll never ever get it because
Seem like it'll only happen when I'm holding the drugs
You can never ever see it

And it won't stop til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top
I said it won't stop til the aliens fight the robots
And all the ladies take their clothes off
I'm here with Mikey and we gonna Rock
This some shit you won't top

I'm so high what you think about that babe
On some other shit, tell 'em baby act crazy
Fifteen thousand, blow it on clothes
Six in the morning still sitting here throwed
I'm buggin' out, buggin' out, I wonder if they know
Pull up to the house, and I wonder if she know</pre>
