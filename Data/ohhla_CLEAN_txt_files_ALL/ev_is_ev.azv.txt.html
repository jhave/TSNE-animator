{intro}
(Nas)
Untouchable, Ill Will y'all
(AZ)
Life
(JOE)
Your dealin' with veterans now
(Nas)
AZ y'all, c'mon c'mon c'mon
(AZ)
We tryin' to win y'all
(JOE)
Now Nas, AZ and J-O-E

[AZ]
I'm back, no Belve, just bottles of Don
With the same wordplay that supplied the Qu'ran
Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand my ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stackin' nigga started actin' fool
Used to be the loud type love to flash the jewels
Hit something nice then broadcast the news
Bags of weed, used to slow drag the weed
Did it all in the hood, had to leave
Asthmatic, guess I had to breathe
Short nigga what up, short to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Returnin' like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor
Money, hoes and clothes, don't let them whores get cha
They not fair

(Joe: [chorus] 2X)
That's how we bump, that's how we bang
Shorty now we all up on them thangs
Play your part, play the game
And everything is everything

[Nas]
My words are my life and my life come with laws
You my brother keeper mean I'd give my life for yours
It's death before dishonor, the rules we would practice
Never play with love, love is evil spelled backwards
'Member the real shit, friend I would build with
Before the Benzs, three quarter trenches it was all friendship
This shit's odd to me, let no one abuse it
Everything's everything niggaz I love music
When Donny Hathaway sing I close my eyes slowly
Body get weak, as if I could feel my soul heat
These dudes get jealous, rappers got a lot of change
Can't solidify their own position 'til I'm out of the game
But fuck'em, cause yo "A" this was needed
Cause when we stopped our flow the fake one's succeeded
And "D" this the game bab' bro, nuttin' change, they know
Play Illmatic then listen to them, same flow

(Joe: [chorus] 2X)

(Joe: [bridge])
Bag up your work, hit the block and pitch
Don't stop 'til you rich, bust shots never snitch
Stick to the script, tuck in your chain
And everything is everything

[AZ]
Truth is real, believe I take loot for real
It's the desperation in the dap, boost the wheel
Trucks and 20's, relax when them cups is in me
You can catch me at Justin's or up in Jimmy's
Jeckyl and Hyde, the real never wrestle with pride
If you live, that's the only way I let you inside
Love it or not, thrive off the love of the block
See me solo in a photo, hands huggin' my cock
Frank furvase, a white cotton tank with shades
Taper fade, got a face that just ain't for braids
Been in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six
Multi-complex, go before the end of the flick
It's just me, besides I'm just a G
With the O in the front, I know what you want
Believe I'm sucka-free this one

(Joe)
That's how we ball, that's how we bang
Everybody do your thang
[Chorus] 2X
