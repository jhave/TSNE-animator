Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
See they think I'm a fuck nigga
But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga
Like what, nigga? Before your ass can answer, get your whole shit bust, nigga
Them rolls off them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire when I'm trynna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my mommas plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this grief
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor
Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with the tounges for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy

[Chorus: Danny Brown]
The return of the gangsta cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got deals
This rap shit don't work then it's back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
Return of the gangster fucked that hipster squeeze the trigger
You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ash tray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Dropped it in the chronic finna lock it that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And them motor minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get real as shit that's on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga
Dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up</pre>
