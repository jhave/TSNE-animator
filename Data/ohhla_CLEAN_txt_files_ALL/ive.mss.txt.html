[Missy - singing]
I know some of y'all sick of songs y'all be hearin on the radio-

It's like drinkin liquor or weed or X whatever does you the best
My beats, are so (sooooo) addic-hictive

[Missy] See if you're ridin down the street
and you're bout to roll that shit up
[Tweet] You don't need drugs or weed
[Missy] Oh nah you ain't smokin that stank shit up in my car
Get your feet off my dashboard
[Tweet] C'mon get krunk with me
[Missy] Oh yeah you wanna get krunk though?
