[Chorus: Tyrese]
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
Every time I try to go, something keeps telling me that (me that)
Everything gon be all right
Every time I try to leave something keeps pulling me back (me back)
Telling me I need you in my life
It was meant to be, you were meant for me
So that means we gotta make it work

[Verse 1: Chingy]
It was all good at first, spendin' money, goin' shoppin'
Eatin' at the finest restaurants, and if I'm club hoppin'
She was right thur wit me bottle poppin' livin' that life (livin' that life)
She just didn't understand my lifestyle and that ain't life (and that ain't life)
All of the jewelry in the world, gotcha diamonds, gotcha pearls
But I can't help it if Chinga-ling be attractin' all the girls
Guess what, baby I'ma superstar, and that come wit it
Gotta good nigga on ya side, you betta run wit it
Even tho I'm on the road doin' shows
I made time for me and her relationship to grow (grow)
They tell me don't trust the woman in this industry
But, she not any woman, more like a sacred friend to me
Cuz when I'm outta town always think of huurr
Might conversate wit some chicks but, no one come above huurr, oh
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like "damn"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Walked in the house wit hard work, my head hurt
Instead of arguin' can I have dinner wit some dessert? Uhh-uhh
She talkin' bout this phone number she found
Ain't gimme time to put my bags down, she straight up clownin' (straight up clownin')
Before we end up fightin' lemme me leave
I'm exhausted, and this herree, I don't need (I don't need)
Now I'm wit the fellaz, ridin' and drinkin' (ridin' and drinkin')
She blowin' my two-way up, but I need some time for thinkin' (time for thinkin') yeah
I wanna go back, but sumthin' sayin' naw (naw)
Lemme give her some space, and the next day I might call (call)
What should I do, look, lemme ask ya'll
Should I stand tall, or let this relationship fall? (fall)
I never havin' my feelings crushed, but it happens sometimes
Either love it or give it up
I thought I was ya man, guess you ain't understand
And now I'm sittin' here lookin' crazy like "damn"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Chingy]
(Chingy, holla at em again)
To all the fellaz, know you feel me, you ever had a woman,
Good times let the bad times, and you ain't see it comin'
Tried the best to make her happy (happy), but it wasn't enough (it wasn't enough)
Cuz mama told me in relationships the road get rough (road get rough)
And I ain't the one to have my head down, weeping, stressed out
As bad as it hurts I gotta move to the next route (route), yes
I thought I was a man, guess she ain't understand
And now she sittin' thurr, lookin' crazy like "damn"
