And if you feelin' how I'm feelin' get your hands up
And if you're sittin' on your ass you need to stand up
Cause this ain't no time for you to fake the funk
Because DJ Kool got what you want
And the dollars to rock is what I got

Cause I rock that hip hop
Never go pop cause if I do I might flop
So I just don't go there
Can't go there
And if you understand then throw your hands in the air, ha
This rhythm is the beat
DJ Kool commin' straight from south east
With the funky new flow taht you hear when you rockin' on your radio
Get up, stand up, let me know, if you with me go
And if you are and you're with me out there say Oh yea
