Ladies and gentlemen (ladies and gentlemen)
It's about that time again (okay)
You know what I'm sayin' (it's about that time)
Check this out, aha
We got Eve in the building (we got Eve)
That's right, we got Eve, E-V-E

Uh, uh
Now I ain't never been the type ta
Not excite ya
Can't miss the vixen that meant you like her
Play a position just might invite ya
Party till the morning if she like ya
I ain't attracted to no lame dudes
Don't wanna name a few
Don't lie either do don't ask she might be naming you
When I'm allergic to these corny bitches
Tryna start shit to end my freeze unto upon my riches
Game been a part of me dog and I'm a keep winnin'
Never should have started me off I love the way I'm livin'
And they wonder why she won't stop
Sit around mumblin' to myself hoping that my shit flop
Yeah that's the shit I like to laugh at
Obsessed with my every move dummy find a crash test
Every year I'm just a little wiser
Ah yeah it's still going, left in the race
???

Yo she got em like E
Everyday eating and taking it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keeping it moving
It's double R flowing hard
This is Eve-olution now scream E
If you really ready we taking it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me

I'm a hustle till I'm stacked up
Lot more to do when it's cool then I'm a pack up
Pass the torch along to someone else
But right now hold me down, little selfish thinkin' of myself
Took a long time to make it here
Before I make a move a make a plan just so I can be prepared
Ain't no turning back it's heavy now, fuck the petty shit
Bigger better shit and I'm ready now

Yo she got em like E
Everyday eating and taking it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keeping it moving
It's double R flowing hard
This is Eve-olution now scream E
If you really ready we taking it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me

Uh, yo, okay she talk a lot of shit
Cocky got plenty lip
Promise myself that I never live pennyless
Took a couple trips
Hopped in and out of plenty whips
Stacked up the game now she reading plenty scripts
Yeah I'm accustomed to the good life
But don't get it fucked up I owe it all to the hood life
Congratulate her when you see her past
It's a shame how these shits get agitated when we cross past
But we ain't even on the same level
I'm thinking bout a sexy eye baby girl you still nice embezzled
Smelt right, had to have it
Third joint still going strong I'm not bragging
I guess I am a little bit though making it happen
Who'd have thought I'd be famous one day making it rapping
Philly, she done lost her mind
Another hit, dog, the last line

Yo she got em like E
Everyday eating and taking it to the V
Vixen V-12 with systems, E
Everybody keeping it moving
It's double R flowing hard
This is Eve-olution now scream E
If you really ready we taking it to the V
Vicious spit flows ridiculous, E
Say it like you know the letters
Bombshell when the clothes a fetish
Just scream my name for me

E-V-E
E-V-E
Scream her name for me</pre>
