[Shaggy 2 Dope]
LET ME IN THIS BITCH!
LET ME GET SOME CHANGE THEN!
MAN FUCK THIS DRESS CODE, BITCH!
I CAN DANCE MOTHERFUCKER!
I CAN DANCE!

[Violent J]
I'm on crack, walkin' alleyways downtown
People drop change so I'm checkin the ground
Behind the nightclub, I can hear the bump outside
I hear em laughin' and drinkin' and dancin', gettin' live
And I'm lonely, graspin' on my 55 cent
I don't know where my meds went, they been spent
And I'm bent, I don't remember yesterday at all
I'm barkin' at the moon as I'm pissin' on the wall
People grippin' new cars, checkin' out a few bars
They see me comin', side step a few yards
I'm like a bad man, holdin' out my crusty ass hand
Scoldin' an imaginary friend
I'm scary and I'm blackin out, just about to lose all hope
I was peerin' through the window of a nightclub scopin'
And there she was, everything I planned for
On the spotlight on the dance floor, gravitatin'

[Hook]
She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk on but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..

[Violent J]
I ran a few blocks away and broke a bottle
Carjacked a minivan and punched full throttle
Right back to the spot then I waited to get her
But when she came out, she had a bitch boy wit her
No problem, hit the pipe and follow em home
And my imaginary friend gon' have to leave me alone
Cause it's really goin' down, I feel it pullin' me down
Knowin' I'm a wicked clown, I gotta throw it down
She pulled in, her and her fuck ass strolled in
I hit the pipe again and hope out the stolen
Jumpin' through backyards, clumsy and trippin'
It don't matter when your goal is a throat slittin'
And the way she danced lit flames
Burnin' me alive out here, quit playin' games
I'm on the side of her house, lookin' in through the back den
And there she was again wit him, dancin'

[Hook]
She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk on but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..

[Violent J]
I walked right in through the front door unlocked
No gun cocked, cynder block
Clown paint, I came here to dance boogie
Mhm Ahh, and maybe tap a little nookie
I'm creepin', music bumpin' in the back
I'm down the hallway hidin' behind the coat rack
And here come the punk fuck to get champagne
I take the rock and pop him wit the damn thing
Hit him in the back of the head
He dropped the wine, but I caught it in time
I had to take his life wit a steak knife
I washed it and put it back, I'm keepin' the place nice
I'm comin' bitch, you want to olive or somethin'?
I'm fuckin' straight up the streets but I'm down wit some frontin'
I want to tango...but instead
I'm still outside the club and it's all in my head

[Hook]
She kept her rhythm, her feet to the floor
She dipped down, she did the twirl and she shook it some more
She's groovy..
She made me happy, I tried to refrain
I walk home but then I run right back, I'm at it again
She's callin'..</pre>
