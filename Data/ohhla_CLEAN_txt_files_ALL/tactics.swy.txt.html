[Rock]
Yo, that's the man Rock
So if you can stand what I be doin
Yo who you think you're foolin, you'll be *shittin* when I be screwin
Your crew's doo-doo and you seem to think that I be jokin
Buckshot Got Me Opin as you get your body broken
Foldin, hoes get, dropped like dominos an'
Fear of my Boot Camp'll have you runnin like a nose, man
I sniff, I smell *pussy* on the set
But he better jet cuz I like my *nigga's pussy* wet
BOO-YAH, do ya, brain your wigs pushed back
Black I swing bats and break backs over crackerjacks
I'm JUST LIKE THAT
(Damn, type cold, but all they really need is rep)
Word to miz Mr. Flipsta flips wit some bigger *shit*
Wit an extra clip, longer than my kneecap to my hip
Now you plead the Fifth
Used to riff, guess I should've known you was bluffin
You better guard your melon kid 'fore Ra throw a slug in

[Ruck]
My culture, colt ya, sculpture, vultures
Who in-sult the lyrics that Big Ruck wrote ya
*Bitch-ass niggas* don't wanna test the skills
Word is bond god I think you best to chill
See I splash flesh, money like crash test dummies
And cash checks bluntly when radios pump me
Due to circumstances in my lyrical advances
Another man die, why, cuz of my verbal enhancements
Transmit, lyrics over bass and your treble
Then I'm vexed cuz the devil can't take me to that next level
If push came to shove, I push drugs
Shove slugs in *niggas* mugs who show the Ruck no love

[Crooked Eye/Tech N9NE]
You probably heard me on The Anthem
Throwin a tantrum, now the phantom's
Kidnappin platinum rappers for ransom, murder em at random
Hand em they cranium on a platter
Then scatter, splatter your bladder
Niggas got to add up the data, they scatter
When I brings the whoo-ra, I'm in this game to stay
You couldn't put me out if your name was neutron
My receital's prime to climb, homicidal rhymes unwind
My rival's minds and time, they vital signs decline
Your title's mine, resign, leave you blind
Cuz every line's designed to shine
And I'm, all about the lyrical skills advancing
Tech drops the beat, I starts the verbally break-dancin
Cuz first I do my foot-work then I break it down to my knees
And now I'm spinnin around on my back, ?when melon? ?
Better stop and freeze, please
You MC's ain't never wanna bout
You need to make like a cecerious-section and cut it out
I'm pure devotion, dosin
The psychological field have chosen, to analyze my notions
But most men, catch emotion, sickness cuz my intelligence quotient
Goes deep as the Mediterranean o-cean
Me and Sway in the concrete jungle bringin comotion
Our blood might be boilin but our attitude is frozen
See me pass up a chance to rip shop, naw
That'll be worse than Kool Herc sayin "Fuck hip-hop ya'll"
That'll never happen
I'll be bustin even after half the major labels start
Financially backin this rappin
Rhymin's my first love, she's been wit me from the start
I exchange vowels wit my styles, now it's till death do us part

[Planet Asia]
Slang exhaust dust, I lace tracks quick
In tournaments, I can't fit the throne that I sit upon, is permanent
Splashin Lugers wit my Chaka Zulu
Observe the numero uno schoolyard assassin
That's fastin to sock it to you
Fuck a team my theme's state of the art
Jumped up and cross seas, sellin em dubs over a pub by the quarts
Now how that sound, Fresno, Cali's even on the map now
Tech holdin down the back ground
We flip chips for rings and championships
Desperado wit the convo, guerilla congo
Killin ? black wit his eyes on troop
(Now listen here) Before I disappear in a flash
Me without pizzazz like a warrior wit a spear up his ass
&gt;From '99 down to the last second
A devastation, findin out like it's the last record
A revelation, it's on a suitcase full of magnificent poems
And testaments, most cats is pestilence in terrestrial form
I'm out there, and I doubt there is any comp
Against the relentless, rap assassin holdin it down in the swamps
My gun claps acts, these raps run laps around irregular run waves
Whatever the cirumstance to uplift, I shoots the gift
It's futuristic, how my patterns they switch
And how the wacker gets rich, I assume while they're down bitin and shit
Planet Asia takes up, three pages for one verse to make up
Twenty-four bars of rage shakin Bay Area earthquakes up
It's like that, lettin loose juice wit forty-duece
First class proof, product and that's the platinum truth
Schoolyard to the fullest, that's the platinum truth
Cali Agent to the fullest, that's the platinum truth</pre>
