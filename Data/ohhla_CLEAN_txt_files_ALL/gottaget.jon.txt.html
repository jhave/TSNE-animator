[Lil' Jon]
There's something I wan't to tell you 
cause I know that a brother got needs tonight 
I ain't trippin on yo pimpin cause that shits tight 
but you gotta pay tonight 
I know you wanna get laid tonight 
but I'm trynna get paid tonight 
we ain't even gotta fuss and fight 
just give me mine 
It's on all night 
I know you wanna get in bed with me 
but you gotta come correctly 
nothin in life is free 
especially not me 
I hope you 
can feel me 
when I say 
pay before you play with me 
wanna taste this 
but its priceless 
it might be sumthin you ain't never done before 
but I'm not yo ordinary hoe 
(repeat lines wit stars once) 

[Chorus]
I said I'm off in the club (shawty) 
not lookin fo love(shawty) 
but I'm lookin fo a gurl(shawty) 
one I can cut(shawty) 
like lil' mommma in the blue(shawty) 
she so got-damn cute(shawty) 
but she say she need cheese(shawty) 
before she get wit me(shawty) 
well let me see(shawty) 
what it might be(shawty) 
and whats yo fee(shawty) 
for my fantasy(shawty) 
now I ain't rich(shawty) 
but I spend a lil' bit(shawty) 
so who you wit(shawty) 
lets do this shit(shawty)

I know you wanna get laid tonight 
but I'm tryna get paid tonight 
we ain't even gotta fuss and fight 
just give me mine 
It's on all night 
I know you wanna get in bed with me 
but you gotta come correctly 
nothin in life is free 
especially not me 
I will get with you 
if you wan't me too 
and i'll be by your side 
if the price is right 
take care of me and i'll take care of you 
nothin in life is free 
especially not me 
I gotta get paid 
if you wan't me 
come correctly 
might be sumthin you ain't never done before 
I'm not yo ordinary hoe</pre>
