[Melle Mel]
Hypocrites and Uncle Toms are talkin trash
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Liberty and justice are a thing of the past
(Let's talk about Jesse)
They want a stronger nation at any cost
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Even if it means that everything will soon be lost
(Let's talk about Jesse)

[Sylvia Robinson, Ronald Isley, et al]
He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't never stop
Brothers stand together and let the whole world see
Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history

So vote

Everybody get up and vote	(4x)

See Ronald Reagan speakin on TV
Smilin like everything's fine and dandy
Sounded real good when he tried to give a pep talk
To over 30 million poor people like me
How can he say that we gotta stick it out
When his belly is full and his future is sunny
I don't need his jive advice
But I sure do need his jive time money

[Melle Mel]
The dream is a nightmare in disguise
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Red tape and lies fill your for spacious skies
(Let's talk about Jesse)
But don't think that D.C. just did it first
(Let's talk about Jesse)
There's a lotta D.C.'s all over this universe
(His name is Jesse)

[Sylvia Robinson, Ronald Isley, et al]

Land of the free and the home of the brave
But it might as well be the home of the slaves
They got me walkin around singin 'freedom's come'
But my body is free and my mind is dumb
The people ain't black but the house is white
And just because I'm different they don't treat me right
They done cast me aside, held me down
Dragged my name down to the ground
Oh beautiful for spacious skies
And your amber ways of untold lies
Look at all the politicians tryin to do a job
But they can't help but look like the mob
Get up and get back, put it away
Watch the F.B.I. watch the C.I.A.
They want a bigger missile and a faster jet
But yet they forget to ?hidin? the vet

[Melle Mel]
Hypocrites just talkin trash
(Let's talk about Jesse)

Even if it means that everything will soon be lost
(His name is Jesse)

Now break down

The 30th day, that's in December
Is a day that everybody's gonna remember
Cause on that day a righteous man
Thought about takin a brand-new stand
The name of the man is Jesse Jackson
And his call for peace was loud as action
Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

[Sylvia Robinson, Ronald Isley, et al]
He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't ever stop
Brothers stand together and let the whole world see
Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history

So vote
