Typed by: AZ Lyrics

On the beach in Hawaii

I wish you were here with me, walking on the beach in Hawaii
playing on the golden sand, looking at the ocean now I understand
love is like the open sea, and I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii

Since you've been gone away, I think about you everyday
don't you know I miss you much, and you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff, oh I wish you were hear with me
on the beach in Hawaii

A little pakalolo, and I say mahalo
ujjayi breathing, to get a real feeling
yogi gonna let you know
that I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
in Hawaii</pre>
