Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
The number one spot, bitch I'm right here
I'm a stay on top, bitch I'm right here
All my real niggas, bitch we right here
Only the family in my eyes, and bitch we right here
We right here, we right here
Only the family in my eyes, and bitch I'm right here
I'm right here, I'm right here
All the haters getting mad cause I'm right here
I'm right here, I'm right here
Only the family in my eyes, and bitch I'm right here
I'm right here, I'm right here
A lot of niggas mad cause I'm right here

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm right here feeling like an all star
Told her keep her body, I want all top
Bitch we down at Gucci, we don't mall shop
Pair of Gucci goggles got me on top
Call my bro up, go wassup godz
He told me in a minute we on WorldStar
You know Lil Durk got hella fans
Fuck a local nigga I'm a real star
Pull up in the S550
Jump out cocaine white looking cripsy
This is for the niggas tryna diss me
I'm right here in the spot, you can't miss me, L's

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Only the family in my eyes, and I'm a be real
I'm right here in the light, with no deal
Bitch I'm rolling money, like I'm off a pill
I'm just tryna eat, and see 100 mill
The streets calling my name, I'm like wassup [?]
Dreads hanging, got me like a rasta
Ain't no way of living from this choppa
From this choppa, from this, from this choppa
Don't hold me back I'm a unleash
Streets in My ear like you a Beast
OTF, bitch we in the streets
Better than these niggas in the industry

[Chorus]</pre>
