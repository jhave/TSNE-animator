Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
If the world hurt you and I knew that I was God
I would take it all away from you
Take it all away from you
Turn away from
Turn away from

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
What do you see when you see me
I see that you want to be free
And I feel your pain
Know what you think before you tell me about to go insane
With out your music
And you can't make it through the day then
Crying a river for your love that's passed away
No body told us that good days was promised to us
No body that could tell you it's gonna be okay well

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
I, well I
I hope today's the day that I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars
Turn away from from your scars
Now I, now I
I pray today's the day
That I can find something to say to make ya
Turn away from from all your scars
Turn away from from your scars

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Life ain't no easy party but we gotta do it because it's required
And it cuts like a knife and I gotta get the beast outta my life
And it sets when your suffering standerly buffering
I think I can, I think I can
Think I can make it if I had you there to hold my hand
And you saved me
Been down but you raised me
I think that you feel what I feel Kali Baby
But I'm just saying

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Tied in on you for ever
I know you feel my pain
So we crazy together

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I'm a daily endeavor no body fade me and clever
But the wavy see slegna we bled for a plethora of
People in many places healing so many faces
The gape in my soul put a lot of my pain into plenty cases
So they seeking my flows
All of them waiting to play
Cause in that moment the pains taken away
Making the day straight having Satan delay wait
Never wanna hate wraith in a way
I get people through I've been told
They won't seek a new I've been chose
I don't preach I just dive in souls
Way down deep I sift highs and lows
I bring peace when I spit live in shows
I see grief when I ripped I them walls
When I sing heat when inside them groves
Rotting beasts for them N9ne explodes
Wish I could take it all together for ever
The pain I see in your eye, that's right
To break it up and sever for the better
And will till I die, die, die

[Chorus]

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yo if I said it I meant it
I get all ya'll messages man
Telling me how the music helps you get through your day, through your life, through your losses
That's what it's meant for that's what I'm meant for
I wish there was something I could say to take away all your mental scars
Kali Baby
I Love You</pre>
