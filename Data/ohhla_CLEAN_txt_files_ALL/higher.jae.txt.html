[Intro]
My comeback
Millzie I got you
Al-Doe
I don't know what the word pressure mean
BBN

[Verse 1]
Winter coming, we bring them furs out
Sky trip in the Aspen, we smoking girl scout
No service, money's my whole purpose
They talk to you, run down on em like why you nervous
They rap about guns homey, I'm rappin with the gun on me
Ask them niggaz in Atlanta how we movin
You know the price, black Rubicon Rover white
Double box vacuum seal
We send the move at night
Ah, who your favorite again, who?
I'm probly on his playlist, raw cones I'm faded
We break Nobel, make fully regular
Spice market spin up, this way ahead of ya
Just me and my bitch
They seen this one we dippin by
Stumbling the kiss and fly
I really did whatever my pimp say
Rest in peace Vito, esperito Puente
Dog

[Chorus]
And as I take another hit
I wonder if I could get any
And as I take another sip
I wonder if I could drift any
And as she takes another sniff
She prolly feel like she'll never get any

Kush got bitch
Ride

[Verse 2]
Straight out the trenches
Use to play the Benjies, the OGs showed interest
Real nigga Pedigree, not a blemish
Law of attraction rob off on anybody I link with
Uh, I'm blessed to be distinguished
Before you get that guy to think rich
Most these niggaz on some think shit
It's my duty to get it
I'm truly the freshest, sliding hoes out of beauty in Essex
Why you stressin?
Block nigga, call him Tetris
Never left the hood, tryna tell me what success is
And just like the game appears
Everything you had lined up, you watch it disappear
And there go the pressure, creepin on yo ass
You call yourself tryna build but life is moving fast
And now you stackin as a nigga using dope
Sleep standing up but you really wide awoke

[Chorus]
And as I take another hit
I wonder if I could get any
And as I take another sip
I wonder if I could drift any
And as she takes another sniff
She prolly feel like she'll never get any

Yo yo
Smoke something bitch
Uptown

[Verse 3]
All praises due to the father
You lil niggaz service is fucked, step your bars up
Foreign boy, I'm too fly for a charging
Rubber band and Benjamins, rolling jelly jars up
Hard luck is all we had
Now it's lobster like we garliced up
Vegetable rice butter with partial cups
Halfway full cause we halfway gone
Repentin all of our sins cause for all we was wrong
But never regrettin shit, we sayin none of these songs
Short patience for sucka shit so I roll mine long
It's a work out to finish my blunts, I smoke that strong
And I love a Spanish girl that love her throat to be warm
McCall poke her over the block
I just supply the guap and let my nigga run the spot
I clean cut with visions and being filthy
To my daughter I'm daddy, to these rappers I'm father Millzie
Amen

[Chorus]
And as I take another hit
I wonder if I could get any
And as I take another sip
I wonder if I could drift any
And as she takes another sniff
She prolly feel like she'll never get any</pre>
