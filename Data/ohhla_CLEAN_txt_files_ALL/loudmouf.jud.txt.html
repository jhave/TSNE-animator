Loud mouf cats, and wylded-out cats
They talk about this, and they rap about that
They ain't sayin' JACK, they tongues need SMACKED
Gifted but they wack, spittin' garbage over tracks

They talk about this, and they rap about that
They ain't sayin' JACK, they tongues need SMACKED
Gifted but they wack, spittin' garbage over tracks

Yo I'm talkin' to you cats, like that +Bone+ to +crush+

Yo, a lot of y'all cats ain't diggin' my flooow
Don't stop, pretty soon you'll see the gold in my flooow
And if you can't really see, then you gotta be BLIND

Gotta whole lotta reasons just to doubt you dudes
