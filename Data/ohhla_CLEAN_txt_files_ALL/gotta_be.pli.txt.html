[Intro]
I know it's somebody somewhere homey (know it gotta be somebody)
That today they celebration (know it GOTTA be somebody)
I might not know ya
But I wanna celebrate wit'cha

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Gotta be somebody the police chasin that done got away
Gotta be somebody 'round the world today that'll beat they case
Gotta be somebody 'round the world got off probation today
Gotta be somebody 'round the world walkin out them prison gates

[Plies]
I'm happy for that nigga today, that done came home
And got that time behind 'em, now it's time to move on
I'm celebratin wit'cha, the reason I wrote this song
Hope you done became a better person since you been gone
I salute you my nigga dog for stayin strong
Now get'cha feet up under ya homey keep it goin
I hope ya walk straight, don't make the wrong turn
Them crackers waitin to send you off on another long run
Just enjoy yourself tonight and have fun
And don't go fuckin wit them niggaz who ain't send ya nuttin
And if ya got kids, go on get 'em and catch up
I'm celebratin with you tonight, I'm holdin my cup up

[Chorus]

[Plies]
He took them crackers to the do' and he beat 'em in trial
A lot of niggaz thought you was gon' lose but you held it down
All I can tell you homey you made all the real niggaz proud
They offered you a plea bargain but you turned it down
Stood in the paint what you believed in you did it in style
I know your family they was worried but now they can smile
Should be happy cause ain't too many of us beat 'em in a while
Just be careful in these streets cause this shit done got wild
A lot of niggaz fucked up, so they playin it foul
He was your homeboy, he your co-defendant now
If you gon' get money, get it but lose the crowd
Niggas in prison cause they homeboys ran they mouth

[Chorus]

[Plies]
To that young nigga who took 'em on a high speed chase
Ain't condonin what'cha did, I'm just glad ya got away
I know ya heart beatin fast, I'm just glad you're safe
Shit you had to hit it, you couldn't afford another case
You tried to play cool, but you shoulda seen your face
'git a motherfucker, lost 'em in broad day
Doin' a-hundred, dawg, goin down a one-way
Jumped out on 'em, turned into a foot race
'git know the streets, so they couldn't keep they pace
He had to throw his pistol, if they find it that's okay
You ain't gotta do it, but for you I'ma celebrate
Do me a favor dog, stay out them cracker face

[Chorus]</pre>
