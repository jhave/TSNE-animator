[INTRO]
Ayo put some sparklers on that Ciroc
And make it look like the 4th of July in this motherfucker
Yeah

[VERSE 1: Fred the Godson]
-Now Diddy told me that it's all about the B-B-B-B-Benjamins
So hustle hard and any hustle you hustlin'
From the deck of cards, life's a gamble and you shufflin'
I'm from that corner that hood you throw that d-d-duffle in
This shawty's strippin
I got that money, I'm tippin'
To that artist going the hardest, in the studio spittin'
Back the whip in
I took the trip until the chips started flippin'
In the kitchen, plastic on the bread grippin'
This stripper's clickin'
I'm fixin'
With baker's mittens
The same colors Wade Griffin
The money I make is different, I'm cakin'
You got to listen
See my name Fred the Godson, pappi call me gordo
Meek Mill, Corey Gunz, the remix and you all know

[HOOK]
I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' money over here
(Said) I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' money over here
(Well) I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' money over here
(Said) I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' money over here
Daddy you cakin'
Daddy you cakin'
Daddy you cakin'
We gettin' money over here
Daddy you cakin'
Daddy you cakin'
Daddy you cakin'
We gettin' money over here

[VERSE 2: Meek Mill]
Lately I've been saving for a rainy day
But still that imperfection make it rain away
Looking at my wrist, it cost me 8K
I get them niggers in the jewelers doing layaways
Trying to keep up
Hate I got my seat up
Backseat of that six deuce
Counting paper, we up
Charlie Sheen I'm winnin'
Holding on and I'm spinnin'
Your paper feel like linen
My money ain't no limit
I said shout my nigga P out (P)
We got white and D out (D)
100 pounds of rags and bush, put it in the tree house
Blow sauce and white hoes, MIA the beach house
I call my niggers first class, I hit the block like we out
You ever sipped Ciroc with Diddy?
Then count the millions in a tailor over top the city? (woosh)
I got the gods with me
I tell them hoes tat my name on the top of they titty

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3: Cory Gunz]
14 I was kicking Diddy's rhymes wow
It's funny then he told me this would be my time now
Ain't nobody body flow like me buy a vowel
Set the tempo, then find a style
Rappin' (fast)
You don't want to get slap it around
Back woods, back down
Cause I'm like a mad cow
No bullshit, I meant this gadget
I rap loud
With a neck count with this actin'
I stack more in the game trailin' with a set
Your money too funny
Youre a clown with a fraction
Back is the main childhood attraction
Lane, any swag outlaggin'
So fly, pulls to the main cabbins
Skip Ron tip goes through the game braggin'
Young money cash money in your face laughin'
Put em up, fuck your tab
I bought that bar because you bought that ass
Girl let your juices flow, later I'll make all that splash

[HOOK]

[OUTRO]
Yea, move something now
Move something
Yea, like that, yea
