(*talking*)
Its your boy Mun-E
The way we like it, cause 
That's the way we like it, like it 
That's the way we like it
Choppers and Blaze is how we riding

[Hook 1]
Piece and chain, gon gliss and gleam
Cause that's the way we like it
Staying playa made, choppers
And Blaze is how we riding 
Rocking shows, from coast to coast
Cause that's all a balla knows, down on that South coast

[Mun-E]
Here down South, we got it on lock
Everything from rocks and knocks, and glocks that pop
Foes that plot, the ones that bop the blaze that chop what
As I bend the block, still shining
Paint job looking redder than a red bus
Sitting on that leather reclining
Blowing big killa big timing, all about my dollas 
And my diamonds, game out of sight so I'm blinding
Phat cash comes, it goes when I hit the block
I stun these foes, from living cold, too fancy clothes
Polo my vibe though, rolling in my candy coated Tahoe
Wood on my do', wood on my console, grip the mo-mo
Rock another contest, then the whole show
Making money pronto, professional, entrepreneur
Flows that come through like a kick do'
Seen a lot of money, but I gotta get mo'
Loot in the Latto, taking trips to Bahamas
Key Lago, pushing up on buttons on my notes
Up in the mix, accumulating chips, hatas get pissed
As you see the diamonds sit, on my piece and necklace
So people check this, huh

[Hook 2]
Piece and chain, gon gliss and glaim
Cause that's the way we like it, staying playa made
Choppers and Blaze, is how we riding, pimping hoes
And fancy clothes, cause that's all a balla knows
Down on that South coast
Piece and chain, gon gliss and glaim
Cause that's the way we like it, staying hustla made
Choppers and Blaze, is how we riding, blowing smoke
And rolling vogues, cause that's all a balla knows
Down on that South coast

[Slim Thug]
I'm piece and chain, I'm pinky ring
I'm gripping grain, I swang and bang
From lane to lane, like it ain't no thang
Might yell up at the bar, cause it ain't a train
Game of fame, I'm wrecking beats
Smoking sweets, and checking freaks
A Boss Hogg soldier, who can't be weak
Everything I speak, will make you move your feet
Bounce and turn, as the dolla back burn
Sit back and learn, how the cash get earned
Wrecking the mic, is my concern
And getting the cash back, in return
I peep the game, and I see the laim
Boys trying to gain fame, off my name
Talking bout, what the Slim Thug is where they hang
And everything I claim, is what you claim
Get up off your brain, thinking you my friend
Cause I'm a hundred percent, all about my ends
Flipping in the boss, or the cockeyed Benz
That's all I'm in, cause that's all I spend
Platinum grill, so I spark a lot
I shine, so I don't see dark a lot
You don't see, them double R cars a lot
Well come follow me out, to the parking lot, haa

[Hook 2]

[Mun-E]
Big body, mobile phone flipper
Sip liquor sipper, mo-mo wood grain gripper
Got a maid that's a stripper, living lavage
Twenty four karat, gold zippers
Promo show, ladies be wrecking my dip
I walk with a limp, so I must be hip
Well call me the pimp, gliss and gleam
Bling bling, when they take a glimpse
Money make the world spin, like the twenty inch rims
On a bubble lens, my loot keeps doubling
So the hatas keep mumbling, they got time
For that, turn up my twelves and tens
And I continue to bump the Benz
The block matches, on lock
We investing in stocks, reservations on spot
Vacations on a yacht, as I rise to the top
Of land to hip hop, and it just don't quit
Baguettes on my wrist, ring and necklace
Candy on my Bentley, Benz and Lexus
People love the way, the Mun-E wreck this
Talking bout, that's the way we like it
Talking bout, that's the way we like it

Cause that's the way we like it, like it 
That's the way we like it, like it
That's the way we like it
Choppers and Blaze is how we riding
