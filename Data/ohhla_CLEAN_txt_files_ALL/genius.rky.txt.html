Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Body's so freakin' soft
I can't wait to turn it on
You got me like la la la la la baby
is how you make me feel baby
I can feel your body flowers
while I'm kissing on your thighs
You got me like la la la la baby
Anticipations so crazy

I'll be good to you, promise
While making love to you, promise!
Go to sleep, and when we wake up
I'ma hit that thing again, promise!
Signs and miracles up in this room
while I'm pleasing you

[Chorus]
I'm blessed with the insight to please your body
girl tonight you're lying with a sex genius
Nothing like the ordinary, I'm a love wonder
tonight you're lying with a sex genius

Baby girl, we're both so freakin' hot
we don't wanna freakin' stop!
Got each other like la la la la la baby
Oh, tell me I'm the master baby
Now I got you out them clothes
Your body's so beautiful
The mirror says la la la la la baby
This moment's like heaven baby

And I'll be good to you, promise
While making love to you, promise
Go to sleep and when we wake up
I'ma hit that thing again, promise!
Signs and miracles up in this room
while I'm pleasing you

[Chorus x2]

I know you heard it all before
From I got that thing now
I got that thing now
Don't you believe 'em cause all of them are wanna be's
Tonight I'm bout to prove myself
You won't ever have to ask no more
I'm a college grad. Girl I got my degree
I'm the head of my class
Girl, you meant the real thing
Signs and miracles up in this room
girl I'm pleasing youuuuuuuuuu!

[Chorus x3]</pre>
