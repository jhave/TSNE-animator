[Sample]
"Check out my melody"- Eric B. &amp; Rakim
Intro [Jay-Z]
In the R-O-C
The official remix
Part two
Now you know who she is
Get familiar
Young princess of the Roc
Teairra Mari
I told y'all
We gets busy
Ye!

[Kanye West]
It's Kanyeezy with Teairra-airra-airra-airra
Gucci sweater
Louis leather
You was never
Where groupies ever
Or goofies ever
So it's only right you pull up in the two seater or better
Uh
Teairra Remix
I keep sip sippin' on somethin like Three 6
And keep keep the conflicts out the Jesus 
Pieces
This is no wrong way to rock when you rollin' with the Roc uh
Let's get it poppin' or we go shoppin'
We back on the top 10
We can afford things again
See they too much effort, we too much better
It take 'em two months to do what?! 
We do whatever
Hypno, Cris though, I mean whatever
Saracco Moscato it do taste better
I know what them girls like
I know it ain't easy
I know it ain't every day you will run into Yeezy

[Chorus: Teairra Mari]
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel
That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good
All I wanna know
Is there any boys around
That know how to make a girl feel
That wanna make a girl feel
Make her feel good
I just wanna know

[Verse Two]
Do I have to tell a nigga how to touch me?
Do I have to tell a nigga how to hold me?
Do I have to tell a nigga when to call me?
Do I have to tell a nigga I'm lonely?
Do I have to feel wrong when it ain't strong?
Keep my mouth closed? (Huh huh huh)
Can't a girl from the hood find a homey,
That ain't just tryin' to hang around me?
Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman?
Do I have to apologize for my emotions?
Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me
Every time he wanna get next to me?
Do I have to settle for a cap back K-Swiss stroke his ego?
(Mmh girl no)
Can't a chick from the hood find a homey,
That wanna do more than spend money on me?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Why is it so hard
For a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
Why is it so hard
For a girl like me to find a boy
That really knows how to make a girl feel (girl feel, feel)
I just gotta know

[Chorus]</pre>
