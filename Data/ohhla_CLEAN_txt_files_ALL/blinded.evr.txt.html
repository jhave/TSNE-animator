I met a woman in West Virginia
She said her name was Alabama
She from a little town outside Savannah
Where everybody talk that country grammar
She said she killed a man down in Atlanta
He beat her and he drank till he couldn't stand up
He told her that he loved her but he couldn't stand her
She caught him in his sleep, hit him with a hammger
Then she sold her car and she bought a gun
Johnny Law got her on the run
Another broken bottle and the damage done
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun

Her breathe was sweet, her eyes were pretty
She said her zodiac sign was Cancer
She was on her way to New York City
Trying to get a job there as a dancer
Then she asked if she could ride home with me
Now I'm still thinking on the answer
She pulled on love, she won't take pity
She'll break your heart if you give her the chance to
This time I've got an Uzi and it weights a ton
Johnny Law got her on the run
Another broken bottle and the damage done
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun

Lord have mercy on me for all the things I've done
I lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun
Don't forsake me Lord, I'm not the only one
I lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun
Blinded by the sun

This time I've got an Uzi and it weights a ton
Johnny Law got her on the run
Another broken bottle and the damage done
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun</pre>
