Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I need money, I be money
I see money, I take it
I don't fold with niggas
Who be out there and they fake it
Real niggas around me
Aha, they real niggas around me

A lesson to you niggas
Don't you come 'round talking sideways
I'm the keeper, that shit, we fuck niggerway
Real niggas around me
Aha

My niggas, my niggas
Your niggas ain't shit
Look right, B.M.G., cowboy, run shit
The chopper's on, chopper's on, don't get your ass leaked
Chopper's outside your home, make a nigga [?]
Speed it on, won't they? I ring it where they lay at
When it come to war time, man, I ate ate it
Take pictures with them choppers, man
You ain't gonna spray that
You never seen a plane
You never felt the need to keep that
The shooters ain't real shooters, shoot on
There's no solution
Over hill, we swap them out, I take them out
Then he gon'shoot you
Clearly we is not the same, over there the cliffs ain't
Clear that bitch, emptying that chopper, bang, bang

[Chorus]

Loaded guns around me, real niggas who ready for war
This is cowboy shit, where you know that pessimism from?
I'm the boss of rap synergy
I shoot you off a BMG
Aha, there real niggas around me
They finally found 'bout this street shit
Niggas talking big, lot of scraps, yeah we eating it
I know them niggas here, later they be on the TV, man
All my niggas around me, you know they cutting dirty, till
See my niece, Maria, I shouldn't have take it
In your mind you wonder, what came [?]
100% real nigga in me, what you though about me?
Got the killers with me, Benz with me, no stalking me
I need money, I be money, I see money, I take it
I don't fold with niggas who be out there and they fake it

[Chorus]

BUG the cartell, the streets, we need real niggas
You don't cross the line, nigga, and that is your faith you don't meet
The shooters, they don't scrape at me
You'gon'make the TV, 'less they heard about the rent
They smell shit with UZI
I killer's I ain't checking like they by that
It's my project nigga Jay D
Fuck, why get in your Benz?
If it's murder, nigga, my lawyer get it acquitted
You on death struck, I don't give a fuck. I warm me up
He is ready to die, then, nigga, you're the one done with that
Shoot'em with more mileage, they finally leave you baking
You gonna pay me, shiverring and shaking like Kaine

[Chorus]</pre>
