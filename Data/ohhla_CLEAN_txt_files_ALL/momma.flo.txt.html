Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (off the lot)
And the heels I'ma build you a mansion (a mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (won't stop)

Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (off the lot)
And the heels I'ma build you a mansion (a mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (won't stop)

Yeah, it was all a dream
I ain't even know what platinum means
Still bought that money, when I was 13
Can't wait 'til the day I'm on the TV screen
When I tell my momma sitting next to me
I wanna be a big movie star
No more sugar that we have to borrow
Open up the fridge and it look like horror
Boy, I can't wait to get them million dollars
Make some, bake some
If I gotta find the recipe and whip it til the cake done
Whenever get the rockin' when MJ gone
Whenever be on top, I be the next great one
I reminisce being broke as a kid
Where I down sit, I don't go wish
I gotta make it
Momma when I get big

Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (off the lot)
And the heels I'ma build you a mansion (a mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (won't stop)

Momma, when I get big, I'ma buy you whatever
Benz with some rims off the lot (off the lot)
And the heels I'ma build you a mansion (a mansion)
And the money in your bag won't stop (won't stop)</pre>
