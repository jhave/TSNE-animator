Uh huh..uh huh..
Don't be scared, represent it
Yo county, yo city
Who you know put Chevy's like this
Candy paint and the trunk full of funk like this

Dade County gone ride..

Acorss the world we gone buy em
booty red wit the Louie top
and the rims keep spinnin everytime I stop {*brrrrrr errrrrr*}
Murder one, I'm killin em
got everybody watchin but who gone stop me?
The vert game sowed up
Somebody tryed some mo shit bout some ole shit
T Double done switched the game
Got niggaz slowin down switchin lanes
Chevy boys, we like it fast
So I drop at the low, heavy at the gas
Before you know it, be haulin ass
Bout 145 on the digital dash

Dade County, gone ride..

Where ever you from, represent it
Yo county, yo city
Where ever you from, represent it
Yo county, yo city

Now how you do a Chevy like that?
Had the car 3 years, ain't paint the bitch yet?
Get off ya ass and get paid
If ya ain't bout money you ain't from Dade
See this strictly for the thugs
this the shit that'll get ya fucked up
A lil nigga wit a big ole car and a big ole bank
Shit if it stank we don't dance
And I don't fuck wit the krippy green
I'm strictly stuck on the brown team
So ask dread for the hotbread
if its brown sticky send that shit my way!
Worm, tell Will to send the dust

Don't be scared to represent it
Yo county, yo city.. uh huh uh huh..
Don't be scared to represent it
Yo county, yo city.. uh huh uh huh..

Question - who the boy wit the itty-bitty rims?
Fuck it, I don't care cuz I don't even see em
Dub rida, don't y'all forget it
if they got a problem wit it, tell em I said it!
I got connection wit the candy store
I'm lookin for the wetter look im payin forrrrr!

And it better be the wetter shit they ever seeeeeeeen!
You know I had to put shoes on her

Magic City, donk back to back

Whats a man witout a Chevrolet?
Thats like ridin in a donk

In Dade County, that shit won't get it
Dumb nigga, you gotta put funk in it
Homeboy whats wrong wit cha?
Ridin up to a nigga wit a Power Ranger engine
Now we gone race donk to donk
But if ya lose, you got to ride in the trunk
