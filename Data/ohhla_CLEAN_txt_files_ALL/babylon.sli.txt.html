Song:   Babylon Is Fallin'
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Babylon is falling down
Everybody losing control
People use and abuse this world
And now they just taking a stroll
These times have changed

Time will tell, left in no wealth
You gotta start giving your love
Maybe then you will open your eyes
And end up in heaven above

There is light at the end of the darkness
Why don't you come out and see? yeah
Some are prisoners of this world, Lord
But you were never right to be, these times

Babylon is falling, falling, falling, falling, falling down
Babylon is falling, falling, falling, falling, falling down</pre>
