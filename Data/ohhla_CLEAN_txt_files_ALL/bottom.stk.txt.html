Hey homie where you come from
Who me I come from tha bottom tha bottom tha bottom
Tha bottom by haystak mak million
The trials and trigilations of the lost souls forced to life
On the bottom we do what we got to do
Baby there aint no rules no regulations
There's only playing and hating down here 
What side are you on side are you on side are you on
Coming up I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now I shine watch me glisten remenissin
Didn't listen folks told me id be killed
I was hypnotized by gun smoke power
And big bills cold chills chrome and gold wheels
Driving in a ? in and out of Nashville
Damn it feels good riding leather with the wood
Its in my blood I just don't  give a fuck
Living it up hit the club gleaming
Step on stage the crowd start screaming
Cant slow down no time now 
On to the next town we proudly present haystak mak
Mr. down south shit shining like a iced out silk outfit
Down here we having things
Damn them player haters clocking digits like adding machines and calculators
  
[Chorus]
We done came so far still we got so far to go
Yea we came from the bottom but where are we now 
About a hot step from being world renown we done came so far
Still we got so far to go yea we came from the bottom but where are we now
About a hot step from being world renown
  
I go visit my homeboy he grew a beard his hairs all matted
Up tatted up he act like 30 is 25 added up
Went from having money and girls with beautiful skin
Now he's just another number in the federal Penn
He tell me haystak you know what to boy
God got a plan for you boy we always knew boy
My boy don't let your talent go to waste
There wont be no cds and tapes in this god forsaken place
When you on top they gone hate that ass
You know it don't stop better make that cash
No one lives forever my time here's temporary
And they cant burry memories in no cemetery
When I die look up in the sky
When that cloud shaped like a drop top lac floats by
Haha that will be stak mak look close bopping his head
Weaving between the stars still dodging the feds
  
[Chorus]
We done came so far still we got so far to go
Yea we came from the bottom but where are we now 
About a hot step from being world renown we done came so far
Still we got so far to go yea we came from the bottom
But where are we now huh huh
  
Represent that boy my lyrics stang like rival clicks
That round the corner down south survivor shit
My boy survived three or four gunshots leave the hospital worst than before 
Hollering this means war off his mommas front porch
Id like to propose a toast to getting paid for life
You want it you got to work for it
Day and night that's right that's right you heard me boy
You want to learn to get that money observe me boy 
My people been gone my people doing time
Wrote this with you in mind 
Im a see you shine say a prayer for my players
Living life on the run before its all said and done
Were going to shine like the sun destined for number one
Damn second or third use communications to move the nation
Thru the power of words shining like pearl paint
My people is plenty paid sitting in the shade
Mixing tang ray with minute maid lemonade
  
[Chorus]
And ah we done came so far still we got so far to go
Yea we came from the bottom but where are we now
About a hot step from being world renown
  
Ugh you I aint forgot where I came from 
Touring big city's nation wide I never changed from
Backwards pimping the moon dogs balling
Baby I aint tripping Im just balling where Im calling
You know id like to dedicate this song
To my grandparents for teaching me
Just because we start out on the bottom
We don't have to stay on the bottom nooooooo</pre>
