"It's on" 
"It's on" 
"It's on till the death" 
"It's on till the death till we settle the score" [Inspectah Deck] 2x 

[Planet Asia] 
Ceremonial Master, crackin at your function 
I bless tracks lovely off a fresh pack of Dutches 
I'm cruddy to the floor, catch me runnin with the grimy ones 
Big up to my seventh grade teacher, Mr. Jamison 
Peace to Shirly Roe who made sure I graduated outta high school 
And peace to my peers who never hated 
This is for ya'll, I spit and take raps to new horizons 
Jiggy on some Tip shit, I make the bitches get Vivrant 
Buttnaked in the tell-all X, ain't nuttin sacred 
I write rhymes dolo on the low-low, blowin ??? 
Whether you're thuggin for the cause or on some space shit 
I place photos of grateness to ya, totally wasted 
Khalil collective, revealin now we real selective 
I spill a to perfection is done 
Give a fuck if cats feel myrecords 
This be the chamber, tunnel vision apply 
To the mic, just like science of mind behind numbers 
Note that I came from 
Fresno, California where my game's from 
A place I met Ras before there was a Cali Agents 
We been in the trenches for years, and hittin up stages 
And we, still in the game, still shakin ya'll niggas cages 
Worldwide from armaggedon, trasmittin transcripts 
Plans mission place your bets and watch your man get ripped 
And this is the part where my manuscripts transists 
From state of thought to something self scientific 
Cali Agent Number two, bleedy eye 
Who wanna run with the some of the 
Illest niggas in the mothafuckin Western Conference 
Bring it on and I'ma smash yo shit 
My School Yard click, we got cash to get 

[Chorus] 2x 
This is how it goes, we be killin the flows 
We illin in shows, next year ya'll be stealin the clothes 
Chillin and blow, fresh gear, with the video shown 
And hoe knows I keep the cities on sown 
IT'S ALWAYS ON! 

[Planet Asia] 
Rockin it raw, exactly who I'm rockin this for 
I'm rockin this for, Cali Agents, Potle Block and that's all 
Don't stop and it's more 
We droppin it hot in the store 
In the mall, niggas was plottin and get socked in the jaw 
We be eight deep, fifteen deep, twenty deep 
I also bungee jump beats one deep to keep myself company 
I switch i-deas while you sit and write "Bobby" 
Unaware and about to get slapped lopsided 
As the legacy unfolds, the saga begins 
Another decade of warriors still holdin ON 
To rituals for cats to stil follow the trends 
Of those before us, two thousand next level and now we back again 
Time mind travelin 
Divine rhyme gatherin 
Prime imperial incognito on a Saturday 
I'm like a stimulant for those whoneed a fix 
Appealin when it's time to shine 
And tell my foes to eat a dick! 
I blow spots just like radical groups 
Give a fuck if your crew sucks 
I'm draining all of they battery juice 
To all my niggas livin large, watch me 
Capitilze and invest in property 
While I'm still sellin copies 
For the love of the art, this is where the bubblin starts 
Lord soundwaves supreme, the quiet thunderin dark 
Cold winded type of cat to pull a plug in your part 
Ain't nothin sweet, we leave niggas with slugs in they heart, for real 

Chorus 2x 

"It's on" "It's on" 
"It's on" "It's on till the death" 
"It's on till the death till we settle the score" 
"It's on" 
"It's on til the death till we settle the score" 
"Yeah...that's right" </pre>
