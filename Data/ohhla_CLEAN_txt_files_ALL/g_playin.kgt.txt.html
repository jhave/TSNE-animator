[Pooh]
Hey King Tee since this beat is kinda rockin
I'ma let you rap and get the suckers cold clockin
So yo loc', hear the beat I'm displayin
(Yep) But now - "listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*}

"listen to the guitar playin" {*E. Sermon*}
"One, two, three.."

[King Tee]
Yo, now if you're hip to me, then I guess you heard "Bass"
but I got another instrument to flaunt in your face
It's not a flute or a trumpet, don't beef cause you love it
A funky guitar rhythm that Pooh sampled and cut it
So for those who really know what dope stuff sounds like
If it sounds good, sounds funky, or sounds hype
Put your ear to this and let me know what you think
Yo Pooh, bust the guitar while I grab me a drink

"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*}
"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*}

[King Tee]
Now to many people this tune is like fazin
Get the crowd dancin with the funkiest persuasion
Hypnotizin suckers with some personal-fication
Get the crowd movin (c'mon) motivation
See I'm like a symbol to MC's I'm a father
No wait, I'm a lyricist, better yet a saga
Enough about the King cause you know I get far
I played with the "Bass" now I'm messin with the guitar
And the way that it sounds you say "Shucks!"
It can't be real how the player just plucks
on the strings, it rings yo, it's like the funkiest rhythm
Pooh brings the drums with the sticks to hit 'em
It's not ballet jazz punk rock or swing it's dope
rappin brought by the T apostrophe King
And if I was in school and this was an assignment
I wouldn't type it or write it I'd just rhyme it
Cause rhyme is what I like I got a metaphor background
A punk jumps up, I bust a verse, he sits back down
Huh - I wrote a epic, I hope you accept it
Fly stupid rhymes I composed and perfected
I'm down with some people that know what they're doin
Darryl and Bobcat and Dwayne and DJ Pooh
and Keith Cooley is cool see, I'm the coolest person
Somebody drop the guitar before I start cursin

"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*}
"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*}

[King Tee]
So, as it looks, the people like it
The funky guitar tune that we ignited
Pooh, I mean really, suckers be stumblin
when they hear the funky guitar strummin
You know frankly, I think this cut is kinda musical
just like my "Bass" song, but don't get them confused though
The guitar gets your mind in the funky kind of state, huh
and my bass makes the walls shake (yeah)
Suckers can't come close with what I got goin
what I be doin, what I be showin
How I be conquerin and how I keep rulin
What makes the King Tee stay so cool and
where I get my Fila's from, how I learned my slang
How could I afford such a big gold chain
and fly girlies tempt me when (?) wanna hit me
Why I drink brew til my body gets tipsy
To ask all the questions that I just spoke though
It's not magic or a hoax I'm just loco
I like bustin on the funky dope track
Smooth like T, mo' powerful than a gat
Now that you know what's goin around
(c'mon) here comes the funky breakdown

That's smooth man, that made me laugh at all these suckers man
You laughin too Pooh? (ye-ye-yeah, hahahahaha)

"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*} (hahahahaha)
"listen to the gui-tar playin" {*E. Sermon*} (hahahahaha)

Yo Pooh, yo Pooh, break it down for a minute
Let me talk to the party
Now yo, me and Pooh is feelin real hot right now y'know
But we want y'all to know, that see, me and my crew
we from Compton, y'all heard about Compton?  Scratch Compton
(Compton!) Aight, see that's where we from (Compton!)</pre>
