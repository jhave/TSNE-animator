Typed by: Cno Evil

[U-God]
At a young, young age, nothing was right
The dirt that I did, I did at night
I used to hustle for a ray of light
Yo, I thought you was my A-Alike
But your heart was cold made of ice, yup
If I could count all the women and the money I spent
And the fake muthafuckas, the money I lent
Ya'll niggas all gon' pay the price
Ya'll all gonna pay the price

[Chorus: U-God]
I won't shed a tear, I will not cry
I'm tired of hand me downs, and getting by
Yo, I just can't get right, no
I just can't get right, no
When I'm gonna get mine, yo

[U-God]
Life's full of drama, secrets and lies
If you get screwed in the end, don't be surprised
Ya'll all gonna pay the price
Cuz ya'll all gonna pay the price
When I'm gonna get mine, oh
When I'm gonna get mine, yo
You keep asking me this, the questions is doubt
You can't trust no one, that's what this lessons about
Put the news through the wire, the message is out
You pissing me off, stressing me out, but

[Chorus: U-God]
I won't shed a tear, I will not cry
I'm tired of hand me downs, and getting by
Yo, I just can't get right, no
I just can't get right, no
When I'm gonna get mine, yo
When I'm gonna get mines...</pre>
