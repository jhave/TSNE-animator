[Nelly]
You got to believe in yourself
Don't let nobody tell you what you can't be
You got to believe in yoursel-elf, yeah
And everything else'll work out, you'll see
Ohh (ohh) ohh, ohh, hoh!

[Chorus: Nelly]
You got to believe in yourself
Don't let nobody tell you what you can't be
You got to believe in yoursel-elf, yeah
And everything else'll work out, you'll see
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
I think I  naw, I know I can
I think I  naw, I know I can
I think I  naw, I know I can
I know I can, I know I can, ay

[Nelly  over Chorus]
Ay, yeah
Nobody, uh-uh uh uhh
Everybody I think I...
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

[Nelly]
You see my poppa was a rollin stone
And my momma had problems of her own
But I still managed to make it out okay
... ohh, ohh
Although I'm hailed as a hometown hero
Still in my hometown I'm seen as a negro
But man, that's okay
Uh uh uh uh uh uh
It's so many obstacles in life to overcome
And as soon as you jump over one here come another come
But we got to be strong, and set examples for our sons
If the sun don't shine, then the decayin has begun

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
They say I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to play in the NBA no more
Now you tell me, what's wrong with that?
Ah ah ah, ah-ah ah ah
I pledge allegiance all the way to Iraq
But ain't nobody pledgin to me when I get back
Tell my Uncle Sam he wrong for that
Ah ah ah, WOO!
You see my self-esteem, I'm never leavin home without it
They told me I'd never make it, they told me I ain't doubt it
Now tell me whoever make it, now tell me I ain't got it
I'm seein +No Limits+ nigga, who sayin I ain't +Bout it+?
WOO!

[Chorus]

[Chuck D  over Chorus]
That's right, you gotta believe it y'all, c'mon
I know I can
I think I  naw, I know I can
I think I  naw, I know I can
Know I can, know you can

[Chuck D]
Rock on Nelly, rock on my brother
Keep your head up over the storm, young fella (hoh!)
Got a letter from the government, opened and read it
Uhh, and told 'em all to forget it
C'mon, cause we BELIEVE in the future
Uncle Sam sent his man to recruit ya
You still can't trust it, cause you came this far
End of discussion, when you KNOW who you are

[Chorus]

[Chuck D  over Chorus]
That's right believe, c'mon now
Don't let nobody tell you, what you can be
C'mon Nelly, tell 'em man
That's right, rockin it positivity, that's right
I know I can, I know I can
I think I, I know I can

[Outro: Chuck D]
You gotta believe it
You gotta believe, my brother
You keep doin your thing
That's right, keep that head up
All the way to the future
That's right, for the babies baby
For the babies</pre>
