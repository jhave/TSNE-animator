Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This is the night of my life
Yeah it's on right now
This is the night of my life
I'm gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

Yeah, we went fast, out a pocket full of cash
So you know where I am going, you don't even got to ask
Call up the homies, tell them we're heading out tonight
Call up some shorties, tell them who's going down tonight
And we gon' party like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm about the bottles, I can do all that cause money ain't a problem
I been to London to France, Australia to Japan
Headed up to Rio, to Puerto Rico
But never like this I'm just saying

This is the night of my life
Yeah it's on right now
This is the night of my life
I'm gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

You know the club jam packed, it's where everybody at
Got a couple shots, I'ma take em back
Then a couple more right after that
The way I'm feeling, I hope it never ends
Girl I'm just saying
Your friends and my friends should all be friends
And we could party like it ain't no tomorrow
Get money's the motto
So I'm balling just like I just hit the lotto
Whip from from Ibiza To Spain, ATL MIA, New York, Los Angeles
But I never went HAM like this, I'm just saying

This is the night of my life
Yeah it's on right now
This is the night of my life
I'm gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life

This is the night of my life
It is on right now
This is the night of my life
I'm gonna run this town
So you already know what it is
I partied all over the world but never like this
This is the night of my life</pre>
