Yeah, and we smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
Now how you like me now?

[Lil Wayne]
Got the Hog on 2-6
Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks
I don't know what you on but I'm on some new shit
While your bitch is on my dick like a glue stick
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if I lose it
Straight out the clip is how I spit like an Uzi
You can't find me cause I'm lost in the music
I running this and I can jump the hurdles
I'm feeling like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandana like the ninja turtles
I'm like a turtle when I sip the purple

[Hook]
And I smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
And I ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
And we smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
And we ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
So how you like me now?

[Lil Wayne]
Buck 60 on the dash, I'ma do two
Captain Crush, these niggas is fruit loops
That's why your girl wanna fuck me and my group too
And I'ma make her back it up like "Joop, joop"
I'm the Birdman junior, I gotta do coups
I hop up out that motherfucker hollering "Soo whoot?"
Hollygrove 17, I'm from the zoo crew
You would think every animal in the zoo loose
*Fuck with me* I'm on that screw juice
But I keep my shit together, not a screw loose
Yeah... word to my Guc' boots
I'm higher than a new suit...

[Hook]
Cause we smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
And we ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush... yeah, that kush
And we ball like swoosh... yeah, like swoosh
Now how you like me now?

[Lil Wayne]
Buck 40 on a ring that I don't really wear
But I bet it light up the night like the city fair
This shit ain't fair, I didn't have to go there
But all this ice got me feeling like a polar bear
I'm so aware, I'm so prepared
I'm so fly I'll take off into the open air
Lift off, Cristal
Please, crackers with cheese
Nigga please, we on J-E-T's
Like Curtis Martin in white and green
I'm lighting lightning, light the thing
Light the thing, no Reggie mayne

[Hook]
You know I smoke that kush...
And I ball like swoosh...
You know I smoke that kush...
And I ball like swoosh...
Now how you like me now?</pre>
