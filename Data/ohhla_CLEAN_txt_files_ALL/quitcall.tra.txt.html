Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Hook - 2X]
Bitch, just let me be
I done told ya, quit fucking with me
Gangsta, is all that I can be
Bitch, quit calling me

[Trae]
She can quit, calling my pho-one
Quit calling, my phone
She can quit, calling my pho-one
Cause I don't love, no bitch
She can quit, calling my pho-one
Quit calling, my phone
She can quit, calling my pho-one
Cause I don't love, no bitch
So hoe, you gotta to move on
I'd rather, kick it alone
You might, just fuck up my zone
I don't need you round, bye
So hoe, you gotta move on
I'd rather, kick it alone
You might, just fuck up my zone
I don't need you round, bye

[Hook - 2X]

[Trae]
You better, do you
I don't want your ass around me, when I come through
All that barking that you doing, I don't trust you
And on the cool you got a nigga saying fuck you, fuck you
You better, do you
I don't want your ass around me, when I come through
All that barking that you doing, I don't trust you
And on the cool you got a nigga saying fuck you, fuck you

Let me tell you what the bidness is, ain't no room for games to be played
I only got love for my money, cause that's what's keeping me paid
See you ain't on the mission I'm on, your attitude show it all
You out here for yourself, and that I'm really not feeling at all
I've been wise since I was young, that's why I made it this far
And I be damned if you around me, just to feel like a star
I'd rather do my thang, maintain while I stay on the grind
And I'm a gangsta baby, I don't need nobody around huh

[Hook - 2X]

She can quit, calling my pho-one
Quit calling, my phone
Cause I don't love, no bitch
So hoe, you gotta move on
I'd rather, kick it alone
You might, just fuck up my zone
I don't need you round, bye
So hoe, you gotta move on
I'd rather, kick it alone
You might, just fuck up my zone
I don't need you round, bye</pre>
