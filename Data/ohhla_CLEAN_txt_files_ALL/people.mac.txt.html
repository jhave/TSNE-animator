Song:   People
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know people that try, people that don't
People that fly through the air, just float, like smoke
I know people that joke
Know people that's rich, know people that's broke
Know people that love, people that hate
Some tell you that you're good
Some say you're doing great
Hey, I know people can't wait
They wanna hear every single thing I gotta say
Some people act cool, some act phony
People are your friends, but they'll never be your homies!
I know people think they know me
Like there's a lame, untalented old me
Girls wanna own me, labels wanna clone me
Haters wanna choke me, stoners wanna smoke weed!
People never gonna change
Cause no two people are the same!

[Chorus]
Hey! we are just two people
What more can we do
Give me one more day
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!

I can't complain, now people know my name
But when come back home, not a damn thing change!
I bet people can't believe
Some after the money
Some want a degree
If you showing love, then you're cool with me
I'm the same old dude, before the jewelry
And everything kinda new to me
Things ain't nothing like they used to be!
People thought I would
And some people probably thought I could
Some people think the boy turned at hollywood
Live it up every day, worth while
Dudes runaway when they see the girl smile
I'm glad I get to call her mine
This the type of thing so hard to find!
You can't tell a star to shine or a carpet fly
Shits gonna happen it's just all in time

[Chorus]
Hey! we are just two people
What more can we do
Give me one more day
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!

Until I'm with somebody, I don't know what to do
They may not understand you cause they see you only move!
Girl this dinner's over, try'na to get you to my room
Cause I've been going crazy baby you don't got a clue

[Chorus]
Hey! we are just two people
What more can we do
Give me one more day
I'm a spend it with you!
With you!</pre>
