[Verse Three: Capone]
They wanna know what's up with 'Pone I'm ok
I'm back with Jose for that free Tony
You got a check then gimme that
I draw nine's and ten's just like pitty pat
Ends is the minimum
I treat O's like brand new tires rotate and spinnin 'em
This year the game's in a brand new perspective
We win, while we take a L like Lexus
Go ahead girl and shoe 'em how you move (How you move)
Tell your girl hold your bag and your shoes
Put it on 'em so a nigga can't move
Now stop, rotate to the next dude, yeah
Hi haters I'm on my hiatus

You can tell by the talk
I represent New York, don't get outlined and chalked

[Verse Four: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! I said hello hi hi hello hello hi hello (Hello)
I'm ready to black, spazz and smash shit with N-O (N-O)
I'm about to fuck the buildin up gimme uno momento
And the game need a nigga you saee me I'm suicentral
While the women love the kid in the hood respectin my tactics
Obvious we ain't the same cause I come from a different fabric
My cup a overflow with the swag sorry ya lack it
A he he, I ain't meanin to brag but I could back it
When I spazz niggas say Bus ya gone too far
This flat bed, my Phantom and watch me drive new car
When the people they see me they say God you are
Back in the buildin with NORE WHO THE FUCK WANNA WAR?!
And I was jumpin out of the window with this
You know who run shit nigga FLIPMODE BITCH!!!!
LOOK! Baby girl this might be your last chance
Shake your ass and do that Arab Money dance 

[Chorus: Ron Browz] (N.O.R.E.)
