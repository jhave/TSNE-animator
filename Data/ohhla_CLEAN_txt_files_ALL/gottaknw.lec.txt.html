Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

(You just gotta know)
You ever feel like life just comin at ya a million miles an hour?
(You just gotta know)
You just gotta know
Somebody's holdin it all together

[Lecrae]
Life is like an elevator, a lot of ups and downs
People pushin your buttons and gettin jerked around
I used to lurk around town tryin to work around
Workin so that I could hit the ground with the perfect sound
Even perfect sound sounds like work
When you spend your time flirtin with the crown in the perp
I was bound for Berzerk with a layover in Crazy,
A lazy Jay-Z hopin rock-a-fellas paid me
Or rockin ladies were caught me a Mercedes
But that whole dream was in '80's baby
Missed that shot like the cop that's crooked
TV goes off, third eye still lookin'
Mom still cookin', I can always go home
Even though I'm five years past grown (five years past grown)
Here I go again, I'm still chasin the wind, I can't win
When it gets hot, it boils down to sin
If Heaven ain't a gift, then I ain't getting' in (man)

[Chorus: Benjah]
I can't even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I've been goin down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know

[Lecrae]
(Yeah) I sit and hear the guitars play
Wonder if they could, what would stars say or Venus and Mars say
Or say that we want it our way,
Stars so desperate to shine that they go on livin the hard way
The intellect to travel to Mars but so blind,
We worship Venus but she don't even know who we are
And she never cared why, cause she wasn't there
When I was tryin to drown my sorrows in a pool of despair
I ain't perfect, sometimes I feel worthless,
Worth less than that is the image that I'da purchased
Man, from the shades to the shirt to the shoes,
Just another fool tryin to cover he's confused, that ain't cool
Sometimes I hate the man in the mirror
Cause I know he's a liar and a cheater and a killer
People say they love him but they love what he can give 'em
But deep inside he knows that there's a reason for him livin'

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
(Uh) You know I need you like aqua
Day without ya got me so nauseous
If I ain't cautious, I'm gonna self-inflict my sickness
You know it's true, you as my witness
At how you witness my inconsistence
Yes, the ovation when I need your assistance
And I just gotta know that even though I'm a misfit
I'm still worth more than calamity's french kiss
Yes I'm loved, and I'm pursued
And though I can't feel it, still I know that it's true
Somebody woke me up, and yeah, I know it was you
And yet I keep tryin to steer clear of your view
Cause if you get me, I know that you got me
But I'm so insecure I can't believe that you want me
But then I heard you went on your way to adopt me
Well you can have my all if you swear you won't drop me
Cause I gotta know (yeah)

[Outro]
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (hey, hey, gotta know that it's real)

You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (gotta know, gotta know that it's real)
You just gotta know (hey, hey, gotta know that it's real)</pre>
