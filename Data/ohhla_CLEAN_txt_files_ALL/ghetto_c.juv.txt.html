Verse 1

In these times we gotta hustle cuz our pockets be hurt
Lil niggas wanna get fronted from who got work
Is she ready for that, you wanna wash the bus
Let a nigga know where they at so aint no stoppin' us
If you handle yo business right I'ma promote yo ass
You bitch out and try to kite I'ma come smoke yo ass
The shit that I'm givin' you they tryin' blood ta get
The vicks be runnin' through because they love the shit
So don't come with that no one bout it shit was cool
Niggas tried ta rob me nobody was comin' through
Snitches I can't have that
Bitches I can't have that
Riches you can have that
Just bring me my cash back
Look its all gravy with me go head and shine
Thats how you play it with me ya big time
All I want is the Gs
With a trunk full of keys
A benz on 20s
You got something you can lend me
Shit nigga I aint doing nothin' for me for free
Can't put no trust in you niggas cuz yall be tryin' ta run G
Cuz I don't like dreamin' bout makin' no cheese
Wanna see my muthafuckin' bank account O.D.ed [(over dosed)]


(Chorus) 2X
Until then I'ma be thuggin' behind a project buildin'
Smokin' that fire be with the ghetto children
Plottin' on a way that we can make a million (million lawd lawd)

Verse 2

Now I'm on some shit again
Leave a nigga stranded like Gilligan
Hundreds I'm considerin'
Lex it for a millian
Catch it nigga I'm killin'em
They spot but I aint feelin'em
My jacket off appearin them
Some a say its numerary
Parntnas in for sipperin'
Juvenile is different
Look at what I did to them
Niggas wearin' reeboks instead of nikes and timbalands
Bitch niggas I be tippin'em
My mac 9 it be flippin'em
Some of these niggas is tryin ta run G
So I be gippin'em
They would do the same to me
Niggas aint no family
Shit is all a game to me
But nobody gone handle me
400 degreez
Tottin' guns runnin' with me
No wonder we need
Mo money one could receive
Nigga wanna deal with this christ
I'ma put it open in his life
Never should I fuck with me right
Why you keep duckin' me shy
I'ma knock ya head off
Nigga tryin' ta get to ya fuck tryin' ta play it off
You made the beef nigga so why is you scared
If you mind yo fuckin' business then yo life would be spared
I can't see it
Nigga try ta make me out a bitch I can't be it
I had a muthafuckin' problem with niggas like freed me
You probably can save yall self but you can't save yall neighbors
Um, and now I got cha spinnin' on round like a baseball playa
Put on this the table I'ma hit'em a nine
Foolish I had ta tame ta keep these niggas in line
Look cuz I don't like dreamin' about makin' no cheese
Wanna see my muthafuckin bank account ODed [(over dosed])

(Chorus) 2X

Ask them niggas bout me 
Bet them bitches know me
Magnolia head buster out that wild T.C.
I'ma young nigga
Look at what ya done nigga
You done made me mad
Now I'm goin' get my gun nigga
Betta watch cha tongue nigga
Cuz I'm gettin' dumb nigga
Killed one nigga 
Represent where I'm from nigga
See thangs don't cha never do fuck with a man his change or his mamma
You do that you won't drama
Fuck with a big tyma, fo sho you gone see
I'm out cha which one of you boys want me
I'ma keep it real with ya
Ya say you the man, I know I'm the man and I'm ready ta deal with cha
I'm prepared for the toe taggin' 
Keep my reeboks strapped tight with my gibauds saggin'
Now, I done rocked a couple of Gs and done flipped that two times
I know I'm in a problem and they gonna persuit mine
I got bills ta pay I can't be playin' with you jokers
These youngsters somethin' else now ya bout ta get promoka
You can't understand how a nigga my age
Can hit the streets psyhced up bustin' with the twelve gage
But I don't like ta dream about makin' no cheese
In the future wanna see my fuckin' pockets Oded [(over dosed)]

(Chorus) 1X</pre>
