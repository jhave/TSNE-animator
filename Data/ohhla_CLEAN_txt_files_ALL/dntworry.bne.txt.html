[Krayzie Bone]

Everything's gonna be alright
             (it's gon' be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now
             (it's gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
             (it's gon' be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now
             (it's gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
             (it's gon' be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now
             (it's gonna be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright
             (it's gon' be alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now
             (it's gonna be alright)

Say don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

Verse 1:

Now why did they kill him
It's one of my niggas is dreamin' schemin on making a million
Tryin' feed they children and police keep coming around
And keep tryin' to beat you down, and take you out
Nigga don't worry God don't like evil
Shit is so clear that they can't even see through
But no matter what we do (matter what we do),
We gon' be strugglin' forever running forever
The hood that I seein' it won't get no betta
Until armageddon goes down it's not a legend
It's kinda hard to view, paradise,
But if you just try close your eyes you can view it
But reality hits you soon as you open your eyes you find
That you still live a fucked up life
And the streets done took over your mind
Figure you gotta survive, so somebody got to die
You just wanna break down and cry
But asking God to come help us please, why?

Hook: Krayzie Bone

Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang
Don't you worry bout a damn thang a damn thang

Verse 2: Wish Bone

Some ah y'all niggas really can't fight
Betta get it together getta act right
Cause when you fuck wid Bone
Betta come wid somethin' betta have you shit right
And don't be planning no future on nuthing you heard, nigga,
He say she say get you fucked up killa
And I'm gon' ride, won't lose no sleep over nuthin'
You can save it friend
But all these years,
Face to face ain't nobody said nuthin'
Livin' in these wicked days
Tryin' to get over my wicked ways
Time after time I know we tried
But losing this life everyday
And I don't wanna go out like that not me,
Lately Bone got what you want
Physically you don't wanna bleed
A la la la la la la
Hit 'em hard it's gonna  be alright,
Alright alright

Verse 3: Bizzy Bone

And don't you worry bout, a damn thang
And don't you worry bout, a damn thang,
Wid all odds, against us
When the guard got me running for the fences
Aiming at these henchmen litigate shells
I'm teaming my clip wid the extra extension
I sit in my basment like it's a crackhouse bored,
Blackout cause I was paranoid, he enjoys what I avoid
The courts ah bowl ah, crooks
Cause bitches want the money on ya books
Destroy double eyed dotted watch devil smiles wid a cush
Gotta sell chronic to get me up some mellofied timing televised
The crucified promised in ah my ish nobody can stop us
Where the shoot out?
How many niggas you killed?
How many niggas for real?
Like Mary Louelle as long as I live
Forty five strategized like,Ohh dow,
Niggas can blast at me
Bitches can pass me,
Fuck ah chicken and let's get on

Verse 4: Flesh N Bone

I remember like yesterday
Way back in the day coming up
Moms used to read to me everyday
Through the evening even through the afternoon
In the dawn ah book of songs,
So I'm wondering off through the wilderness
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
Want to hunt me down all the need for people
Heaven I wonder will the devil catch me shall prevail
Lately even heaven is flashy sick of this amazed envy
And it ain't nuthin' to see and believe in heaven in front of you
That's what I'm having a de ja vu
Lord when I lay down down to sleep
I pray for the Lord and the Holy Ghost bless my soul to keep,
And if I should die before I wake up wake up wake up wake up
I pray for the Lord to have mercy on our souls oh please Lord take us
I say to my momma peep no no more crying drying eyes
Nigga locked up at wayside
Couldn't even pay respect to my stepdad when he died
So finally got a release bid and I slide back to the county
Back to the 5-5 ride fore I touch back home
Don't worry bout a damn thang
Everything finna be al-right
Off to the door so bright like a knight in shining armour
Hug my wife my sons my daughter
Ain't no more reason to even bother

Verse 5: Layzie Bone

Look nigga I ain't worried bout nothing
Cause it's a little thing I know called faith
All you need is much as a mustard seed
And the Lord will keep you safe
Whateva don't kill you will make you stronger
I promise you that just keep on pushing,
If you slip you fall and you hurt yourself
Then the Lord will provide your cushion
Determination, rules the nation whateva you facing just be a man
Believing in death before dishonor shake the drama and take a stand
For ah nigga like me see it didn't come easy
Ah nigga had to struggle and fight
At ah point and time in my life
It's like ah nigga just can't get it right
To all of my family Layzie loves ya
And I never take shit for granted
Feeling so wicked off in this planet
Man fuck tryin' to understand it
That's why I stay focused thugging and loc'dus
Stacking my bricks till I form the fifth
Momma never said it'd be like this
But nigga I'm ready for anything,
Remember to never count your eggs before they hatch
About precision timing and vision
Get up and go and don't turn back
If you ah soldier and you know it hold ya head up high
And keep stompin' in yo big black boots and don't worry
