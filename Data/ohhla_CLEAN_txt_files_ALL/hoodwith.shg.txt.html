[Big Shug]
Yeah, to all my people in the hood, y'knahmean?
This is hood talk right here, ah-hah, yeah
Feel me? On the sub-reals y'all might not know about this here
Feel me? Let me put y'all up

Two slices and grape soda, I'm hood with that
Liquor stores on every corner, I'm hood with that
Sweet flavored blunt wraps, I'm hood with that
Dim lights and mouse traps, I'm hood with that
Tight jeans and fat asses I'm hood with that
Late for school and cuttin classes, I'm hood with that
Section 8 and steel gates, I'm hood with that
Drive-throughs and long waits, I'm hood with that
Dogs runnin no leashes, I'm hood with that
Sidewalks, dog feces, I'm hood with that
I'm not good with that, but I'm hood with that
Piss smellin hallways, I'm hood with that
Smoke weed all day, I'm hood with that
Racial profilin, I'm hood with that
All my niggaz just stylin, I'm hood with that
Beef patties, fruit colas, I'm hood with that
Gunshots at crazy hours, I'm hood with that
Cops short on manpower, I'm hood with that
Pitbulls and dirt bikes, I'm hood with that
Niggaz pushin snow white, I'm hood with that
Crap games and card games, I'm hood with that
Young cats shootin each other I'm hood with that
I'm not good with that, but I'm hood with that
Young mothers no man, I'm hood with that
Represent Mattapan, I'm hood with that
All the ghettoes 'round the world, I'm hood with that
Represent where you're from and be good with that
All day all day be hood with that

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
E'ry day all day, I'm hood with that

[Big Shug]
Nail shops and barberships, I'm hood with that
Spinnin rims and no top, I'm hood with that
Fly chicks with nice feet, I'm hood with that
Rough chicks with bad feet, I'm hood with that
Smilin faces no teeth, I'm hood with that
Smilin faces gold teeth, I'm hood with that
White, and black tees, I'm hood with that
Shorts way past the knees, I'm hood with that
Chicks gettin they hair did, I'm hood with that
With three or four kids, I'm hood with that
Men drinkin in the car, I'm hood with that
Trip on Hollyhood stars, I'm hood with that
Churches and bingo, I'm hood with that
Yellow tape and po'-po', I'm hood with that
Slap clowns with fake flow, I'm hood with that
Always good with dat stay hood with that, with that...

Yeah, Big Shug baby
I'm from the hood man, don't ever forget where you from man
No matter where you go, the hood is always in you, FEEL ME~!

[Chorus]</pre>
