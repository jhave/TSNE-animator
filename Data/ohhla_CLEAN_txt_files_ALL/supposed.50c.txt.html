[50 Cent]
Ah-ha man!  Ay you know where them niggaz be at right?
{*click-clack*} Take me to 'em

[Chorus: 50 singing]
All through the hood I keep hearin niggaz sayin
- I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggaz done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
- I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
- I'm down to ride tonight
Weed smokin, straight loc'n, lockin loadin
- Somebody gon' die tonight

[Verse One]
This is nuttin new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggaz outside of her door
Different day same shit, old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggaz never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin, I'll have 'em tongue-kissin my tec
Gwan come, test me, pussy bwoy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggaz wanna stick me for my paper"
"And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar and vest shit, that wild wild West shit
There's eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!

[Chorus]
