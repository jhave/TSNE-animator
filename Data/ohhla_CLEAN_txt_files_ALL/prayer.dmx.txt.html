I come to you hungry and tired
you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak 
you give me strength and that's deep
you call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
only asking that I keep the focus in-between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect,but you'd like me to try
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie
till I die
Lord why is it that,I go through so much pain
All I saw was black,all I felt was rain
I come to you because its you who knows
you showed  me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
our dogs being,brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way,but i hid
and I remember once you held me close,but i slid
There was something that I just had to see
that you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it,but I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I've seen it,I can feel the change
and it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known a love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
and up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears with a song
and I almost lost faith when you took my man Monty,Paso,and Jay's brother Dan
and I fear that what I'm saying won't be heard until I'm gone
but it's all good,cause I really didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer,for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die,but please Lord treat him right
