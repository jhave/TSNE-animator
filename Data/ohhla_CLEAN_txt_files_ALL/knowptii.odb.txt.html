Intro: Ol Dirty Bastard, Shorty Shit Stain

Yo, turn the-- drop the, drop the drums
Yeah, drop the drums
(I know all the time) Step up to the mic boo
(It be hard to use a Trojan) Yeah, let me hear you
(Cause your shit can't breath...)

(Sex is something that everybody needs) I know all the time fellas
                                        It's hard to use a Trojan
(Everybody wants, everybody loves)      Cause your shit can't breathe
                                        It's all closed in
(Sex is something that everybody needs) Put the beat on, put the beat on
(Everybody wants, everybody loves)

Chorus: Shorty Shit Stain

Sex is something that everybody needs
Everybody wants, everybody loves

(repeat 2X) - If you want it baby
              if you want it babe
              better use a Trojan!

Verse One:

I know all the time fellas, be hard to use a Trojan
Cause your shit can't breathe, it feels all closed in
You wanna slip itoff, ohh baby I like it raw
But why i wanna hurt myself for?
I was walking down my block, say my block Munroe
Said peace to this girl, girl said hello
Well hell is low, and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young bitch brain
Causin her a great relief of physical pain
She said, "Tit for tat, step off da bra strap.
No diamonds, no gold, I can never get a rap."
I said, "So what?", as I grabbed herbutt
Bitch smiled for a while but her  mouth kept shut
Bitch eighteen years old, just birthed a child
Young in the brain though her thoughts are wild
On welfare, but she don't care
She says, "FTF is always there."
FTF means face-to-face
Main, headquarters of your local place
Where, you collect your monthly pay
To support bad habits youse abuse everyday
There hasnever been a girl in my entire life
My girl, my next, ex or my wife
And never been one who tried to disrespect
I'm speakin bout the member of the opposite sex!
There's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Quiet as kept, she thought I was soft
But all I wanted to do, is knock her boots off
Just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girl seemin rather quite dense
Other than dense she played slightly bold
But from the statement I made she could not uphold herself
She broke down, and she started to cry she said
"Oh!  I don't believe this guy!"
What what you gonna do?
May I diss her?  Yes you may
That girl's a slut, with a hole in her butt
Who used to be a meaty-bone puppy child little mutt
Came to my house smellin like trout
I said, "Doggie doggie doggie, get out!!"
She did my dick, I mean she bit bad vicious
Dirt Megirt, deep dark and delicious
She's a doo-doo BUH
Alcoholic NUH
and her ass is tighter
than a pair of vice GRIPS
Speaking of a TUH
I won't kiss, because they don't give milk
Them shit, kick, see uh
Let me tell you about the rash from the neck
it's enough to put the ring around the collar in check
She's nothin but a BUH
otherknown as a WUH
with an irritating ITCH
from trying to SWITCH
Strung out ass, foggin up glass
Tell all the NUH that the pussy first class
Smoke a bag of hash with the money she stash
But she had to play the corner just to make that cash
Pulled down her panties and scratched that rash
Then rubbed it with that a pimp had slashed
Tryied to get saved at the Tabernacle Prayer
But the only thing holy was her shitty underwear
I will change a style, always I will fix
But you can not teach an old bag...

Outro:

Yo I ain't got to say no more Son
Yo word to God man
Only thing I'm saying man, is use a Trojan
KnowhatI'Msayin?  Fore real man
Cause it's on man
YouknowhatI'msayin?  I had to learn that...
