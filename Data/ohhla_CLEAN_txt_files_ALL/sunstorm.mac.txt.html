[Intro]
Conflict/Resolution. That's damn sure not a specialty
I wanna thank everyone for listening to the album they just listened to
Please don't take out your lights though. It's kinda sad

[Verse One]
I'm from the meth lab city of broken dreams
And cracked out dopamines
Where everybody's looking for an ocean scene
Where 'Pac and Biggie are passe cause back home
We speak in terms of Mac Dre and Fat Tone
I'm from a city where there's actually people
That are bothered by the thought of homosexual marriage
The Bible Belt, friendly smiles, and Christian steeples
And names like Bobby Sue Williams and Belinda Peoples
This town is so eerie when it snows
All the trees look like ghosts appearing from the road
The crows flew south of heaven and found the elixir
The echo of silence whispers from the mouth of the river
To say... yeah the city could be great one day
But the first step is getting out of our own way
I've been to bigger cities, they produce bigger frowns
I'll die, right here, in this town

[Chorus] [x2]
And I know
There's something beautiful within my grasp
And I know
I think I'm satisfied but it won't last
And I know
To lace my boots up and pick my path
I'll find another rainstorm to fill my glass

[Verse Two]
So quote my life as written by anonymous, fuck it
I think I'll keep the liquid courage and the broken promises
So if you're coming over bring a bottle and a cup
There's a war going on outside (and I don't give a fuck)
I could never win the fight for me
I could only minimize the details of my life story
I was born, late July, 1981
Skip a bunch of bullshit until now and then the story's done
But I'ma write the chapters later in my life
In a nursing home with a sweet lady for a wife
Both of us in wheelchairs we quietly hold hands
It's strange, but one day, I'm gonna be an old man
I hope to be happy on that day 
Because I finally stood up and moved the hell out of my own way
I need to get the hell out of my own way (note to self)
And so do you

[Chorus] [x4]
And I know
There's something beautiful within my grasp
And I know
I think I'm satisfied but it won't last
And I know
To lace my boots up and pick my path
I'll find another rainstorm to fill my glass

[Outro]
No no no no. Don't get your lighters out. This isn't Bed Harper
Thank you Seven. Thank you Opus. And thank you Kanas City. Good night

BOW MOTHERFUCKER WHAT!?</pre>
