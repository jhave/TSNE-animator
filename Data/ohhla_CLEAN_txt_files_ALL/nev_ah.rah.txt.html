[Talking]
Nev-ah
Me, lose?
C'mon now, c'mon man
How can I lose
I'm the best

Chorus: Rowdy Rahz

I will nev-ah lose, nev-ah fall
Nev-ah hate, nev-ah give up
Nev-ah snitch or rat on my dogs
I will nev-ah fall victim to the law
Nev-ah run from a brawl
I know they say nev-ah to say nev-ah, but I will nev-ah

[Talking]
This is my year
Losin', is just not in my vocabulary
You understand who I am?
I'm rowdy
The son of the God
I can not be touched

[Verse 1]
How can I lose when I was born to win
Some say nobody's perfect
So can you tell me what the hell is wrong with them
The supreme, I deal beam, beyond compare
Ghetto works, team with Queen, and shock them, compare
A master mind, design the perfect crime, so to facinate the ghetto
And crush those who oppose
I shall nev-ah lose, my name is Rahz, so I'ma rise
And I shall nev-ah fall, so just call my the son of God
Double R rip constant, lose nev-ah that
Flow sicker than leukemia, can't get rid of that
Y'all might as well call the cops
See me I play to win, if not, I'ma ball non-stop

Chorus: (2x)

[Verse 2]
I used to know one
You talk slick, I'm quick to blow one
Stop the yappin'
And take it down for Rahz start to actin'
And shit happen here
Losers, to the rear
Head home, Dunn
When it stay on, losers gone
Scornin', keep movin', regulate
Decimate, the fake who perpitrate
Kid, facts is provin', niggaz saw me ball, niggaz saw me brawl
Niggaz saw me hittin' chicken's walls
Niggaz saw me shake him 'til he fall
Need I say more, nah fuck that , rough cat
Brick City thoroughbread, darrowhead, feel that
Feel the real illness, my nick name is the abyss
Take the wrong step and fall, in some deep shit

Chorus: (2x)

[Talking]
See, I'm tired of you fake ones hatin' on Rah
Y'all don't understand Rah
This is Rah year
'99-2000, it's mine I'm takin' over
It's not a game

[Verse 3]
My whole life I been the gifted one
Had ups and downs, but still I came out the victor one
See even if you say I lost, they gon' say I won
'Cause I'mma make sure your bruises is worser than mine
Opps, and I'm squirtin' the 9, nev-ah losin' I'm workin' a dime
Takin' the L to me, is foriegn, I'm far beyond the level of the norm
Call me concieted, cause is this game, my rap flow is undefeated
Ask Joe Jacks, he couldn't beat it
I'm Newark's best kept secret
Slick talker, thick chick stalker
If you spit, I spit harder
Dope with the rhymes, when it's beef I'm holdin' the 9
If I get knocked I ain't snitchin' I'm servin' the time

Chorus (repeat until fade)</pre>
