[ VERSE 1: Too $hort ]
What the fuck is wrong with Too $hort?
What the fuck he tryina make somethin new for?
Why that nigga keep spittin all that game
Why he still gettin bitches, this shit is insane
All my life I been writin these verses
Learned the game cause I like to go in pussy and purses
It feels good to be a motherfuckin pimp
Sometimes I knock a bitch just to do it on the strength
Every time you see me - I'm on 'em
That's how we was raised up in Northern California
She bought it all and if you gotta ask why
You ain't on the case, man, you not a PI
Don't trip, I know what's up with you
You take her shoppin and the bitch ain't even fuckin you
Nigga, you bout as sorry as they come
They took you to a strip club and you bought up all the ones
What the fuck

What the fuck! (What the fuck!)

What the fuck!
Bitch

[ VERSE 2: Too $hort ]
What the fuck is wrong with some of you bitches?
Waitin on a wealthy man to come through with riches
And shower you with presents, what's the mission?
You shoulda been a hoe cause there's really no difference
What you want? A marriage and have babies with a millionaire?
But not too many ladies get to live in here
You better stay in school
Cause old sluts with ball players just ain't too cool
Spent all them years on your back
Hella niggas with contracts, they fucked that
Bitch, you got some thangs on your mind?
Used to be dime but now you ain't so fine
And all the little girls wanna be just like you
They wanna fuck a rich nigga too
Worse than me, you're not a good role model
Offered her a shot, the bitch drank the whole bottle
What the fuck

What the fuck! (What the fuck!)

What the fuck! (What the fuck!)

What the fuck! (What the fuck!)

What the fuck!
Bitch

[ VERSE 3: Too $hort ]
So I had to do it all again
What happened to the game? I can't call it, pimp
You tell me, we let the squares change the rules
Snitchin is cool and y'all trickin like some fools
What the fuck you niggas thinkin?
And where the fuck is all the motherfuckin kingpins?
What would life be without the snitches and the feds?
A mattress full of money, two bitches in the bed
It's hard to get around them federal guidelines
Too many real niggas sittin on the sidelines
While bitch niggas keep playin the role
You know you not a gangsta, what you sayin it fo'?
I picked up the phone and said, 'Who is this?'
You got your own label and you in the music biz?
But you never put out shit, you never had a hit
And never went to the bank to deposit one check
What the fuck

What the fuck! (What the fuck!)

What the fuck! (What the fuck!) (What the fuck!)

What the fuck!
Nigga
