[DADDY X]
Fire It Up
The next chapter
(Yup)
Legalize freedom
Free your mind
(Forecast says that high winds are blowin')
Higher consciousness
(Dark clouds up ahead, we kept rollin')
You create your own reality
(Some times you gotta live life knowin')
Stoney vibrations
(Your in the eye of the storm)
Seek Truth
Observe Nature
Educate Yourself
(Refuse to conform)
Find your real history
(Deviate from the norm)
Non-conformity
Anarchy
(Refuse to conform)
Walk your own walk
Every moment is a gift
(Forecast says that high winds are blowin')
Create your own reality
(Dark clouds up ahead, we kept rollin')
Live while u live
(Some times you gotta live life knowin')
Freedom is a state of mind
(Your in the eye of the storm)
Freedom is a state of mind
(Refuse to conform)
Non-conformity
(Deviate from the norm)
Individuality
Legalize freedom
(Refuse to conform)
Legalize freedom
Creation
(Your in the eye of the storm)
Legalization
Legalization</pre>
