[Intro]
Geahhhh! Yeahhhh!
Yeah! (Big Cat Records)
Zay-T on the track
Gucci Mane, LaFlare
So Icey E-N-T, ha
So Icey man, they say you're a stupid boy
Man guacamole's on deck

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity

[Gucci Mane]
Tell me I'm a junkie baby, color karat watch me baby
Want to spend 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop 380 baby
Multi-color clarity, necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain
Mighty mouse is icey dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance the stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin lick, Gucci man the talkin brick
If you ain't gon' talk no chickens dog, who you talkin to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate Nate 'bout to go to school (Nate Nate)
Saturday I'm cookin chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin chickens, granny about to go to church

[Gucci Mane]
Heavy wrist activity, got me livin lovely
Cocallina in the 'llac, coca in the shawty
Breakin down ten chickens dog, 'bout to cook the shake up
All these extra grams, might as well go buy a Jacob
Gucci Mane for mayor, Gucci Mane so player
Reppin East Atlanta that's ten minutes from Decatur
I must match our cars and our vests gon' match our gators
You can't swang like Gucci cause you don't got enough flavor
Heavy on the licorice, in the street ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business?
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas

[Gucci Mane]
My girlfriend say she love me, but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor karats got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm all in
'74 restored it, Zaytoven record it
Say you chargin 30 like the Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stupid jewelry dog, I don't think you heard me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Huh (Big Cat Records)</pre>
