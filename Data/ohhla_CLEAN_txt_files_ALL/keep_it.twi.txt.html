That's my family, criminals and weirdos
Outcasts and freak shows and members of the carnival
That's my family, wicked clowns and dead folks
And lyrical assassins that'll slash ya throat
That's my family, so put ya hands up
Put ya hands up, put ya hands up
That's my family, keep the hands up
And represent the Dark Carnival for life motherfucker

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Now come on where my family at, woo woo
That's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
Now we keep it tight like cat burglars and ledges
Look out your window, I'll be hidin' out in your hedges
Waitin' for the second for you to turn your back
And jump through the window and attack your bitch ass
We keep it movin' like a juggler jugglin'
Wicked and thuggin', motherfucker say somethin'

[Monoxide]
Label me whatever, it never mattered to me
Long as I'm related to your family tree
It's a gang of us, all shapes and sizes
And the world'll be enlightened when the dark sun rises
Despise us, go ahead, hate me to your friend
No matter what you say or do, this'll never end
Pretend it's a dream and it don't matter what I say
Juggalos unite and represent at GOT-J

Keep it movin', rollin' till it ain't no wheels
Keep it movin', give it time to flex our skills
Keep it movin', you ain't never seen a crew like us
The underground rumbles everytime we bust
Come on man, you ain't never heard of the Carnival Clique
Come on man, we be deep and on some family shit
Come on man, you can try to get as close as you can get
But you never come close to the Hatchet

[Jamie Madrox]
I bump the best shit, only the best shit, and if it
Ain't a Hatchet product it's bound to get ejected
This shit is protected by Computron
And hard drives and main frames that it's downloaded on
Virtual criminal, subtitle subliminal
It's the carnival, bumpin' out the speakers in ya vehicle
Madrox, venomous nemesis
Deeper than a fat chick's cracks and crevaces, oh I bet it is
Patience is a virtue and time waits for no man
It take forever, dog, for some people to understand
Took quite a grip for me to master my shit
And I still find myself just wantin' to quit
But my mind is uncontrollable
With the ability to hop any obstacle and make it beneficial
Can't no dudes hold us back, a bitch for that fact
It'd take more than that to derail train from track

Keep it movin', rollin' till it ain't no wheels
Keep it movin', give it time to flex our skills
Keep it movin', you ain't never seen a crew like us
The underground rumbles everytime we bust
Come on man, you ain't never heard of the Carnival Clique
Come on man, we be deep and on some family shit
Come on man, you can try to get as close as you can get
But you never come close to the Hatchet

[Violent J]
We keep it movin', improvin' all that we doin'
Makin' decisions and rulin', every moment we schoolin'
I jump outta bed better than I was yesterday
I'm so fuckin' fresh I think I'll bloody a mess today
What happened, y'all don't know me, homey
I'll slap yo bitch big ass while she blow me
I thought you caught word, Violent J's an asshole
Blowin' mad grass, passed outta control
Me and Jamie Madrox, Shaggy and Monoxide
Scare the fuckin' color out your hair like peroxide
New shit's droppin', we don't stop choppin'
Our shit stays on and poppin' while y'all been floppin'
I'm a don bitch, respect that shit or fuck off
Still stayin' scrub with a scrotum you can suck off
Wicked shit baby, Jugga-lugga-lotus
We the fuckin' shit and you know this, roll with us

Keep it movin', rollin' till it ain't no wheels
Keep it movin', give it time to flex our skills
Keep it movin', you ain't never seen a crew like us
The underground rumbles everytime we bust
Come on man, you ain't never heard of the Carnival Clique
Come on man, we be deep and on some family shit
Come on man, you can try to get as close as you can get
But you never come close to the Hatchet

That's my family, criminals and weirdos
Outcasts and freak shows and members of the carnival
That's my family, wicked clowns and dead folks
And lyrical assassins that'll slash ya throat
That's my family, so put ya hands up
Put ya hands up, put ya hands up
That's my family, keep the hands up
And represent the Dark Carnival for life motherfucker</pre>
