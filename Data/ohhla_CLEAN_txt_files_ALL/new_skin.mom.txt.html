[Tommy Lee]
Now I'm shedin' my skin ya gotta listen
To me I'll tell ya what I see 
Never believe whatcha read the shit
Is spreadin' like a disease
Never feel withdrawn time to move on 
Get your groove on say goodbye
Everything must die solidify and fly to a 
New level A place where love is unconditional

[Tommy Lee]
Like a snake shed my skin 
Leave my past where I've been......
Can you feel what I feel 
To hold on must be killed 
Don't crly over what's been spilled
Can you feel what I feel
Yeah yeah
Can you ? Can you? Feel what I feel
Yeah yeah
Can you ? Can you? Feel what I feel

[Kid Rock]
See the Kid Rock bumpin' up n down your block
With no cares long hair swingin' 
Middle fingers in the air people stare n point
I hit the joint 
And laugh kiss my ass the past is more than 10 years 
I've grownfrom a complete unknown to the hot zone 
Million dollar home and a diamond ring 
Never thought I'd amount to a damn thing
I'm the man sing like Curtis may mack on homies like
Rudy Ray
It's been a long time comin' but you know whats
happenin'
Straight pimpin I'm sittin' five times platinum..

[Tommy Lee] (repeat until end)
Like a snake shed my skin 
Leave my past where I've been......
Can you feel what I feel 
To hold on must be killed 
Don't crly over what's been spilled
Can you feel what I feel
Yeah yeah
Can you ? Can you? Feel what I feel
Yeah yeah
Can you ? Can you? Feel what I feel</pre>
