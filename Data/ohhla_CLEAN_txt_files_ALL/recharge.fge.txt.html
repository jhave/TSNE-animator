"And when you feelin down.. recharge!"

[Wyclef]
Now and, forevers, them emperors, are nova
The lovin, the huggin, will never be over

[Pras]
Back up back up boy, don't get me started
Still the MC, hit the target, you get bombarded yeah
Affect the minds, let the blind evaporate
Let me elaborate, ohhhhh nooooooo (it's too late)
Push the button, cause I'ma get ??
Pass me a SCUD missle, so I can bomb the land

[Wyclef]
Yo Pras (what?)  Yo Pras (what?)  Some start to wonder
Some see lightning, some hear THUNDER
Shades of a black man, maybe the black panther
Makin MC's run when it come to rappin I'm the Darth Vader
I'm not regular, consider me ir-regular
from the regular rapper ones that lumber
But I come from a slum where many bum
Sometimes I cooled out, while my boys were in prison
I always told them that right, overrules wrong
cause ever since a boy mama told me judgment they will come son
So I watch what I do, what I say, how I PLAY
and hope that I make it through the next day
Cause the streets are like a jungle, they got me say
OH-AY-OH-AY-OH, cause Tarzan's a black man
So I'm waiting for a break in the record company
so I could take you MC's, back to camp I mean
Cause with a flick of my wrist, I come rewind another RHYME
I got more rhymes than a church got WINES
Ever since middle school, I used to, rule
The ?? mule, people called my talent beautiful
Never lost a battle, they thought I was buckWILD
?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??
They didn't know that a ReFugee could rock so well
So here's the resurrection, of Pras, Wyclef, and L

Check me or my team as I recharge your body (4X)

[Pras]
Livin to be given, chillin like Bob Dylan
Like Michael I'm Thrillin, I'm not dealin to be illin
Runnin a mask ??, like the task force
The cause is laws, the laws that broke your jaw
now I'm, gettin raw on a thing like a mean machine
(Why you runnin around with the same old thing?
Humm.. you know what I mean, yeah)
I search and search, I start to faint
but never never never fall in entertain
Don't beam me up Scotty, I'm audi like John Gotti
Drivin in black Caddy

[Lauryn Hill]
Success for the next man is success for myself
Vanity's vanity yet I still wanted wealth
I know there's a true God, but it still makes me think
of Yusef.. now is the notty dread dead?
Believe in the Bible because it promise eternity
Six six six, that makes you, my adversary
So I, watch my back and hopin I don't get taxed
I used to, rip the rapper cause they said we'd been said wack
I know what the critics they say, keep it commercial
I used to freestyle, but everything now is rehearsal
I miss the old school, so tell me what will I do?
I guess I'll start a revolution with the Tranzlator Crew, so..

[Wyclef]

[Wyclef]
They label me (WHAT?) the MC psycho
Prim' you up, but don't mistake me for Sunoco
Cuss to get loose, now you got the micro' Joe
Who talkin about hope?  Poquito dinero
means I work hard, but got no money, and that ain't funny
Hey honey when you work for free see it's hard to get a lady baby
But they say good things come to those wait
So I wait, no ego trip, and on the mic I penetrate
Elevate as I battle for high stakes
Many gamble, I eat you like an ANIMAL
cause he gambled for the dime that he didn't have
He woke up in a dream and found his body in a body bag
Wyclef pissed cause, oh what I really said is
is I'm that funky, big up def in pig latin man, hah
A lot of rappers try to outrap, but miss me yo
But I'm askin every teachers everything he know
There's always one trick, to make em slip
So let me predict in pure trick I'm sure the rap form will recharge

	Me lick me one, me lick me one one
	Me lick me one, me lick me one one
	Me lick me onnnnnnnnnnne
	Me come for them alllllllll
	Me lick me one one one, lick bumba rum
	Follow me follow me follow me follow me

Check them style out of Wy and Prazwell

Soldier man... them a fire ??
