[Verse 1: Intellect]
Born on the fourth of february in seventy four, Capital I-Man
Acquarius surviving, survive till 95, a lot shit's changed
They're slowing, fastline, then that's the rain
It's insane, people want it, people flaunt it
They murdered with thugs, decided to bust a move on them
Or a matter of give or take and break burning elevation
Ignite the flight by higher learning, concerning
Granting you abilities like think  
Motions first reactions though instinct
Like blinks of an iron eagle in the cling, do or die
Survivor unknown how it seeps through my third eye
Mentality closed reality before clutch
Radar radius thus far it's too much
Be operating two-four/seven
Try to hit me with the next, I'll be ahead ten seconds

[Chorus]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] In a blink, I listen to my first INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine
Pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT

[Verse 2: Intellect]
Woke up on a Saturday afternoon about two  
With the hangover trying to cut my view
I've got the remedy, damn fool, last night was the bomb
Out with the C.B. crew ALL NIGHT LONG!!!
At the party capacity packing
Everybody seem to be cool like that
Pass the J's as we blaze freestyling in a circle
MC's ripping skills till their faces turn purple
All 'cause their passionalities was in the beginning  
definitely in the house was THA MEXAKINZ
DJ knew what to play, music was thumping
Females in the house put you in the mood for humping
Around like Bobby and Brown with "My Prerrogative" to light up
The spliffs and blunts 'cause once it's how we lived
I admit it, I cranked it, overdid it  
Two thirty in the morning, something told me to quit it
Congregated, my crew done stepped out full of brew
Rolled up mi leño for the thirty minute cruise
Dropped me out by my house, now we in the present stage
Got today's newspaper, looking at the front page
"A Drive-By At Three In The Morning
Kills One", at the same party that I felt the warning
That coulda been me or my homies on the headline
But I guess INSTINCT told me it wasn't bedtime

[Chorus 2]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine
Pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT

[Verse 3: Intellect]
Well, of course tonight, it's the night I'm out with aggression
After what I read that led me to learn a lesson
So I grabbed my nine double M and extra clip
It can't be headline: "Capital I-Man Just Slippped"
Failed out the avenue?  Gotta get my crew
Bumped the oldies, got reunited with the homies
No room for kharma deep in my aerostar bed
Swinging shit like my name was Tarzan and can't
Fumble, soon as we hit this jumble
Tree felt like "Me was George Of The Jungle"
Cruising down the boulevard about the speed limit
Looking for schtookie thinking about digging in it
Wait a minute!
I think I smell bacon right behind me
Which reminds me, you can't trust a pig in the '90s
Try to find thee automobile stolen
I guess because I'm Mexakin and deep is how I'm rolling
In the rear view I see they run a make on my plates
Couldn't find shit in the Jett but I'mma stick to
Fuck with me seeing that I'm clean as a whistle
Except for the moment I'm high and got my pistol
From behind the sween accelerate right up
While they harrass us, luckily they roll right passed us
You never knew could this spot fills too hot with cops
Back to the hood, back to the block, 'cause!

[Chorus 3]
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first instinct
When nothing feels fine
pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I listen to my first INSTINCT
When I've been lost  
Felt I've been crossed
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT
When nothing feels fine  
pop, pop, goes my nine
[Intellect] Not too soon but before I just can't think
[Intellect] I stick with the INSTINCT!</pre>
