You need a lover that's digital

[Humpty-Hump]
You need a tuna fish sandwich

[Digital Underground]
You need a digital lover [x4]

[Money-B]
You need a lover to lick you

[Saafir, (Clee)]
You need a lover like me
Yeah, you need Saafir
(Nah, you need Clee
You would think I'm in the army
Freaks call me major)
See, with me
They have got to pay a fee off the pager
(Grinding my hips)
Finding the tips in detail
Cause I'm a mack
See, I'm cool like that
{I freak like that)
And I freak like that
Cause my b-bong is fat

[Digital Underground]
You need a digital lover
You need a digable brother
Yeah, you need a nigga to love ya</pre>
