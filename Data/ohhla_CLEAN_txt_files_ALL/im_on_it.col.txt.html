Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah, my God, Science

[Chorus]
Lord I've been dreaming about the paper
I want it all
I wanna shine, I wanna ball
I want the whip with the suicide doors
this is my life homie, you decide yours
I've been dreaming about the paper
I want it all
I wanna shine, I wanna ball
I want the whip with the suicide doors
this is my life homie, you decide yours

Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe

I'm bringing that fire, you know that flame throw
I'm getting you high, I spittin' that brown sugar that DeAnglo
just look in the sky
a nigga so fly I'm up here touching rainbow's
aint making it rain though
no don't be silly mama, I'm no pinata
letting my paper fall, no way
but if you feeling it, you can take it all and show me
don't fight the feeling mama
not Jeffrey Dahmer but your body is a killer mama
I'm tryna rock that ass to sleep like pyjamas

I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
my palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause...

Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe

And I'm back with that flame, I got that flow that'll blow your brain
they calling me Cole yeah thats my name
and just like Martin I know that pain
no novacaine and wont complain never
but spit it so hot whenever I drop a verse I change weather
now hey badder I'm dropping that Floyd Mayweather or rather Lebron james
rather so much better than these featherweight rappers I'm ahead of my time
and never pressing rewind
now watch me shine,

I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
my palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause...

Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe

(Watch me shine)
Big plans
(Watch me shine)
Big things
(Watch me shine)
Big money
(Watch me shine)
Big dreams
(Watch me shine)
Big crib
(Watch me shine)
Big screen
(Watch me shine)

I'm tryna shine like
(Watch me shine)

I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it man I'm on it, I'm so on it

I'ma ball hard with the Roc, crossover hit the shot
my palms itching like I just got the Chicken Pox
haters wish they could, bitch, I'm bad meaning good
I live my life like you should cause...

Man, man I'm on it, I'm on it
get on my level I'm hot like, I've been dancing with the devil man
I'm on it, uh uh I'm on it
so in case you aint heard, observe</pre>
