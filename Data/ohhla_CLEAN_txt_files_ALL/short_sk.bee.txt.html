[Baby Beesh]
Come on now, why you wanna do us like that girl
Come on now, got a skirt pulled up to your crack girl
Come on now, I love it when you show us that cat girl
Come on now, later on after barking and chat girl
Come on now, look at you freaking the cage girl
Come on now, now everybody seeing them legs girl
Come on now, you got this whole place in a rage girl
Come on now, can your boy get at least a little page girl
Come on now, let your back break I can't wait
To see you in them high heels, making the track shake
I stack weights, so you know money ain't a thang though
It's Baby Bash, Superman in a Kango

(Chorus)
I like the short skirts, short skirts
I love the boppers in the short skirts, short skirts
Rolling on choppers in the shorts skirts, short skirts
My little mama's in a short skirts, short skirts
And H-Town love the short skirts, short skirts
And California love the short skirts, short skirts
And Arizona love the short skirts, short skirts
And Oklahoma love the short skirts, short skirts
And Sanitone

I walk in the club, in my big black boots
I look around and see em all flock in a group
Dancing in a circle, but I'm slow as a turtle
Cause I be sipping on syrup until my tongue turn purple
I just did a show, for ten thousand mo'
I'ma go buy a diamond for my pinky toe
And if that diamond ring don't shine
I'ma hit somebody baby mama from behind
She get it free, she don't need no I.D. she V.I.P.
Join the booty contest, and walk away with a G
Oh MI-oh-ma, oh ma-oh-MI
She got the shortest skirt in his-tory
I think she's a les, she does what I says
Look how she freaking young Happy Perez
She's the best, she love me even though I'm a nut
Cause I be counting so much cash, I get paper cuts

(Chorus)
I like the short skirts, short skirts
I love the boppers in the short skirts, short skirts
Rolling on choppers in the shorts skirts, short skirts
My little mama's in a short skirts, short skirts
And Colorado love the short skirts, short skirts
And in Chicago love the short skirts, short skirts
And Dallas, Texas love the short skirts, short skirts
And Las Vegas love the, short skirts, short skirts

[Baby Beesh]
I love to see you pop pop, up and down just like a drop top
Whoop wop, mama cita you looking too hot
You shop, as by wild on fire
I ain't gone lie, I wanna play with that tie
Cause I'm a playa by nature, but I'm a hustla by trade
You need to roll with Baby Bash in the Escalade

[SPM]
We big tippers, syrup sippers, bird flippers
I'm the one that bought Cinderella, her glass slippers
Paint drippers, skirt rippers, city slickers
All these fly strippers, just wanna lick us
They kiss us, they hug us, short skirts by the dozens
I done went through all her sisters and cousins

Short skirts short skirts, the Big Apple love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Florida love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Albuquerque love the
Short skirts short skirts, Louisiana love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Alabama love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Kansas City love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Mississippi love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Michigan love the
Short skirts short skirts, and Salt Lake City love the
Short skirts short skirts, and in Seattle love the
Short skirts short skirts, them black girls with a
Short skirts short skirts, them white girls with a
Short skirts short skirts, and Filipinas love the
Short skirts short skirts, sexy latinas love the
Short skirts short skirts, simoan girls love the
Short skirts short skirts, and my colitas with a
