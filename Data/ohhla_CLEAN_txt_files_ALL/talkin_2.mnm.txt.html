[Intro: Eminem]
Aiyyo, before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for bein so patient
And bearin with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe]
Is anybody out therrrre?
It feels like I'm talkin to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from (ohhhh)
Can anybody hear meeee? Yeah
I guess I keep talkin to myself
It feels like I'm goin insane
Am I the one who's crazy? Yeah

[Kobe]
Whoooa, whoooa
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh oh oh oh)
Whoooa, whoooa, whoooa
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh oh oh oh oh)

[Interlude: Eminem]
So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Eminem]
I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin through, growin pains
Hatred was flowin through my veins, on the verge of goin insane
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin
and I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it
feels like I'm goin psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin another pill, tryin to talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lyin to yourself, you're slowly dyin, you're denyin your health
is declinin with your self-esteem, you're cryin out for help

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Eminem] + (Kobe)
Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowin, self-loathin and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (oh-ohhhh whoa)
But I must be talkin to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
inside him; one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin asleep with writer's block in the parking lot at McDonald's
But instead of feelin sorry for yourself do somethin 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
long enough, it isn't them it's you you fuckin baby
Quit worryin 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin goin crazy

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Eminem]
So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
it's different, them last two albums didn't count
"Encore" I was on drugs, "Relapse" I was flushin 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fuckin around
I got somethin to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
signs of slowin up, oh and I'm blowin up all over
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or somethin
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Aiyyo, and to anybody I thought about goin at
It was never nothin personal
Just some shit I was goin through
And to everybody else, I'M BACK! (I'm back!)
