Song:   Party Ain't Over
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party ain't over
It's 3 am and it's too many women
She's just beginning the time of her life
So tell the DJ, j, j, j, j
Turn the motherfucker up, up, up, up, up
Yeah, mister bartender, tender, tender, tender
Pour me another cup, cup, cup, cup,
Get fucked up!

From the MIA, to the ATL, to the world, DALE!

[Beat break]

Party ain't over till the fat lady sings
Or should I see, party ain't over till you so fucking drunk
That that fat lady stand, dale gordita que rica
Catch me like in a fool and a donkey
All in one in regard, yeah they hot, yeah they fire
But even the devil knows I'm hotter
Ay, dios
See me, yeah, 3d, yeah, yeah, with no glasses
Tell the pope to come see me
I got answers, by the masses
I ain't greedy, sharing is caring
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen

[Usher]
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party ain't over
It's 3 am and it's too many women
She's just beginning the time of her life
So tell the DJ, j, j, j, j
Turn the motherfucker up, up, up, up, up
Yeah, mister bartender, tender, tender, tender
Pour me another cup, cup, cup, cup,
Get fucked up!

[Beat break]

[Pitbull]
Joggin women but I'm far from a clown yeah
And doubles and triples I'm knocking em down yeah
So watch who you bring around
Cause next thing you know, I'm turning around
To ashy, to classy, but fuck it, I'm still nasty
I'm like moses, I split the red sea
Baby if you ask me
Oye mamita, ven pa' ca, dale mamita
Dale marcha atras, que te tengo la croqueta bien prepara, pepe billete, ah!
I ain't greedy, sharing is caring
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen
Especially when it's for Sharon and Karen

[Usher]
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party ain't over
It's 3 am and it's too many women
She's just beginning the time of her life
So tell the DJ, j, j, j, j
Turn the motherfucker up, up, up, up, up
Yeah, mister bartender, tender, tender, tender
Pour me another cup, cup, cup, cup,
Get fucked up!

[Beat break]

Show off and shut it down
Bartender send another round
We ain't leaving till the party's over

[Usher]
The party ain't over, the party ain't over
The party ain't ooovveerrr
It's 3 am and it's too many women
She's just beginning the time of her life
So tell the DJ, j, j, j, j
Turn the motherfucker up, up, up, up, up
Yeah, mister bartender, tender, tender, tender
Pour me another cup, cup, cup, cup,
Get fucked up!</pre>
