Them other girl you done been wit
None of 'em got nothin on me
Ain't got my style, they ain't got

Stop lookin for, lookin for, (stop, stop) I'm the (ONE!)
Stop lookin for, lookin for, (stop, stop) I'm the (ONE!)

[MJB - Verse 2wo]
Lemme break it down if you don't get it
Quality, I'm custom fitted

[Drake]
UH-OHHHHHH
Okay, I got these girls fight hype
Only thing on right now like a nightlight
While my brother Wayne rockin out like The White Stripes
I'ma kill the game, I'm the Young Money white knight 
Yeah - plus I'm lookin for the right type 
Cautious of the flood so I always lay the right pipe 
West put me on the mark-et flight life 
Plus I go HARD for the woman that I might wife 
I put the ring on her index finger
So if you wanna keep ya girl please don't bring her 
I bet I'm the type of guy she got a thing for 
and you would block/wood block me, but this ain't Jenga 
Yea, and she's someone I would work with 
That's what I can tell what she's showin on the surface 
I ain't sayin I'm requestin anyone that's perfect 
but I just need a woman that'll make it all {WORTH IT}
 
[Chorus]
 
[MJB - Outro]
Na-na-na-na-nah...

It's that na-na-na-na-naaaaah..
It's that na-na-na-ba-naaah...
I'm the one-one-eno-on-{ONE}
I'm the one-(eno)-one-(eno)-one
(Oh, y'all ain't ready of this one)
(Y'all ain't ready for this one!)
I'm the one-one-one-one-one
WHOOOOOOOO~! Another one, Rodney
That's girl's number one, finally standing up for herself sayin...
She's the one</pre>
