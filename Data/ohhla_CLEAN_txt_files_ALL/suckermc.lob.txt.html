[Stoned Soul]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
He asked me to say some MC rhymes
I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was def and it went this way
I took a test to become a MC
Orange Krush became amazed over me
Took me inside of his cadillac
The chaffeur drove off and we never came back
Cut the record down to the bone
Now they got me rockin' on the mi-icrophone
Takin' autographs, tears and laughs
Champagne, caviar and a bubble bath, but see

[Stoned Soul]
That's the life that I lead
Sucker MC's is who I please
Take that move back, catch a heart attack
But there's nothing in this world that all would ever lack

[Everlast]
Chillin' at a party, b-boy stance
Rockin' on the mic, make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a dove, come from up above
Rockin' on the mic, you can call me E-Love

[Lordz Of Brooklyn]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, we hit you with the one two three, three to two one
My name 80-M, you can't make 'em run
We do it in the place with the high's and the bass
Rockin' to the rhythm, writing graph on the trains
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MC's, boy, you sad face clown
You a five dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You's a sucker MC and you're my fan

[Stoned Soul]
Got a big long caddy and I lack a Seville
And a written on the side is 'dressed to kill'
So if you see me cruisin' step aside
Ain't enough room for you all in my ride
It's first comin', a first serve basis
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind, and for delight
You sucker MC's, you just ain't right
Cause you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on the wife
You're walkin' round town like a hoodlum with a knife
Hangin' on the ave, chillin' with your crew
And everybody know what you've been through

[Stoned Soul]
That's the life that I lead
Sucker MC's is who I please
Take that move back, catch a heart attack
But there's nothing in this world that all would ever lack

[Everlast]
I'm dressed to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC, you know, who's versatile
Got good credit in your regards
Got my name, got numbers on my credit cards
I got Uptown, I come back home
Just me, myself and my microphone
Just me, myself and my microphone
Me, myself and my microphone

[Stoned Soul]
That's the life that I lead
Sucker MC's is who I please
Take that move back, catch a heart attack
But there's nothing in this world that all would ever lack</pre>
