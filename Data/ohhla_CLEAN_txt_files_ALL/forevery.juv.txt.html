[Wacko]
Yeah, U T P nigga, come on!  K L C nigga, come on!  Holla!

[Verse 1: Wacko]
I done tightened up on my G dog
Wacko outcher flippin' these hoes like see saws
Ya man trippin'? Girl, look we can creep on
Ya friends stressin' too, I'll flip all 3 of yall
Respect my steez, I ain't really bout fallin in love
I travel too much and Baby sling too many drugs
Stay in the wrong place at the wrong time
With 2 bricks,(two of 'em) and a chrome 9
To these niggas I'm easy to be provokin'
Look, I got 1 in the chamber and I been smokin'
Don't make me proceed
I'll hit you from ya neck to ya knees
Have ya gaggin' where ya barely could breathe
But I ain't in here for this
Whoadie, I'm in here to get me a bitch
Bring her back to the telly to issue some dick
Hook up with Juve and Skip, go get me a brick
And get ready for next Sunday, to snatch a new bitch

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
[Juvenile] You can have an ole' lady
[Skip]     But them hoes
[Wacko]    They for everybody

[Juvenile] Let her go dog, that ain't ya hoe dog
[Skip]     Let me get broke off
[Wacko]    In this jump off!

[Verse 2: Skip]
I done tightened up on my G dog
I was ducked out at first but now I beat broads
Cock back, BAM! Bash in her teeth, AWW
Guarantee you this, that bitch gone see stars!
Respect my gangsta
I see you looking mad and I ain't 'cha
I know +50 Cent+ and bitch I ain't no +Wanksta+
And I don't get down like that
In the right time, at the right spot
If you try to buck, you gone get shot
Hey fella, calm down. I know what ya thinkin'
But I got 1 in this chamber and I been drinkin'
Don't make me proceed
Spit in ya face, bastard ya seed
Widow ya wife, you don't need my shit in ya life!
Especially how I'm feeling tonight
If it was good, it'd be different
But it's not, so it's not, so let's end it!
And bring this shit back to business
You can have yo bitch dog
I live by the rules I'm givin'

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Come on, come on, come on
Grab yo bitch my the arm cuz if she stop she hit
Oh, I know how to get 'em, I hit her with lotsa dick
The simple things I'm knowing that she probably miss
And in return, she going out and buy me shit!
I hope my adversaries is listening:
Motherfucka with tryna be eased from these D-vils
Cuz we evil in this!
I'm not about to waste my cream on a bitch
I be outcher tryna get money, while she scheming for dick
I ain't gone lie, if my ole lady leave a nigga, I'm sick
But fuck it, we ain't married, so she ain't got nothing to get
I had to go in fronta the jury January the 6th
I promise, ya Honor, I ain't been doin' the shit!
They just like to keep niggas like me in a mix
And use it on TV and radio as a skit
Wanna see some masks, move to the bricks
But before you make that move grab the tool and the clips
Ya heard me?

[Chorus]

[Juvenile] Let her go dog, that ain't ya hoe dog
[Skip]     Let me get broke off
[Wacko]    In this jump off</pre>
