[Verse 1]
If scars was tattoos with better stories
So much trauma scribed on my melon mob you liable to find tribal design tumors
That contain best selling novels, so much pain cursed my adolescence
That I can count my outer blessings on one hand
I was shook to the bone when informed of the three slugs you took to the dome
Just slammed and broke the hook to the phone
Teared up and let a couple trickle
Before retaliation could start cops knocked him and slammed him with a double nickel
Twelve years later stil not complacent tools
I cock I'm pacing impatiently awaiting to snap off for obvious reasons
Grew up with G's who's hobby is squeezing, hell probably is freezing
Peep said it'd be a cold day before we part
Yeah you prone to violence, just not to start provoking acts
You was smarter folks than that, especially to lose your life
Over a Starter coat and hat, I'm stil heated so what
Your pain is my pain, until the world blows up

[Chorus 2X]
(Til the world blow up) I remain the same no matter life's obstacles
(Til the world blow up) I will shine for us all if it's quite possible
Til God calls me home and the caskets closed
And no longer can serenade my dogs with these classic flows

[Verse 2]
We were both raised studying rhymes and scriptures and the street rules to the game
And the game deeply embeds and tarnished jewels on your brain
The ghetto reflects us, from doo-rags to school metal detectors
To earning what you rightfully deserve is irrelevant
Cause now we only settle for extras, if not then jumped up charging
Got affiliates that shot at slumped up sergeants
Just to avoid trumped up charges, kept my head stern
Focused on these bars when you was knocked in arrest burned from ???
Funerals became annual, we all studied from the same rule book
And stil lost numerous to the game's manual
Supreme has the power, any dirt when added up
And multiplied by 7 equals the Grapes of Wrath is sour
For all I know you might hate me, cause I ain't been able to write
or send you a kite lately Just getting my mind right
so I can walk through this life straightly
And live see my little girl grow up
But you stil my dog until the world blow up

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 3]
Until I see if the price of the happiness your deserve is cheap
As long as you embed these words deep
And can cinematically see the world from a worm's eye view at a bird's peak
Life occurs blurred, bleak sometimes but regardless of how sour the Kool-Aid is though
It could stil be stirred sweet, there ain't no guarantees
Except that them taxes in a world that attacks tactless
But Imma get full access to its axis
And take the weight of the world off your shoulders and put it on my back like atlas
The incompatibleness of me and your moms
Is something that we deny greatly, we ain't eye to eye lately
The concept of not being there to guide you through life safely
Is the reason me, myself, and I hate me irately
We love each other but after mating the result is the pitas of a queen stinger
And stil our dear relationship goes swing slinger
Before death had a chance to do us part
Fate had flipped us off with the ring finger
And that's the reason deaths celebrated and birth's mourned
But Imma always love you first born
From diapers until you casket bound with black skirt on
Til the world in your beautiful eyes stops spinning and blows up and the earths gone

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
