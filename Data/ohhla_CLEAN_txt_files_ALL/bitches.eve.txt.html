Uh,Uh,Uh,Uh,Uh

My bitches my bitches that'll  change the locks
My bitches my bitches that'll cut up your clothes
My bitches my bitches that'll steal your stash
My bitches are bold my bitches are cold
My bitches my bitches that'll smuggle your drugs
My bitches my bitches that'll hold you down
My bitches even when you out of town
My bitches is smooth my bitches is real
My bitches my bitches that take care of they kids
My bitches my bitches that you don't respect
My bitches my bitches that you always neglect
Yall niggas ain't real yall niggas ain't shit
My bitches my bitches let his ass go to jail
My bitches my bitches don't post none of his bail
My bitches my bitches teach him how that shit feel
Don't except his calls don't send him no mail
My bitches my bitches that'll fuck out your brain
My bitches my bitches that'll take the pain
My bitches my bitches that'll play the game
Ya'll niggas is weak ya'll niggas is lame
My bitches my bitches that'll stay in school
My bitches my bitches that can keep a job
My bitches my bitches that can raise the kids
My bitches are strong my bitches will live (echoes)</pre>
