I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go

I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
Let me see ya go left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
I do the fat man stomp

If you ain't it's cool, tell 'em
But I'm a just show you what you gotta do
Just pick up your right and then your left shoe
And stomp, ha, stomp, ha
But make sure you keep your rhythm right, tell 'em
Cause if you used, ? step on some shoes
They be mad at you like you's a crazy fool
But you gotta do what you gotta do
And then stomp too

I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
Let me see ya go left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Do the, I do the fat man stomp

	[Cotton Mouth]
Hey y'all, it's Cotton Mouth
It's that fat motherfucker from the dirty south
And I fuck up the floors all through ya house
Make you bounce that baby, wanna kick ya out
Got a little dance called the fat man stomp
Guaranteed to get your ass up and crunk
This dance ain't for the slim and young
It's only for the folks that wanna have fun

I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
Let me see ya go left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Do the, I do the fat man stomp

Ladies and gentlemen, don't get it confused
It's the fat man stomp for you and you
Feel the whole world move to the heavy groove
Get off the wall people, what you gotta lose
In case the club just can't handle the bass
Of the worldwide jam that's rocking the place
Just stomp, stomp
And let them know that you still get crunk

I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
Let me see ya go left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Do the, I do the fat man stomp

I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go
I say go fat boy, go fat boy, go, go fat boy, go fat boy, go

I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
I do the fat man stomp, whomp, who-who-who-whomp
Let me see ya go left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Left to right, left to right, left to right, left to right
Do the, I do the fat man stomp</pre>
