[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Three weeks out and it's two back in
Sporadic at that, niggas stay hustlin
Six weeks out, HOJ's on the rizzoll
Three weeks out, only thirty-one sizzold
Uh, I never break down and fizzle
God made Pooh out of a whole 'nother mizzold
It's old, stop askin me about BET
MTV showin niggas love, homie that's that
Uh, I ain't gon' say it again
Every time we step out, I expect to win
Rapper Pooh on his G till the motherfuckin end
Pick up the phone, tell a muh'fuckin friend, nigga!

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, I'm on my G, on my G

Yo, I'm on my G, on my G
Yo, I'm on my G, on my G

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Blah, blah, blah, niggas talk like they want it
Blah, blah, blah, niggas talk like they done it
Run it, I know it's more money to get
I'm at the bottom of the pole and I'm content with this shit, nigga!
Uh, I'm still honing my craft
A lot of muh'fuckers hate, thank you for the laughs
Lukewarm, somebody's big ass
Drunk off emotion, man up 'fore you crash
Life's about what happens in your dash
Live for tomorrow, no regrets for your past
I'm on the floor, too close to bitch ass
I ain't tryna talk bidness, fall back bitch ass
Yeah, I ain't gon' say it again
Every time we step out, I expect to win
Rapper Pooh on his G till the motherfuckin end
So pick up the phone, tell a muh'fuckin friend, nigga!

[Hook: Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, I'm on my G, on my G
Yeah, I'm on my G, on my G
Nigga, what? I'm on my G, on my G
Uh, yes, I'm on my G, on my G

[Outro: Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, I'm my muh'fuckin G yo
Yeah, Big Dho starring the motherfuckin commissioner

I got my nigga Doovie in this motherfucker
C Sams, O-Dash, my nigga Young, nigga BJ, Uncle Joc
Yeah, I'm on my motherfuckin G nigga
I don't care how many muh'fuckin records we sold nigga
