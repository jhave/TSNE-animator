Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Young money pust that on the beat hoe
Walk up on this bitch with a hundred grand
Two rollies on my arm another hundred grand
Bitch let the money burn nigga no tan
Got a young bitch fuckin doin what she can
Pop it up king kong killa'
T raw the real deal put it on manilla
Make a bithc pop (pop)
Pills 'till it's dinna'
She'll fuck a nympho that's why I fuck with her (ha)
Put some white twirk pussy singles
All up in the club throwing up middle fingaz
If you dry snitch turn a bitch to a hangar
Let yo shit down now you plankin' (you plankin') I am saying

Ah, one two and the bitch came break a bitch hard pouring out the champaign
Why you over there chilling with the lil' lames
You ain't know you, ain't know, that my shit bangs?

Pop it bitch
Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
One two and the bitch came pop it bitch
Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
All these hoes know my damn name

she dont give brain that's a damn shame
I don't find this shit funny like "soul plane"
Put ice on my wrist like shit is sprained
I'm just ridin aroud gettin, two chain last cane YMC and Gan
Heard they ain't dope bitch with another cane
Bitch say I'm the bomb, home made
Know the pussy up, tear it to the sex game
Row 8 make the bitches in they gag for they yak
She goes spaz make a scene like she act (act)
Stupid take a cab oh you broke? oh yo bad?
I don't cuff hoes they just follow my command I'm saying

Ah, one two and the bitch came break a bitch hard pouring out the champaign
Why you over there chilling with the lil' lames
You ain't know you, ain't know, that my shit bangs?

Pop it bitch
Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
One two and the bitch came pop it bitch
Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
All these hoes know my damn name

Lift that ass up (up, up)
And bring that ass down (down, down)
Bring that ass up (up, up)
Shake that ass to the ground and then

Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
One two and the bitch came pop it bitch
Pop, pop, pop, pop it bitch [3X]
All these hoes know my damn name
You ain't get brain that's a damn shame</pre>
