[Silkk--Whispering]
Wassup
Its time, bitch
Where you from? 
I represent
Casket ridin bitch
Fuck off

[Silkk the Shocker]
I'm from that land of the gun slangers
So I get up early in the morning 
an exercise nothin but my gun finger, my one finger
I ain't no big ol' nigga but I still get paid
That's all I need is my trigger finger to squeeze the mack (Bloom!)
I'm layin niggas dead in the bushes
These niggas be comin up short I gives a fuck 
(What are they?) A bunch of rookies
Nigga, it's time to go, it's time to flow (It's time to ride)
Nigga I hit yo' block, it's time to go!
Nigga I'm from the land where niggas they shoot (Uptown!)
Niggas ain't all bout that talkin, we down to do shit
When it's time to ride best believe I'm gon' ride
An if you on the wrong side, it's on, down to die

Chorus:
I represent
I represent
I represent (Where you from nigga?)
I represent
I represent
I represent
I represent
I represent
I represent (Bout gettin mine)

[Silkk the Shocker]
I'm up early on the dope spot
3rd Ward nigga, I stay hard, nigga, I do shit (Watch yo' back)
Best believe nigga I stay hard
If I'm in that Bay, nigga its Rich-Town
If down South, nigga, the 3rd Ward
I'm best at bein a hustler, I'm all about my mail
Be on the block wit the crack rock, tryin to get most mail
Whole sale if I gots to, chopper close
cuz niggas be tryin to show stop us
But nigga I be some real niggas thats down to ride (TRU!)
A project full of niggas who down to die!
What the fucks next?  What the fucks up? 
I roll thru yo' block nigga, an post up
An stand up on yo' set, bitch
You step outta line, thats when the Teck's gon' hit ya (Bloom!)
Split yo' ass in half, like a tree
Chop you, an box you down, an smoke you like some bitch</pre>
