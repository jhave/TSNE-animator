Pass me the bottle

[Chorus]
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Verse 1]
Forget about love I like thongs and tattoos
Peggy Sues and boots, high heel stiletto shoes
I don't miss my ex, I like JB &amp; Crown
I hit my boy scotch when that Jack ain't down
And no late night drama, no time to think
It's last call, 10 minutes, it's time to drink
I'm all smiles and hugs, Strip clubs I'm kinda twisted
It's 2 am and I'm still double fistin (you know)
You can have your man I got Britney and Hannah
A New York girl and one from Alabama
And you miss me now, but Kelly's on my mind
Oh I might call Heather just to pass the time
You didn't like my ways so now I'm livin it up
Totin up and showin up keep filling my cup
I may, I may not, say whatever you say
I got my cure right here I'm gonna drink you away

[Chorus]
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Verse 2]
10 P.M. call my boys, grab the jack, let's roll
There's no worries tonight and no cares, so let's go
Cuz I met a nice girl, I think her name was Tammy
I tipped her 20 bux, got to feel her fanny
For a good five minutes, thought it was true love
Til I realized I was in the elks club (what)
I'm single now so come sit on my lap
I got 5 more dollars in my baseball cap
I don't miss my girl now, hey baby where you goin?
She had thick thighs, half her ass was showin
It's just me and my bros in limos and live shows
Throwin them bows love comes and then it goes
And I told you, no bluffs, it's all true
Now it's Babydolls, Cheatas and Déjà vu
And my mind's over you more and more everyday
But in the meantime I'ma drink you away

[Chorus]
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Verse 3]
A city kid in a different world
But I fell outta love with that country girl
No headaches, heartbreaks, it's just drinks and bottles
I went from country girls to dating plus size models
(?????) cold brews, booty calls and malls
And big balls and big drawers in the bathroom stalls
And now I'm clubbin, lovin them girls with ass cracks
Lips waxed and girls with the damn the big racks
I'm done with you and it's back to straight gin
And I'm cussin you out with a half drunk grin
And I'm lovely cuz it gets no better
I'm fully fueled up when I wrote this letter
I'm writing goodbyes, it's no ties and no lies
Blond hair and blue eyes, kiss my ass goodbye
I'm back to the bar cuz my therapy's there
6 drinks later like I don't even care
Cuz I

[Chorus]
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

[Chorus]
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away
Pass the bottle cuz I'm too messed up
I'm gonna fill my cup I'm gonna drink you away

You away</pre>
