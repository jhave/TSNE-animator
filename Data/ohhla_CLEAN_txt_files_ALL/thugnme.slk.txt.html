[Master P]
Keep your head up boo,
Girl feel me, and if you love me, you gon' love me till they kill me
Girl feel me, girl feel me, I'm a thug, but love me till they kill me
Girl feel me, feel me, I'm a thug, but girl, love me till they kill me
Feel me, girl feel me, and if you real, you gon' love me till they kill me

Your friends try to tell you bout the things I do,
They say I'm just too damn hard for you,
All your friends think I'm just too thuggish for you,
But I can do what no other man can do

[Silkk]
Look
See
Wanna let this thuggish nigga in?
Scared of the life, that I lead
Can't change addicted to smokin' weed,
Can't change addicted to havin' g's,
See, you wait patient knowin' you could be draped in gold
I can't deny, me an' you go together, like daytons, and vogues
It's hard to find a true girl, that's a soldier
See when I was in jail, you come see me
When I was at home, you come over
And see, you don't like to gamble,
But this one you can win
Knock knock on the door
Knock knock once more
This thuggish g's in

Chorus:
It's just the thug in me, girl
They say I'm making too much cash
It's just the thug in me, girl
They say I'm living much too fast
It's just the thug in me, girl
Your friends say I'm just too bad
It's just the thug in me, girl
Your people hope this thing wont last

[Master P]
Girl feel me, girl feel me
And if you real boo, you gonna be there till they kill me
Girl feel me

And you were just too damn ghetto for me, (Girl feel me)
All my friends thinkI'm just too good for you 
(But if you love me, be here till they kill me)
I always think of ways to be with you (Girl feel me, or love me till they kill me)
Oh baby

[Silkk]
I guess it's just this thug livin'
Got so scared, don't give me a hug
Don't let your guard down, till one day, you might fall for this thug
Pendin' the chances tryin' to get rich
You don't even much trip
But you get mad, when I call, females a bitch
When I first met ya
You were so, ha, scared to react
But now when there's drama, you talk about step back
And pass me the strap
It's so much pain, in this game
When I close my eyes
I'll be mad at the world, sometimes I take it out on your thighs
Now I wanna change
But I can't stand being broke
So if you wanna be there for me,
Just sit back maintain, and cope
