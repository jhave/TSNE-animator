Verse One: Lone Ninja

Man the barricade the clans clash for savage reign
Laugh at pain I slam, blast with hand grenades 	
Palace raids,and we march in the king's quarters
Brandish blades very harsh and we bring torture 	
Extreme slaughter when we ravage, slay  ya
You scream in horror from the graphic nature			
The Lone Ninja my foes withered in 
The snow blizzard for those wicked I am most vicious		
Gross grimness, the chessmen bash
Wrote sickness, with pen and pad			
We search in your lair and killing ruthless
Reverse engineer and stealing blueprints			
I'm slashing, I'll slice ya get stabbed with the fangs 
Of the viper we craftsman of hadron collider 
The fast iron fist will bury your henchman
The mad scientist with plenty inventions 			

Chorus: June Marx

Display,
The plan from the start to the finish
Invade,
Scam, raid, rob and pillage
Portrayed,
The game is a fascade and a gimmick
Betrayed,
Man created god in his image 2x

Verse Two: June Marx 

Its the lawless apprentice embark upon a foreigners village
To target the heart and the spirit
The marxman prolific, the tracks I provide
Is the point where matter and anti matter collide
I'm the bastard that's despised, by backstabbers
Challengers and spies
Watch wires and the cameras they hide
Surpass them I'm obliged, jog thru land and swam rivers
Marx is brutal and vicious spark your neuro transmitters
Scan fingers, hire terrorist cell for favor
Death threats beheadings repell a traitor
To rebel is in my nature, the particle accelerator
You horrible I'm remarkable excell greater
The end is near, the iron fist hit harder
Engineered by scientists on the swiss border
Firepower will bloody your foolish infantry
Light sour and studying super symmetry

Chorus 2x

Bridge: June Marx

From the psalms to the scriptures
Man created god in his image
Read upon your palms and your fingers
Man created god in his image
Dissolving the law for the sinners
Man created god in his image
Don't believe them its a con they're against us
Man created god in his image</pre>
