Song:   Imagine
Typed by: Nlmttnkdwg@aol.com

Imagine making it big in this rap game
And you think it's all good
I'm here to tell you it ain't baby
You got every eye in the world on you
You gotta understand these people fear what they don't know

Chorus

Imagine life with no jails and no laws
And no harassment on brothers in fancy cars
Now why they wanna trap me, make me a slave
They just mad cause a ghetto nigga break bread x2

[C-Murder]
I'm on the ground cuffed up like a dog
Said my cuffs too tight, but they laugh when they see me fall
I guess my skinss too dark for them to hear me
I know they don't like me, for some reason I think they fear me
Quit tripping on my chains and my rangs
I want to hit em, but I didn't cause I maintained
They got me FED's on the scene and they sware I got the cream
And the stolen truck green, canine all up in my jeans
They don't realize I'm a soldier
I had a pissed, ask your son, I know he gotta C-Murder disc
Number one in every record store
Mom and pops tap my phones, but you know I aint slangin rocks
Take me to jail but I tell em take me off the scene
My first call go to P, he put my mind at ease
You told me not to trip cause it's a bigger picture
And if your tank don't put it on TRU, I'm a come and get ya

Chorus

[Mac]
Woah, picture life without the crooked cops and without the cell blocks
Would you sell rocks, or would you be like me, I'm shell shocked
And I went through stressin (why), cause I'm already strapped,
bulletproof vesting
Waiting to be tested by the devil on that level
I used to sit on the porch with my uncle Ben
And I watched the murder scene when I was 13, dad, why they come for me
And it made me crazy, and it made me lose my mind
And from time to time it crossed my mind
What if there wasn't a crime 
Now Slim, would you kill for me and everything that's true for me
If there was no law, and nobody was superstars
No state trooper cars to follow, you wouldn't have to swallow
Your rocks, so toss the glocks with the hollow
I would kill a rich man and drink his blood, would it bring me riches
Or would I just be selling my soul to them wicked witches
We already in babylon, the world is a ghetto and God is like the don,
nigga wooooah

Chorus 

[Soulja Slim]
Now we get only get one minute to pray and a second to die
Could you picture the darkside before I let these bullets fly
From out my 4-5 see, I know what you mean
Is it life or that imagine living life with no breath
My imagination's a motherfucker with a bullet stretch
Too much killing, I won't supply the world with a vest
But that's impossible, killing its unstoppable
As long as they got bullets and guns they got niggas thats droppin em
Real niggas from that ????? the world that's all about
Real niggas we won't have a reason to kill niggas, heal niggas
My plane it runs so deep I'm a share it with yall
While my own niggas is trying to cut throat while I'm tryin to ball
Dog, you aint never seen what I seen what I seen</pre>
