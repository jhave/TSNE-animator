[Verse 1]
The night was still young, she felt like a million bucks
Leaving behind the pain and the building blocks
...Blockin' the sunshine mockin' the young minds duckin' from one time
...To fly the nest and try the next
Leave it all, set out on her private quest.
Not really sure what she lookin' for, but like
She knows that there must be more to life
Too many things tryin' to control her life
Like the career that she know ain't right
Or like the boyfriend that told her lies
Or her jealous friends. Yo it's only right
That I'm gone tonight. I wasn't meant to be
Trapped like this physically and mentally
Only thing I'll miss a be my family
But I'm on the right path so don't cry for me.. Cus I'm

[Chorus]
Lookin' for love
And you are - Lookin' for love
We are all - Lookin' for love...

[Verse 2]
One love, one aim - different name, different city
Same old shitty pollution. This kid he sees no other solution
But to leave with the last train
He's tired of the fast lane and the acid rain
The massive pain that we all feel at times
But nobody else understands when we feel it. Why?
No sympathy, no empathy, no love in the city, no identities
He went to sleep. When he awoke the next day
Lookin' out the train window he sees he's halfway
To the Promised land, and face to face with a young woman
Ey, what's that song you hummin'?
It's the new Looptroop - lookin' for love or something
Oh, I ain't heard it yet. Is it hot? Yeah, bumpin'
Can I hear it? Alright. Exchanging looks
Listen, it's just coming up to the hook.. and I'm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The night was still young, their lives were still young
And who knows - they just might fulfil one
And others' needs over this butter beat
It's a bitter sweet little lovers' theme
Cus some find love around the corner
Some never find it though they travel the four corner
Of the earth, but for what it's worth
I'm sure it's out there - I'll continue to search.. cus I'm
