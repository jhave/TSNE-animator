[Otis]
I'm alone, I'm holding my chrome
And I have become
The only one that sees what is really there
I hate that I'm scared, but who really cares?
I tell 'em and for me all they have is blank stares

And I can just see it now, me jumpin' off the stage right into the crowd
I beat the shit out of a kid and when I got backstage
I licked the blood off my hands that I took from his face
I start to thinkin': why did I just do that?
I got a demon on my shoulder, ain't no monkey on my back
And this demon's with my now, she's writing these rhymes
And only time will tell if I can put her in hell
And it's swell
People tell me I'm so lucky
Six of the hottest bitches waitin' to fuck me
And I feel pathetic
And the thing's that's odd - maybe another vicodin will bring me closer to God

[Chorus - 2X]
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
Just cannot - Get ahold of myself
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
I have lost control of myself

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm afraid of the dark and I'm afraid of the light
And I'm afraid that I might've killed a motherfucker last night
I don't know, I'm just somehow bloody
Feels like I just stuck somebody
Bad dreams, I'm crippled in the forehead
I gotta be. It takes up a lot of me
You probably need a lobotomy (right)
Lookin' in the mirror I scare the shit outta me
And I finally can't afford no pills
Layin' in the dark, sweatin' out night chills
Night spills into the dawn
Blood spills into the lawn
I don't wanna go any place anymore
Don't nobody care about a dumb dead shitty whore
It's just me, myself, and I
At war with each other until we die

[Hook]

[Otis]
You, you belong to me (it's just me, myself, and I, at war with each other until we die)
I forever own your sanity (it's just me, myself, and I, at war with each other until we die)

[Bonez Dubb]
I feel it in my chest and I can't breathe
Don't know what the fuck I need
I try to take all my pills, til they all was gone
It's just me and myself don't really get along
I feel it in my head and I can't see
Start trippin' when the world comes fallin' on me
I got a pain and it spreads through my head
Make friends? Man, I'd rather just kill you instead
And then nothin' -
I'm gonna be alright
If nobody takes me out than how can my own mind?
I'm gonna fight this, I'm gonna get somebody close
To keep me out of comatose
But then it starts up
I try takin' a breath
Please, God, keep me away from death
My life, I cant see bein' a very long ride
Insanity won the fight so I'll die tonight

[Chorus - 2X]
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
Just cannot - Get ahold of myself
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
I have lost control of myself

[Violent J]
Boom! It's been four years of decline
The mind can't exist alone on rewind
But nothin' happens anymore to me
Nothin' that I wanna store as a memory
Livin' alone, hidin' in the back room
Four times a day a run the vacuum
It's dirt outside tryin' to make it's way in
I gives a fuck if you feel what I'm sayin'
I'm over-powered in the head by emotions
A terrifying sadness with panic explosions
I tried prayin', but I conjured a demon
It's head popped outta my chest and started screamin',
"You, you belong to me!"
I tried prayin', but I conjured a demon
It's head popped outta my chest and started screamin',
"I forever own your sanity"
I tried prayin', but I conjured a demon . . 

[Chorus - 8X]
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
Just cannot - Get ahold of myself
I cannot - Get ahold of myself
I have lost control of myself
