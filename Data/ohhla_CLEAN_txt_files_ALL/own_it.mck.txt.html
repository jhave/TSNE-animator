Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Nothing's too much
Words that I live by
And that's just how I do
Do, I do

I'm young right now
But I won't be forever
So I'm a live it up like that's true
You might wanna roll with me too

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I don't mean to brag
But I live a life that most can only dream about
Yeah

So baby come be my dream girl...
Pick a fantasy, and let me work it out
Yeah, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me where you wanna go
What you wanna do
Said we living it like we own it
Said I'm on top of the world
And what I need is you
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it, own it

[Verse 2]
It's never too much
So just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through
Through, come through

You know you're the flyest
They should call you your highness
And call me king cause I'm that Dude
All you gotta do is leave your crew

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Whatchu talking bout?
We run this town
We got it sewn up
Because we own it

Whatchu talkin' bout?
You deserve this crown
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
Because we own it

[Chorus]</pre>
