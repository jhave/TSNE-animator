This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh..
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ask Scott to match the socks, what's in your +Speakerboxxx+
+Pink and Blue+, you're lolly gaggin, you're slow pokin
You got me open, you're playin wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if I need a baker bring's the joy, you're a kiner, the Tyner meanin the real McCoy
I can't wait..

[Sleepy Brown]
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo baby, come on
Got plans tonight (plans tonight 4x)
Anticipated, the love and I'm gone get it
Till the mornin light (mornin light 4x)
Come on baby

I can't wait (the way you love me)
I can't wait (the way you touch me)
I can't wait (I can feel it)
I can't wait (all over me)
I can't wait (come on baby)
I can't wait (please come home)
I can't wait (tonight)
I can't wait (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooo its been too long now baby
Lets seize the night (seize the night 4x)
Cuz I'm gonna take you on a journey
Enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride 4x) enjoy the ride
Up and down (ooo baby!)
Up and down (whoo lady!)
Round and round (take it..)
Round and round (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
Cuz baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
So luscious she's the real deal, but even he gets ancy
Some honeys try to +Kill Bill+ beneath the underpants see
But patients is the virtual to being anxious, just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of nigga's tryin' get in vengeance on a full moon
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin, and contemplatin, she got you sprong dude
Shit, I'm fin to get her might emit her, what you gone do? (wha?)
I tell you what, we wont be fallin for that one, two
Just kinky sex up off in the boom boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace, cuz I can't wait
