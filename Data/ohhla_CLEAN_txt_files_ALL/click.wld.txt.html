[CHORUS] 2x's
Anytime you come to New York City

Even if I catch you in the ride, you robbed
All y'all niggas gonna die word born

[Ms. Cali]
I'm an east coast bitch
Pull, cock, spit
Hot boys shit

Medallions and rings
Bracelets and earrings

[Talking]
Look y'all cats is assed.  Y'all niggas can't rhyme.
How you gone settle on my click.
You can't come to New York, no more.  We see you it's on.
You can't come to Brooklyn,
we'll rob you and send yo ass back in a box.
You can't come to the Bronx,
we'll stomp you the fuck out, muthafucka.
Any one of the bubbles, y'all barred.
You barred from the capital of the world, muthafucka.
We catch you in Jersey, we gone gang up on you niggas,
take your cars and break your jaws.
It's over, see let's get um.
Wild Boyz lock this.  My click in the south, we gone air y'all out.
New York, Jersey, Connecticut,
y'all niggas is disconnected from here.  Holla back.
Mannie Fresh, Juvenile, Lil' Wayne, B.G.,
and the rest of y'all non-rappin' ass niggas.
We gone fuck over all y'all.
Y'all ain't Cash Money, y'all crash dummies.
That's my word, Wild Boyz, east and south connection.
Rest of you muthafuckas stay out my muthfuckin' business,
