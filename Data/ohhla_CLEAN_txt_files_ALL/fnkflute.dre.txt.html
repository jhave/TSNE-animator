[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen as he executes the funky flute
He can play it at a noise so watch him blow it
While I be speakin deep down in your eardrums
How do you like it? So yo wont'cha just come
Closer so you can see who's playin that funky sound
That's goin down and ya sayin that
Jimmy Z is the one you like to see
On the F L U T E yeah

[Bridge: Jimmy Z]
You wanna blow it baby? (Yeah)
You like to blow it don't cha? (Yeah)
Can you take a deep breath? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
The funky funky flute is just what Jimmy gave ya
But witta hip-hop flavour
On ya radio, stereo and your compact
I'm only makin sure you remember that

So just call him the Pied Piper
So I know you wanna see Jimmy Z
