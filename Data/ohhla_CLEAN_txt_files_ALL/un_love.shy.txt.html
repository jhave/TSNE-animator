Yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
It's all real, homeboy (it's all real)
Feel me, yo
Dedicated
To my mother
You heard?
Hold your head
(Lady, hold your head)

[ VERSE 1: Shyheim ]
This is dedicated to the lady of my life
Who gave me life and raised me right
Even if I was wrong in her eyes I was right
We like brothers and sisters, me and my moms we tight
Regardless of the habits she had with the pipe
I had to bail her out, she got locked up last night
We fight sometimes, she sells things that's mines
Programs ain't workin, rehab for the tenth time
My partner in crime, I would cry
Leavin the V.I. as she walked back inside
I remember she died, they brought her back to life
'member no lights, sugar and rice, roaches and mice?
Those were some long nights
We still in a tough fight, but we lookin good in the ninth
My a-alike'll get hype for me, bring your gun upstairs for me
And tell the cops I don't live here when they lookin for me

[ Ray J ]
Mama I told you so
You don't have to worry about it, mama
Now I'm in control
And even if you did act kinda crazy
I'll always love you
No matter what it might seem
I'm always with you
And everything's gonna be alright
Lady

Growin up wasn't easy
She sold the radio, VCR and TV
Took my 3 g's, I used to say, "Ma, please stop"
She said she would but she couldn't so she didn't
Caught her in the kitchen hittin, I started flippin
She bought it off my man Richard
And on the low I heard he was sniffin
I wanted to bring it ot the bisquits, for real, kid
Cause sellin to my mom is some real bitch shit
I can't cry no more, my insides is dry
My heart is gone, my mind is sore, it's Desert Storm
Can't believe I ain't gon' see my twin for four
I'm mad tight, pressure bust pipes
Remember I love you, mommy, if I die tonight..

Mama I told you so

Now I'm in control
And even if you did act kinda crazy
I'll always love you
No matter what it might seem
I'm always with you
And everything's gonna be alright

Aiyo ma
Turn the walkman up (yo yo yo turn it up, turn it up)
Smile when you hear me, you heard (smile when you hear me)
For real (for real, for real)
I sit back and I wonder like damn (yeah)
At all the bullshit in our life (ah-ha)
I still made it, you know (yeah)
It's like - (we made it) damn
You was mad young when you had a nigga though (you were 16)
And..
You experienced a lotta things and went through a lotta things (all in my hand)
And I followed through and went through em too, you know
I love you, mommy (yeah)
