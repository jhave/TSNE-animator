[Intro]
Mira chulo tu me llamas e' Aqui esta mi numero!

The beat don't stop till the panties drop
It don't stop, It won't stop
The beat don't stop till the panties drop
It don't stop, it won't stop

[Chorus]
And you know it just don't stop
And you know it just won't stop
There will be no stoppin' till the panties start droppin
And you know it just don't stop
And you know it just won't stop
There will be no stoppin' till the panties start droppin baby

[Verse 1]
Back in the day when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Cuz I remember crazy summer nights
Sneakin all up in your window just to do you right
Panties wetter than a slip and slide, you trembelin inside
I promise I'll be back tomorrow night, your body's callin`
12-play since the 1st day
Now how can I forget those days
Tellin mom and daddy we was goin` to the movies
Damn girl! If they really knew what we was doin`
I know I probably shouldn't even start to say
But every time I reminisce it brings a smile to my face
Heavy breathin and you wisper baby please don't
Stop, you know I'm on this mission till you hit
That spot, so every time you need someone
To make it hot, you know the beat wont stop
Until the panties drop.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now play this slow jam; I got ya bumpin and grindin' like R.Kelly
With bedroom games poppin off like lingerie parties, (woo!)
Life is lovely, puffin on herb we sippin bubbly
While I rub ya, down with body oils
Tellin all your girlfriends how Ziggy got you spoiled
Kiss you from your lips to the middle of you hips
How about that like from the front to the back
And how does it feel to on your fourth climax
Goin looney screamin' I got 5 on it
Now can make into a carmel sundae with the cherries on top
Painting you with whip cream
You know I want my cake and be able to eat it too
Can ya get the hint, organisms got your heart beating like if its on sprint

Taking off make love on the clouds, now what's the odds
Meetin' at the same spot at the same time

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Are you down to make it hot straight up explicit
Wanna lick on the spot no one else dares to hit
You a nasty girl I'm a nasty boy let me rub you down
Kiss you all around you're the type that will be down
You're that freaky deeky like it kinky like that
What you want what you need insist I hit from the back sayin
"Aye papi chulo baby please don't stop"
As we proceed to make it hot, to the stars at 12 o' clock
Lay back relax let me take you through the motions
My genie in a bottle as I rub you with the lotion
By the ocean, makin love through the breeze
Got you rush climaxing from your head to your knees
Never ending night we both will never forget
A love seen to repeated on that you can bet
Cuz you know it won't be stoppin till the panties start droppin
NBK once again keepin you steady rockin

[Chorus]</pre>
