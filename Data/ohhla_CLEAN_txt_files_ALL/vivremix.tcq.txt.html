Verse 1: Lil' Kim
Uhhh
I'm yo special girl, yo real good girl
Biggest bitch in yo itty bitty world
Comin' up in the ninety-nine, every other word i say
Be part of my rhyme
Catch me outside of the club, smokin' seltzer wit jason
Get my mind fucked up, and my heartbeat racin'
You can call me, your crafty honey
I don't give a fuck, as long as you give me the money
And if you ever violate this, call me a bitch
Or forget to run the ???, You better do your little thang
Mack it around, and do your little thing
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Hook: Q-Tip
It's such a vivrant thang nigga
Vivrant thang, a vivrant thang

Verse 2: Charli Baltimore
You know me nigga, I'm good to you nigga
Sex you up nigga, As long as I see the bank figgaz

Stay mad cool wit these industry niggaz, big dick niggaz
All up in my shit niggaz

But when I hit my next track, All niggaz gon say is OW
