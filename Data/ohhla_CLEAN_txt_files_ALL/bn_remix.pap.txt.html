[Intro: Remy Ma]
That's how we be on the trailor?!

"Bucket na-bucket na-bucket-bucket naked!!!"

[Papoose]
(THIS IS THE REMIX!!!) She got a bedroom body GO SHORTY!!!
She got a bedroom body GO GIRL!!!
She got a bedroom body GO SHORTY!!!
She got a bedroom body

[Chorus: Papoose]
I told her I'm a call her (Bucket) got her on the camcorder
I can't believe I saw her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
As soon as I meet her (Bucket) like a Queen I'm a treat her
'Cause I just wanna see her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)

[Verse One: Papoose]
I like it when she wear the sweatpants right the ass ain't pink
Smell like roses her pussy don't stink
Chew Doublemint gum, she like to have fun
Tatoo on her body earring on her tongue
We the real Bonnie And Clyde
Your girl aight but your girl ain't live
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my ring
She look good in her stay-greens, (Bucket)
But I wanna see her get (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
I like it when she wear them tight jeans, (Bucket)
But I rather see her get (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
She got my name tatooed on her
(Bucket) man I seen her when she get (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
I make her scream I hit every corner
(Bucket) 'cause I like her when she get (Bucket naked!!! UH!)

[Chorus: Papoose]
I told her I'm a call her (Bucket) got her on the camcorder
I can't believe I saw her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
As soon as I meet her (Bucket) like a Queen I'm a treat her
'Cause I just wanna see her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
She was sittin home alone, (Bucket) sippin on Patron
Now she in my cameraphone  (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
She was dancin in the club, (Bucket) she want that thug love
Now she in that bathtub  (Bucket naked!!! UH!)

[Verse Two: Remy Ma]
(THIS IS THE REMIX!!!) 
Download the footage from the phone and to the Mac and make a movie
A master bedroom body and my shit come wit a jacuzzi
He said, "Excuse me miss, your lips is mad juicy"
I said, "It's Mrs. and +THIS+ is Papoose's"
In my birthday suit, he +Wipe Me Down+ - Lil Boosie
And we both Gs', together we make Gucci
You sex-textin, typical groupie
Men are visual, might send a picture of the oochie (Oochie Wally Wally)
I'm his housewife {?} Suji
I be on my dot, Remy Ma's on du-ty
He be callin me papers so people think he use me
No, I give him three holes like a piece of loose leaf
I throw the booty, the food-y is always ready
I'm t-tellin you, B-Becky ain't got nothin on Remy
Don't need KY jelly, everything is all ready
Don't gotta take off my clothes, I'm bucket naked already!!!

[Chorus: Papoose]
I told her I'm a call her got her on the camcorder
I can't believe I saw her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
As soon as I meet her like a Queen I'm a treat her
'Cause I just wanna see her (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
She was sittin home alone, sippin on Patron
And she in my cameraphone  (Bucket naked!!! UH!)
She was dancin in the club, she want that thug love
Now she in that bathtub  (Bucket naked!!! UH!)

[Outro]
UH! Bucket
UH! Bucket naked!!!
UH! Bucket
UH! Bucket na-bucket na-bucket-bucket naked!!!</pre>
