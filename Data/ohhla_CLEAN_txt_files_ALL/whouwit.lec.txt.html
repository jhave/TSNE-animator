[Lecrae]
You know I'm still on a mission, man
I'm still gon be spittin 'til I spill my intentions
and you got saved and was reppin
Then you strayed from the message
Now you stay half-steppin boy it's real
Yeah, people still dyin
Still cryin on the inside, Satan still lyin
Still tryna show the world how coo you is
Ain't' got a clue about whose you is
Get with' the program, let 'em know, man
It's willing to fear, it's never been a show man
It ain't about hot beats and a flow man
But when you go, tell me where you gon go man
Is it the world or Christ? The girls and ice
Five minutes of fame or eternal life? Who you with? Choose correctly
Think who protects me? When I reject him, who accepts me?

[Chorus]
Who you with? Are you in it to win man?
Are you livin in sin or are you livin through him man?
Who you with? Can't walk the fence y'all
It's God or the world 'cause the two don't mix y'all
Who you with? What you need in life?
The world can't give it to you what you need is Christ
Who you with? If you know who you serve
and you roll with the word, if you so sincere

[Lecrae]
A lot of people live for the moment, they want it
Yhey gotta flaunt it, they worship the money and the fast life
You hear 'em on the radio and see 'em on TV
in the sleezy scenes and then they wanna thank Christ
Man, I'm hollerin bump that
I seen it in my backyard
Dudes act hard, but I know they really lack God
Man, dump that
They don't know that God is holy
He oppose the proud, but exalt the lowly
That's why I'm rollin with' Him
My soul is with' him
My treasure's are up in Heaven
Yeah, my gold is with Him
Go with God or just don't go
You either watered down or you just don't know
And I'm a say this straight so you do, man, it's true what they say
Ain't no maps to Heaven
It's only one way
You heard it all of your life
The word is right
If you ain't servin Christ, then turn tonight

[Chorus]

[Lecrae]
I used to be the dude talkin 'bout 'Only God can judge me
You can't tell me nothing man
Jesus love me.' But here I go again with the same ol' sin
The same ol' friends
Comin to the same ol' end
It's like cheatin on a test that you know you can't pass
Still got to face the teacher's wrath after class
No point in doin it
You're ruinin your life
Tryna live it for the world instead of livin it for Christ
I promise there's no extra love for bein bigger
than Fifty, Diddy, and Biggie in the heavens above
If you really like aborigine act it out
Be Heavens biggest promoter
Try to pack it out
You could win you a crown and be down with the team
And know that the bloodstream of Elohim redeems
It's Jesus; I don't say nothing else y'all
You ain't down with him, you ain't down at all</pre>
