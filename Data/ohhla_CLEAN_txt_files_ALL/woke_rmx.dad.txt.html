[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]
Why did you have to be this way
Baby all you had to say
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be
But you planned a great escape
Bright and early before I wake
We both knew we had to break
You could of chose a better way

[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be

[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]
It was cold the way you left
Still the pain is in my chest
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me
If you put away your pride
And look deep into my eyes
It would of been to your surprise
That I got up to apologize
But you were gone

[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be

[Break: Carl Thomas]
Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone
It's time to carry on
I thought that you made me happy
But it's this thing that's come between us girl
At one time you were my world
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away

[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]
(Uhh)I dreams filthy
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin "Bastard!"
Cryin, know my friends is lying
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers
or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

[Chorus By Carl Thomas 4x..music fades out]
Woke up in the morning, you were not there
All I seen was an imprint of your head
In my pillow, weeping willow
Why'd I treat you so bad
I should of known one day that you'd be gone
You should of known one day that I'd be gone
You should of known one day that we'd be</pre>
