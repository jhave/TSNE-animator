[Hook 2X: Buddha Monk]
Dirts the boogie, Dirts the boogie

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Come on, baby, let me hear you jump
Come on, baby, let me see you stomp
Come on, baby, let your body go
Come on, baby, let it flow, flow, flow

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The most amazing, rhyme blazing, smoke that purple haze and
I'm the Ol' Dirt McGazing
After the club, I'm straight up dazing
I fuck til my nuts shiver up like raisins
Everybody just, do my dance
While your girl, she feel my dick through her pants
I'm the Ol' rotten slang, that Wu-Tang mixture
Leave your head to bang, boom bang licked up
Watch the speaker kick up, bitch eat my dick up
Ass stick up, I'mma hit her quicker
Never find a nigga nasty as Dirty
Still fuck a bitch if her ass is dirty
Still sip the Hennessey if the glass is dirty
You ain't getting shit if your cash ain't dirty

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus]

[Boy Jones]
Hit a ho, make her go crazy
Doctor, doctor, she having a baby
(Girl: oh, no, who could it be?)
Out is the son of the ODB
My name is Bar, I'm made like a Maybach car
(Girl: you crazy) What you say that for?
Bar slick with the gift of gab, I throw jabs
(Girl: tell the cop, boy, get your black butt in the lab)
Still got a slab of that welfare cheese
Still get features from government G's
Still looking for a big butt to squeeze
Ol' Dirt, are you gonna give Lil' Dirt a G?

[Hook 2X]

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
