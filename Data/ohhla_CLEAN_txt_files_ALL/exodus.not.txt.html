[All by I Self Divine]

[Verse I]
We deal an exodus first
Physical, mental assert
Worth numerous hurt bruised and killed for minimal work
Nat Turner work off, egg blood type insight
Black stoned out of mind like ganja smoke in flight
Aesthetically pierce, genetically fierce
I'm shattering earth plates and chords whole barriers
Explode the galaxy infinite space
High intelligence, earth negligence, liberational displanes the crucial
Some conflict, it's never mutual
Malnourished to the pupil
My depiction of Zion more fruitful
Queens getting they crowns bent, domestic entrapment
Battered and bruised, nursing they wounds out the cabinet
Free up word shattered and chained
Low self esteem from a parallax view, the youth seen the whole thing
Plus the Philly journalist, shackled in lies and conspiracy
My Shawshank confinement exodus on alignment
My vision of prisons enclosed
Followed to explode violated off government codes
The cycle is cold
What do you envision? as free living
Synthetical crack smoke inhale the suicide then jail
With queens posting bail while intercourse
Climax, ejaculate release chi collapse back escapism
Meditation through ancient religions
I'm clearing the mental of high polarized schism
Exempt restraint
Autocratic rule gets the blade to the artery
Display the artistry
Full, not partially

[Chorus I]
Soldiers all of my niggaz in locked places
Trapped inside braces, careful stone faces
Hold on, release yourself, steady yourself
Move like water freedom is now, pick up the wealth
Soldiers all of my queens with bruised faces
Trapped inside hatred, space and feel vacant
Hold on, release yourself, steady yourself
Move like water freedom is now, pick up the wealth

[Verse II]
You feeling it, no doubt
Extreme like domes blown out
My soldiers fold origami mode, feeling no route
Trapped, in cubicles rocking the suit, nothing suitable
No window view tortuous bamboo through cuticle
No destiny child descension
Through the maze of corporate system
Pay cuts and more workload filling the venom
Ready to spit in the form of three eighty clips, eclipse
Slaving incarnate rage two to commit
Amistad, navigate the vessel second book of Moses
Harried exodus voided of court cases and dates
With trap doors removable floors guided by stars
Mud to the neck, walking with dog, posting with martyrs
Suffering various, severed and shackled them to run straight
Spirit intact we program flight off the runway
Ignite express the sight of breakout
Ethiopian soil for Rasta route, Mecca Islam route

[Chorus II]
Soldiers all of my niggaz in stone taking
Trapped inside making moves with no thinking
Hold on, release yourself, steady yourself
Move like water freedom is now, pick up the wealth
Soldiers all of my mothers with child fainting
Trapped inside anger pain alone feeling
No love, release yourself, steady yourself
Move like water freedom is now, pick up the wealth</pre>
