[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, you know technically
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
(Ahhhhhh-men, ahhhhhh-men)
Yeah! Ha ha, feels good!
(Ahhhhhh-men, ahhhhhh-men)
Woo! Guess I'm lucky, some of us don't get a second chance
(Ahhhhhh-men, ahhhhhh-men)
But I ain't blowin this one, nah man
(Ahhhhhh-men, ahhhhhh-men)
Ha ha, shit I feel like I can do anything now

[Eminem]
Who can catch lightnin in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, flyer than swatters
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug prick, you better flee/flea cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch you to the ground, you're tricked
It's a trap, fuck my last CD the shit's in my trash
I'll be goddamn if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winkin and blowin kisses cause you're flirtin with death
I'm destroyin your livelihood, I ain't just hurtin your rep
I catch a flow and get goin, no remorse I'm showin, ain't slowin
for no one knowin there's nothin you can do about it, zero in
on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva, what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like "WOOO!"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
So you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?
Now guess who? (Hey) Here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife-beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in ya ass (hey) he's in ya ass, he's all up in your psyche too
(Hey, hey) Now, what's his name?

[Chorus]
Cinde-rella, Man, Cinde-rella, Man
Cinde-rella, Cinde-rella, Man
Cinde-rella, Man, Man, Man
If I had a time machine, I'd be
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine, so call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man

[Eminem]
Fuck catchin lightnin he struck it, screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside-down, and made it rain upward
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker, he's the shit right now
He's (Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Cinderella Man, Cinder-fella Shady Dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane, raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore ya with the Cinderella story nor did he
come to do the same ol', can't afford to be
a lame-o in this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly; so say bye
to the old, H-I to the new, Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah, the coup de grâce, raise 'em high
in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient I won't make no more mistakes, shit my
potato's baked homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yeah faggot the steaks/stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and a hair on my nuts I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fuckin irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
And ain't shit you can do but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
and I'm his spittin image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists?
Who? (Hey) Here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife-beater, lost his Nike shoe
It's in ya ass (hey) he's in ya ass, he's all up in your psyche too
(Hey, hey) Now, what's his name?
