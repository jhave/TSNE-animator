	Ayo, straight up and down on the reel to real, if you
	drug abusing child abusers don't get your shit
	right now, your children might grow up like this

He was born in a jail cell, cause his mother was a con
And in his mother's cupped arms was a newborn timebomb
But it wasn't his fault he was in the cageed vault for aggrivated assault
On his eight-year-old sister
As Mr. Daddy stood there, instead he should have dissed her
And now mommy's found guilty
Cause she almost beat her daughter to death for spilling a glass of milk, 
see
Poppa was a boozer, momma was a drug abuser
They were no-win losers
And now Sonny's gotta struggle
And another day of life to him's another day of trouble
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

	The diary of a hitman

Sonny's making money on the norm and you know he's got another job
When you see him with the leather gloves on
He got a look in his eye like he wants to die
Packing the nine double murder near his thigh
10 G's a head, whoever you want dead
Will be filled with lead, and be buried in their own red
He don't sleep at night, cause he's just like an owl
On the prowl and his lifestyle's foul
A self-made boss in the ??? of his moms and pops
Is what really ticks him off
A flashback from the past, dad whipping mom's ass
For the cash, after that she hit the stash
And takes a blast of the trash she was hooked on
And Sonny felt helpless, as he looked on
You gotta live this life for you to try and understand
The diary of a hitman

Sonny got a call from the mob
It was 100,000 grand for my man to do a quick job
The contract was plain and simple
One in the mouth for talking, then two to the temple
The address looked kinda funny
But Sonny didn't care who was there, cause he was in it for the money
He made his way to the crime spot, the victim
With nothing on his mind at the time but to get him
He arrived at 10 o'clock and didn't even knock
He just shot off the lock
And he kicked the door open
Destined to smoke him, nope, Sonny wasn't joking
He made his way up the stairs, and there's
Mommy in tears, and daddy in fears
But he didn't give a damn cause he never had a fam
So now it's time to silence the lamb
Momma took the first three, so now she's living drug free
Cause she's put out of misery
And Daddy's on his knees yelling "Please Sonny please"
But Sonny squeezed
You had to live this life for you to try and understand
