[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, ho!
That's how we do it up here, you know what I mean?
D.P.G.C.'d out boy!

Young Daz, step up on they ass
Give these party people a blast from the past (boo-ya!)
Young Daz, step up on they ass
Give these party people a blast from the past

[Daz Dillinger]
I've been here for years, ran with the best in the game
Diggy Daz, Dogg Pound - you know my gang
Swift as a cheetah, swift with the millimeters
I love it when we click up, I love it when we meet up
A new attitude, I wasn't raised with no spoon in my mouth
I had to bang for the rep, I had to bang for the clout
You better watch out, before you get beheaded
I said it - you ain't no Dogg Pound Gangsta
Diggy Daz just said it, don't ever regret it
Beat you in the head 'til you remember who the king is
Wa-swing, I'll show you what a G is
We in the world where we don't give a WHAT!?
I'm Diggity Daz and I'm a stone cold WHAT!?
You ain't no entity, you're just a pretend-to-be
You ain't no friend to me, rockin' for centuries
Holla my name, you'll see me when I rock crowds
I move the crowd with a click-click pow-pow

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat

[Daz Dillinger]
Here I am, comin' right back outta the cut once more
Party people say "ho!", and check out my flow
And I flip flop and I serve those
Anialate my foes and roll
(party people, you know just how it go)
See flowin' me as I glide, hollow tips when I ride
Only stride for perfection when the party is live
Do what you do girl, you know your body gettin' hotter
Lovin' the way you bouncin' your booty, you know you gotta -
Drop it or stop it, all I need's to top it
This my new shit - go cop it, bang down the block and -
Daz Dillinger more liver than ever
Me give up this gangsta rap rap, homie never
You heard of the Dogg Pound, you know that's my gang
You know of Dat Nigga Daz, you know of my name
So here I come - stompin' in my khaki suit
B.G. for the hood and my cousin Snoop Eastwood

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat

[Daz Dillinger]
Now as Daz break it down with the gangsta funk
I can see and I can tell that's all you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so we can get high
The party don't stop until the clock strike five
Double shot of Tequila when the DJ turn the beat up
You know I'm D.P.'d out, I stay G'd up
I do it to 'em - feelin' you never could feel
Where your mind is calm, where your body is chill
Yeah, you got to feel the realism
Daz is on the mic homeboy, hittin' hard as steel
Cause this is for the Gz, and this is for the Hustlaz
I came to the party, to get up in this mutha mutha
I see the people jumpin', the DJ start the cuttin'
Nobody standin' on the rule, girl move somethin'
So here we go, here we go, round and round, here we go
You can't fade, this 2003, ho!

[Chorus]
(Cause it's all night)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all day)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all night)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all day)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope shit
(Cause it's all day)
We rock the party - all night long
(Cause it's all night)
Til when? - 'til the early morn'
(Cause it's all day)
It don't stop, and uh, it don't quit
(Cause it's all night)
Diggity Daz to rock the cavi dope beat
(Cause it's all day)
(Cause it's all night)
(Cause it's all day)
(Cause it's all night)</pre>
