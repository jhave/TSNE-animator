[Juganot]
I was conceived by a super power who ruled the world with an iron fist
I was discovered by a world renowned scientist
And the plan was to reduce the population of man
By creatin' some type of internal assasin
Blastin' flesh with guns wasn't enough
Not everybody carries burners but everybody fucks
Big bucks invested for the sick twisted
Demented plan that's so diabolical
Forget about guns make the weapon biological
And blame it on niggaz in Africa fuckin' the animals
And spread it through the media there's never been a seedier
Scheme since Genocide and Sickle Cell Anemia
Dreamin' of a way to slay large quantities of minorities
Through a strand of D N A today
Shit's transmitted in all forms
Through bodily fluids or genetically passed on
Even airborne diseases absorb the pores
And stank whores screamin' they want it on all fours
To learn more read European litareture
They put Small Pox in blankets for the poor

Apocalypse now prepare for chemical warfare
The new milleniums here no one who can spare
They lockin' it down so you best to beware
Cuz when it comes to battles these niggaz don't fight fair

Silicone biochips embedded in wrists and foreheads
I'd rather be dead than triple 6 I'd
Rather be split from groin to gullet and spit upon
Then live under the rules of the beast in Babylon
Wars destruction chaos mayhem slayin'
Bodies decayin' know what I'm sayin'?
I'm prayin' for these humans to come around the way and
Act like primates cuz I've been bored all day and
I love seein' silly mortals behavin' like cavemen
Clobberin' and demolishin'
Why do they follow in my footsteps?
I lead armies to victory we'll make history
Can't you see that you and I will coincide
Eternally you've always heard of me but never seen me physically
I feed off of pain and misery and get my vitamins from ignorance
And suck the blood out of innocent babies like I was drinkin' banana Nutraments
What up niggaz?
The name's Pestilence arch nemesis
References in pages of Revelations to Genesis
Steppin' foot on my premises shows a lack of intelligence
Whether or not I exist is totally irrelevent

Apocalypse now prepare for chemical warfare
The new milleniums here no one who can spare
They lockin' it down so you best to beware
Cuz when it comes to battles these niggaz don't fight fair

Before the beginning of time and mankind
A divine light shined
Brighter than nine suns
The holy trinity combined in one singular mind
Mysterious archeological finds and astronomical designs
Warped even the most theoretical man's mind</pre>
