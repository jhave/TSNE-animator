Demons surround me all the time 

[Bizzy - repeat 2X]
Demons surround me all the time 
Demons surround me all the time 
Now pick up your psychic line 
Now pick up your psychic line 

[Bizzy]
Nobody believes 
Nobody believes 
Nobody believes me, even my baby girl 
See I was raised up on that ouija in my crazy world 
Better take it easy 
[Sang]	Outta my mind, outta my mind
	outta my mind, outta my brains, brains 
7th Sign time, in a line, shine, fin to bye-bye, die die, bang bang 
Hit 'em with that woo-woo, and that flip-flop flown-n-low 
Steady as we roll 
Maybe you don't know, oh 
Get away for safety, in a coma like state, invade me 
Everyone say: "Hey, hey, he's crazy" 
Premenitions, kick pushin' daisies 
Wait, they chase to slay me 
Paranoid, mortal to the paranormal, jumpin' out portals. 
Kinetical energy formal in the global get warmer 
Mormons may mourn, may Messiahs be born, torn in the purgatory 
Sworn to violence, silence, word my bond 
Get ya story on, call me, saw me in the army gatherin' in harmony 
Hardly in all we be so salty 

[Chorus]
Demons surround me all the time 
Demons surround me all the time 
Now pick up your psychic line 
Now pick up your psychic line 

[Bizzy]
Talk to the walkin' dead, crossroads, call on the Rev., lost souls 
And I'm off in a coffin' tossin' my memoirs, oh no   
In the closet, come open the door, what do you see?   
A funeral 
Usually closest to kosher 'til I see some loved ones, don't go 
Get it crucial, pick up the psychic line 
Future to before time in the sinister mind of spiritual wicked 
Intertwined with weak souls, come kick it 
Written, rewind, get it, look out, hit it, rise 
Dig it, wig out, feel it, ride   
Mimic, die 
Nigga, fly   
Boom bye-bye. 
My kind in time, 7th Sign, 7th Sign (7th Sign) 
Time after time get mine, gon' get mine 
Pick up the phone line, pick up the phone line, 
ready for truth on the loose? 
Got a dime or two and I'm liable to tell you, only if you know, wooo 
He flew right bye you, true
demons follow and resume from the womb in the tomb 
I fool you, boom, boom, boom 
B-b-b-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 

[Bizzy - repeat 5X]
