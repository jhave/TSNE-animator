[Mac Dre Talking]
C'mon
Let's do it
What it is
Thizz is what it is
unh yea
Another Knocker
Kick This game around like soccer

[Verse 1]
Pull up a chair let me make you a plate
Of this game tha's seasoned like a tasty steak
Since '88 I've been serving them well
I was serving yell when L was rocking bells
Clocking mail get get getting it
Copping it flip flip flipping it
Now I'm spitting it bar for bar
European whipping it car for car
No doe hoe? You know I say no
I need you like jaws need a rain coat
I put dangles stay high as the star spangled
Choke the blood out you bitch get strangled
Get mangled fucking with this pimping
Hot as Lipton Dre Jay Trimpson
You better pay attention it's all gamed up
Peep the bio the file see how I came up

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin my doe
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin hoes
Rolling on vogues and Two Fours
Dre trippa got to stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas boy I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say dog she blows

[Verse 2]
When I sweat her I say read my lips
Bring me cheddar bitch bring me chips
Finger tips ass hips and lips
Folow my lead dont ask questions bitch
I want fresh fits from Abecrombe &amp; Fitch
When it's going down the Mac comes and shits
The Mac comes to spit
Let me do it to your ear baby
I'm trying to flip see I do it every year baby
Real off the laddish
Getting my cottage
Cheese geez please beez freeze
Stop it your heading down the wrong path
Fuck making bitch I want a tongue bath
Dumb cash can you do it like me?
Cash a fat check at the bank with no I.D.
Can you blow by me when I'm doing 100?
Smacking slapping in my 500

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin my doe
In the Sco the O and Valley Jo
Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin hoes
Rolling on vogues and Two Fours
Dre trippa got to stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas boy I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say dog she blows

[Verse 3]
I got cutthroat friends and lots of women
I ride in a Benz but i'll squat a lemon
I want a stuff turkey with all the trimmings
To pay and play extra innings
I'm winning fat lady start singing
I'm finna get the cougnut and start swinging
Skeet dance and eight
And when they run my plates model and make
I'ma shake like I'm riding with a K
Pedal to the medal rarely hit the brake
I love a high speed get away
They wanna get rid of Dre
Put the kid away
But I'm in the day I'm in the 7 series
So quiet you can't even hear the
Engine when I smash the gas
And would you look at all the wood on the dash

[Hook]
Since '84 I been out there gettin my doe

Getting rich in the Rich and San Jo
Grinding and rhyming and pimpin hoes
Rolling on vogues and Two Fours
Dre trippa got to stay with two hoes
Stay with zippas boy I keep a few O's
Get bossed and say dog she blows</pre>
