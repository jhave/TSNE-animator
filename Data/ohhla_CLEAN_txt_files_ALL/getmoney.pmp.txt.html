You talkin 'bout you wanna be down with me
You need to get some money wanna be with Pimp C
Uhh, cause I'm real to the core
And give a damn 'bout a bitch and I pimp on a whore
You can tell yo' momma, about the drama
You was fuckin for free, befo' you met me
Get your mind on your money, get some big faces
Before you come around here catchin cases
Pimpin, panderin, bitch I'm handlin

In a 2001 Benz with the screens
Sippin a big cup of lean, uhh

If you don't get out for the dough
You talkin that shit, you a lazy punk
You need to get out there and pop the trunk
And make the motherfucker see all the cock
And get that money, shake what you got
Sell that pussy ho, suck that dick
Break that trick ho, hit that lick
Get yo' mind up on my grill
Punk-ass bitches, always trill
You a yellow ho, and you a dyke
The type of bitch, that I don't like
You think you come and gon' wreck my stable
I keep a fuckin bitch on a line or cable

Make the trick say it feels good bitch!
Bitch get it now!
Make the trick say it feels good, uhh!
You gotta get my money bitch
Get it, get it, uhh
Bitch get it now!
Make the trick say it feels good, uhh!
