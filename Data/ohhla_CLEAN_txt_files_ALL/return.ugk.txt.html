(Pimp C)

It all started with a Pimp C, bitch
So what the fuck is up
Told em somethin good
Ease up my muthafuckin cut
Cause if you don't really wanna fuck wit a trill nigga
From the trill villa wit a steel trigga land of the real killers
Pop Pop muthafucka there you go
I'ma bust em on yo ass if you don't ease up off me ho
Cause trill niggas don't carry no sugar in they nutsac
Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack
So you gon give me my money, but you don't hear me though
But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes
P.A. nigga, trill ass nigga, 
How you figga you can buck me down nigga?
Mr. big man, Mr. big time, give me what's mine
Instead of buying cars for a bitch named sunshine
Give me what's mine, give me what's mine
before it come down to triggas
Shit, it's the return of the trill ass niggas

Bitch
It's the return of the trill ass niggas 
Uh
It's the return of the trill ass niggas
But you can't hear me
It's the return of the trill ass niggas bitch

(Bun B)

Yea muthfuckas
I figured you run, I figured you run, when I pull
Triggas to guns, that triggas to guns P.A. fool
A nigga named Bun, a nigga named Bun, no more sun, no more shine
Say hello to the nine milly (Buck!) millameter (Buck! Buck!)
Money tight glock, bustin them shots
when I break yo ass off somethin hot
Niggas steady catchin lead to the head, I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin, niggas start passin away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass, and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise
I'm gettin chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now its the return of the trill ass niggas</pre>
