[Chorus]
Oh IIIIII..
I think I betta let y'all know...
them foolz should have let me go....
So now they gots to feel my flow...
K-Rino K-Rino..

[Verse 1]
My motives are magnetic
Let 'em effect their cerebellum
Persecutors suffer the verses impact before I spit 'em
Radioactively contaminate MC's saying they cracked us
Shift rhymes and reverse click and say 'em backwards
I punish a faker for years before I let up
The referee could count for two months he ain't gonna get up
I'm trained well my every brain cell contains hell
Flames dwell inside of my cranium hear my name bell
Kill a verb known to recite irresistible words
By day I'm K-Rino by night an invisible bird
Incredible artistic rap scientifical mission
Displayin futuristic x-ray peripheral vision
Yet blindly searchin for styles to undermine me
Plant lyrics in the ground add water and grow a rhyme tree
Nerves split unauthorized verse readin forbidden
Witness the folder where the ancient rap secrets are hidden
My black book details the counts of the collars I bruised
Poetical scriptural arrangement left scholars confused
Unsolved mysteries so average lyricists doubt me
If I can't think my book will create the rhymes without me
Styles like punches so let's step in the ring and quote 'em
My battles large enough to let Don King promote 'em
Rapped in my past life made coroners miss it
Dug the casket up a week later my body was missin

[Chorus 2X]
Oh IIIIII..
I think I betta let y'all know...
them foolz should have let me go....
So now they gots to feel my flow...
K-Rino K-Rino..

[Verse 2]
Rapidly my knowledge reaching new planes
Doctors x-rayed my skull and discovered that I had two brains
Respect the man checking in wreckin land
Imagine murder millenniums within a five second span
I yell out through my full reign and strike slayin
You sell out like a Bull's game with Mike playin
They blowin taps when I start the creation of raps
Victims are crushed by extreme gravitation collapse
I see the flat line I hear no responses and flee
Rhyme sleeping gas every body unconscious but me
I deciphered astrological rhyme codes
The main subject of deep experimental mind probes yo
Words like brass knuckles left that head knotted
Waking up at night to catch my black book floatin over my body
My verses hypnotize 'em MC's be layin down
Screamin like they fallin off a building but they on the ground
Talented battlists professor game shower the main flower
my rhymes melted opponents like a flame thrower
breathing the fire on the mic vocals burnin the stage
lyrical genius reading books without turning the page
convert to ghost form the agg ways seem to worsen
sayin my name on Tuesday makes me appear in person
wrote it and flowed it activate greater vocal aerobics
scanning your microscopic brain got me claustrophobic
pillage your rep never step where the pressure was kept
telescope placed in my conscious to measure the depth
you want to kill me that's cool I know its true
but when you do I'm coming back as a bullet to murder you

[Chorus]
Oh IIIIII..
I think I betta let y'all know...
them foolz should have let me go....
So now they gots to feel my flow...
K-Rino K-Rino...</pre>
