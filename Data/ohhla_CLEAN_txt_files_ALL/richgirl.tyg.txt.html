Song:   Rich Girl
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Look at how she walk, walk
Like a rich girl
Look at how she talk, talk
Like a rich girl
Lick your lips, blow a kiss
Stop playing
You's a Rich (Girl)

She so L.A., she there every day
She like the scenery, I like to see her face
It's a lazy day and I'm bored anyway
So hit the freeway, chill with the boy bay
That swag whirlwind gotta say
When she with me, she feel like beyonce
Back in the day, used to rock the finger waves
She much older now, but she don't even look her age
Knew she get the dollars one day
A good girl every day's like Sunday
Only one way to her soul
You don't need a flashlight, cause her heart glows

Look at how she walk, walk
Like a rich girl
Look at how she talk, talk
Like a rich girl
Lick your lips, blow a kiss
Stop playing
You's a Rich (Girl) {*2X*}

She called me on the way to her friend house
You know home girl with the loud mouth
She had a boyfriend but kicked the nigga out
You saying she was cute too, you know what I'm talking bout
Some chicks are the same, not her
I just seen them all pop up, popped her
Flying then I'm off to the next bird
But this one right here nigga superb
Scoop her then we listen to some Luther
It's never too much, she know every word
I'm like very good, and she's from the hood
But she a rich girl, she can have the world

Look at how she walk, walk
Like a rich girl
Look at how she talk, talk
Like a rich girl
Lick your lips, blow a kiss
Stop playing
You's a Rich (Girl) {*2X*}

I'm looking for a rich girl, I'm looking for a rich girl
I'm looking for a rich girl, So come here, come here girl {*2X*}

Look at how she walk, walk
Like a rich girl
Look at how she talk, talk
Like a rich girl
Lick your lips, blow a kiss
Stop playing
You's a Rich (Girl) {*2X*}</pre>
