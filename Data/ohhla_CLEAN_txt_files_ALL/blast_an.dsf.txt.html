What up renzo
What up leon
What up breack neck
what up opio

[Verse 1: Salvador]
What up kizzo how ya been?
This goes out to you my friend
We been up in the lab assembling
I was gonna send you things for remembering
Hate my lifestyle nowadays
I'm in a zombie mindstate going crazy
I know I'm lazy ?I know it's hazy?
?Going loco? like driving around with miss Daisy
I wanna pass out
Even thinking about taking my life while I'm takin the trash out
Because I'm depressed like constantly
It's like coo-coo's nest funk factory
But I got people looking out for me
People who are loyal to the cause and would kill and die for me
And I'd do the same for them of course
It's Darkside Of The Motherfucking Force!

[Verse 2: Opio]
It's been a long time but we grew up
Now breack neck's in the lab doing new cuts
He's a father now
Just like myself and I'm pulling it through someway, somehow
But It's all good, there's no stress man
What you hearing is the words of a blessed man
Shook the load off, got it off my chest man
But I can't rest 'till the vinyl's pressed man
I stand firm cause I gotta'
I knew I had to get a grip and act proper
Been in and out of jail, I don't wanna go back
But if you giving me threats I'm gonna drop ya
But still I gotta watch my step
Because I lose control when my temper sets
And my family is all I got
And I'm all they got
So I give work a shot instead
Lay the stress to rest and move ahead
No rehab for the buddah heads
We in the groove instead
Continue to shine
Dedicated to kizzo, the beat and the rhyme what!

[Chorus]
I think it's rolling now
Blast another missile, blast another missile, blast another missile

Combat Rock is in the place to be
We navigate the mothership to the highest degree
Mister K-I-Z is still down with the D
So all you sucker MC's just let it be! (2x)</pre>
