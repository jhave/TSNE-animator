[Intro: DJ Paul]

[Verse 1: T-Rock]
My house of representitives, be A town assassins
That'll cause a riot in any shape form or fashion
Run up in your grill, when attention who we blastin'
Now woo now we presidental thing, cause you was flashin'
We some alcoholic niggas, we cause depression'
A-tech in this mobb, niggas mashin' for cashin'
Amazed what we see the crooked police harassin'
All because we makin' cheddar other clicks are lackin'
Down for the cause, where you haters wanna brawl
Got my back against the wall, Hypnotized Camp I call
We some treal figgas', drug heal niggas, makin' (?) quicker
Livin' in the world where it's hard not to kill niggas
Enemies is layin', unless they hold in tight them brain cells
Sacraficein' every chick that they can make, because of fame mama
Clean till I'm gone, like I'm ridin on the chrome
Shakin' all the playa haters, soking knowledge in my dome

[Chrous: DJ Paul] x2
The last boy, you gone hit this and feel me
Smilin' in my face, but you you really wanna kill me
Hail one of you niggas, wonna get some like that (some)
Hail one of you niggas, wonna get some like that (some)
The last boy, you gone hit this and feel me
Smilin' in my face, but you you really wanna kill me
Hail one of you niggas, wonna get some like that (some)
Hail one of you niggas, wonna get some like that (some)

[DJ Paul]
Ohhwee it's gettin' hot up in here
You mutha fucka's learned some technique yet nigga

[Verse 2: Lord Infamous]
Get back from me nigga here come lord your fuckin' nemesis
Back on your premisices, remember what I left on bitch
You hoes can't take me, you can't fake me

Always shady, and I leave yo weakass (?)
I got no fears and no pain in my veins mayn
I been insane coming free in the black rain
You wanna step up to the mayn, well put yourself in danger
I'm like the ranger from the west and obsessed with anger
I hear the room was from consumers and this shit is funny
The niggas talkin' shit, it's niggas who ain't got no money
They make a sale off  fuck a grip they askin never again
They make a sack a stick to bitch they askin never stick
They make a sack to spit this gangsta shit they'll never spit
So walk up faking feel the shackin' drowning in fuckin' piss
Trick yo' gossip, your like fossets so I let you leak
Lord is elitein' now I beat you like a hoggy beat

[Chorus] x1

[Verse 3: Juicy J]

Man I'm glad these niggas gonna the fuck up out the Posse Songs

[Verse 4: DJ Paul]
I done been up on your corner, I done smoked up all they weed
I done hold down with your killas, I done corner them for there g's
Niggas talkin' bout yo ass, say you ain't nuthin but a bitch
Say you always claimin killa, but for real you suckin' dick
Yeah it's funny how it is to see a nigga in a thong
Get them glocks with the pop, you gone break yo ass and run
I ain't fuckin' wit yo kind and I ain't got no point to prove
Let yo legs move be a mutha fuckin best move..bitch

[Chorus] x1</pre>
