It don't even much stop (I keep it real with my real niggaz)
I got real niggaz all over
Man, look here
  
Verse:1
My hood is kurupted with nothin but killers and soldiers
Off top cut throaters, get crossed up, get fucked over
It's in a nigga nature to put that iron
Don't playa hate us
Get knocked off the map
Head fall off your shoulder in 'ya lap
Wuz, happenin' lil' wootay
I'm bout that trigga play
Kidnappin', jackin', and murderin'
Pistols click clackin
I'm blastin I know that you heard of me
Call me lil' duga 
B.Geezy fore sheezy it's gravy 
Niggas they ?? me they can't take me
So they choose to hate me
Jealous bitches I abuse a assault rifle ??? did
Folks grief,  fall on they knees, 'cause I play for keeps
I been thugged out since back in the G's
God blessed ????
Me and my fuckin' dog LT
It ain't never got to the point where I can't handle the heat
I can't see no way out for me i'm in the game too deep
So, until i'm covered in white sheets
Shit is gonna be real, nigga
When I'm afiliated with beef 
  
(Chorus)2x
I keep it real with my real niggaz
They beefin' I donate steel to my real niggaz
No secret i'll splitta mill with my real niggaz
Get in drama kill or be killed with my real niggaz
Off top
  
Verse 2:
All my niggaz bout they business
Hustle for the feddi first alternative is they riches
Bitch regard everything peddi
We shinin are so deadly 
Don't checks snitches hate up throw 'em in ditches
Now, I'm the type that'll die for nigga
No matter how deep the water is
I'll ride for my nigga
I don't give a fuck
 I'll give my last dime to my nigga
Save my heart
But keep it real at all times with my nigga
Look, that's for my nigga
If he on a murder charge
I'ma make sure he got no witness
Ya know without no witness
No way he can be convicted
While he down I'll handle business for 'em
My nigga real
If he want me to fuck his bitch it's on
He can call 24-7 ain't no limit for 'em
Nigga if i had to
I'd take a life sentence for 'em
?? jungel
On a wild life adventure for 'em
It don't matter
I go on any kind of mission for 'em
'Cause i'm real
  
(Chorus)2x
  
Verse 3:
Oh, best beleive i come and get you if i want you
Get caught wit' yo' draws down 
Then lil' Geezy will funk ya
Never underestimate me just because ima youngster
I know a nigga named Turk 
Leave ya' in the driveway dumpster

Hard hitters, trill niggers, straight wig splitters
No soft niggaz my dogs play the game raw nigga
You'd be fucked up if you see half the shit a saw nigga
