[Verse One] [Scarub]
Single male seeking female with a beautiful mind
And a physic to keep me peeping like, "Damn she's fine."
Let's take a date with destiny
Shoot across the galaxy
Just me and she
She and I acting out fantasies 
Hobbies me?
Swimming in the Milky Way 
Playing marbles with the stars
My noggins spaced out like that
No sense
Why even charge me of malarkey?
Grounded my heart beat 
But my mind sky larks
See?
Hold the phrase, "What if?" like a car key
Roll with me
The brain race like road rage
Strap in before you start me up
Where the side walk ends is where I dare to jump
Parachute while shooting out paragraphs
Let's rap
Love conversations that tickle your funny bone, make you laugh
Yeah, I'm comedy
But not funny like ha ha
The type of funny that you chuckle at when out of ya mind
Birth sign Aquarius
People think they see me like, "Where he go? There he is."
Thoughts don't drift in one line
Movements various
I'm a daydream catcher
For your love and laughter I fish
Sailing on the winds blown after making a wish
You're number one on my to do list

[Chorus]

[Scarub] If so beautiful your mind is
[Scarub &amp; Eligh] Your money or you mind which is timeless
[Scarub] Most seek fortune but it's rare that you'll find
[Scarub] One millionaire of ten with a beautiful mind
[MURS] You can't buy youth when you're old or food for your soul
[MURS] Friends when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold 
[MURS] The wealthiest person is the poorest at times 
[MURS] When compared to the one with a beautiful mind

[Verse Two] [Eligh]
Its the muscle I use to hustle my voice
A tussle to choose management of thought in my shoes
Not easy at times
Voices chatter at night, meeting of mind
Inside of my tank
The scent of a woman passes your nose
Left an impression for life
A possession in time
Lesson in strife
Decompression of love
Lives from the past
Embodied in me
Regrettably free
Free to wander the planes
Universe is the sky
My body lies over the ocean but my mind will fly
Beautiful thing shelter from the rain
Forgetting the pain, letting it stream down the drain
In the form of denial 
The trial and error
To stare at your problems with heroism and win
Beginning of sin
End of the beginning and then
Some numb it with narcotic to fend from the demons within
Blurring the vision
Wisdom occurring through prism
Colors of hope
Shining bright like a beacon is my eye when I'm speaking
3rd is the level I'm freakin' flows
For the people who listen, know
That it's all a tradition, grow
With a plant of my purpose 
Land on my feet in the circus ring
I'm the master who work the crowd
With a beautiful mind to tide the times

[Chorus]

[Scarub] If so beautiful your mind is
[Scarub &amp; Eligh] Your money or you mind which is timeless
[Scarub] Most seek fortune but it's rare that you'll find
[Scarub] One millionaire of ten with a beautiful mind
[MURS] You can't buy youth when you're old or food for your soul
[MURS] Friends when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold 
[MURS] The wealthiest person is the poorest at times 
[MURS] When compared to the one with a beautiful mind

[Verse Three] [MURS]
I know I'm only using 10% of what you offer
But I feed you what I'm reading 
Trying to brighten up my chakras
Imposters 
Hide behind degrees and certificates
Some seek to expand you by using barbiturates
I'm sitting with this book
Tryin' to get a better look 
Through these words as mirror I should hope to see you clearer 
I'm a figment of your imagination it appears
So mold me 
Shape me 
Hold me 
Take me
Existence is a window and our dreams are the draperies
Lately, I'm lonely cause you're still the only 
One who understands my plans and consoles me
I'm hoping we can find 
That match for our soul 
And through that union we become a new whole
But for now it's you and I and the life we create
Destiny we control and the fate that we shape
That's enough to keep us busy till we find the right mate
But if we never do 
At least I had this time with you 
One body one mind, we combined the two 
A pair like us you'll only find a few 
Until my last day I pray I stay this way with you

[3MG]
