[Verse One: Lil Wayne]
Uh! I like a long haired big red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon THAT PUSSY!!!

If she let me in I'm a own THAT PUSSY!!!
'Gon throw it back a buss it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick now come here let me dope you
You 'gon be a dope fiend your friends should call you dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth cause they don't know me
Ha! But you can call me touche'
I fuck the whole group maybe I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid my head game is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on phonics
Yeah! But anyway I think your bionic
And I don't think your beautiful I think your beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
Back it up and dump it back-back it up and dump it

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] (Drake)
Cause we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
We like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too
And OHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! (Yeah! Alright!)

[Verse Two: Drake]
She be jumpin up and down, tryna fit dat ass in 
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten 
All they wanna talk about is partyin and fashion 
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin 'em ALLLLL.. 
Young Money man, this shit so timeless 
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest 
And what are all your names, again? We drunk, remind us 
Are any y'all into girls like I am, les-bi-an/hooooonest 
{*sings*} She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all shorty, tell me what you don't see?
{*raps* }I would fuck wit all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy, hoooooooes
And Wayne say, "Pussy, pussy, pussy"
And weed and alcohol seems to satisfy us all
Damn, and everytime I think of stayin wit her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] 
Cause we like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and we like her too
We like her, and we like her too
And we like her, and she like us too
And OHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 

[Verse Three: Jae Millz]
Baby I'm not bein disrespectful baby I'm just bein Millz
And I don't know how fake feels so I gotta keep it real
I just wanna fuck, every girl in the world
Every model every singer every actress every diva
Every high saditty chick every college girl every skeezer
Stripper and every Desperate Housewife that resemble Eva
My role model is Wilt, so married woman to milf
It don't matter who you is miss you can get the business

[Verse Four: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christ-mas 
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass 
Uh, and I swear I'm feelin alla y'all

She screamin out papi every time a nigga deep in 
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on 
And Hilary can Rodham/ride 'em too boy I gets my pimpin on 

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] (Mack Maine)
Cause we like her, and we like her too

For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
And in about three years, holla at me, Miley Cyrus
