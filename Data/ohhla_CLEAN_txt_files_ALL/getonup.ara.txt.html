Song:   Get On Up
Typed by: dj-run@mailcity.com

Rollin, everybody dance with the soul and
I'm the man with the mic and I'm controlin the floor
Givin you more and there's more in store 
As I take this party to the encore
Higher, hot like fire
Everybody wet with the sweat cause it makes you perspire
Drippin, but nobody's slippin
The beat is hittin and yo...I ain't trippin
I know how to make you flow from the intro
With the wave of your hand and then say "ho"
Everybody off the wall
Get invloved...
Your problem's solved
I'm here to make you quit it if you ain't here to dance
Then take this chance and get out of here
This is for the real party people so you know what's up
It's time to dance so get on up

[Chorus:] Get-get-get-get on up...get get on up (x4)

Movin, gettin with the groovin
Everybody dance cause the song's improvin
If you can't dance rock your head to the beat
Throw your hands in the air... 'til you feel weak
Yeah then you shake it, 'til you can't take it
If you get tired move around and fake it
And stop....and do a dance or two
So everybody in the place can get wild
With to the program, this is a show-jam
Ask me to stop, and I'll say "no ma'am"
Tell the DJ to turn it up a little louder
Make the crowd and party people take a shower
And the music, I can use it
Make you wanna go and jump through this
And get busy...cause I know what's up
Everybody in the place you gotta get on up

[Chorus]

Yo, maxin, nah no time for relaxin
Just get into the floor instead of waxin, the sound
No time to sit down...
You have to get up so you can get down
Let yourself go, get into the flow
As Arab makes this a hype show
From intro to intro you know
That the size of the crowd will grow, large
That's the kinda life I'm livin
That's why I try to keep givin
Something new for you to try to dance to
Work your body 'til the song is through
Just flex it all the way up to the exit
But don't stop there cause next is the chorus
Yeah there's more of this, so you know what's up
You gotta get on up

[Chorus]</pre>
