[D.M.C.]
Aiyyo Jay yo Jay, check this out
I was born
Son of Byford, brother of Al
Bannah's my mamma and Run's, my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, those burgers are RONALD'S
I ran down, my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother and D
Huh..
Oh, y'all on that tip now huh?</pre>
