[LL Cool J w/ 112 harmonizing in the background]
Yeah, uh-huh
I can't believe it

[Chorus: 112]
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
No need for the coping now
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar
Made a vow before God to love me
And finally I'm walking down that aisle
I will never second guess us how
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together
Having kids together, my life begins right now

[LL Cool J]
Finally the day has arrived
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles
I can feel my stomach turnin and tossin and goin through it
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it
Take the vow to be together forever
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out
I was blind to love, God showed me you
Now I'm standin here shakin 'bout to say "I do"
And I do

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
Butterflies, my palms are sweaty
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife
Us both dressed alike in the purest white
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows

[Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
It's a beautiful and heavenly day
As the pastor asks, "Who gives this woman away?"
Your father says "I do" and gives me a hand
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand
He losin a diamond and now you're mine and
He don't have to worry, I'ma keep you shinin
I'ma build us a future, I'ma keep on climbin
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment
I'ma work overtime, make sure y'all live
But still find time for you and homework with the kids
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, "I do"

[Chorus]

[112] + (LL)
And I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I doooooooooooooooooooo
We made a vow baby
I do (I do)
Baby I do (I do)
Baby I doooooooooooooooooooo
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)
Waiting for me at the altar
And I make a vow before God to love you
Finally I'm walking down that aisle
I'll, never second guess you {*fading out*}</pre>
