Sapphire we don't need no help now

[Hell Razah]
We was tighter then Arnold and Willis, when it was hood cries
Closer then Michael and J.J. from "Good Times"
I gave you my brotherly love to keep a good mind
Would give you the shirt off my back to see the sunshine
Never thought you'd choose the ways that Judas paved
Or sell me out to devils for thirty pieces of shackles
My loyalty and trust was better then gold medals
But niggas wanna see you in graves with rose pedals
Was raised off Isely Brothers inside our mothers
How the fuck money could make us despise each other?
I open up my door; we slept on the same floors
We swore we would ride out sure for one cause
Not knowing you would stab my back with no swords
But hate is a devilish trait that fill morgues
And love in the atmosphere could heal sores
Even though you bit me twice I gave my hands
DAMN!!!!

(Chorus) Razah
I asked my brother, could you help me?
You was wealthy, how could you shelf me?
I asked my brother, could you help me?
I still made it out young and healthy
I asked my brother, could you help me?
I asked my brother, could you help me?
You was wealthy, how could you shelf me?
I still made it out young and healthy

(Interlude) Bazz
Ain't no more brotherly love; it's strictly Cain and Abel
Ain't no more honor amongst us they send you to them angels
Niggas that fill you with slugs and help the judge hang you
They tried to feed me the crumbs that fell off their table

[Shabazz the Disciple]
They tried to use me as a tool and get rich off my labor
Showed the same behavior of those who crucified the Savior
The duty of the wise to civilize the 85-percent
Even my own brothers cast stones, strung out on a lot of dents
I asked brother, can you please help me feed the seeds?
I asked brother, can you please help my hoods in need?
They got the same spirit as Judas thinking they're Ramesses
They got the holiest titles but with no rugs and deeds
Consumed by greed, so they thieved all the proceeds
Niggas left me for dead, left me out here to bleed
Like they rather seed my whiz rocking that widowsry
Leaning over me in the coffin crying on the knees
For few shiny nickels you turned your back on the Nation
To them you're just another buck wheat on plantation
They turned their back and they contribute to our furthers
Stole our blesses and didn't divide inherit us (We want it back!)
While they negated communities lavishly living
The only gated community we inhabiting is prison
A good Sheppard will always lay his life down for his sheep
He a Good Samaritan; he don't step over 'em like the priest

(Sam Cooke sample)
I asked my brother, brother help me
I've asked my brother, will you help me?
I asked my brother, brother help me

(Sample)
"I am my brother's keeper"

(Chorus) Razah</pre>
