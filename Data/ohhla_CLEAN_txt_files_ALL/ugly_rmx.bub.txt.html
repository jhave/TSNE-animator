Beat Club
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em

To the beat now, Bubba Sparxxx, uh
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
To the beat now, Ms. Jade, uh
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the, oh

(Verse 1 - Ms. Jade)
I don't start shit, but I'm quick to finish
Destroy, demolish, ruin, Ms. Jade abide the business
I know y'all like who is this young Philly gunness
Coming for everyone, Mrs. Jackson and both her sons
The battles already won, I don't think ya'll understanding me
I just pick 'em out randomly, abusing what they hand to me
Use the gift that grinning me, humble so I don't damage me
I do it for the money, but mainly it's for my family
Niggas is not ready for what's about to happen
Female captain, coming out jabbing
Cocksucka sleeping that's exactly how it happens
Get ugly drunk with Bubba out in Athens
Right foot on the gas and left hand on the wheel
Beat Club shut it down so niggas mad for real
We doin' it any way, y'all rhymes is kiddie play
Silly puddy, young buddy, we don't got friends dummy

(Chorus - Timbaland)
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em

(Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx)
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin bigger, with every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin, spittin that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin that truly matters
On goes the saga, of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrow, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now, I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin
You hear that beat don'tcha that's just Timmy talkin
Go 'head throw dem bows, fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin
This that new South, take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin legend, and this is gettin ugly

(Chorus - Timbaland)
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em

(Verse 3 - Ms. Jade)
I don't won't much, just what's do to me
Ignore gibberish, babble, and talking stupidly
Throwing second chances, it's kinda slim to none
I'd like to see what y'all thinking after my verse is done
I'm sorta different now, from my younger days
My attitude is adjusted cause on the mic I blaze
Oh how I just love it, when they get upset
Get or, haul ass on, that's your best bet
They say love and hate, it go hand and hand
Ms. Jade, never worry bout the next man
I gotta think the past, but the futures better
Never catch me off, my game's always whatever
I ain't selfish but, I won't my own money
I ain't never been Joe, but I can make you love me
Now you can melt of that ice, or you cloud pour out that bubbly
Believe the words that I'm saying this shit is gonna get ugly

(Chorus - Timbaland)
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
It's gone get ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly
It's gone get ugly
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
To the beat now
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
To the beat now
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em
To the beat now
Shock the monkey wit 'em, shock the monkey wit 'em</pre>
