Verse One: Skoob

We on some wiggity-world renowned, comin back for the crown
Time to show these rappin cats how diggity-Das get down
Still keepin real, smoke el's and still pack steel
Stiggity-still be on the streets of BK with cat skill
Oil rap spill, riggity-rhymin over tracks ill
I rock the Benz, I rock the Range, bliggity-black grill
Kid go pro, sellin ten and a half mil
It's the end of the world so MC's write ya will
Boogie Bang throw fatigues on then strike to kill
Sewer rats underwater, formin, rap seals
Riggity-reppin on the regular, bliggity-black, I'm tellin ya
Emergency, call up P on the cellular
911, escape the hood on tour
so riggity-radio cats can take the tapes off pause
We're overseas on the bomb, Chevrolet, Yukon
Reunion (The Hit Squad, Def Squad), let's get it on

Chorus:

Das EFX - riggity rock rock on rock on
Hit Squad - riggity rock rock on rock on
P-boy - riggity rock rock on rock on
Jersey - riggity rock rock on rock on
Brooklyn - riggity rock rock on rock on
Uptown - riggity rock rock on rock on
Killer Queens - riggity rock rock on rock on
Strong Isle - riggity rock rock on rock on

Verse Two: Dray

Piggity-pockets tight, diggy-Das on the website
Cops and 'stop' signs, niggas is red lights
Kiggity-can't get too deep cos the feds tapped the mic
Generation EFX, ressurrect as Jesus Christ
Riggity-rippin it, for die-hard fans continuous
War with us, the whole industry on the injured list
Diggity-Das EFX, Dray and Skoob snap necks
We're liggity-livin, eatin off these here rap cheques
Fancy cars, women, EPMD, P-A, Richmond
In this rap game, giggity-get in where you fit in
Fit in where you get like mines, on your man's friend
Collect platinum like Jordan collect championships
Biggity-bust a cannon, like punani keep the system slammin
Doin 90 in Augusta-made Lex landin
Shorty feelin this, to shiggity-shake that ass, get busy, girl
Das EFX biggity-back off to Disneyworld

Chorus

Shaolin - riggity rock rock on rock on
