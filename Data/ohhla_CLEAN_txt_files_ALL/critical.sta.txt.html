[Verse 1 - Lil' Fame]
Uh, what the fuck, what the fuck, huh?
Uh, if I ask you who's your top 10 greatest rappers dead or alive
And you don't mention my name, I'm a blacken your eyes
I'm from the bottom of the 'ville, duke I had to survive
Where them snakes that'll murder your fam' and then slap you a five
Keep it goin now, P.E. shit, hoein now
Big bag of white widow, kiddo (throw it down)
It's the death of a MC, death of the Auto-Tune
Death of the motherfuckin engineer that recorded to ya
You're spaced out, what the fuck you recordin for motherfuckers on the moon?
This is for my real corner goons
It's Fame (M.O.P.), back at it again
Cop killer, slugs, black 'matic and gauge
Niggaz ain't gon' give me my credit
So hear's a couple of curse words for y'all niggaz to edit
Suck a dick, you trick punk bitch
You fuckin with the Brownsville warriors, I'm so glorious

[Chorus - scrathing of samples] - w/ ad libs
"Tell 'em Fame"
"Lil' Fame in the"
"Holdin it down, for New York City"
"It's (BK), it's (all day)"
"Statik Selektah"
"Critically acclaimed, criminals to blame"
"New York, is takin the scene back"
"Yes sir"
"The whole's most underrated"
"I'm showin off for Statik"
"Brownsville"

[Verse 2 - Saigon]
Haha, look
Oh I get it, you thought you was dealin with some regular niggaz
Fishermen'll find your fuckin head in a river
See my competitive squiver, holdin slugs, I'd rather deliver
Yeah I got locked but I'm here, he a dead nigga
You can't compare it, I hear niggaz with 25, say fuck inside, I'm a wear it
From dead niggaz, I don't hear shit
Think before you risk losin your health
Niggaz grillin me, should understand man, you're just confusin yourself
'Cause I don't buy that, that shit is whack, it's a smart act
Tell a cat let's do a car jack, see where his heart at
If he refuse it, then a nilpotent might lose it
If he do it, we gon' see he fuckin stupid and use it
To make 'em do shit, like rob a club with a pool stick
On a train stickin chicks in they tit with a toothpick
Lay back and laugh at this jackass
Make 'em let me use his army coat pocket as my personal back stab
If he ever back lash, let the black MAC
Blast from the back of his cap up to the crack of his ass
Look it here, niggaz took it there, like a crook'll care
I unload, all ya hear is blooka blooka yeah, blooka yeah, nigga

[Chorus - scratching of samples] - w/ ad libs
"Saigon-Saigon the Don"
"Holdin it down, for New York City"
"It's (BK), it's (all day)"
"Critically acclaimed, criminals to blame"
"When it comes to verbs, I be flippin
'Cause herbs just be shittin off the words I be kickin"
"Say word"
"That's word, Sean don't give a (give a)"

[Verse 3 - Sean Price]
Haha, what up?
Yo, Sean P, Statik Selek', pass me the sket
Shot the first whack rapper spittin trash on the set
Pass me a check 'cause nigga don't be rappin for free
Rap for a fee, producers, I rap for a beat
Fuck around and get smacked with the heat, wrapped in a sheet, cremate 'em
Loved across the board, P. hate 'em
I don't like thugs (thugs), I don't like nerds
I don't like myself and I hate bein disturbed
I hate seein you birds, hummin, stunt on the block
Suckin cock for a hundred a 'wap
Get a job, I used to sell rocks in front of my mom's building
Twelve hundred a day, now me and my moms chillin
Uh, I write raps, make five stacks a show
Sell white to white people, stay playin in snow (okay)
Stay rakin in dough (yeah), you stay hatin the flow
Assault and battery, I stay breakin your nose

[Chorus - scratching of samples] - w/ ad libs
"So what"
"Just wonder why he's fuckin crazy"
"Holdin it down, for New York City"
"It's (BK), it's (all day)"
"Critically acclaimed, criminals to blame ..."
"Somewhere"</pre>
