[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 1]
Okay, headed to that swap meat
Coppin all that Avalon
Fresh white T's and some J's what I had in mind
I remember days when a nigga didn't have a dime
Now I got big dollas, I just buy whatever come to mind
Choppas squeezed, I remember when I used to window shop
Now I hit the mall, buy it all 'cus I'm on the top
Boss like I used to dream of this moment
Used to roll that stress, now I roll that kill, I call it coma
Step inside my ride, I know you smell the aroma
6-50 top back, chillin on my corner
Used to be MacDonald's, now we eat at Benihana's
5 star suites with freaks, that's on my mama
They tell me money evil but it wash away my problems
Don't matter what the price, lil mama just know I got it
Aw, it ain't trickin if you got it
My bank account solid and my wallet need a diet

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 2]
Like my nigga meet me outside
These homies rush me just so they can steal my flashdrive
My music that important, imported in iPod
Buying my CDs like payin ties, act God
I'm sure success will taste better than nectarines
Growing in the spring, basket's the fruit of life
Had the boy arrange me every time I pick up the mike
I hop my entertainment be a bigga impact than Mike
Can I live like the princess of Munda?
Got a princess to groom the lacks o my scalp with a golden comb
And I'm on, Cloud 9, stopping acts like in the sky
I'm from Compton, can't you hear me coming like I'm from the shy
I'm inspired from a magic twice, which art is a rep and run?
But if they knew my intentions the reff and probably run
I'm just a good kid from the city who made straight A's
Tryna make the transition from Rose to Kool Aid

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this

[Verse 3]
Okay, started as a youngin, now I'm at the top
Used to ride the city bus, now I'm at the car lot
And we live up in the mall now, something like a regular
I ball every day like clap, I got my cheddar up
I used to smoke dirt weed, now I'm smoking better
But in school I couldn't get a girl but now I'm getting groupie love
Now I'm seeing better days, mama's so proud of me
Do it for my grandma but I know she lookin down on me
Reach in my pocket and grab big bills
If this is Caribbean rich I like how this feel
Hah, and ain't nobody help me get here
If you lookin for me at the top is where I'll be, I'll be there go

[Bridge]
I used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin
Used to be broke but now I'm ballin, I'm ballin

[Chorus]
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this
And I spent a couple bucks on this, yea
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this</pre>
