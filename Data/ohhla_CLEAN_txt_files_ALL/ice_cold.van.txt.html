Your bad self..

[Verse 1]
All right, stop, spread yourself around
Get loose girl, let's break it down
Get down, straight to the floor
Get excited and beg for more
As I go on, flow on with a smile
Pay attention to my style
Dirty but hot, ya' know what I mean?
Get loose girl like a sex fiend, let's do it
cause you know what I want
Me and you babe go one on one
Get freaky and I do the same
Get hot and I ride like a sex machine

[Chorus]
Ice cool and you're colder than ever, I like it
Ice cool and you're colder than ever

[Verse 2]
Ice cold, cooler than ever
Never say never cause I'm so damn clever
Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips
V.i.p. posse and we're pimps
Be on the lookout in your vicinity
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity
Like robin hood gave to the poor
I rock kashla and now she wants more
She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy
In a rodeo somewhere out west
She screams out "vanilla ice, you're the best!"
Echoing out, can you hear?
She screams out everywhere
Just a pimp and you know
Snatchin' women, so, yo!
You can beg, plead and tell me you love me
But there's no way i'd put a girl above me
Unless it's sex and you wanna' ride
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Move your body all around
This is the dope jam, so get down
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it
This is the jam and vanilla just did it
I made you work 'til your butt got sore
In other words, I'm about to get raw
On stage, it's a v.i.p., doin' dances from a to zpumpin' it, pushin' it, stick it hard
I freaked your girl in the back of your car
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on
Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a trojan
Get ready, hyped into the groove
As I practiced to make your body move
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin'
This is the jam I know you're gonna like
Deshay he cuts like a knife
He won't smirk and he won't smile
Deshay get funky for a while
Yo, it's time for me to pump, pump..
Pump up the volume

[Chorus]</pre>
