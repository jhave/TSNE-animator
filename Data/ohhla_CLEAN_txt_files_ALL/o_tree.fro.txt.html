[Afroman]
Alright, here I go, here I go
[loud coughing]
Check it out!

Chronic Tree, O Chronic Tree
Wit' yo' leaves so sticky green
Chronic Tree, O Chronic Tree
So hard to sell, I want you all for me

The bong is smoked this side of town
L.A.P.D. tryna shut me down! 
Chronic Tree, O Chronic Tree 
Your leaves so green and sticky to me!

On the cover of High Times Magazine 
Zig-zags, water bongs for you I fiend
Chronic Tree, O Chronic Tree 
So hard to sell, I want you all for me

From Masta Town to the CPT 
Can't wait to pick yo' stems and seeds.
O chronic tree, O chronic tree 
So hard to sell, I want you all for me!</pre>
