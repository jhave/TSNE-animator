[Intro/Chorus]
She says she loves me but, she comes and goes when she pleases
When the door shuts, it's like another papercut
And I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceilin fan blades
Claims she loves me but, she cuts me into pieces
When I'm sewed up, here comes another papercut
Now I'm stuck with a hand full of band-aids
Until she comes back around like them ceiling fan blades

[Verse One]
We met twenty-two years back, fresh out the womb
Now she consumes me, no room for self these days
And she's so demandin - do this, do that
Don't forget to take your medicine
I hate it when her face is invading my head again
The welcome mat reads "please take off your shoes"
But she disregards the statement
I've grown accustomed to bending my beliefs
To, satisfy her needs but I'm fed up
with plugging cuts everytime they bleed
So I dip my pen in the puddle
What a bloody mess its been tryin to end this struggle
But I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her but
I'll sit alone 'til she comes back home
And I'll be waitin by the phone {*ring*} hello?

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
She don't live here no more; I heard she's stayin down the street
with a deadbeat that don't treat her right with two bad-ass kids
Guilt and regret, and I'm willin to bet
my last album that she's wishin she was kissin me

[Verse Two]
Man the nerve of this bitch, pardon my French but it's been 10 days
And I'm gettin kind of lightheaded
Maybe I'll write her a letter, in a gentleman's way
And send it, with the hopes that she might get it
I can't believe I let her run all over me
But, all I think about is when she's here and holdin me
I love her, she's the reason for the lesions
Man I love her, I start bleeding when she's leavin
And every scar on my fingertip is a reminder of
All the lessons learned on my missions tryin to find her and
I can't complain, I kind of like the pain
She ain't even got a name she just lives in my brain and

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Says she loves me but (she really thinks that I'm an asshlole)
She says she loves me but (my ears are too big)
She says she loves me but (I pick my nose too much)
She says she loves me but (she says I never really listen)
She says she loves me but (I take too many pills)
She says she loves me but (I never pay my bills)
She says she loves me but (I wait until the last minute)
She says she loves me but (I don't try hard enough)</pre>
