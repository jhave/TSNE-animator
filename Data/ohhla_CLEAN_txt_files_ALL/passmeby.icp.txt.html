Pass Me By

"Does this excite you? Think about it! Does it not stagger the 
imagination? No builder on earth can concieve any structure to 
compare to the mansions above. Won't that be something when you go 
to live in your own mansion? There'll be no concern about paying for it, 
it's already taken care of. There'll be no worry about veing moved out 
of it. It will be yours forever." 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I got shot, ah!, the murder was heinous 
The bullet went in my eyeball and out my anus 
And I was hit, that was it, on the spot 
Flash, I woke up in a parking lot 
And I'm sittin in a '64 Reinkeys 
With Shaggy Dope written on the car keys 
I look around I can't believe that it's possible 
I'm dead, and I made it to the carnival 
I walk in, it's everything I dreamed of 
Everybody and they momma got clown luv 
Japanese, Lebanese, and Chinese, 
Portuguese, and southwest ghetto g's. (woowoo) 
Hangin' out with redneck truck drivers 
Instead of always givin' each other piledrivers 
I see my old homey, he died in a drag
Chillin with two bitches, "What up, Shaggs?" 
And he passed me a blunt like a tree trunk 
I tried to hit it, but couldn't even fuck with it
And to think, I always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]
We all gonna die, but I'm not gonna fry
Even though most never try
I'm not gonna let this pass me bye, no

[Violent J]
I was born, first, they threw me in a shit pile 
I dealt with it, and lived there for a while 
I got dissed on, pissed on, and beat down
Mutilated, and tossed out a dead clown 
Next thing ya know, I'm chillin' at the big top 
Free money, and mad bitches non-stop 
No water, it's Faygo on tap 
I wash my hair, and my face, and my butt-crack with it
Cuz I can, cuz I'm phat paid 
I got a five story funhouse with a maid 
And she walks around with her titties hanging out 
And when I cough, she come and dust my balls off (woowoo) 
I'm headed up to the show, I'm gonna see 
Jimi Hendrix, Selena, and Eazy E 
Elvis tried to open up but got dissed off 
We got pissed off, because he sounded like butt 
There's no fights, it's a perfect match 
Hillbillies in the crowd tryin' to cabbage patch 
And to think, I've always been afraid to die 
But I ain't never goin back to wonder why. 

[Chorus (2x)]

[Violent J]
Did ya ever burn your finger on somethin? hey 
Well picture this, your nuts burnin that way
And a roman candle stickin' in your butthole 
That's where the greedy skank motherfuckers go 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
This is all hell now, we livin' in it 
But this bullshit'll be over in a minute 
Then it's off to the Faygos and neden hoes 
New clothes, and patent leather for your toes (woo-woo) 

[Violent J]
And while you sit around cryin' for your dead friend 
He's chillin' up there, paid, getting mad ends 
He's probably there tryin to figure out why you're sad
He's on the beach gettin' fat, you got it bad 

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
And for those who ain't down for the next man 
Who rob from the poor, and snatch all ya can 
And any chicken talkin' shit, lemme tell ya something 
Hold a lighter to your balls, and you'll see what's coming

[Chorus (2x)]
