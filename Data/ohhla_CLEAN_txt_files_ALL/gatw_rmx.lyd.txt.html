[Intro: Big Reese] (DJ Khaled)
Pop a bottle to this one! Hahahaha! (REMIX!!! WE THE BEST!!!)
Uh! (REMIX!!!! DJ KHALED!!!!!)
NEW LLOYD! Hahaha! (LLOYD!!!! WE GLOBAL!!!) LISTEN!!!!)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Pump up the brakes, pump up the volume
I rock all night cause I'm a motherfuckin stallion
Walk up in the club with this big ass medallion
Throwin up the dub like niggas from Staten Island
Who that that do that diamonds all blue black
The critics don't get it they think I'm one of those new cats
I'm a dog a rottweiler, ask Rockwilder
When Game and Lloyd come through in that drop 'Palla
It's Murder! Irv don't hurt 'em
When he come through in the Phantom the same color as syrup
I'm a criminal individual smooth as Beyonce
Skin I'm thick I stand out like Frank Lucas
Mink in the club cause I'm too iced out
You feelin me I'm feelin you let's get you wifed out
Throw on my Louis V belt and bring them new Nike's out
It's BlackWallStreet and Murder INC, lights out

[Chorus: Lloyd] {DJ Khaled}
(Girl I) can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh {LISTEN!!!!!!!}

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I got a brand new Ferrari Midnight Blue
It look like water and the rims do too
Shawty look like a model and her friend do too
Tell her I wanna kick it with your friend and you too
Ok wait see I ain't tryin to offend you two
Hey all I wanna do is recommend to you two (both of y'all)
Come over to the crib let me bend you two
Over one at a time put it in you two
I'm a fool with the money, cheap who honey?!
For the right woman I'll throw away a hundred
Grand I'm the man chrome on the Sedan
Same on the McClaren lil' mama like DAMN!
Yeah! I'm still hell on the scale
Danielle, Shantelle in the bed with Michelle
Double XL down there I swear
Panty pumper number one camel toe swinger

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
{Girl I} can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song {song}
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Lemme talk to 'em..ay
I'm lookin for a master suite
So I could wake her up, beat her back and put her BACK to sleep {*snores*}
And the picture's so perfect, call it masterpiece
And when my partna passed the Sweet, I passed a freak
We can do it in the middle wit the lights on
Give myself a high five wit a pair of Nike's on
Eh, now greet ya girl wit a salute, "How are you?"
Knock her boots from College Park and back to Guadalupe
Yea, take the passport, freak'um fly status
Got a chick in every area code, it don't matter (nope)
When daddy come home, drop the thong, no chatter (nope)
I take her to the room and make the headboard rattle
and when I'm in ?'legos? I hit 'er in the jungle
When I'm in Australia, I take her Down Under
And when I'm in London, it's tea and crumpets
I let her blow on me, like she plays trumpet

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
{Girl I} can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song {song}
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I got a paint that's wetter than a bank
She wanna hang like my yellow chain that's on the deck
She wanna bang, I make her day 'cause I'm never late
In foreign places everytime she wanna fornicate - press 48
I blow her mind wit the (technique), straight freak
House ski bay by next week, impress me
Impress me, Lexus, yeah the SC
Lloyd got the fox, and I got the best seats
Dressed like the SPs'- Boss


[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Well, I'm just pickin up my plans while I'm countin up grands
Got my chick in Japan, she my number one fan
Tell her bag the cash and grab a clean half
I'm take her, take up, go and get the Jacob
Send us to the money, you'll be back before I wake up
A-C-E, H-double O-D, the gangsta
Know I keep dat white girl, send it up to Asia
Later to Decatur, I cater them the greatest
Yah!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
{Girl I} can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song {song}
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long (REMIX!!!!!)
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)

[Verse 6: Young Dro]
Bought a friend to a club, ain't sweatin none of you
I bent nine times out of ten on either one of you
She's from Australia, headin down on the crew
Chill with my women in Brazil for a month or two
The panty pumper {?} I'ma do what I'ma do
Put the tounge under you and lick you where you want me to
Now I got her starin, this can get outta hand
My ice's transparent, chicks outta Japan
Got bruds in Malaysia, models in the Asia
They all wanna kick it with the Bankhead ray-pper
Put the gloves on, box that thang like Joe Frazier
She knew I had chips, so I free throw later

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
(Girl I) can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)

[Verse 7: Pitbull]
Chevy, Chevy on that 'annon fast
Flyin 'cross Dade County line
You could get wit this, OR you could get wit that, toot
This chico fine, no opinion, it's a fact
I am, not Will Smith, but +I Am Legend+
without the jawn, if you wanna +Set it Off+, let's get it on
I am freaky, oh, a lil' sneaky
Oh, a lil' kinky, oh, I get you wet wit my
lil' pinky, no I'm not a boat
No, you can't sink me so, watch your ass
Uh, if the money's tracable, I bank it
But I always bury the cash, then laugh (Hahaha!) 
You won't catch 'em in the Phantom, NO!
In a Maybach, NO! In a Lambo, NO!
Wit a bad one, YES! Hehe, she's not a chicken
but sh got two thick thighs and nice size breasts
God bless, haha!

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
(Girl I) can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)

[Verse 8: Busta Rhymes]
I came in the door, I said it before
I always let a beautiful ass magmatize me
Peep the way shorty studyinme now she analyze me
Makin me imaginin things that I can do to it
Make her throw it back like a king then I be losin it
Lost in the lovin when I give her the stuff
And tryin to be with you and playin around the world it's nothin
Hallucinatin crowds tapes of me and you fuckin
Now look homey when you see me bawl around your girl
Don't get mad it happens (All Around The World)
When I travel, I love the women and you know they love me
With a special embrace when I step in every country
Hehe, I know you love the way I get into it
I gotta laugh cause niggas respect the way we do it
This goes out to girls around the world who ask for it 
When I'm goin through customs stampin up my passport

[Chorus: Lloyd] (DJ Khaled)
(Girl I) can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
I Just wanna be your man, ohh (LISTEN!!!!!!!)</pre>
