(Slick Rick)
Well...
Kinda hungry
Have you eaten?
Hardly any
Walking down sunset boulevardnelly
I had this miner on the lock
She said 
That mutha fucker look finer 
Than a fuck
But he's an eastcoast cat
Pure jelly ass
Nigga kick a rap that can impress
My L.A. ass
Disrespect 
When I didn't deserve it
Hey you acting like earning the
Best rapper walk the earth yet (no)
I guess some big tymer tapping her
I huff, and puff
Blew her fat rat ass off
Blaze her
Shit, in the face
The most rapper
Why she acting like it didn't know
While I pulls up on her Rolls
I gets in it  
I'm like bitch it's 
Best you write down your number this minute
Catching her going
Just sparking off
And she came to her sister
Before the car took off

(Chorus)
We know what to do 
If we give you the chance
You'll fall in love
And all the time won't remain
The way you look
Your touch is fine
But I won't let you blow my mind

(Warren G)
Lodi Dodi
We like to party
My nigga slick rick 
Can still rock a party
It was 12:15 when I hit the scene
Fresh out from L.A.
Touching J.F.K.
I was on my way 
To go get my bays
I'm a real one from L.A.
So I gots to say
I hit my nigga slick rick
And said I'm in town
Get some puerto rican freaks
Cause it's got to go down
So we hit every girl in the N-Y-C
I'm rush associated 
So what's up with me
We fucked and flee off the hennesy
Girl just for me
Hit'em all for free
Beyatch!

(Chorus)

(Phats Bossi)
What?
Fast as suave-a
Boss will flip the script
The number one draft pick
So the G's is thick
Roll with Rick
Nigga that'll roll with me
Every man feel free
When he making a G
Is money constant?
And money all that I see?
I'ma breath this shit
Money coming with me
What you want with it
The boss stay committed
To drunk trying to pive it
Still I bust the sickest
Check it
Wreckless major carrots
In my necklace
Black lence and go kill'em with ??? shit
Perfect it now the game's obtain
And this don pieces eyes 
Peel jocking the ring
Trade the sex face
Baby keep the pace
Lots to do 
Little time
And is love to make
Promise you my pearl
Baby this my world
And even broke without a dime
You still be my girl
What!
