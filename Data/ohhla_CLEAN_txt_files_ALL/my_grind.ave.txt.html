[Intro]
In life we go after what we want or at least I do you heard?!
Powder!

[Chorus]
You bitch ass niggas can't see my grind (Uh uh, uh uh)
So you got no choice but to see me shine (Powder)
Oh no my brother we are not the ssme (Not at all)
'Cause I ain't no fraud I live what I'm sayin (Powder, Uh!)

[Verse One]
Walk like it, talk like it
I don't give a fuck nigga, New York like it
Or not, I'm Troy Ave get use to me
O.D.B. dead but this a new shimmy
New Biggie, R.I.P.
B.S.B drug deals and R.I.P.'S
I was buyin the lambo after I bought the mercedes
My big homey and my moms said nigga you crazy
Born in the 80's, I was just, baby with tears
It's grown men now, dressin like they from that year
Fuck is wrong with 'em, don't get along with 'em
Nah I don't wanna do no motherfuckin songs with 'em
Neither, am I cool with these F.A.G.'S
Fake ass gangstas nigga you are not like me
You hustle O.T. well nigga what town was you in
You bust yo' heat, well nigga what ground was they in
Huh?! The biggest deal out my borough to rap
Is me right here, real niggas know it's a fact
They hear me on the radio see my vids and trip
And tell they peoples, that nigga sold me a brick
I'm Troy Ave nigga, Harry Powder in the flesh
Know I'm bad nigga, and I would cause a fuckin death
When I'm mad nigga, other than that I'm cool
They sittin, I'm shittin, either way that's stool
Powder!

[Chorus]
You bitch ass niggas can't see my grind (Uh uh, uh uh)
So you got no choice but to see me shine (Powder)
Oh no my brother we are not the ssme (Not at all)
'Cause I ain't no fraud I live what I'm sayin (Powder, Uh!)

[Verse Two]
'Cause niggas don't grind like me, they don't shine like me
They ain't never go put in work with a nine like me
They some eight ballers they ain't never buyin no keys
They lyin they don't papi unless papi meetin me
That's the illest nigga rappin out of N.Y.C.
I'm in the hood I don't know niggas but they know
And I can easliy mistake their fanfare for grillin
And they can easily be layin in to wait for the killin
It goes down that simple where I'm from my nigga
And we don't lose no sleep fuck them my nigga
It's a cold city I'm just keepin warm in the fur
Lookin so damn pretty that these hoes kitty pur
Man I'm fuckin everything in my videos click back
We fuckin every dame that you see in the Bricks hat
Certain things happen that let me know I'm the shit
A chick flew in from Miami just to suck my dick
And pay for there own flight, the fuck I look like
A trick ass nigga that need pussy nah I'm aight
Niggas out here buyin hoes, bags and shoes
But couldn't buy there kid a brand new coats for school
Damn! It's unbelievable, they the same ones claimin they the realest
Real niggas don't hate jealous or they will steal shit
Or keep a hundred singles underneath a hundred buildings frontin
Powder!

[Chorus]
You bitch ass niggas can't see my grind (Uh uh, uh uh)
So you got no choice but to see me shine (Powder)
Oh no my brother we are not the ssme (Not at all)
'Cause I ain't no fraud I live what I'm sayin (Powder, Uh!)</pre>
