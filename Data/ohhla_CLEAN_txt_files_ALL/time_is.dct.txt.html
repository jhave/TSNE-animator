[it's, it's too short, it's too short]
[I have lots of time]
[they say time waits for no man]
[all the time]
[waisted time, waisted time]
[wait a minute]
[this'll just take a little time]
[time out!]

Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'
[tick tock!]
Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'
Tick, tick, tick, tock, tickin'

Here we go again
Straight up rock-n-roll
All that hip hop... ???... is... ???
Don't forget

Let's go
Here we go, everybody
Let's go
Here we go, everybody
Let's go
Here we go, everybody
Let's go, check it out

You got a gift and you best start using it
Cause if you don't you're gonna wind up losing it
Just like the brother who buried it deep
The task was simple but the price was steep
We got a mission while we're on this earth
We need to tell people 'bout our second birth
Get busy like a school boy makin' an "a"
Cause time my brother is tickin' away

[Chorus]
Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away
Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away
Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away
Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away

Right now is the time that we gotta get with it
The gift that he's given ain't just an exhibit
But a tool that he's given us to use for his sake
And just as he's given he can surely take
The signs of the times are dropping like flies
The cries of the people around us imply
They're lookin' for an answer that we already know
But time is definitely on the go

All the money in the world
Can never stop the hands of time
And a wasted day in your life is more than a crime

[Chorus]

Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'
Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'
You got a gift and you best start using it
Cause if you don't you're gonna wind up losing it
Get busy like a school boy makin' an "a"
Cause time my brother is tickin' away

[Chorus]

Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'
Time is tickin' away (6x)

Whoa, wait a minute...</pre>
