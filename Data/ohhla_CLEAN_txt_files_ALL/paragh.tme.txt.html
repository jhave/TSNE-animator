Too pretty for my I-N-K
Too special for my quick pen play
My lover my hater, my template, my teacher, my schizophrenic sensei
Plenty paid to break through your barricade
And they play like they pray but they afraid
Deep inside, tried to deny my weakness for you
Nothing like the feeling that you provide
Knowing it could be just you and I 
Then lose you, I would rather lose an eye
A man blinded by foolish pride
The savior of my life stands crucified

(Time)
Too beautiful to write about
Too fucked up to let the silence out
The only type of love that could bring my silence out
They ask how you doing? I say good in a silent shout
What does a fake face look like I ask myself in the mirror
The mirror doesn't respond but the answer is clear
We both got problems, every problem I got is from me
I'm shackled by my silence, that's why I write these words to be free
I'm not complaining, I got nothing but love for you
My only problem is that I'm selfish, I adore you
You're my universe, I'm a spaceship
I need a million lifetimes to explore you
Chivalries not dead I'm just not there to open the door for you

Too beautiful to write about, I don't need my pen
I wanna say it right now, thanks for being a friend 
So shine shine shine for the universe to see
Show them your love, your grace, your mercy

(C-Rayz Walz)
This ain't that hyphy sound, this is hypochondriac fact
Running from my true love, thinking it's a slug attack
Every time I hug I'm clapped
I'm stuck in the back plus I'm wack and I think I sound wack
What the fuck? I'm hearing things but nobody doing role call
Gun butt mentality, trying not to smoke y'all
I stay locked in the house, my excuse a broke arm
One arms not itching, the problem is, both are
The walls have eyes oh my keep the blinds close
Someone's been here, those aren't my clothes
Trade money for pain cause it makes no sense to feel
Mind of a fruit cake, thinking my skin will peel
Hallucinating, my favorite quota, you'll see
Too scared to use drugs, I'm afraid they'll abuse me
I can't stand to catch a flight, maybe one day I'll take a seat
But right now it seems airplanes are chasing me
Heart pounding insatiably, taking me ungratefully 
Mistaking the leaf as a string in my teeth to speak is relief
Insects dissecting me something's fishy like coy
I need space cause I'm trapped in the void, paranoid

(Time)
I'm as high as the street lights
I'll bleed to write
Cause if I couldn't write I'd probably need to bleed
To release the fright
One thing bout music it don't hit till its heard
The critic's foot is in the air, my careers on the curb
Vision blurred I'm staring at Guadalupe
I lost my religion got my love in a suitcase
Double knot the shoelace, take me to a new place
This world is fake it's full of two faces and tupays
I'm looking for that platinum plaque so I threw away the toothpaste
(you threw away your toothpaste?)
Tears in my throat, pride in my stomach
Pain in my past, maybe these songs will numb it 
How many people's opinions do you care about?
I reply this many, and that's plenty
Put on two pairs of glasses and you still can't see me
I'm hiding in the dark with Dracula and Stevie
You amaze me with your beauty and charm
What's the difference between love and blue magic in your arm?
They're both addicting and I'm jonesing for a kiss
I found you in my mind in a body called Chris
You're too beautiful for ink, that's why I adore you
Chivalries not dead, I'm just not there to open the door for you

Too beautiful to write about, I don't need my pen
I wanna say it right now, thanks for being a friend 
So shine shine shine for the universe to see
Show them your love, your grace, your mercy

I'm as high as the street lights
I'll bleed to write
cuz if I couldnt write I'd probably need to bleed
to release the fright
one thing bout music it dont hit till its heard
the critics foot is in the air, my careers on the curb
vision blurred I'm staring at quadelupe
I lost my religion got my love in a suitcase
double knot the shoelace, take me to a new place
this world is fake its full of two faces and tupays
I'm looking for that platinum plaque so I threw away the toothpaste
tears in my throat, pride in my stomach
pain in my past, maybe these songs will numb it 
how many people's opinions do you care about?
I reply this many, and that's plenty
put on two pairs of glasses and you still can't see me
I'm hiding in the dark with dracula and stevie
you amaze me with your beauty and charm
whats the difference between love and blue magic in your arm?
they're both addicting and I'm jonesing for a kiss
I found you in my mind in a body called chris
you're too beautiful for ink, that's why I adore you
chivalries not dead, I'm just not there to open the door for you</pre>
