{*instrumental for 15 seconds, then movie samples*}

"I have taught you well, everything I know
 You have even surpassed my skill
 But why is it so important?!
 Years ago, your father was a royal guard
 The best that there was
 He won many royal merits
 But still, during a special contest
 He was beaten by five {?} experts
 He was disgraced, and so was our Clan..."

"It was long ago, but he has never forgotten that day though
 And you are his only hope, to redeem the Clan
 and retrieve our honor..."
