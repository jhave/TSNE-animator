[South Park Mexican]
South Park from the heart, jump start the game
Everybody in my hood sellin' crack cocane
On my block, everything goes (Goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (Toes)
Candy paint on my Cadillac ('Llac)
Who the fuck wanna battle rap (Rap)
Believe me you don't have a chance (Chance)
I come down like an avalanche ('Lanche)

(Verse 1)
Load the pieces with Reeses, watch out lo que me dices
I'm on the mic and Jaime's workin' the (???)
Dickie creases, fucked all your nieces
I eat 'em up for breakfast, they taste so delicious
Smoke fill rooms, poppin' mushrooms 
I feel like I'm in a motherfuckin' cartoon
Sippin' on Red Rum
You should join us
A million haters, and they still can't destroy us
On the mic
I'm known to get it started
Cold hearted and half-ass retarded 
Dearly departed, and those who got guarded
The young and the lost
Is who I'm tryin' to target
The sergeant's narcotics division is crocked
They found my bloody money and the motherfuckers took it
Whoop this nigga, then book this nigga
And they wonder why I such a ruthless nigga
You can act like you don't hear me
I know your listenin'
I hear you talkin' out the pot that you pissin' in
Street specialist respect my intelligence
I got gats that's made to drop elephants

Chorus: South Park Mexican
On my block, everything goes (Goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (Toes)
Candy paint on my Cadillac ('Llac)
Who the fuck wanna battle rap (Rap)
On my block, everything goes (Goes)
Diamond rings on my pinky toes (Toes)
Believe me you don't have a chance (Chance)
I come down like an avalanche ('Lanche)

(Verse 2)
Twenty ounce Mountain Dew
Mix it with a two
With my nephew, smokin' Pepe Le Pew
Talkin' 'bout a doobie, don't think it's groovy
I'm a put him to bed like Sleeping Beauty
I told you once and I'm a tell ya twice 
But I'm not gon' say this three or four times
You boys wanna play
We don't runaway
God damn, I forgot what I was gonna say
Something about .45's and Mack 11's
Desert eagles and AK-47's
Slice your throat just like a goat
You boys can't see me with a microscope
Kick down your door
Found your snow
Smokin' tough cause you had a fuckin' pound of dro
And after I jack all the birds in your kitchen
I hit the butt naked
Then go feed the pigeons

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 3)
Crack hotels
Digital scales
Platinum necklace laced in Rockells
Shine my jewels
Buff my toe nails
Who kisses and tells, bees who sees hell
Smoke like a Rasta, watch the imposter
Who's at my door
A fucking Cookie Monster
Hasta la vista, bon appetit-sta
Twelve gauge shotty make your chest look like pizza
Call me Flintstone, land of Bedrock
I bought two clubs and a fuckin' restaurant 
Take a journey
Where the boys dine too early
.45 underneath a nigga's Rockets jersey
Turn the table
Buck shots be fatal 
Pigs handcuffin' my wrist, to my ankle
Mira muchacha, it's all about the raza
Burn my fingers, tryin' to smoke a cucaracha
They prejudice
That's why they don't play Mexicans
I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist
I started out with a hundred tapes 
If you wasn't down then, get the fuck out my face

Repeat Chorus</pre>
