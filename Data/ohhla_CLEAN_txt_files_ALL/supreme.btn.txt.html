Intro:
Meanwhile in the control room at the back of the theater...

These brats swam, I knew they would
Your plan is working master.
Of course!

(knocking) Who is it?
Special delievery.
Who? Who is it?
It's a special delivery.
Who is it. (Fuck it)
UPS open up.

Psycho Les:
I just got this product transported for essay, Gea, connect to say who ?
Kid coming at your speakers, is the same kid that be like (puuut puuut
puuut) coming in chicas
Keep shakin' that ass like a horny Egyptian, as we proceed to rip shit
Baby, I be S-T-O-N-E Crazy, red Mercury blow your spot up
I keep one eye on snakes the other on jakes
3rd eye on my money with no time to take a break
They only break I make is when I gab the breed and jump in the get-away
(It's got to be now) but for now is the only way
Pop my CD in your Sony play, twist a fatty, kick back
And enjoy what I got to say, cause this type of shit your don't hear
everyday

JuJu:
Big Ju, rugged and rawnchy, never nonchalantly
And huant me to live in this world that don't want me
A fowl nigga maybe the fowlest you'll ever encounter
Murder for the smallest amount, money to count
Cuban cable givin' cash around the table
My record label watchin' the sons steady and stable
Bit my shit, but you wack and wasn't able
Silence, we bringin' the violence from the cradle
Fatal when I see a bitch nigga and face, you like a foreigner frontin' in a
dangerous place
You in Corona, Stone City and Babalona
Dominicians got a tight grip Isatona

Pyscho Les:
Catch me in Corona, on a corner, hotter than Daytona
Sippin' Arizona, power moves on a celly phona
Touch tone flip, 9-11, the click, we connect like internet
Cash checks, blast techs, that burn holes to lest bet, faggots
Get they ass ripped, that quick, trying to play me like a camel
Fuckin' with my moola, telling me to change my formula
Alcohol and lye be the perfect combination, my organization move the nation
Like automation, with no hesitation, no doubt son (naw mean?)
It's off the books (it's off the books baby) It's off the books this year
baby

Hook:
Beatnuts, Supa Supreme team from Queens
Grand Imperial and misters say "whoyounawmean?" (x4)

Outro:
3 C-F Mafia. Corona Killers. Gray Cisco. Profile Baby
