Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
My life is perfectly terrible
The word perfect is like my, favorite word
Let me tell you
About my journey for perfection and why I should've got off the train along time ago
But for some reason the doors, they just won't open for me man, life

[Hook x3]
High as fuck
Turnt up
Nigga giving no fucks

[Verse]
I'm 24 years old, and you can ask anybody about me
They probably tell you the same thing
He fly as hell, he fresh as fuck
He probably feelin some type of way
I already know what they was gon' say
Cause they the reason I feel this way
But they'll never say it, they'll never say it
So the only soul I fuck with, is my Jordan's and my mama
And both girls I ever loved, had to call it quits cuz the drama
So I stop searching for love, and kept smoking this loud
Cause I thought when you this high, that you couldn't feel this down
I was wrong again (these hoes are ridiculous)
I was wrong again (real ridiculous)
Niggas gon' hear this song and probably think I'm going in (them niggas lame too)
But if you a real nigga, and you think that you know me
And you say that you my homie, then you shouldn't have to worry
Cause this song for them fuck niggas, and niggas who I don't fuck with
Now you wonder who he talkin bout
If you had to wonder, then the shoe fits
I don't understand these people just like I don't understand this government
All I see is these new buildings, but single mothers still struggling
I still see these homeless children, they ain't got no role models
And my flow is like flat screen, and y'all niggas is floor models
I get legal money and illegal money, but even legal money ain't legal homie
Cause the government gon' take it from us, so my middle finger is up (fuck 'em)
The best part about being me, is I ain't nothing like you
And if you were me then you probably wouldn't like you
The best part about life man, just should be living it
But everytime I try man, I just keep getting into shit
So I ain't changing for nobody, if you don't like me that's your problem
We can shoot the one if need to, cause real niggas gon' stay true
It always surprise me, that the realest niggas be the fakest man
And the underdog be greatest man, I said the underdog be the greatest man
I just wish I had a little help, like Marlon Wayans in 6th man
But I don't see it happening, might drop a tape and never rap again
Got a couple fans, hope they female
Went from selling clothes to weed sales
If I had yo bitch, nigga don't ask me no details

[Outro]
Yea man, thats pretty much
Thats the end of the tape
Hope you enjoyed
If you didn't
What can I tell u
You listened
Fuck nigga</pre>
