[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no you never let me down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down
Get up, I get down

[Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the rovers roll up wit ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see, niggaz can't fuck with me
Cuz I'm a be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God given
This is hard livin, mixed with crystall sippin
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus overlapping last four lines]

[Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggaz can't make it to ballads to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just don't be feelin it
Racisms still alive, they just be concealin it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even make me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized each 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggaz praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl's father past away
So I promised to Mr. Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cuz look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now romeo must die?
I know I got angels watchin me from the other side

[Chorus]

[J.Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you're apart of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe; the world
I'm tryna make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why it's spiritual
But I get my hymns from him
So it's not me it's he that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes
For your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm tryna give us us free like Sinke
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed
With a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the death
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of god reigns out

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Who else you know been hot this long
Started from nothing but he got this strong
Built the ROC from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Peddled bikes, got my nephews peddle bikes because they special
Let you tell it man I'm fallin well
Somebody must have caught hI'm cuz
Every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan em
Number one albums what I got, like four of em
More of them on the way, the 8th wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissin Jay will get you Mase'd
When I start spittin them lyrics niggaz get very religious
Six hail mary's please father forgive us
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggaz
They way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a livin legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive
