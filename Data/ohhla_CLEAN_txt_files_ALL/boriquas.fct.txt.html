"You ain't got no ends in mi casa"-Method Man from 'Method Man'
"Puerto Rico hooooo"

Doo Wop:
If your Puerto Rican and you know it clap your hands (clap clap)
If your Puerto Rican and you know it clap your hands (clap clap)
If your black, spanish, white whatever everybody clap your hands
And it's the Puerto Rican rebel
Crank up the treble bump up the bass
Doo Wop goin' ape
The kid from the tape What's Goin' On What's Goin' On

Fat Joe:
Niggas can't deal with the real WORD IS BORN

Doo Wop:
My nigga Joe good lookin' check it my title never got tooken
From San Juan to Brooklyn 
I am the undefeated undisputed
Eat cootchie fiend it every time I gets buddhed
Sip Corona with Mona the bitch from Myona
I didn't bone her (why?) cause she's a blood doner
And you know about the virus
Fuck 5-0 Doo Wop is New Yorks Finest
DJ slash MC competition envy
Cause I bounce in each and every Benzy
Check me with Frankie Cutlass
Uh Boriquas On Da Set motherfuckers

Hook
"Mic check Boriquas on the set"
"Yeah you ain't got no ends in mi casa"-Method Man from 'Method Man'   
(x4)

Fat Joe:
YEAH guess who comes out the camp
The undisputed heavy weight Bronx champ
Niggas know the time niggas know the deal 
Niggas know that nigga Fat Joe is mad real
Check it who wants to disrespect 
Iraq connect I take your life in a sec (boom boom)
Fuck around now you Snaggle Pusses foe
Flip it in spanish and be like ?mamma man lecho?
It's the illest nigga from the BOOGIE DOWN
Represent everyday with the FOUR POUND
Rap aggressor, MC stresser
When ever horny I'm fuckin' bitches on my dresser
Even downtown white boys recognize
Fat Joe number one yo it ain't no surprise
I'm rippin' mics for days to days
And I plan to Be Around like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Fat Joe on the track with Frankie Cutlass
Yo Boogie bring on the motherfuckin' ruckus

Hook

Evil Twins:
I sit back and I simply wonder rappers ponder
I stick I move my crew makes noise like thunder
It's the third haven't you heard thats another story
The board of Rican is steadily seekin' for my piece of glory 
(yeah) When I say glory I don't refer to riches
Cause riches put a lot of niggas in our new ditches
Sometimes material dreams make ya scheme
Now ya nature graffitti on the wall in the streets scenes
Check it attention eruption invastion
My height, my pride my stride means I'm not caucasion
Yeah you best leave this kid alone
I have melatone not fully blown
But I've been known to bless a microphone
See True &amp; Binky keep it real kickin' street facts
Head cracks for the blacks and the aerowax
My Aztec roughnecks get love too
And if you ain't from the ghetto then motherfuck you

Hook
