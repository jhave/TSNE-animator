[Intro]
Hohhhh-ah
Hohhhhhhhh

[Verse 1]
At first it started with the eyes
I'm like uh-uh, no way, yo sister, can't no
And so the tension slowly build
You got them slanted eyes that kills, all systems go
Then you kissed my cheek, my knees get weak
My heart just skipped a beat, so I just froze
Then you touch me there I knew you wouldn't
Girl you touched me good, I'm like uhh-oh
Ohhhhhh girl

[Chorus]
Know what, know what, know what, you know what?
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
It hurts me, it hurts you, it hurts me, what you do
Was so sood, so good, so good, so good

[Verse 2]
Let me show you where you went wrong
You know that our sex took us to and fro
Then you had the nerve to say you're hurt
And fix your mouth to blame the Cuervo
Then in me you couldn't find a compromise
And I'm just like you know what you chose
I don't want to say it again, but here it goes
Fuck it, we're just friends, now where's my clothes?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What am I gon' do when I can't get anymore
I'd rather not nooooooooo-oh
Cause if you wanna know the truth
Nobody made me cum like you, I just roll over
I can't let my mind think of you
I hit that dial and get you on the phone
Cause baby it's just not the physical
I get with you I'm addicted to your moan

[Chorus]

The rumors {*3X*}

[Breakdown]
This ain't right (you know it's so)
You know I want it (you know it's so)
You know I want it (you know it's so
(You know it)
Girl this ain't right (you know it too)
You know I want it (you know it too)
You know I want it
(I'm mad at you)

[Verse 4]
You try keep your feelings inside the ropes
Vut then you weigh me down when you see me like hey hello~!
Now you know we never cared of a public place
I see it in your face and those were magnific' times don't go
How we gon' stop?

[Chorus]

[repeat 2X]
Your friendship means the most to me
Hohh-ohhh</pre>
