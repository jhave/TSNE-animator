Uh-huh, yaknahmean?  (Yeah)
Lobster shrimp nigga, I'm a pimp nigga
Feel the game that I spit.. lobster shrimp nigga

Yeah, c'mon
From the gutter to the rich
From holes in my clothes to the most butter shit
How's life, what a bitch
Now I rock ice for the fuck of it
Your wife love my shit, know who you fuckin with?
Jay-hovah, 'fore I never got no play
Now these bitches wanna give me more head than Sade
(Say what?)  Crisp in the 6 withcha bitch parlayed
I need privacy I pull up the back shade
Initials on the headrest, it's official
Style so sick I need bedrest, nigga I got issues
(Say what?)  I hate fake bitches, "you gotta wait" bitches
"I don't know you, I don't fuck on the first date" bitches
(Is that right?)  Hot shot niggaz, talk to the cop niggaz
"Money, that's my girl," cock block niggaz
See you in the club, and scheme on your watch niggaz
Talk a lot of shit with, no Glock niggaz
It's Jigga baby, let it be known
I'm the king, I could never be dethroned
Thank God

Uh-huh, yeah yeah yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yo
Is you a pimp nigga?  (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
Well spit the game nigga  (Lobster and shrimp nigga)
Yo, ain't nuttin changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
And I came to put it down for y'all, what?

Call me, fitty plus, niggaz envious
Drop top, Jigga, leave em in the dust
You got a lot of crew, do any of em bust?
Hell no, Jigga off the hook, "Hello!"
They call me poppy seed, this is hot to me
I got this lock and key, I got cities Under Siege
When I'm in L.A. the six-four is ill
When I'm in the A-T-L it's the Coupe DeVille
When I'm down in Miami, I'm hoppin through
with the all black Ninja with the sock over my shoe
Mami screamin, "Papi chu', who keeps stoppin you?"
And I'm screamin, "Not a cat, Money holla back"
It ain't nothin but beginners, and y'all in the game
but y'all can't ball like Chicago centers
This is it niggaz, get your grip niggaz
It's about to get hot mami, Who You Wit?  "Jigga!"

1 - 	Is you a pimp nigga?  (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)
	Well spit the game nigga  (Lobster and shrimp nigga)
	Ain't nuttin changed nigga, you know the name Jigga
	And I came to put it down for y'all

	Is you a pimp nigga?  (Yes I'm a pimp nigga)

[Jay-Z] Snatched the case of Crist' up out the car
Can you stand the rain cause it's pourin now
[Timbo] I hope she likes porno flicks cause she starrin now!
[Jay-Z] If the answer is no, she speakin foreign now
[Timbo] Just let a brotha know, I turn my car around
[Jay-Z] Freak or freeze, if the answer really is no
Girl I leave so fast you can speak to my breeze
She said, "You're stressin me now,"
Said, "No No No," then, "Yea yea yea" like she Destiny's Child
