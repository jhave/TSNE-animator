This is dedicated to the niggaz that was down from day one

(*Cell Block opened*)
Welcome to Death Row
..like we always do about this time

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Ha haa haaa haaa, yeah, nine deuce
Death Row Records, creeping while you're sleeping
Niggaz with attitudes, no Loc, niggaz on a motherfucking mission
What up niggaz and niggettes?
That crazy-Ass-nigga is back in the motherfucking hizzouse
Yeah, with notorious Compton G
D-R-E on a solo tip, fuck them other fools
What up Ren?
Yeah, dropping Chronic flakes on your ass bitch
West Coast flavor
Niggaz who talked shit, get dealt with real quick
So if you wanna take a trip to the Row
Let a nigga like Snoop Doggy Dogg know
Protected by niggaz with big dicks, AK's and 187 skills
So if it's must you test us
We can handle it the streets nigga, fuck making records
Yeah, G's up, whores down
If that bitch can't swim, she bound to drizzown
Peace to my nigga Drizzae, another platinum hit nigga
Peace to The D.O.C, still making it funky enough
And Death Row Records is in full motherfucking effizzect
Awww yeah, PS: Fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo
A.K.A. Jerry and Eazy
Sincerely yours, deeez motherfucking nuuutz
I don't love Eazy
I don't love Jerry
I don't love Ruthless Records
Frankly, I don't love nothing they got to do with
But.. but.. but you know what I what you do for me?
Jerry and Eazy, check this shit right here
I want y'all to put this bizzalls, in your jizzaws
And walk them like a strizzaw, tell me what you sizzaw
Yeah, you know what? - you know what?
Fuck all y'all, fuck y'all, really though
It's Death Row nigga
You better ask somebody, you really better ask somebody

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know them no more

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah nigga, youse a penguin looking motherfucker</pre>
