Party and bullshit, party and bullshit
Posted the mall like who?
I don't have the air I don't like you
Three four rose and they're all like uuu
I don't have a ball like cowboys do
I do what I want when I want
Unlike you, tonight alpha two
What it do, what it don't, what they do, what they don't
Baby just jump, just jump, and you don't
Baby let's rap, big girls for my all freaky friends, and freak all tonight
Baby let's rap cause I'm ready to motherfucking party, yo all know

You look like you're... so get on the floor, show me what you can do
Cause I wanna rock with you
I want together on the chair, let's move on the chair
Touch me like you ain't scared, cause I'm about to touch you
Everybody get up with me
You got that fire yes you do
Let me show you everything I can do
Let me show you everything I can do, let me show you

You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party
You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party

Everybody get up with me, let me give fair warning
I just like I want it cause I can, and I know you want it
.. let's keep it going
Everybody get up with me, you got that fire yes you do
Let me show you everything I can do, let me show you
Let me show you everything I can do, let me show you
You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party
You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party

Everybody get up with me, and dance, dance like you got it going on
It could be a fast or slow song, don't let it... right or wrong
And dance, dance like you're dancing by yourself
Don't think about nobody else
See you did it because of what you felt
And dance
Everybody get up with me, let me give fair warning
I just like I want it cause I can, and I know you want it
Just do your thing like you do
I need to see you I wanna get into it, let's keep it moving
You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party
You could rock my party, you could rock my party, you could rock my party

You got that fire yes you do
Let me show you everything I can do, let me show you
You got that fire yes you do
Let me show you everything I can do, let me show you</pre>
