[Un-Kasa]
Catch me Ot maybach wit' a bitch
2 macks strapped to the lips Now rapidly spit
2 bad brazilian bitches wrappin' my spliffs
2 Byrds strapped to they hip Purple seats lavender 6
Hundred' thou' just to wrap up the wrist
Nod you head cash in your whip
Got the crack stash in the van
Yo them macks I got them stashed in the trench
Empty clips 2 when I'm havin a fit
2 guns I ain't havin' that shit
Diplomat purple city better honor that shit
