[Murphy] Yo y'all got another pair headphones in there I could use?

[King Jacob]
Uhh, King Jacob
Yeah, Fala Beats
Murph, Durph, ohh (Derrty E.N.T.)
We all we got

[Chorus: King Jacob]
My niggaz we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The girls gon' bounce, the gangstas gon' groove
My nigga we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The playas gon' win, the haters gon' lose
I said we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The girls gon' bounce, the gangstas gon' groove
My nigga we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The playas gon' win, the haters gon' lose
I said we gon' stomp

[King Jacob]
7 in a day roller, bong smoker, dope choker
Fo'-fo' two hundred spoker, Polo sporter, bet I poke her
Call me Mr. Roper, medulla oblongata slicer
Shoot dice up, pursue the juice that move the price up
'F' you if you don't like us, fool, your life up
Me removin my foot from ya ass know that's that screwed my Nike up
Like Ruben I'm uhh, "Sorry" for my rap presence in the game bein Derrty
Now I rock 'til two-thousand-forty
Last call for that Bacardi
It be me bein corny on TV with Barbies, think some girls in Cali saw me
Cause I'm a flyer individual while hire individuals
I'll fire individuals, I'm critical
A King (King) named Jacob (Jacob)
Me, Murph Durph make missies poke end up in mini-skirts
Game shooter, high poster, aim through the
center of the frame, we Derrty-ly Entertain

[Chorus]

[Murphy Lee]
For you nosy, you nosy muh'fuckers, barbershop-ass niggaz

Yo, aiyyo Timb' boots, starch jeans, brand new, white tee
Hundred dollar button on, mo' colors than Ice-T
Haters didn't like me, "School Daze" like Spike Lee
Now most likely like Mike Tyson they bite me
Dressed just like me, dreads just like me
Nine times out of ten they more fruity than Hi-C
Gon' head and bite him then, offer that fool a Heinekin
Claimin that he tighter then, don't add up so I'm minus'in
Always in her vagina when under blankets like Linus man
(Why?) Cause I da man and all royal My Highness and
Rolls truck, turkey leather seats with a hole in it
Beef-brown woodgrain, pork didn't go with it
Fish tank in the trunk, chickenhead on my lap
Even King Jacob, now he gettin head in the back
Hoes, clothes, automo's, smokin 'dro, all I know
All them questions leave 'em on the other side of the MO

[Chorus]

[Prentiss Church]
We gon' stomp down the club flo', stomp down the punk ho
Stuck coast-to-coast niggaz slump from the steel-toe
Write me a stomp rhyme, beat down and stomp mines
Beat a punk nigga to the flo' and you know it's stomp time
Fuck a two-step, like a band march
On the good foot, for your hood boy
Church better recognize, Mr. Prentiss for president
Bitches better pay ya ties, we keep a rappin veteran
Derrty knockin let me in, known for kickin the door dawg
Think that you better niggaz show me, let's have a stomp-off
Go hard, stack your cheese up until you can't see the sky
Haters be hatin, love to hate me but wanna be this guy
Catch him at his foul play, hawk him like a hallway
Chalk him and mash him, happens often, matter fact, all day
Haters can't stand us, stomp if ya cash up
Hoes twist that ass up, now stomp - c'mon, faster

[Chorus]</pre>
