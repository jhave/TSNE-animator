[KJ-52]
It was after the show and he came by
He walked over and he said hi
He opened his mouth and I wanted to cry
I felt a tear run down my eye

[Chorus]
I said sirrrrrrr ya bref stank
I said sirrrrrrr ya bref stank
I said sir ir ir ir, ya bref sta sta stank
Sir I gotta tell ya, ya bref stank

[KJ-52]
Ya see kids, here is the reason why
His breath smelled like somethin died
All I wanted to do is jus run and hide
I looked at him and I jus replied

[Chorus]

[KJ-52]
I know it was mean just to be honest wit you
What else could I say, what else could I do
He jus kept sayin, Hello, Hallelujah, how are you?
I leaned over and I started to puke
