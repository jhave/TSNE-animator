Glass face
It's Lil B
Going back
You already know, you can hear the gudda
You can hear the fuckin hood
All good, I know you hear the hood

Lil B how you worldwide with no commercials?
Sit back, take notes, got the game in focus
Niggas hate I don't trip, my heart don't skip
In the heart with your clique, he heart gon speak
But you can't go man, that's that heartless shit
Fuck niggas, I'm a talk this shit
Motherfuckers talk often shit, you can't handle my life
I'm awkward bitch, you feel me?
Like the dude at the corner store on the payphone
Talkin bout a calling card, think he at the shopping mall
Buying rocks, spendin bout 500
Smoking so much rock he on the moon
Based God, beautiful complex like a snow flake
Wake up and spray
Or maybe pray, that's what they all say
Live life, that's what they all say
Some sleep and never wake up
Put the mack tee lips and I ain't talkin bout make-up
Bullet in your... it ain't no case man
I'm down for this shit, I'm straight
And I ain't never been fake
Fuck that reason, them fakes
Back to bless you, talk specials
I'm a get you, I'm the made man
Cut the check, we're grown men
You feeling me?
In my hands, the same color as Conan's
I'm so and off grand, the same color as Conan's
Guns in the back, right by the trash can
How I move man, you would call me Batman
Give bitches the back hand and that in my right four eyes
Mom said take on sight
Stay polite, fuck life
I love earth, that's life
Sometimes I'll wrong a right
Well I don't know and I don't give a fuck man
It's just something nice as that king shit
Lil B shit, this that gat shit
All black shit, this that motherfuckin mag shit
This that I'm talkin with an accent
Ebonic, sleep on it
Perfect linger some straight eggs
Coming through with the straight nets
Because I'm sleepin
Layin niggas out man, I'm the deacon
Fuck em
