[Chorus]
The ice I got on goes
Bling a blinga blingggg
Ya girl keep calling
My phones like
Ringa ringaaaa
We keep ballin
To us it's not a thinga thing
My money go chinga Ching

[Eddie Barnz]
10 bottles of HENNY
10 bottles of d'usse
Bitches around us
they think we shooting a movie
No pictures little man
We feeling to groovy
Even the boujiest models
Lets us feel on their booty
Got my chain all swinging
My ice all blinging
Niggas asking
For money
Fuck is you thinking
50 cents a shot
What the fuck is you drinking
No touching that bottom shelf
No hand outs
Help your self
My heart cold as hell
Yo mommy
Roll this L
And soon as the swishas lit
U can get some dick
And I might trick a bitch
But I ain't tricking on a bitch
And I might trick a bitch
But I ain't tricking on a bitch

[Chorus]
The ice I got on goes
Bling a blinga blingggg
Ya girl keep calling
My phones like
Ringa ringaaaa
We keep ballin
To us it's not a thinga thing
My money go chinga Ching

[Eddie Barnz]
10 models around me
10 killers around me
The way I'm protected
You'll think my head got a bounty
I brought out the females
In every city and county
Get thrown out every club
My team is too rowdy
My rings keep shining
Eyes I blind them
GPS your bitch
Homie I hope you can find her
She in the bathroom
With king turn up behind her
But leave that shit alone
Or you'll leave wit a shiner
Jidddda jays on
Barnzys amazon
Dumped a bottle of rozay
On a model she's Asian
Fresh cut with the waves on
If they drowning
Don't save them
fresh cut with the waves on
if they drowning dont save them
noooooooooo

[Chorus]
The ice I got on goes
Bling a blinga blingggg
Ya girl keep calling
My phones like
Ringa ringaaaa
We keep ballin
To us it's not a thinga thing
My money go chinga Ching</pre>
