[Violent J]
Bitch back up cause your dimmin' my shine
You got nine kids, only two of em mine
I get you cigarettes, weed, pampers and simalack
Bitch start giving back, fuck hittin' that
Your shit loop like a bowl of soup
And everytime I'm with you I'm smellin' nothin' but baby poop
You got week food stamps and eighty seat
Why you still fuckin' wit me? you dirty scoundral
And I'mma murder any friend of the court
Throw a bomb in they office on the way to the airport
Then blast off, catch a flight to another life
Five baby mommas everyone of em trife..hoes
They won't stifel, always wanna fight and for what?
Get the rifle, one to her butt, POP!
I won't have it, bitches don't fly straight
And I got two more bitches callin' sayin they late
Baby momma blues..

[Hook]
Deadbeat moms are chasing me, ain't no one on my side
I'm packin' all my shit up and I'm taking off tonight

[Esham]
Fuck my baby momma, with that baby drama
Callin' me while I'm in the Bahamas with Lanna and Donna
Two freaks that I met with the hummer from last summer
Anyway bitch, how'd you get my new number?
Fuck my baby momma, she need a new weave
The bitch did something that I couldn't believe
She called up a priest, she called the police
And then called the lawyer and took half of my piece
Fuck, my, baby momma
I can't see it like Stevie Wonder
All I know is when it rains, it thunders
My baby momma, took me under
Fuck my baby momma, and my thirty kids
Don't tell me about shit that none of em did
To all you deadbeat moms who be bringing the drama
Fuck you and friend of the court, and fuck my baby momma

[Hook]
Deadbeat moms are chasing me, ain't no one on my side
I'm packin' all my shit up and I'm taking off tonight

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I got the baby momma blues, from in my shoes
You don't love them kids, you only keep em to use
Ya breathe fire, all your baby daddies are rappers
How that happen? you got me plottin' to kidnap ya
Baby momma, baby momma, baby momma, FUCK OFF!
All I know, you should've just jacked me off
He looks like me, bitch he looks just like you, DAMN
Just a piece of neden for cuttin' some ooh
Bitch I bought you a trailer, It wasn't enough
You met some punk, and he stoled your stuff
You wrecked your car, they cut off your phone
Baby mommas blowing me up, AIN'T NOBODY HOME!
How much money just for three kids
I got three other hoes layin' down they biz
Don't think I won't choke out all four of they faces
I got baby mommas in phenomenal places

[Hook]
Deadbeat moms are chasing me, ain't no one on my side
I'm packin' all my shit up and I'm taking off tonight

[Talking]
There you have it man, these hoes done lost they mind man
These hoes keep tryin' to hit a brother wit charges
So I just keep on hittin' em wit dodges you know what I'm sayin'?
These hoes, just step up off me man
I don't give a fuck what the DNA say you hear what I'm sayin'?
Fuck what the DNA say, I just had another one man
Yeah, it's tryin' to get me, I don't know man

But if they break up out this..</pre>
