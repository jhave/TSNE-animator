[Intro: Joell Ortiz] (DJ Tedsmooth)
A one two, a one two (Tedsmooth!!!) A one two, a one two (Straight Face!!!)
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz (You remember!!!)

[Verse One: Joell Ortiz]
Uh! The feet is Nike the jeans is Levi
The tee is white the fitted is N.Y.
My box are Diddy the box is pretty
But the bottle inside a have you wobblin dribblin
I rep the most poppin city (New York)
The apple is rotten the blocks is gritty the ave is gwoppin
Decoys is lurkin toys is squirtin
Tuck that hurt in them boys is hurtin
We gamble wild the games get violent
The hammers loud the neighbors silent
The cameras flash the sirens flare
The ambulance ain't fast you dyin there
To pay cable you grindin here
The kitchen table a white affair
The rappers spit the time is near
I'm straight hood that's how I'm rhymin yeah!

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
A one two, a one two, a one two, a one two 
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz 

[Verse Two: Joell Ortiz]
Uh! The boots is Tim's the jeans is Polo
The hoodie is Champ the skully is Solo
The leather is Pelle the AB's no go
I'll let you slide if the ball is Ocho
I'm too cool can't ruin my mojo
Don't fuck you dicks pause no homo
You talk slick you 'gon fall in slow mo
My right quicker with the force of Cotto
I write hits on my thoughts I'm oh so
Starlight like a toss from Romo
The theater is wack we bottleg movies
Too much for packs the moves is Lucy's
The broads is bad with awesome fatties
It turns you on when they call you daddy
The butter is shower the high is sweet
The love is yaowww and you like this speech

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
A one two, a one two, a one two, a one two 
I like to, introduce myself, my name is, Joell Or-tiz
