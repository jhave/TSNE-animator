Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, uha
Better pump this in your jeep, gotta turn the volume up
Wanna smoke a little of this stuff, that's the way we blaze on up
Better pump this in your jeep, better turn the volume up
Wanna smoke a little of this stuff, that's the way we blaze on up
Boy ain't a freak like me, that do it constantly
Make sure you keep busy, wanna feel the part of me

[Adina] (Missy)
You make my heart beat faster (yeah)
You got me ill flow like a rapper (ooh)
I'll blaze you with good sensations
Your loving be my first occupation
This is how I'm puttin' it down
For my peeps on the other side of town
Can you tell me are you feeling me
And if you're feeling me then bump this in your jeep
Play this in your jeep

[Missy]
Oh, ah, baby, show me love, better pump this in your jeep
Oh, ah, baby, crank me up, better turn the volume up
Oh, ah, baby, show me love, wanna smoke a little of this stuff
Oh, ah, baby, crank me up, uh, aha

[Adina]
Baby were you fine along me
Won't you come and spend some time
Won't you come and chill with me
I know you wanna smoke this *cough*
All I ever wanted you to do, ooh
Is to feel me
I wanna sit and get you in the mood
But you gotta play this in your jeep, in your jeep

[Missy]
Oh, ah, baby, show me love, better pump this in your jeep
Oh, ah, baby, crank me up, better turn the volume up
Oh, ah, baby, show me love, wanna smoke a little of this stuff
Oh, ah, baby, crank me up, yeah, yeah, aha
