[Intro]
Yeah... Roscoe (Tabasco)
Soopafly on the track
It's real big tonight
(How big is it?) Soopa' big
C'mon

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
It's that time again, we in the place to be
Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there
Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere
It's that time again, we in the place to be
I love to see, everybody wanna party with a D.P.G.
Take a toast and we can get ready for the good part

[Roscoe]
Here we go again, Crenshaw Boulevard
Hittin' switches in the fours again
Time to go Spring Break shoppin' and get some clothes again
All eyes as we rollin' in under the influence
Hit the Beverly Center
The Hennessy and mystic mixed with this indo got me lifted
O-Dizzle with the bomb dizzle, let my nizzle Bizzle twist it
Be legit and stack, now let me hit it
Ladies chase me and busta's scheme
To see me caught up in the twist is a busta's dream
We too fly when we cruise by
Me and my Westside riders and plus my original squad
In PA sippin' E&amp;J
Dippin' the everyday Chevrolet's candy painted
Got my eyes wired shut
Kick back for a minute, let my high rise up
I can't be faded, tough guys wise up

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
It's that time again, we in the place to be
Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there
Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere
It's that time again, we in the place to be
I love to see, everybody wanna party with a D.P.G.
Take a toast and we can get ready for the good part

[Roscoe]
You wanna party with a D.P.G.?, then come and holla at me
I'll be up at DoggHouse with all the homies
Poppin' my collar happy, doin' it big as ever
In the City of Angels, Devils, and pretty weather
The 'Shaw packed with bumper to bumper traffic
All bouncin' and 40 ouncin'
Hydraulic with it, alcoholic with it
Bumper paint and polished, demolished
But we ain't trippin', we got heavy wallets
Sittin' on dubs, rollin' on three wheels
On the four with mugs, on the four with big wheels
Just breezin', and all the non-believers eventually gon' end up believin'
Roscoe Desoto the brown bomber, Philly Phanatic
Automatic packin' with my khakis saggin'
Philaphorn-I-A, Y.A., where everyday is Friday
C'mon

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams]
It's that time again, we in the place to be
Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there
Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere
It's that time again, we in the place to be
I love to see, everybody wanna party with a D.P.G.
Take a toast and we can get ready for the good part

[Roscoe]
You know the Young Assassins gon' get it crackin'
Everytime we mashin' - runnin' 'em up, actin' a straight nut
When the yak in my cup spills, I get a refill
Enemies plottin' on me, y'all better keep chill
I put it down like a G supposed to
And show you somethin' that only a G could show you
Makin' all the cheese, leavin' mice with tofu
Young but I'm cool, laid back and old school
Come here girl, let me show you how to G walk
And maybe after we could sneak off
I'ma - talent scout with a casting couch
If you ain't got no talent, ya gotta get out
Let me rock the breezies one time with my raw rhyme
I'll show 'em how to do the snake with they jaw line
I'm D.P.'d out, with every piece of love in the club 'bout to follow me out
And they all mine

[Chorus: LaToiya Williams] - X 4
It's that time again, we in the place to be
Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there
Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere
It's that time again, we in the place to be
I love to see, everybody wanna party with a D.P.G.
Take a toast and we can get ready for the good part</pre>
