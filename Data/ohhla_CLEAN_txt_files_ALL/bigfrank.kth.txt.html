Yeah, two-thousand-two
I don't hear you no more
The K-double-O-L, the K-E-I-T-H
Check it out

I trust talent, whattup Flex, JoJo and K-Ci put me on next
Eighteen times let my record play like Dr. Dre and Jay-Z
All man headline like Beenie Man; work it out this time - don't bother
Make hits like "Planet Rock" Bambataa
Dance floor stiff beat break your jaw
I cancelled the Limp Bizkit tour
Let your braids and afro grow more
One year I hear about you, next year I don't hear about you no more
Got people in Oakland, Bronx Lebanon to Fillmore
Carry updated trunk funk
That stuff you program is for punks
I can't lay up big shots gotta pay up move in the penthouse way up
(Way up, way up..)

Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side

Brother move your feet, don't front on my funk shit
Jealous cats like you should jump ship
Right from my left nut like a vice grip
Cognac take a sip you look burnt out
I don't like the two-way pager stickin out my hip
No time for voicemail
I bring heat in the city on Amtrak and monorail
Why you makin tracks like L.A. Reid and Babyface?
How that gin and tonic taste?
Korg adapter, Yamaha in the suitcase
Just dance, don't look and nobody two-faced
Brown man, all head like Tupac
Cadillac frost blue, yellow convertible rag top
Girls enter the club with Lonnie Rich
Chevrolet Impala green SS on dubs
Don't front on me one bit I pull ladies out of fly cars with love

Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side

Walk around for the playin captain of rap skills
Eatin, big smoke comin out of my Ampex reels
Sit in the back of your Escalade, tell me how my bass feels
From Big Nixons down to the beta
George in New Orleans rattle your dashboards
Bounce strippers around sounds echo from New York to Decatur
Exhaust pipes, white kid drivin a limo I'll see you later
Leather boots or gator
Turn your head hater
Lockerroom packed like the Los Angeles Raiders
We the real eliminators, we come down on diamond elevators

Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
Big Frank drivin - leanin to the side
Side, side, sa-sa-side, side
