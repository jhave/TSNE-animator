Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[B.o.B]
Yeah we finally on, tell the world we on
Yeah we finally on, tell the world we on
Tell the world we on, tell the world we on

That's that's that I live for [x3]
Who we sent get real
Tell the world we on

[Iggy Azalea]
Life like blissing, eh TIP done made an investment
It's hustle game till I'm resting
Plus rounding round and I'm flexin
Hundred racks for a show, run it
Broke, I blow hundreds
See you talking 'bout not money
What you talking 'bout? Nothing Nothing
GDOD, get doe or die we do
Powder blue Guiseppes and [?] and Maserati coupes
To all my bitches that's pretty and got a body too
Tell 'em throw that dough in the air
And go catch

[Chorus: T.I.]
I said we kitsch bitch million dollar misfits
Million dollar misfits, million dollar misfits
We kitsch bitch, million dollar misfits
Million dollar misfits, million dollar misfits
Finally on (That's just's what I live for)
The world we on
Yeah we finally on (That's just's that I live for)
(That's that's that I live for )
The world we on (That's just's that I live for
Who we sent get real)

[B.o.B]
I said, I said, I said I hop in the coupe
Then I throw up the deuce
I take my city every where I go
In that A hat salute
You see is hustle gang bang bang bang
We too hard to can bang
Ain't no candidates ridin' over beat, that murder business campaign
See I roll up the ciggy, burning donuts with Iggy
Anywhere we land on the globe, we the hottest in in yo city
Your woman know when we coming she gon' pop up any minute
She poppin nails, poppin pillies
Might cop a Porsche, pop a wheelie

[Chorus]

[Iggy Azalea]
Okay shining all I know, and balling all I do
Get the millions when the spring and summer fall I do
Falling through, you saw my crew
We red carpet ready, you say you are as who
Dead fresh like we woke up on the runway
Damn, body bangin like gun play
Red bottoms no high tops no sick rocks
No Hyundai I'm dumb paid
Couldn't get 3 stacks outta Andre
They ask me what I want, I ask 'em what you got
Everything private plane multi million dollar yacht
Got that on my hand, mansion
On my way to Cabo, riding suicidal
Get money by the [?]

[Chorus]
Tell the world we on</pre>
