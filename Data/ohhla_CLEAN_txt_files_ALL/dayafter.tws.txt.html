The day after... the day after...

"Are we on the air?  Yes, we are live at the scene
 of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building.
 The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista.
 Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_.  The big question is,
 will the rapper survive?"

[Syleena Johnson]
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight

[Twista] + (S.J.)
Now it was a war it was like I was in Vietnam
But I kill 'em all, cause _Kamikaze_ was the bomb
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because it
this cup of death, Death was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride
I even had C4 duct taped to my stomach but uhh
(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'ma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
(You're gonna make it)
Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine
It's not a given to work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit don't affact us effect us they wanna imagine
they take us lay 'em on the back, I'm makin 'em look at the sky
If I think they cool, I give 'em a dutch
If they break the rules, I give 'em a crutch
If they on the come up and I feel 'em I give 'em some dust
If they talkin shit I'ma bust at 'em and get 'em to hush
Get away clean, go high on the meter, I got the streetsweeper
A creeper believe I get deep as the word of a preacher (and I)
Lyrical retriever but good with them heaters
When I'm full of passion and fury like when you listen to Syleena (and I)
Went multi-platinum when I stepped on enemy grounds
Now bodies all over the world is fin' to be found
And _Kamikaze_ was successful now c'mon and feel _The Day After_
Twista done blew up and tore the whole industry down

[Syleena Johnson]
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight
Ohhhhh yeah yeah yeah, yeahhhhh
You're gonna make it, if you believe it, you can get it
You're gonna make it, you've gotta fight {*fades*}</pre>
