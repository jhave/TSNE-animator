On lonely nights I start to fade 
(On lonely nights I start to fade) 
Her love is a thousand miles away 
(Her love is a thousand miles away) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 

Memories made in the coldest winter 

It's 4am and I can't sleep 
(It's 4am and I can't sleep) 
Her love is all that I can see 
(Her love is all that I can see) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 

Memories made in the coldest winter 
Winter, winter 

Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 

If spring can take the snow away 
(If spring can take the snow away) 
Can it melt away all of our mistakes 
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again 

Never Again</pre>
