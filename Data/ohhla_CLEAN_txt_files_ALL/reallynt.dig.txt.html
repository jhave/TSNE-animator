Typed by: whyteboymc@aol.com

[Verse 1]
I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a little beat wit it
I'm deep wit it, i speak it, believe I live that
The type of cat that call my dogs and have 'em where you live at
I play it from the bidap my soldiers in the front
What the fuck you in the club fo' I told you on the phone
You niggaz want talk, talk time is ova now
Diggs run the West and I'm bout to hold it down
Diggs from the Crest so whatchu gon do wit me
100 more niggaz where I'm from just as rude as me
Cali need a leader, I'm the nigga with the torch
Take the 80 to Marine World exit to the north
I'm the boy in the city, nothin like that Diddy
Do it on some gangsta shit plus I can really rap
Feelin' that?, S-Dawg, a BMF track
They made the call ya'll they want the West Back

[Hook]
I need my niggaz and bitches to help me rep that
They made the call ya'll they want the west
S-Dawg a BMF track, they made the call yall they want the west back

[Bridge - 2X]
I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a lil beat wit it

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of the games, I aint playin no more
Get the fuck out the way, you aint the man no more
There's a new nigga here and his name is Diggs
And if it sounds like I'm talkin to you I probably is
You niggaz in the way, ya'll holdin up the bay
You niggaz fuck wit snitches, now what ya'll wanna say?
Ya'll take 'em on the road, ya'll let 'em book ya shows
They sent by the FEDS man to ova look you hoes
Family Productions that's a police front
And if you fuck wit the police you a police punk
Told this nigga B-La man Tony a rat
He say, "He ain't tell on me!", man how phony is that
These rap cats is plastic, flipped liked a mattress
Do so much rappin these niggaz tell wit' out askin
I'm here for you Cali, I know watchu need
Some more gangsta ass music to go wit' your weed

[Hook]
I need my niggaz and bitches to help me rep that
They made the call ya'll they want the west
S-Dawg a BMF track, they made the call yall they want the west back

[Bridge - 2X]
I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a lil beat wit it

[Verse 3]
If 'Pac was here, he'd probably pull a mag' on you niggaz
Mac Dre, a rapper go bad on you niggaz
Cougnut, he'll be duckin you niggaz
So what I'ma do, I'ma not fuck wit you niggaz

See this the bay mayne, Romper Room, neva on no funny shit
Do it in the street, I'll show you what the money did
Made it off parole, so now I'm bout to step it up
Playin wit some change, so of course I got my weapons up
Really ride a range, really fly them planes
Really been around the world wit girls getting change
See my shoe strangs, they tied and laced up
And if I'm playin poker, I'm Jokered and Aced Up
Fo sho thang, and I ain't losin the movement
And it you want the West back you betta check what I'm doin
This the last warnin', you niggs betta tighten up
Just gettin' started and Diggs ain't gon lighten up

[Hook]
I need my niggaz and bitches to help me rep that
They made the call ya'll they want the west
S-Dawg a BMF track, they made the call yall they want the west back

[Bridge - 2X]
I'm really not a rapper, I'm real real street wit' it
All I did was take my life and mix a lil beat wit it

[Diggs Talkin at end]
To whom it may concern, haha
That's right, Diggs is in the buildin, yeah
This the last warnin' to you rap cats man
I'm givin it to you raw and uncut man
'Cause I don't play mayne, ya'll know me man
Been in these streets man, been doin this shit man
I'm finna take it back to the 80's in the bay though
