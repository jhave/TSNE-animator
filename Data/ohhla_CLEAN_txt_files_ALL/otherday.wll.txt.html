[Paul Wall]
I'm not the type that likes to think about the times I was broke
reminisce on how everybody thought my rhymes was a joke
I played if fair while competitors were buying their vote
But thats life I ain't crying I cope
They talk about I owe them somethin, but they the ones thats holdin me back
They the same people bringing me down, 
so thats why anytime I hop up on the mic there ain't no holding me back
Watch I show ya'll the meaning of clown
Until I'm under the ground
They won't disrespect or slander my name
It takes more than a strong mind to handle the fame
I'm walking one path in this broad, scandalous game
If you don't have an umbrella don't stand in the rain
It gets deep boys losing they life cause of their rappin
Get jacked lose their car cause of their cappin
Alot of cats exaggerate on the things that they lackin
But I'm real baby ain't no actin, just real action

[Chorus: Chamillionaire singing]
Seems Only Times When I'm Balling Balling Balling Balling
Foreigns, Lacs Are Crawling, Now Hood Rats Are Calling
My Stacks Is Tall and To Them Baps and Frauds But Hey
Where Was You At The Other Day 
Never See Myself, Falling Falling Falling Falling
Picture Me Falling Off from Rappin Back To Starving
No Lacs Or Foreigns, Gucci Hats Or Jordans Hey
I Couln't Ever See The Day-ay-ay

[Paul Wall]
I wish I could forget how I didn't have a friend in the world
More than a dollar to spend on a girl
But now them boys talking down cuz now I'm realer than a genuine pearl
While thier sweeter than a cinnamon swirl.... 
I'm Real
My whole life I never acted fruad or fake
There must have been some kind of large mistake
Because I've been stuck out like a broken down garage or gate
I paid dues while they charged me hate
One thing I learned is no matter what nobody can dodge their fate
Don't try to rush life like guards, at florida state
Slow down rookie take ya time god ain't late
Do your chores don't go to war with a rake
I'm tryin to soar to be great
thats why I'm fly, looking for wealth
I don't want to be just another book on the shelf
I stopped looking for help when I looked to myself
I got the whole world under my belt 

[Chorus: Chamillionaire singing]
Seems Only Times When I'm Balling Balling Balling Balling
Foreigns, Lacs Are Crawling, Now Hood Rats Are Calling
My Stacks Is Tall and To Them Baps and Frauds But Hey
Where Was You At The Other Day 
Never See Myself, Falling Falling Falling Falling
Picture Me Falling Off from Rappin Back To Starving
No Lacs Or Foreigns, Gucci Hats Or Jordans Hey
I Couln't Ever See The Day-ay-ay

[Paul Wall]
You won't hear my brag about the struggles I endured as a kid
How selfish and ungreatful people got more than I did
I did my chores damn near went to war to be rich
They think its just a game cuz I'm throwed, more than a pitch
I lost a lot of teammates to jealousy and greed
Planted seeds and watched them get swallowed up by weeds
I'm tryin to live comfortably and have the things that I need
Its true the best things in life are free
But I got people in my face that are influenced by hate and pride
Hiding behind their ego's engulfed in lies
But I dont' walk around looking like my dog just died
I couldn't get rid of my smile if I tried
My face shine bright, you'll never see my grin grow dim
Even when I only had one friend
I couldn't dive into the ocean until I taught myself how to swim
But I ain't tryin to think about back then

[Chorus: Chamillionaire singing]
Seems Only Times When I'm Balling Balling Balling Balling
Foreigns, Lacs Are Crawling, Now Hood Rats Are Calling
My Stacks Is Tall and To Them Baps and Frauds But Hey
Where Was You At The Other Day 
Never See Myself, Falling Falling Falling Falling
Picture Me Falling Off from Rappin Back To Starving
No Lacs Or Foreigns, Gucci Hats Or Jordans Hey
I Couln't Ever See The Day-ay-ay</pre>
