Typed by: obi1one@hotmail.com

"Oooh..."
I just hear mom praying, I just hear gran sayin...
"Somebody oughta just, reach out and, help me..."

[Verse 1]
Eight decades and four years and gran still kickin
Look at ma, still whippin
Still keep a strap, won't hesitate to give the kids whippins
Tryin to make it to heaven, still livin
Make a visit, stop by the weed spot grab a dub
I know grams gon' have me a grub
I hit the front door, smell aroma of her food cookin
My favorite, a pot of rice and her stewed chicken
Hit the basement, holla at Uncle Doc
Nephew, wit Snu kickin
Where dudes, what's your new mission
We bust it up he cold frontin
I know this nigga wanna hold somethin
I know grams upstairs preppin for church
Matchin up her hat, shoes, pocketbooks and skirts
I break her off some dubs, so she can go see the preacher man
Even though I know he false teachin, damn

CHORUS:
"Ooooh..."
All I hear is grams prayin, I keep hearin moms sayin, shit
"Somebody oughta just, reach out and, help me..."
That's all I hear is moms prayin, I keep hearin grams sayin...
"Somebody oughta just reach out and,  help me..."

[Scarface]
Don't cry mama, your baby boy done weathered the storm
And I found peace right here in your arms
By the way, how you gettin along, huh?
I know it's been tough bearing the pain since daddy's been gone
But, all in all, you still stood tall and never shedded a tear
I'm thankin God you still here
Cause, only heaven knows all my heartaches and setbacks
Goin from a high school dropout to shovelin wet wax
I'm never gon' forget that, look in your eyes, [look  in your eyes]
When you told me that my grandfather died
It was like nothing had happened, [naw] and I'm knowin that you miss him
But to accept death, is just the side of a good Christian
And I miss him, just words, and I lived it in life [lived it in life]
and I take it step by step, but I take it in Christ [take it in Christ]
Cuz I'm knowin I can't make it alone [uh, uh]
You told me not to buy you a new house because in heaven's your home
and as hurt as I was, I had to smile witcha
and thank God that we crossed paths cuz you one strong sister
and I'm never gon' forget ya
Heaven sent us an angel and the world gon' miss ya... mama

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
I'm in love with two women
The one that birth me
and the one that birth her
Know that you gotta hurt me
Before you hurt her or hurt her
Or hurt them or hurt we
I cursed see the worsest death
Beat you niggas to a thirsest breath
Off wit ya head niggas, fuck that all purpose vest
I'm ridin all out for Umi
Christian Caffer, though I follow the path of the sumi
What can I do but bow down and give offerings
For the lady with the softest skin
Keep picturin grams tuckin me in
Breakin me out of her change purse
Slash teacher, slash preacher, slash changed nurse
One woman, ten boys, seven daughters
Three story house wit no supporter
Damn, you wanna get your life in order
Words from the oldest boy of your youngest daughter
