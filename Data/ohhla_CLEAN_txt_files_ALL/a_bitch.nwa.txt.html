Oh, shit - I guess there's one less bitch you gotta worry about

[Narrator]
Let's describe a certain female
A female with the disease of character and attitude
If you will, a snob
However, in the view of N.W.A...

[Ice Cube]
A bitch is a bitch (bitch) so if I'm poor or rich (word up)
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title bitch, don't apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in 'em (yeah)
It's like a disease that plagues they character
Takin the women of America (yeah)
And it starts with a letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me (bitch)
See some get mad, and some just bear it
But yo, if the shoe fits wear it (wear it)
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear
That's why when you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think, you're too damn fly?
Bitch eat shit and die (ha ha ha..)
Ice cube comin at you at crazy pitch (Why?)
I think a bitch is a bitch
	
"Who the fuck you think you callin a bitch you little sorry muthafucka?
I dunno who the fuck you think you talkin to
Let me tell you one muthafuckin thang, I'm not no..."
[Eazy-E] Bitch, shut the fuck up

[Ice Cube]
Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money (How?)
She look good and the bitch walk funny
She ain't no dummy, she's rather connivin
Yo bitch, fuck when I'm drivin~!
See a young nigga that's strivin
You're through, without a BMW
That's why, a bitch is a bitch I guess
Or either P-M-S
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby (aight)
And I bet you dissin niggaz is her hobby
And after she finish the test
Grade today of B, I, T-C-H
And watch her get mad cause she know it's true (she know it)
But a nigga like me'll say 'fuck you'
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (slam her ass)
Cause a bitch is a bitch

"Why I got to be a bitch?"
I ain't call you no bitch
If you'd listen to a goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is
"Fuck the song cause I'm not no muthafuckin bitch"
I didn't say you was a bitch
If you stopped actin like a goddamn bitch
"Fuck you, lil punk-ass lil nigga!"
Fuck you, bitch!
"Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?"
Little sorry-ass scandalous-ass ho
"Yeah I'ma bring ma bitch"
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch!
Lil scandalous-ass doody dogg breath smoking...

[Ice Cube]
I once knew a bitch who got slack
Cause she played me, like she was all that
A bitch can be your best friend talkin behind your back (yeah)
About who's fuckin who and who's gettin fat
Look at yourself for me (look bitch)
Now do you fall, in this category?
Are you the kind that won't blink
Cause you don't think, yo' shit stink?
Lucky I haven't had a drink
Cause I'd down you ass, then I'd clown your ass
Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich (I ain't rich)
We'll all say "Fuck you bitch!" (Word up!)
Now, what I can do with a ho like you
Bend your ass over and then I'm through (get the fuck out)
Cause you see Ice Cube ain't takin' no shit (Why?)
Cause I think, a bitch is a bitch

[Narrator]
There you have it - the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself, are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous
stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are - HAHAHAHAHAHAHA~!

"Bitch!"</pre>
