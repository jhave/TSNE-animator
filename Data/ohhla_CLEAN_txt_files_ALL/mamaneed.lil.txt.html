[Ikeim]
You first heard of us on the Mean Green joint
Drop the first hot single now yall getting the point
We was here many years ago with same flow
If you seen us in your town probably doin a show
Keep it real and let you know it ain't all about dough
But it is about the kids with power to go
Mind ya own biz you don't like my flow
Find a spot to live cause the bomb gon' blow
We like spiderman superman and friends
Come to coliseum and slam these jams 
Lil' Soldiers my controllers what messin with that
Ikeim and Freequan real brothers at that Yeah

(Chorus)
Mama need a new blouse (Bounce)
My little brother only five months from the house (Yall Bounce)
Playa hater need to stop runnin at the mouths (Yall Bounce)
We doin something while yall mad that we coming out (Yall Bounce)
What's that about
Mama need a new blouse (Yall Bounce)
My little brother only five months from the house (Yall Bounce)
Playa hater need to stop runnin at the mouths (Yall Bounce)
We doin something while yall mad that we coming out (Yall Bounce)

[Freequan]
I can't believe I heard a bad thing about what we bring
I guess they want us to sing (what)
Stay away from Keim
Never this that's what you call devilish
We in the studio jumpin' out the plad six
B.B.F big boys flow to death
My arson delivery make all yall feel me (Lil Free)
Fellin Little Free astrimedies 
You a fish if you dissin me swimming in the warm
Ain't life there all it is is love here
Free like a big bear with no claws but letter guard
Step aside for my entorounge (move away)
Yall ain't seein a morouge I represent for my whole squad (squad)
Lay it down I don't play around 
See us work then play the Colonel made it that way
We make hot songs everyday
Yall wanna play wanna play to (what)
Sea Deuce

(Chorus 6x)</pre>
