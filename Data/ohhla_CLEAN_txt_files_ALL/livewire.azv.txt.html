(AZ talking)
Yea ok...motherfuckers wanna be gangsters now huh 
this how we gon do it
Everybody thuggin now right...ok
*gunshots*

(Verse 1- AZ)
This is that thunder five mossberg AR shit
Pearl handle black leather glove rubber grip
Buckshots hollow heads front cover shit
I'm on some other shit laying on the mothership
Advertised as a street wise Malaika
Feastin the Allen I's you beef and you paralyzed
Teddy P pumpin out the GT
In 93 niggas had it jumping in DC
A lot of dickriders got amongst us slipped by us
Bit a lot of shit but this is how you spit fire
Gut stroking four pound on the duck broking clutch toting
Hush or get your face bust the fuck open
From floor level to the ice pebbles in the bezel
From pedal bikes to them Teterboro flight shuttles
Style sicker big quench through the Nile River
Now verbally versatile when I deliver nigga
Snuffing, I'm hip hop all day
Used to hustle in the hood heavy, knock off trays
Had to scuffle for my blue Gazelle's ?cop door shades?
How ya'll niggas gon fuck with the A?

(Chorus)
This is that thunder five mossberg AR shit
Pearl handle black leather glove rubber grip
Crowbar gem star on some other shit
My niggas love to flip never on that sucker shit

(Verse 2)
I rep rap for my niggas up in Cossack
For ya'll crab niggas this is how you clap back
Black beretta hot barrel like Miami weather
Homocide late 80's early 90's ever
Niggas crime together get a run get time together
Never minor league I breed a different kind of cheddar
Chilly chill now chump fix your silly grill
Shit is still a fuck around and tell me how the semi feel
I'm on some Farrakhan Conrad Elijah shit
From the bottom pit forming my conglomerate
A young dominant pro black Communist
Anonymous been rhyming since released on my recognizance
Now greater 2 felonies later the heat melody maker the streets heavily favor player
Pretty chicks clean kicks whips, creased in the jeans my self esteem's like Idi Amin
For the cream I'm like Hakeem the Dream puffing my green
Guaranteed to get a ring for the team...

I rep rap for my niggas up in Cossack
Green in comstop? knock with they last pack
Singin nap nap them kings they clap back
I'm just a feen trying to bring this rap back...

(Chorus)
This is that thunder five mossberg AR shit
Pearl handle black leather glove rubber grip
Crowbar gem star on some other shit
My niggas love to flip never on that sucker shit

I rep rap for my niggas up in Cossack
Green in comstop? knock with they last pack
Singin nap nap them kings they clap back
I'm just a feen trying to bring this rap back...

(Chorus)
This is that thunder five mossberg AR shit
Pearl handle black leather glove rubber grip
Crowbar gem star on some other shit
My niggas love to flip never on that sucker shit
