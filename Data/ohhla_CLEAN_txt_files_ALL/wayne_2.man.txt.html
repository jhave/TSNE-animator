Get down and lay down
Lie down and die down

Rapper with guns

[Lil Wayne]
Get me that piffy, I'm higher than my attire
I float like I spit through the fryer
I-uh sniffin cocaine is some fire
I-uh get to buy money out the dryer
Ridah in the five buggy, slim tires
Tryin to find a try to light Jeremaih
They call me Weezy F-Baby
Women wanna suck all on my pacifier
and if she tell ya she didn't, homie thats a liar
You see me passin by ya, More like flashin
Lights, Camera but I'm more like Action
So get your back into it, Stop acting
Cause we bring pistons to the balls
Cool cat, wind breezin through my whiskers
Hurry, speed up, hater you just missed us
I just twisted something
Birdman Jr. swoop down on ya bitch like whats up with cha
Walk to me, that's real
We on that Shrek, I met her neck like let's chill
When we ridin in my SL, she give me more tongue, less grill
My yellow diamonds give you spit nigga bitch yield
And that tooley gets saluted or I'll shoot it Yeah
