Could you tell me where you run to
[When it's rent time and I done spent mine ba-by]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When it's rent time and I done spent mine ba-by]
Could you tell me where you run to
[When the LAPD see you ridin' dirty dirty dirty]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When it's rent time and I done spent mine ba-by]

Verse 1: Layzie Bone

I'm stuck in this penetentiary called life
Deciphering wrong from right
Dodging these institutions these niggas shooting
Puttin' the oldest far from life,
Facing a brick wall at a stand still
Was it a dream or was it reality
Now it's a nightmare hunting my sanity
Thank the Lord up in heaven ain't mad at me
It's sad to see I be bustin' my ass
I'm down for my grind getting nowhere fast
I'ma thug so you know ah nigga built to last
To the point ah no return tryna' get the cash
Feel mo' wrath, murda on the government
War for the niggas on the streets
It'll be no peace till the top dog eat
Tryna' stop my meal you can catch this steel
6 feet deep is where you be layin'
Worms and maggots is where you be stayin'
Deaperado 2000 all about the money murda 'n mayhem
I look at the niggas I went to school wid
Shot pool wid was always cool wid
Same niggas I just can't fool wid
Niggas got guns and ready to use it
So I'm trapped up against the wall
Watchin' y'all niggas plottin' on me
Tryin' ah catch me up in that robbery
Put they mob on me and do ah job on me
But I'm proud to be that nigga in the ghetto that just can't stay out
Ain't nowhere to run ain't nowhere to hide
And it ain't no way out

[Flesh N Bone &amp; Bizzy Bone]

Could you tell where you run to
[When you duckin' the po-po dodging these killas]
[And leaving yo family at yo people dog]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When you stuck shit outta luck
[And ain't got no hustle to make that buck dog]
Could you tell me where you run to
[When the road you on is a dead end left wid borrowing and begging]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When all this music shit play out and you trapped wid no way out]

Verse 2: Bizzy Bone

Together forever,
I know they wanna see us fall
And if I had no money you would probably playahate me
Selling dummies all dum dum dum dum
Oh every, nigga don't wanna see us wid no money
You won't see me when I've said it
And if some come run only to visit
No muse so if I told you would you tell me like you did it?
I hate that wake that sucker up buck buck buck
'N tell him to take that wid him
Now that we still thugging
Spitting as we run away from prison
Nigga we still running,
But the bad bad boyz is still coming
Nobody wanna start this revolution,
How could they be some soldiers you ain't neva been in no war
The end of it, been training during, east time and least time
Getting ready ah mind could learn to love it
And when I release mine on the public
Thuggish ruggish and plus it's all, real
I put that on yo nine millimetre steel
All judges, that's strictly real

Could you tell where you run to
[When you duckin' the po-po dodging these killas]
[And leaving yo family at yo people dog]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When you stuck shit outta luck
[And ain't got no hustle to make that buck dog]
Could you tell me where you run to
[When the road you on is a dead end left wid borrowing and begging]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When all of this music shit play out and you trapped wid no way out]

Verse 3: Wish Bone

Now all ah y'all niggas tough
Y'all ready for violence violence
But niggas don't give ah fuck
We ready to riot riot
When all the smoke clears
Y'all niggas long gone (Damn)
Niggas learn the hard way shoulda stayed at home
Got ah couple million on this uh huh
Got ah couple milion on that (that's right)
Got ah couple million on everything we do
Can you sell that?
And it didn't come easy round our way,
We had to hustle to survive and didn't eat some days

Could you tell where you run to
[When you duckin' the po-po dodging these killas]
[And leaving yo family at yo people dog]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When all of this music shit play out and you trapped wid no way out]

Verse 4: Flesh N Bone &amp; Bizzy Bone

I'm stuck lookin' for the lost soul
Niggas stucked at the crossroad
Thugging wid my people and I seen so much evil
In the midst I hear you, but I fear no evil
Crooked life revealing tick tock racing against my time
Against my grind while you coming and stand here
Nigga betta wake up cause they're not blind
While I live the thin line, between love and hate
How many gon' survive armageddon
Just waiting to atone that day
In the Roman gates here to make no mistakes
Handle stakes and man Lord meet me half ah the way
Kicking up dust thugging with my runaway slaves, for safety
Livin' in ah world so cruel
And I got nothing to lose
Rippin' and thuggin' wid Trues
Smoking the sweetest cheeba drinking brews
My motherfuckin' niggas killing when it comes to my screeler
Bang bang I gotta stay down for my hood thing

[Bizzy Bone]

Never ask where the killas at
Niggas run wid automatic weapons
All I really wanted was ah gun
I neva gave ah fuck and drop neva one in the bay and had away wid her
Bone's hitting all day wid the Lay wid ah play
Wid the seven other niggas no protecting smoking hay what
Would he pray wid her would he pray wid her
Ohh Ohh No No
Stressin' henny got fiend and green and nicotine
Noooo-torious bustin' wid my regime fiends all around me
Ah genuinely pumpin' new millenium
Thugs caught up brought up believe me
Revelation to the station holocaust
Billow and smoke the ozone, Soooo
Can't stand just listening
Go on ah God like mission to live all the written inscriptions
Nobody was gifted so many lifted spliffs been hold
That's while I'm pissing
It's nowhere to turn to no shit
But I'ma stay Christian

Could you tell where you run to
[When you duckin' the po-po dodging these killas]
[And leaving yo family at yo people dog]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When you stuck shit outta luck
[And ain't got no hustle to make that buck dog]
Could you tell me where you run to
[When the road you on is a dead end left wid borrowing and begging]
When it ain't nowhere to turn to
[When all of this music shit play out and you trapped wid no way out]</pre>
