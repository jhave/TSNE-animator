[Lil Rob]
These fuckin' vatos homeboy
Just don't know when to shut the fuck up
ey I mean, they cry like little fuckin' girls and shit, you know?
It's like, what the fuck is your problem perro?
Quit your cryin' bitches, no llores Pobresito has an issue
here's some tissue Toughen up big guy
don't cry, dry your eyes
It's ok, maybe someday you'll find your way without me
But if you play, you pay
You couldn't fuck with me on your best day on my worst day
Been rappin' for a long time it still sounds like your first day
What's worst ey, you think that you put it down like I do
I know you'd like to but you can't do
That's just somethin' that you can't do
Boo hoo hoo poor you

[Chorus]
(Dry your eyes, there is no need to cry)
Quit your cryin' bitches
Boo hoo hoo poor you
Dry your eyes, no need to cry
Keep your pillow dry
(Dry your eyes, there is no need to cry)
Quit your cryin' bitches
Boo hoo hoo poor you 

[Lil Rob]
(Hey wait a minute dawg, wait a fuckin' minute holmes)
Where the fuck do you get off talkin' shit about my neighborhood?
Comin' from you it don't mean shit 'cause I know you never claimed a hood
I've been drunk in this town, high in this town
Shot for my town, brought up in this town
Puttin' it down, good times and bad
Hop in the Cad just fuckin' around
And doin' the things that you never did as a kid, but you wish you did
So the things you say now wouldn't be bullshit
Never did shit, never will do shit
I'm from SD 858 but I know you're a 619er 
Ese Lil Rob, San Diego, no one does it tighter
Pass the fuckin' wire

[Chorus]

(Wait a minute, let me get this right then dawg)
He disses him, then he disses him
Then he misses him, then they're friends again
I'm on the other end, smokin' pot with a plot to win
Now they're dissin' me it's obvious to see
they're tryin get the best of me
They're not affectin' me physically or mentally
Wasn't time to mess with me, this shit was meant for me
It was meant to be, sad to see you're sad too bad you're mad
But I'm workin' on my platinum plaque
then after that they're back to back
I've got places to go, people to see
go to a show and they're waitin' for me
Better than that, they're payin' for me
It's no wonder why you been cryin' lately

[Chorus]

(Dry your eyes, there is no need to cry)</pre>
