[Redman]
Gillahouse, take it from the top like this nigga

[Verse]
Yo, Redman 'Back in Business' like EPM 
D whips I drive, I gotta TV'em
I tour New York down, so B.B. King'em
Found my way back home like E.T. finger
I rock the arena, you know the drill
Get high, get drunk, grab a hoe and chill
Eat a meal, then back to the hood for more action
Promotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin
Doc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson
Foreign bitches feelin me for my accent
Talk like a boss, I can't complain
When I do it, it's big like Fulton in St. James
I got Brick City, even D.C. bitches
They all steal for me outta P.C. Riches
I move like a pimp, but I'm far from one
Like Lil Weez, I got army guns
gimmie one, nigga

(Hook)
1, and here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4
And here comes the 3 to the 2 and 1 (Gimmie one, nigga)
And here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4

[Verse 2]
Yo, If you don't like me, fuck you, I flex one muscle
Doc got more effects than kung fu hustle
I'm uptown, buyin the perk
Lookin cut clean, jeans, ??? designer shirt
Redman fell off, what the talks about?
I wasn't lettin y'all swim when the shark was out
Rollin red carpet out, it's Jersey
Me and them together is like Lil' Seymour and Big Percy
I knew women from high school that picked on me
Now I see them, they all wanna lick on me
I hood down homie, rock like Bon Jovi
I can work the nightshift like he Brian Mobley
Brick City, boy, my flow is on fire
Disagree, I go in your mouth like botox
Pick up Pete Rock, nigga, we all cool
Hit the highway and ask, "Is the CL smooth?" nigga

(Hook)

[Verse 3]
Your style might be parkay, but mine butter
That bitch can't break no bread, then why fuck her
I'm kinda cocky, homeboy, did I stutter?
I pop the umbilical cord on my mother
I jumped out the womb, I became a whale
That's hard to harpoon, I need more room
The hood love me, so I keep it real gully
I got handsome, but my flow is still ugly
Turn the treble out the track and I'll jet
I lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea
I stay on my grind, but when I come up with an Idea
The year, is party over here
It's 5 years I disappeared, but I'm back
And tell Nino Brown and them that I'm crack
Grab my bozack, middle finger is up
I got your grandma givin it up
Gimmie one, nigga!
