Song:   Crabs N a Bucket
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Don't let nobody stop you, just believe in yourself
They be trying to hold you back cause the niggas is jealous
Everybody no talk about crabs n a bucket
Speak your mind if you feeling something

They try to get me for real, they try to get me
Try to take me out the zone, and do a nigga like 50
All I do is spread love, how you niggas is shifty
Bitch I came out thugging, see you niggas is greedy
Just believe in yourself, keep your plan in your mind
Cause nobody believe until you show them the grind
Everybody wanna sleep on your dreams and goals
Till you show you got money that's a lame ass role
But it's life you're lucky if your parents believe
They want you be [?] way, change the feelings you deceive them
Turn people want they best as you get happy
Those are ones the true friends, niggas hate so badly
Black people only raise a lot of haters
A niggas ain't loyal
Black man killing blacks over money and oil
Blacks and say black cause nobody loyal
Only guns in the hood, people live in turmoil
You feel me?

Don't let nobody stop you, just believe in yourself
They be trying to hold you back cause the niggas is jealous
Everybody no talk about crabs n a bucket
Speak your mind if you feeling something

Really, how you feel, why these niggas is liars
Pimps and drug dealers, all them niggas is liars
Niggas come from the hood, and the niggas exhale
[?] for me, trying to make inhale
Every day another nigga down going to jail
He a addict this time, little niggas is frail
No love as babies, never hold by they mama
Mama was a crack user, she ain't have no conscience
You was sleeping on the floor, you ain't have no house
Even sleeping outside, cause mom put you out
As shit turns you hardcore, but you gotta forgive them
Ain't nobody [?] just keep living
Ain't nobody perfect, just keep living
Hurts my heart to say that
We all play different cards, how you deal them
Don't never give up man, follow your vision
You just [?] God damn it
I just wanna tell the real from my heart, man

You just [?] determination as you do drug dealing
And do that to life living
2 love not one love, cause both of us

Don't nobody stop you, just believe in yourself
They be trying to hold you back cause the niggas is jealous
Everybody no talk about crabs n a bucket
Speak your mind if you feeling something
Don't nobody stop you, just believe in yourself
Man this shit so deep for me, I can't really talk

Don't nobody stop you, just believe in yourself
They be trying to hold you back cause the niggas is jealous
Everybody no talk about crabs n a bucket
Speak your mind if you feeling something</pre>
