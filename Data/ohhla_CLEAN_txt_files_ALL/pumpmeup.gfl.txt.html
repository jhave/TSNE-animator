Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Melle Mel]
Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle

There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you

Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew 

The shark got sick and then he exploded 
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Melle Mel]
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)

Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

[Cowboy]
I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker 
The microphone champ

Got a knock out voice
Like a rolls royce 
Gotta rank as number one 
To be the people's choice 

Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle 
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle 

Up above your head is the flash of light 
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain 
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train

The train to the bus the bus to whatever 
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather 
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother

Come on, I said come on, I said come on

[Scorpio]
I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night 
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night

Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood 
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud

And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women 
That give me good love in the beginning 

Bubble bath and candle lights 
And girls saying Scorp you alright? 
So stop standing there like you from above 
And just relax yourself and get in this tub

Pump, pump, pump, pump me up

For all you beautiful people out there
if you having a good time, everybody scream!

[Melle Mel]
I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine 
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel

And to all the fly girls I come off hard 
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge 

Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat 
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat

I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup 
Cut the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you

pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)</pre>
