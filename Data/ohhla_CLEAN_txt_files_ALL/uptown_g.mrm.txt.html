(*talking*)
Uh-huh Marcelo, you already know
I represent Uptown New Orleans, to the motherfucking fullest
I don't know no other town like Uptown, you heard me
I don't know no other town, like this one right here look

[B.G.]
I keep it real keep it thorough, keep it gutter
Gizzle keep money, cause Gizzle a born hustler
Gizzle is thugged out, Gizzle a straight G
Gizzle got all his game, from the streets of the 13
U-P-T-O-W-N
I been wilding through that bitch, since I was about ten
Cross Martin Luther King, hit Jackson hit Willow
The mo' corners you turn, believe it get's realer
The way I was raised, I came up raw
I was taught never trust, or give a fuck about the law
I dropped out of school, I wanted them street smarts
Them teachers ain't know, bout not taking shorts
The knowledge I got off the block, can't be bought
That's why Flarence and Magnolia, embedded in my heart
Hurricanes tornadoes, I'll still be around
That's why Uptown, gonna be my stomping ground

[Hook - 2x]
Keep it gangsta, chilling on the block with me
Keep it gangsta, until them people come get me
Keep it gangsta, that's how we hanging Uptown
Keep it gangsta, pound for pound my block is down

[Mr. Marcelo]
See niggaz know I'm a gangsta, niggaz know I'm a G
Young 'Celo ghetto, I was raised in the streets
Uptown, yeah I hold that down
My footprints'll still be there, if they tore that down
Ask any nigga in the streets, bout Brick
And they'll tell ya if I been, I'ma use that bitch
Young cap peeler, raised on Willow
I ran with the gorillas, so I learned a lot of shit
I ran through the Yo, with my homie Doe-Doe
Sold coke sold dope, and I bust a lot of clips
I ran through the cuts, hung in every co-way
And opened up shop on the block, on a Thursday
Made friends made ends, made enemies
And I stood my ground, nigga I been a G
If it wasn't for my hood, and it wouldn't for my peeps
Then I probably, wouldn't be so street
Sipping on Henny, blowing on dro
Holding down the 'Nolia, like a nigga on the joe

[Hook - 2x]

[C-Murder]
I tote glocks, and I got the streets in a head lock
Now why they wanna act like they G's, when they not
See me I can't be faded, and I can't be stopped
I'm Calliope blooded and I'm thugging, until I drop
On top of that I'm here, and I want my spot back
You had that now pass that, before you get jacked
Now ask my partna, 'Nolia brick I layed it
C-Murder said it, so he portrayed it and sprayed it
What's up lil' daddy, you know what's happening this your daddy
I'm in that Caddy with that thang, so now what's happening
Uptown had me, my daddy got New Orleans pregnant
Your shorty naked so respect it, hold up a second
What's up you flexing, and ain't no checking a boss balls
Lil' mama, when ol' lil' mama got tossed
I take a walk, cause my bite and my bark
Is straight gangsta, bring out the white chalk fall

[Hook - 2x]

[B.G.]
Uptown, is my stomping ground
My footprints'll still be there, if they tore that down
So if you trying, to get the low about me
Ask a nigga in the streets, they'll tell you I'm a G - 2x</pre>
