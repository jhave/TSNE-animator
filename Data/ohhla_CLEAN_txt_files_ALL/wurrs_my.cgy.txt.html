[Chorus]
Ho, Wurrs My Cash?
(Got his money ho?)
You don't have it?
(You trippin' girl)
Am I gon' slap you? Uh huh
Sling that ass
(Sling it for a nigga girl)
What is this ma'?
(How much?)
Is that enough? Uh Uh
Know ya'll gon' ask
(Tell 'em the truth close to move)
I am a hustler?
(Get yours)
Am I pimpin'? Uh Huh
Ho move real fast
(Don't be slacking up)
You don't like yo' job. So!
Do I care ho ? Uh Uh

See that verco, that's for when it's cold
Break that white gold,plain gold, got old
Snake skin shoes, give yo' friends blues
Step out the car, sharp as a fuckin' auto too
Got tall girls, into small girls
Latin, Japanese, Black, Mexican all girls
Willin to work for it, go in they purse for it
Down wit' me even if they put in a herse for it
Got in the dirt for it
Call me papi and'll pull up they skirt for it

[Chorus]

[Chingy]
People ask me why I'm like this
See my father and my uncles gave me this shit
Since I liked it fot down and hiked it
That's why you catch me doing foursomes with dike chicks
They like my style, I like they mouth
Even gotta couple hookers workin' the south
And on the east my girls the best
In Cali got 10 out on sunset
Pimp of all pimps, young Don Bishop
Got life insurance, trick gon' I won't miss ya'
On the sole of my gators she can kiss the (smooch)
Bitch!

[Chorus]
