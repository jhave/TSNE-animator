[Intro]
Yeah nigga
This is what the fuck I'm talking about
Back up in this fucking shit now
We gonna do shit ya'll niggaz never heard of
Fuck is goin on in this motherfuckin bitch c'mon

[Jim Jones]
Yo yo yo yo I'm a nomad nigga
I came up with no dag
Little broke nigga I ain't have no cash
No threads and no rags
Shit was serious
I wasn't in no fads nigga
I'm no pretender
I've been to jail and I know offenders
You I don't know or no remember
But I know you tender
Shit you ain't no exeption
I'm in the hood with no redemption
When you gonna die in life there's no prevention
Why the fuck you put us here when you know we bad
Yeah I was one that would cut you
Cause I came up to with no one to look up to
But the one that sold drugs to the ones with no life
Why the fuck police treatin us like we got no rides
Niggaz I know the truth though I ain't got no poverty nigga
I know my roots
Nigga I know some mirrads that don't get no dormida
Ain't got no trible for no cormida no papa no madre no nada
Nigga no hente what the fuck people no comprende

[Freaky Zeeky]
Comprende what the fuck
Nigga fuck all this shit up in this motherfucker
Got get your own cheese nigga
What the fuck is the deal what the fuck is the deal
Nigga fuck is the deal nigga fuck is the deal
Keep it real on this motherfuckin bitch nigga
You talkin shit blah blah fuck you bitch
Nigga I do what the fuck I got to do

[Cam'ron]
Yo I can't live up in Hollow Hills with some model thrills
Why for the dollar bills I got the bottle Crils
I don't have to swallow pills
Why when I'm starvin I got to gobble meals
Why did I cop to steal
Why did I ride ride for real
Why we can't wait til our time God could take her
Why the flesh eatin disease make niggaz get ate her
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why Dave Listern from the NBA-a
Why the great ones always break up
And when travisty happen they wanna make up
Why niggaz can't get caked up and stay caked up
Say what why we can't tell who's smart or dumb
Why niggaz in blue suits gotta take us and put us in orange one
Why Adam and Eve didn't know what was in the garden dun
Why niggaz from America always wanna cart to foreign land
My drugs I gotta buy why sluts gotta fly why thugs gotta cry
Why when I get on blood got to die
Why me and Tai can't see eye to eye
Why when plane crashes niggaz fly to die
Why were depend on a handshake when you reachin a palm
Why beef with my mom why can't sleep when I cum
Why my black I love every fight I laugh when they mug me every right
I got to fuck every night
Run deep in my ways six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain't retreated to slaves
Why we don't learn til we leave for the cage
And we say the beasts is in rage
Why I can't tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can't I have two rather than few highs
Whys homos got to do guys in the world
Why ain't there more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple intosis
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight flurges I see crook type murders
And niggaz get cooked like burgers
Why your girl want my clique why your girl on my dick
Why she rub it against her mouth like it's chap stick
Why this rap shit
Why CEOs wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEOs
Yo why you all wanna see me blow
Why the rederick why I can't get my proper etiquette

[Outro]
Better get all your money motherfucker get that said again
I want that money too nigga
Fuck that lil two dollar prude
I wanna get that Cristal shit too nigga
Yeah niggaz up in the shit motherfucker
I ain't stoppin I ain't never fuckin stoppin
I ain't never motherfuckin stoppin up in this motherfucker
Nigga you better get some more money cause
We got to tapes up this motherfucker
You better be rich cause we got a lot more shit
I ain't never gonna stop motherfucker
I bet you better believe that</pre>
