[Missy] 
Yes 
You have just entered 
The year 2000 
And they've just arrived 
Ready to take us outer space 
To another planet 
Where there's only one club 
And one disco, ooh 
And they wanna show us how 
Heh heh, they boogie, uhh 

[Lil' Mo] 
Got a strange call from a girl 
In the midst of the night, uh huh 
She said you better call your man 
Cause he sleepin' right here tonight 
So I put on my coat 
And my hat and then put on my shoes, yeah yeah 
I said bitch don't you move 
Cause I'll be seeing you soon 
It only took me 

Chorus 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

[Lil' Mo] 
Saw a few scratches on my car 
Just the other day, yeah yeah yeah 
Neighbor around my way 
Said she saw you drivin' away 
So I put two together 
And I found myself ready to go, whoa whoa 
Before she even knew it 
I was comin' down the road 
It only took me 

Chorus 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

Bridge 

Be a hoe 
I'm kickin' you up out the door 
I hope you know 
Like Coolio, you gotta go 
Don't even think 
I'm gonna let you hang around 
Got your drawz down 
Lookin' stupid like a clown 

Be a hoe 
I'm kickin' you up out the door 
I hope you know 
Like Coolio, you gotta go 
Don't even think 
I'm gonna let you hang around 
Got your drawz down 
Lookin' stupid like a clown 

Chorus 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

In five minutes, I was knockin' at the door 
In two minutes, I had her on the floor 
In one minute, I was fightin' wit' my man 
Yes I did it, and I told his tail to scram 

[Missy] 
Freaky freaky 
Freaky freaky 
Yes, eh heh 
It's the year 2000 
And they will be back 
To take us to outer space 
To their planet 
Where there's only one club 
Where there's only one disco 
And you know what they wanna show us 
Ooh, you know what they wanna show us 
How they boogie (yo, yo, yo) 

[Lil' Mo] 
Yo, don't know what they told you, but 
They done told you wrong 
Bet I go back and tell 'em again 
And make sure you here it all 
Don't come up in my Mellinium talkin' bout 
Girl, this my song 
If you don't know how to bounce to this 
Then try to play it off 
It's just like a movie, everybody wanna see 
In the 2 G, how she dress like me 
They say "Who's she?", she's fly as can be 
Got a groupie, off a hoochie 
I got lucci, mad cheese in the bank 
And my crew be, straight flossin' wit' me 
Even Hootie, wanna Blow like me 
Heard he wanna be a Lil' mo like me, what 

[Missy]

Check it out now, uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh 
Break it down now, uh uh uh, uh uh uh uh 
Ah heh he   </pre>
