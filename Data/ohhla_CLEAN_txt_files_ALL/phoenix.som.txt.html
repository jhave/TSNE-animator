Album:  Trilogy
Song:   Phoenix Rising (Resolution)
Typed by: nightbreed420@hotmail.com

Resolution hinges on a breath after a series of struggles
When questions become less defining
And solutions have no silver lining
When the battle has fallen to ultimate destruction
With no momentary pauses for why it was all triggered
And from all angles equations plus views, you still can't figure

Resolution is the aftermath of that which could not be defined
Hanging on a cliff with no options but to die, rewind or recline
Compromising on earth to ignite what was written before you began
Understanding that every rock created, eventually turns to sand
Grandly accepting that in life's rythem, there is only one concrete plan
That has nothing to do with blocks, hoods, anger, tears, retaliation or man

Resolution is the fire in the sky left by a phoenix rising
A caged bird lost, but still free
Flying over a trecherous sea with no effort, gliding
Resolution is the thought you cannot contain
When city lights turn to magnificent heights
And release has no echo of pain
Resolution hinges on a breath that passes as quickly as an untangled life
Its when you... (deep breath, sigh)

It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright</pre>
