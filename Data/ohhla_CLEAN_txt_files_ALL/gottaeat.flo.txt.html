Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: Flo Rida - singing]
Damn it I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed (my weed)
Found me a hoe to help plant my seed (my seed)
I got bail money they fuck with me (with me)
Cause in my hood e'ry nigga gotta eat
Cause in my hood e'ry nigga's gotta eat {*repeat 3X*}
Cause in my hood e'ry nigga gotta eat

[Flo Rida]
I know where I come from, niggaz got it rough
Penny-pinchin for paper 'til you poppin big bucks
Give it up, load it cock it, ain't no tellin with them thugs
Dealers straight out the projects only felons that'll bust
Some shit you don't discuss, snitches they get {fucked up}
Damn it I'm proud to buy my own bag to fill my dutch
Planted my own seed, not a month without a bud
Granted I got to feed you we don't pump the same blood
You need that new Mercedes, home of the color gravy
How the hell you gon' pay me I made it did it .380
Tell me I'm acting shady I try to ignore the lazy
Say my grace on the daily if not arrest me I'm ready

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Chowder had-ta, dinner platter, mills/meals on deck
Cash comin, that currency to earn that respect
Money machines measurin, makin sure you collect
Roll in the dice game you better be stoppin bets
Keep it movin like chess, look for your new address
Proof of ghetto success, that Bentley Coupe is correct
Go from failure to fruitful, your label, momma impressed
Done for whoever knew you, supported you through the stress
That drama on the block, all them run-ins with cops
Couldn't afford shoes, was happy two pair of socks
Steady payin your dues that landed you in the box
Other niggaz confused, you asked them to borrow crop

[Chorus]

[Flo Rida]
Cryin e'yday, big franks on they brain
Properly marinate a million strong, keep the change
Cheddar that generate, we gotta tote it with a crane
Hustlers for that bank, be aware that we untamed
Ducats, we deranged, muscle the damn thang
Militia off in the hood, come get you that's point blank
Hit you it's all good, business before a dame
Women tell us he'd never survive in that cheddar lane
You see we want it all, yeah we breakin the law
Buy it sell it cook it that's on everythang if it's raw
Anyway you put it, to the folks we breakin the law
Sing it so I took it and if you tell a nigga that's all

[Chorus]</pre>
