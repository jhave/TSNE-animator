[Jadakiss]
Yeah... {You're now listening to Araabmuzik}
Yup - HA-HAAAEEH~!

Don't make me put one of y'all in the grave (uh-uh)
I'm playin' with money, y'all niggas save (yup)
The pain I'mma cause is something y'all couldn't face (mm)
A couple niggas shot cause one of y'all niggas brave
Rushin' him to the ER, rushin' me to the stage
This The Soul Tape 3, nothing we need to say
Leave the handguns at home, fuck 'em, just bring the K's
For the homies in the county with nothing that's eatin' trays (homie)
Since I started eatin' my motto is eat away
Top 5 is always followed by DOA (yeah)
Thought I was on top when I bottled a key of yay
Then I went straight from the block to the VMA's
The way the hands move on the clock you'd be amazed (yup)
You just feel the burn, nigga. you don't see the blaze (uh)
Take a good look at my eyes, you see the haze
Right left, live or death either way
Same tough guys will cry when they see you laid
Never show your hand, they dyin' to see your spades
I'm married to the game, you dyin' to get engaged
You only gangster when the lions is in the cage (coward)
Your life's worth nothing, the goons had it appraised (uh)
I might do the ray for maroon with the beige
Bad bitch with me, Louie with the shades (uh)
If you ain't self employed than truly you a slave

[Fabolous]
Tooly to your waves, brain on your winter coat
Niggas burnin' bridges then expectin' you to send a boat
If I'm comin' at your neck think a bullet in the throat
Never gone forget you niggas, got 'em written in my notes
I'mma send the goons (yeah), a snitch gone send the folks
They gone kill you just cause, don't make me send the locs
New blue hundreds (yeah) spendin' c-notes
Fresh pair of Timbs, vintage pea-coats
I'm a stand up nigga, never been a joke
Ridin' since pedal bikes with reflectors and the spokes
I snuck up from behind, put the game in a yolk
You apply a little pressure and them rookies finna choke
Niggas lookin' washed up, it's something in the soap (uh)
You lookin' like Adrien Broner in the ropes (uh)
My shoes is 2 racks, I should be in the slopes
Might come through in bubble same way they send the pope (yeah)
Paradin' down 5th Ave like I'm in a float (yeah)
That new H50 push button like remote (woo!)
Control is hard to have, especially when you broke
They sleepin' because they eatin', but you hungry and you woke
Shorty mouth wet, but her strength is in the stroke
Greatest of all time so her name has been the goat
She say you got the people waitin' for it then it's dope
The game is fucked up, but if you back then it's hope, nigga</pre>
