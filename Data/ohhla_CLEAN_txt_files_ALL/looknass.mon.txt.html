[Chorus: Detail]
All I, all I know is there should be no reason
All I know is there should be no reason
All I, all I know is there should be
All I know
All I, all I, know is there should be no reason
All I know, you know it, and you know it
Look at what, reason

[Nicki Minaj - over Chorus]
Look at y'all niggas... niggas
Look at y'all niggas... niggas

[Nicki Minaj] + (Detail)
Look at y'all smokin' ass niggas after every pull, niggas start chokin' ass niggas (you know why)
Nigga-nigga (all I, all I know is that there should be)
Look at y'all bitch ass niggas, stop lyin' on your dick ass niggas (you know why)
Nigga-nigga (all I, all I, all I know is there should be)

Look at y'all lookin' ass niggas, stop lookin' at my ass ass niggas
Look at y'all lyin' ass niggas, talkin' 'bout "it's paid off" but it's financed, lyin' ass nigga
Bunch of non-mogul ass niggas, frontin' like they got a plan, Boost Mobile ass nigga
Nigga, nigga, look at y'all, can't get a job so you plottin' how to rob ass niggas
I ain't gotta check for y'all but if I'ma check for y'all, I'ma need a check from y'all niggas
I 'on't want sex, give a fuck about your ex, I 'on't even want a text from y'all niggas
I'm rapin' you niggas; look at this pic, look what the fuck I gave to you niggas
Ain't feelin' these niggas; niggas want my time, call me +Clinton+, I'm Billin' these niggas

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Look at y'all sharin' one bottle in the club, one bottle full of bub' ass niggas
Look at y'all not havin' game ass niggas, y'all niggas share a chain ass niggas
Same cup in the hand ass nigga in the club with a credit card scam ass nigga
No dick in the pants ass nigga, I be damned if I fuck a non-man ass nigga
I will, I will, I will never fuck a non-man ass nigga; I would never lie
Even if that nigga flew me and my bitches all the way out to Dubai
Pussy, you TRIED, pussy ass nigga you LIE, pussy ass nigga, you HIGH
Bitch I'm ME, hundred on the wrist, I SKI; art on the wall, BASQUI, fuck who SEE
Look at you fake dope dealers, know real niggas that be movin' weight in them villas
Talkin' 'bout ki's, say it's ki's in the van but he really move grams and he split it with his mans

[Chorus]
