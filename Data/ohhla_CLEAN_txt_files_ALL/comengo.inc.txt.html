[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah, yeah
Where are all my niggaz at
Where are all my bitches at
Huh, it's anotha one
Another Murder Inc Joint
Anotha Irv Gotti and Seven joint

[Chorus: Ja Rule &amp; Ashanti]
Bitches come, bitches go
But little do they know we don't love them ho's
Niggaz come, niggaz go
We ain't dealin wit niggaz that ain't got no dough
(Repeat once)

[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah
Just incase y'all didn't remember
Pimp up! Ho's down
And them rollies that didn't know me
Know now
Know how, I lay the ism to the women
Pop a collar don't drop a dollar
Still gettin it grinin
Slicker than linin
Wit the gator, hard bottle
See the dog got him
Droppin it like it's hot
Rubber band wrapped in knots
Keep the space to a minimum
I don't rap alot
A prince like J
And I'm serious about my pay
So play if you wanna mama
Daddy Caddy got an ass whippin for ya in the cut
So go on and act up
Watch my chips stack up
Cuz in this world it's M-O-B
Pimpin is in my blood
But I got thug tendinsies
Lead spit, my guns got a mind of their own
And a 'Lac truck sittin on top of the chrome
I'm tryna own, land
So I plan to blow
And chase the dough
Cuz bitches come and go, motherfuckers

[Chorus: Ja Rule &amp; Ashanti]
Bitches come, bitches go
But little do they know we don't love them ho's
Niggaz come, niggaz go
We ain't dealin wit niggaz that ain't got no dough
(Repeat once)

[Vita]
Yeah, pimpalicious
Uh-huh
Female pimp, Baller
Gangsta bitch
It Don't matter what you call me, just call me miss
Y'all all can get, a peice of my love
As long as you lickin and trickin and peice me wit dubs
It's all love
Cuz playboy, I'm not a hater
But Vita, will bring joy like a needa baka
Yea, and you lames get your weight up
If you had and you shoot your plants wit data
I advise you, not to try to, hard
Cuz you can get a E for F'in a scratch dark
Now listen, cuz niggaz ain't shit but tricks wit dicks
And I quote this, watch this
I play em like a game of spades
Kick back, martini's, while I lie in the shade
Ladies, if you really wanna know
It's all about the dough cuz niggaz come and niggaz go, ma

[Chorus: Ja Rule &amp; Ashanti]
Bitches come, bitches go
But little do they know we don't love them ho's
Niggaz come, niggaz go
We ain't dealin wit niggaz that ain't got no dough
(Repeat once)

[Vita]
Where all my ladies wit the cash that rock (we right here)

[Caddillac Tah]
Where my pimps wit the knots in their socks (we right here)

[Vita]
See my game's intact
Y'all lames is whack
Braggin bout stacks, playa fall back
All my gangsta mommas
Let em know ain't no need to holla
Playa drop them dollaz

[Caddillac Tah]
Picture that
Hustlin grindin and gettin stacks
Just to pin ya back, To a brodie
Man y'all know me
More or less know me
Ain't got love
Just log and bubble yum
And I'm fresh outta guns
So niggaz you play dumb
But I know how it go
And one things for sure
These bitches come and go(Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Ja Rule &amp; Ashanti]
Bitches come, bitches go
But little do they know we don't love them ho's
Niggaz come, niggaz go
We ain't dealin wit niggaz that ain't got no dough
