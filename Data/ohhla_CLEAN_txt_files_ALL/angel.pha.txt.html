Brother, ya betta think twice (twice)
See, ya can see the heat I will be her butter

[Chorus]
She's an angel
She's the girl, I want to share my dreams
She's an angel
I don't care if she can't fly over things
Ohhh She's an angel
I don't care if ya can't see her wings
Watch her flyyyyyyyy, yeah, muhfucka ohhh oh
