Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Let's go ridin, sidin, whippin and dippin
I know it's my car bitch, you ain't trippin
It's your favorite color, on a lovely day
You let me reach right over, and rub on your leg
I'm sayin all kind of shit, to make you smile
Put your seatbeat on, cause I be drivin wild
You think I'm like them other niggaz, I just wanna fuck
But I like to get money and get my dick sucked
I ain't your average everyday little hoe nigga
And I can see through you bitch youse a gold digger
tellin me stories, about the richest man
But I'm Too $hort baby, the bitch's pimp
I come a long way from young and done the certified player
I get what I want, and I'ma holler at you later
If you ain't got game you might think I'm a trick
Don't play yourself girl you won't get no dick
I take you right back home so you can be witcha man
I know you sucker motherfuckers won't understand
See me with a bitch and say I floss too hard
These hoes ain't trippin on me, they wanna fuck my car

	Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
	If you put your mind to it, you might get far
	No need to be a player or a superstar
	She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

She could care less about a real man
All she wants is a man with the meal plan
Pick her up in the Benz and hope she get to eat
Every day is Halloween hoe, trick or treat
I throw your ass in the trunk with a bag of rats
Drop you off at Kaiser like they did in The Mack
I know you're broke, fantasizing like Mariah
get a grip on my bumper, rub your clit on my tire
You can ride on top or wrap your legs around the frame
but if you get in this car you gonna respect this game
and I'm knowin that, I hope you know it too
Only real pimps know what I'm goin through
It's a daily mission, controllin these bitches
Uphold the pimpin, never start sympin
Got the cleanest drop Caddy for your eyes to see
So c'mon bitch and take a ride with me

	Now I'm about big blocks, drop tops
	White guts ending with much knock
	Got loot but dough ain't even trippin on it
	Got keys, to three hundred Z's, knowin these bitches

        Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
        If you put your mind to it, you might get far
        No need to be a player or a superstar
        She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

I gave you a ride for some head cause my dick was soft
But if you ain't widdit I'ma drop you off
I got hoes all around me all day and night
And yo little pussy's just way too tight
for a big black dick like mine to slide in
I take my motherfuckin time and ride it
Cause ain't no punk bitches where I'm from
They like to suck niggaz dicks, and make us cum
So get butt-naked let me slap that ass
Play with them titties while I tap that ass
Slam your face in the pillow, and arch that back
Have you lovin this dick like it's made of crack
cocaine, and you know that costs
Can't fuck for free you got to pay the boss
Hundred dollar bills bitch
I break your ass and won't feel shit
Cause pimpin, pimpin, that's my game
I got it from the O where it always rains
pimp game, now it's time to roll
And take my hoes down to the hoe stroll

        Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
        If you put your mind to it, you might get far
        No need to be a player or a superstar
        She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car

You ain't slammin doors like me cause I'm the coldest mack
From a brand new Benz to my old school 'llac
You ain't never gon stop my pimpin style
it's like two plus two, can you figure it out?
You say, what fo', I say that's right
You know the answer nigga pimpin for life
What's a trick to a hoe, some dope to a fiend
What's a bag of weed if the shit ain't green
You say the game is forever, well so am I
You only got two choices bitch, hoe or die
now speak up, you better say somethin
Before I turn your ass back into a pumpkin
Cause ain't no motherfuckin fairy tales
Only Freaky Tales, and I tell em so well bitch
Now get your ass in the car
Don't play me too close I won't pimp you too hard

        Now whether on the strip, or in the bar
        If you put your mind to it, you might get far
        No need to be a player or a superstar
        She ain't trippin on you she'd rather fuck your car
