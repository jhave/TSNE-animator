[Master P]

Oh yeah, and to our enemies
We don't hate you but uh, we got a place for ya
Cause uh

Somebody goin die tonight
No Limit assassins goin ride tonight (What's up Big Ed nigga)
Somebody goin die tonight
No Limit assassins goin ride tonight

Uhhhhhh, ha ha
My motherfuckin guns and my duty nigga
And let me handle my motherfuckin business

I served an ounce of cocain, and now I'm trapped in this game
So much weed to the brain, got you bangin for change
But I'm a No Limit soldier, tattooed in blood
Federal OZ's sold keys and now heroin and drugs
And this game got me trapped cause I've been bustin at bitches
And I've been standin on these projects countin up keys and kits
And these hoes wanna kill me, see me dead cause I'm rollin
And everything that I ride I pay with cash it's not stolen
Now I don't trip on no bitches and I don't trip on no niggas
You wanted the dope and some cain, now how'm I supposed to deliver
I got my game that's my G, I fuck with killers and ballers
I live for today and tonight so nigga fuck tommorow

See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight
See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight

[Big Ed]

I'm on my way to N.O. with four keys of cocain
I got murder on my brain with the trunk full of thangs
P told me meet him uptown, it's time to get dirty (third ward)
Got a bunch of niggas tatted up screamin ya heard me
Got them bout it bout it bitches ready to fuck
I said it bout it bout it nigga, cause they're ready to bust
Put my guns in the sky (sky), bullets goin fly (fly)
And I ain't satisfied till all my enemies die

[Master P]

See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight
See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes
And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight

Now drive nigga
We did that
No Limit soldier!
