        (Tic-toc)
        (Toc-tic) 3x

        (Tic-toc 
        You don't stop)

        (You)
        (You don't)
        (You don't)
        (You don't stop)
        (Hit it) 4x

If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman, and make her your wife
I mean ugly, so bad you can't look in her face
So fat she can't go down and tie her shoe lace
Now the reason that I say this, is simple and plain
All the pretty girls, man, they just play games
With your mind and your time, they're not with it
Cause if you ain't got no money, then you might as well (hit it)
But with an ugly girl, man, they'll simply adore ya
Like you can mess around and they'll still be there for ya
Cause you're all she has, and you're all she can get
So run out and find yourself an ugly chick
They'll be honest all the time, so boy, don't pursue her
Cause she's ugly as hell, nobody'll talk to her
So what she's a (bat) and a Godzilla (creature)
But it's not how she looks, it's how the girl (treats ya)
So if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman and make her your wife
Cause pretty girls'll have you cryin the blues
But when a ugly girl leaves (she ain't nothin to lose)
No

        (You)
        (You don't)
        (You don't)
        (You don't stop)
        (Hit it) 3x

Now here's a time of my life I won't forget for the world
When Cash hooked me up with this ugly girl
He said (Marv, she's bad, and she's a musical producer)
But I shoulda known with a name like Medusa
When she opened the door, man, it wasn't even funny
Cause the girl reminded me of King Kong Bundy
Bald-headed and fat, boy, she blew my mind
But she captured my heart (why) cause she was kind
Sat me down at the table for a bite to eat
Gave me a rose and a kiss on the cheek
My mind was in shock, man, I thought I was dreamin
Cause everytime I looked at her, I felt like screamin
I thought about leavin, but I stopped and chilled
Just thought to myself: can this be real?
She's not pretty at all, but she treats me like a king
(Is that why you care for that ugly thing?)
Yeah Cash, you probably dog her and call her a creep
But you know what? (what?) beauty's only skin deep
And no matter what you say, man, she seems to be sweet
Cause I've been datin her now for the past three weeks
So if you wanna be happy for the rest of your life
Man, find an ugly woman (yup) and make her your wife
Cause pretty girls'll have you cryin the blues
But when a ugly girl leaves (she ain't nothin to lose)</pre>
