[Intro]
I told ya'll niggas I was comin back hard nigga
Oh you ain't hear this shit since "Thug Motivation" nigga
Hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
Hoes ain't shit, and money ain't nothin
And if I nothing then it gotta be something
And if it ain't something then it gotta be nothing
If he ain't showed the cash then he gotta be bluffin
My dog hit me up, he say he got a lick
Gotta bad jump shot so he might shoot a brick
Talkin' reckless on my line, that's a technical foul
Don't know what the fuck you talkin about, I'm hangin up right now
Nigga you ain't Nick Cannon and this ain't wildin' out
I'm playin' my position, I ain't tryna foul out
Instant replay, yeah we bout to find out
Hey where the referee, I need to call a time out
You know

[Chorus]
If young is what they want
Then young is what they gettin'
They ask me what I do I tell 'em teachin for a livin
What you say nigga?
And I can show you how to make mill right now
And I can show you how to make a mill right now
If young is what they want
Then young is what they gettin'
They ask me what I do I tell 'em teachin for a livin
What you say nigga?
And I can show you how to make mill right now
And I can show you how to make a mill right now

[Verse 2]
Say he just touched down, and he need a touchdown
Second time he called today, think he goin' all the way
36 yard line, we goin' for the first down
Fed's playin' defence, everytime they come around
We goin' to the Super Bowl, if I make this field goal
I understand you gotta be, laymen's terms he need a three
He trippin about that extra point, that means he want a extra joint
Make sure you bring my extra cash, next time I see your extra ass
Huddle up, call the play, yeah I'm playin' quarterback
4 way, 2 way, bet I bring a quarter back
Weigh it up, bag it up, pass it to my running back
A dollar short on my pay, that's a flag on its way
You know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ninth innin' bases loaded I'm goin' for the grand slam
Tax free, tax free, I ain't givin' shit to Uncle Sam
Youngin playin softball, you playin softball
Yeah I'm playin softball, the same color as golf balls
Catch me in the out field, that's a whole lotta of grass
Tryna buy the franchise, that's a whole lotta cash
Damn right I'm saving up, think I'ma buy the team
Watch me get my bounty on, tryin to get my money clean
Focus quick watch the pitch can't afford another strike 
If I can make it through this, shit then I can play another night
Money right, money right, gotta get my money right
But first I gotta get these O's so make sure you wrap em right

[Chorus]</pre>
