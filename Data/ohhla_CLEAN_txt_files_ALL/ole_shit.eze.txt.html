Hey Yella

and we gonna do this shit like this...

[Gangsta Dresta]
Nigga eva deadly
ya just don't know who ya fuckin' wit
so I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin' bitch
before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast I leave my gang bang layin' on ya face
I tattoe Dre name on my chest 
cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed huh
and you won't see R.I.P. 
you'll see P.N.D. 
a Punk nigga deceased yeah
and the bitch that was yours will be mine buddy
all because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
and I had to make an example
nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
of a nigga with street wise reality 
that don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face 
contemplate my last day on and everyday base
cause a nigga neva know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
cause I don't wanna die slow
my funeral will be full of my peers
people that neva gave a fuck about me droppin'
threw me tears
I hope I'm in the casket face down
so all you muthaphukkaz can kiss my black ass now
and fuck all that cryin' all night
just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life
Yeah, and now you see you can't handle me
I give a shout to Tonel and the Ruthless Phuckin Family.

[Eazy-E]

muthaphukka

[Sylk]
Now it's about time for the Sylk to speak 
check dat ass last weak 
you off the chronic and you tweak
speak when I feel
cause I'm as real as they come
I'm a bitch with a gun 
neva run ain't for none
so step, step up
if ya wanna test ya luck trick
Sister like Sylk 
don't really giva a fuck bitch
punk bitches wanna step phony speak howdy doody
I make ya self break ya self bitch you neva new me
yours truly no longer layin' in the cut
steady phuckin' shit up
neva see me shakin' my butt I strut
like a gangsta bitch no not a pranksta bitch
I'm quick to gank a bitch trick
peep game at this bitch as I shoot this
gangsta bitch steppin' rollin' wit da Ruthless.

[B.G. Knocc Out]
The R-U-T-H-L-E double S 
yo it's the nigga knocc out

I'm kickin', tah spittin' this funky shit to make a quick phat buck
I'm doggin' a dog you suckaz can't talk bout tip flip I rip shit 
I'm stressin' "Damn cuz", "Pick it back up"
Chillin up in the studio
with the Ruthless Family
fuck the Death Row Posse 
yo them fools cannot handle me
Snoop and Andre ya come and try to fade the
Loc'ed out, Compton, Original Baby Gangsta
1-8-7's how we do it on the West
ya say ya shit is Chronic but to me it's more like stress
or should I say make my shit the stronic
Tha Dogg Pound don't wanna step to the atomic dog
D-O-T-K-N-O-Double-C-O-U-T so muthaphukka come and phuck wit me.

"Come On", "Come On"
"This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check 
Ruthless Muthaphukkin' Family ya still in effect"(x3)
"This is just a little something to keep ya ass in check 
Ruthless Muthaphukkin' Family" "Kick That Shit"

[Eazy-E]
Jealousy is a muthaphukka when your the man
with the other hand I don't give a shit
clock a grip like no other can
wanna be like me be a G like me
but I'm the nigga that made a G
outta the bitch D-R Eazy
I was the captain
Dre was my sidekick
everything was cool 
till he wanted to get what I get
any other real G Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
now claimin' you a G
how does it feel to be me</pre>
