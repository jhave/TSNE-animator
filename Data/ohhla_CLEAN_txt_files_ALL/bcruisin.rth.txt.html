[Intro]
Let's head into the ford taurus and cruise around the streets for a little bit

[Chorus]
Yo, we cruisin', Yeah, we cruisin'
Yo, we cruisin' down the streets
I got the money, Who got the dutchie?
You got the munchies, I got the weed
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
My homies in the front, got honeys in the back
Yo, roll that weed up and put it in the air
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2

[Verse 1]
Yo, roll it up (roll it tight), hit it once (hit it twice)
Pass it round (pass it round) but don't roll the windows down
Let's box it out (box it out) and save the trees (save the trees)
We hoppin' out like the mystery machine
My eyes be the size of Mr. Miyagis
Squinting to read the fine print on the widescreen
We riding, riding and that's when I see
Headlights behind me, I then start to freak
Hide the weed, oh x4
You know I got it

[Chorus 2]
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
My homies in the front, got honeys in the back
Yo, roll that weed up and put it in the air
You know we be
Blunt Cruisin' x2
Yo, we cruisin', Yeah, we cruisin'
Yo, we cruisin' down the streets
I got the money, Who got the dutchie?
You got the munchies, I got the weed

[Verse 2]
Yo, stop at Sef's for a drink, ice cream and some chips
Where's the dutch at, homie pass that shit
Not like that, homie, ash that shit
Can you turn this song up, homie, ash that shit
You don't need roach clips if you can't hold it
You can use your phone tip, hurry up and take this
Fa real man, hurry up and take this shit
Yo, it's burning my fingertips, dude
Drop the weed, oh x2
Yeah I got it
Drop the weed, oh x2
Yeah I got it, oh x3
