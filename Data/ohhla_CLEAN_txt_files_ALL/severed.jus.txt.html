Yeah
You know the name
Omnipotent baby
Right in front of ya eyes...

[Verse 1: Jus Allah AKA Megatraum]
Yo I'm way beyond the hatin' stage
make you fucking bathe in razor blades with someone gay with aids
I'm the god that waves your chance of being saved
You owe me your faith
Parable money and names
Motherfuckers acting funny as flames
Who would follow you? I should kill you and bottle you and bury you
Underneath the ground like it swallowed you
You lack a common thinking degree
Devil got you dumb slaves fucking thinking you're free
You're not even alive
Your brain just supports your 9 to 5 lost from your tribe taking false prides
Believing in the false guides--taking opposite sides
Listening to the prophet who ties
Prophets from lies, your hands and a pocket of knives
So sharp, you can't even see the marks, with your optical eyes
You're a fucking joke
Another nigga stuffed in a boat
Blind to the ten pound choke
Coughing in throats
Motherfuckers turn the dust in my grips
Ice melts before touching of my lips
Wise men covered me with gifts
The next is, face hanging from a necklace
A true meaning of X-Mas--Measureless
Deaf and by my ill residence
It's perpetuous--THe fucking earth shakes and the seconds split

[Chorus] X2
Catch this beatdown
Who the fuck want beef now?
Flow to make the seas drown five burning trees down
Deep rooted, we rap forever and rip
Yo my crew will leave your fucking head severed and split

[Verse 2: Bomshot]
Aiyo I conquer lands, high hills and deep valleys
Control crowds, start rising spark ralleys
Unite forces, ignite and light torchers
Command fortress, demand expand sources
Revive corpses, all hail the dalai lahma
The great gandhi, extract salt from seawater the embalmer
I dip blunts and get illy
Alot karma, hypnotized the snake trauma
Burn like dr.Jerm the chemical Ali
You die, Hussain from Marocco to Bali
More arms than sheiva, guishna
I smash vinyls with a flame in my hand, To buckies with their own bibles
My god's iller
Breath fire like godzilla
King Kong hits back and forth like ping-pong
To remix ya, My flows deep, the elixer
To baptize ya, at last--THe messiah


[Chorus] X2
Catch this beatdown
Who the fuck want beef now?
Flow to make the seas drown five burning trees down
Deep rooted, we rap forever and rip
Yo my crew will leave your fucking head severed and split

[Verse 3: T-Ruckus]
Yo, I appear right in front of your eyes
A fucking broken neck was the cause of this nigga's demise
Despise since the day I was spawned, In the fires
Despite heavyweight 'till my plate, I'm at rise
Fate got me chasing these lies and all the fame
I'm trying to blaze ya brain, with rhymes you know the name
My games got run, tonz o gunz that deliver
I'm deep rooted, T-Ruckus for ever my nigga
Niggaz got taken, sheisty cats want more
You play yourself like a sloppy bitch on tour
I'm cocky like Rocky
Belboa flame thrower
I Scorch ya, torch ya
Touch ya when I rush ya
You got clapse, cynapse , collapse from the pressure
So fuck you, your fam got hit with this lecture
Don't let me hear you flapping them gums
I run upon ya crew like you rapping stars slapping with guns
I make you want your funds in the back of the slums
Malicious hack leaving gashes and some
I'm lethal like antrax on a fucking heartattack
I spit out bangers you're on your shit like axlax

[Chorus] X2
Cash the beat down
Who the fuck want beef now?
Flow to make the seas drown five burning trees down
Keep doing, we rap forever and rip
Yo my cool will leave your fucking head severed and split

[Verse 4: Virtuoso]
My pyrotechnic flies your ethnic out the rhyme inspector
Tired of vagina lectures
Now it's for breakfast
See how fast your mind elects it, my selection
Hard to scarm down the texture
Now I'm your harvest sheperd of the sheep
I'll lead the vinyl records
Your ??? lecture, I'll lift you the light as a feather
The weapon will hit you the line of your life's been severed
To a city ship what the fuck were you thinking bitch?
I'm drama within the booth I blow your mind like Lincoln bitch
A terrorist I tear bricks with bare fists
Fearless, you scared bitch go talk to your therapist
It's Virtuoso check the logo
Know I'll spit the mecca mojo
Someone got your chick shootin game like Rabecca logo(?)
Where my teccas blow bow, fully automated
Got alot of hate, you need pray on this crumb leave it gestapo naked
My mic game make disgracion, teams are rightous indignation
We fight in prison cages for the rights of liberation
Swing a knife and slit your face and satan devil minions catch ya
Slap the taste out your mouth, and apply your face with ??
Clap you with the metal I spit, settle this shit
You ain't let devils can get your head severed and split

[Chorus] X4
Cash the beat down
Who the fuck want beef now?
Flow to make the seas drown five burning trees down
Keep doing, we rap forever and rip
Yo my cool will leave your fucking head severed and split</pre>
