[Trina]
See I don't need Nann Nigga
Jockin' me, slowing me down
Or stoppin' me
Climbing all on top of me
If he ain't gonna fuck me properly
It's got to be, possibly
A dick that ain't too soft for me
Nigga get your ass up off of me
Besides your dick to small for me
I gots to be fucked right, sucked right
In the butt right like a slut like
In the bright lights, every day all night
Now talk to me, why you fuck me violently?
Calling me names that apply to me
Cumming all inside of me
Don't lie to me, now tell the truth
Is this pussy good to you?
Grip for you, good and tight
But full of juice
Why wouldn't you?
Why shouldn't you?
Scream while I am riding you
Over you making this pussy stroke for you
Like your bitch supposed to do
Close to you and I'm feeling most of you
Deep for me, we can meet
Fuck me till I fall asleep
Not unless there three nuts for me
Or get your ass up off of me
Ol' tired ass nigga besides
You ain't even all that any way
FUCK YOU!

1  [Trick Daddy]
    Bitch I don't need you
    No way, no how, not then, not now
    Uh-uh, bitch

Repeat 1 (3x)

[Trick Daddy]
Oh you done blowed
Bitched you done showed out
And I got no beef
If this was my house bitch
You would've been thrown out
And y'all bitches better hold up
Simmer down and get the fours up
Mouth all tored up
All this is swolled up
Y'all bitches better show some love
Or your licking these nuts saying that freaky stuff
And you ain't gotta have the best head
But bitch it better be close enough
See I don't need ya, I don't see ya
And I really won't wanna be ya
If head is nappy and you boppin' me
Young bitch then that's illegal
You always braggin' and beggin'
Talkin' 'bout what the last nigga gave ya
See everybody ain't able
But y'all bitches so ungrateful
You need to ask questions about dushy
Cause I hate the smell of stank pussy
And you're under arms a little musky
I was gonna spare ya but you had to push me

Repeat 1 (4x)</pre>
