That's what I ain't gon' do
Ride three gold thangs with one hubcap in white?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Meet at the club and not try to fuck tonight?
Nah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Marinate, make you niggas wait and not have my shit tight?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Catch a Rémy Jones, hit the sto' and only flip a half pint
Nah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Let my big cousin rock my Roley to the club tonight?
Nah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Flip a new Benz and tear my shit up the same night
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Hit that cigar if it ain't filled up with light?
Nah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Meet a bitch and if she don't fuck take the lil' bitch to get a bite?

That's what I ain't gon' do
Youknowmnsayin?
Some shit just ain't gon' happen
That's what I ain't gon' do
Muthafuckas be gettin mad at a nigga, youknowmsayin?
That's what I ain't gon' do
I mean, let Rich be Rich, youknkowmsayin?
That's what I ain't gon' do
That's just a muthafucka get down, youknowmsayin?
Check this

That's what I ain't gon' do
Push a Navigator and not have my shit on dubs?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Fuck with these squares in the streets who be thinkin they thugs?
Nah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Slang you zipper and the sack ain't go no buds?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Visit my nigga in jail with a pocket full of drugs

That's what I ain't gon' do
Feel that?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Youknowmsayin?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Niggas ain't really knowin, youknowmsayin?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Feel this

That's what I ain't gon' do
Call the right number and then say the wrong name twice?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Still come through even if I'm bein followed by the vice?
A-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Take you to the mall and buy you a gang of shit?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Show you how to ball, so you can run and tell the next bitch?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Ride all day without wanna get my shit wiped?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Floss high-po and not be sideways to the light?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Draw down but not let the muthafuckin glock smoke
That's what I ain't gon' do
Go Downtown and run my mouth to them damn white folks

That's what I ain't gon' do
Youknowmsayin?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Certain muthafuckas just ain't really knowin
That's what I ain't gon' do
415...
That's what I ain't gon' do
Richie Rich

That's what I ain't gon' do
See the five-o and try to swing a type donut?
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Be the nigga at the bar talkin shit but outside throwin up
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Let baby tell me what I'm doin with my weekly check
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Try hard to be the man and hit the club with a fake Rolex

That's what I ain't gon' do
What?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Not me, baby (Not Double)
That's what I ain't gon' do
Some niggas is original
That's what I ain't gon' do
Youknowmsayin?
Check this out, man

That's what I ain't gon' do
Fuck no bitch on the first night bare cap raw
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Kiss no bitch that I heard had a hell of a jaw
Nah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Fuck with my nigga 40 Water when he slappin them balls
Ah-ah, that's what I ain't gon' do
Try to bust a left in the hood when I see Tom Jones
Look, that's what I ain't gon' do
Use your studio if you say I can't blow my weed?
That's what I ain't gon' do
Pull the panties off and still hit it if it startin to bleed?
Ew, that's what I ain't gon' do
Be the second knowin damn well I coulda been the first
Check it, that's what I ain't gon' do
Stop spittin that same-ass line "if you scared go to church"

That's what I ain't gon' do
We gon' bounce on this one
That's what I ain't gon' do
All my niggas.. we finna do it
That's what I ain't gon' do
They gon' have to, they gon' have to give us this
That's what I ain't gon' do
Niggas ain't really knowin it's all about the hoes
That's what I ain't gon' do
Dedicated to all my real niggas, you know
That's what they ain't gon' do
They ain't gon' do it
That's what I ain't gon' do
Youknowmsayin?
