[Mocha]
But uh anyway
You could catch me any day
Sipping Hennessey
And my peeps get plenty way
But anyways, to see that I hold this dough
Cats fake it
I made it 
I told you so
Mocca late kid
We no play
Stress free, sexy and my Tico bag
Its a pity that
Yall look like idiots
Yo boo let me know when I should rip this cat

[Nicole Ray- Verse 1]
Im mad he dont call me anymore
He dont even cares
Damn right, this fool
What must I do
To keep him loving me
All this love I give
That aint cool

1-  I got what you want (got what you want)
      I got what you need (got what you need)
      Can I get another shot
      This time Ima make it hot
             (repeat x 2)

[Nicole Ray - Verse 2]
Call while Im at the crib
He turned off his phone
Said to call him back
Why silly me
Why didnt I suspect
He was making love
To someone else
Boy you cant leave me

[Repeat 1]

Oh yeah (x 4)

[Repeat 1]
[Missy Elliott]
Im sitting on the side of the curb
With a pocket of herb
I dont know if yall heard
But Im high as a bird
I can fly like Kelly
I can slide like skates
Me with no Timbalands 
Is like Puff with no Mase
Wait , hold up
Wait a minute, what you say
Back it up, give me space
Who that, Nicole Ray
By the way, DJ, better play all day
Make the whole world say Damn this sucker Ray
Yo yo yo 
Yeah this been kinda junk
That be making everybody wanna bop their heads
Haters, lovers, whatever
Nicole Ray
Timbaland 
Mag-a-noo
Aaliyah
Ginuwine
Missy 
Playa

[Repeat 1 (with Timbaland repeating Nicole Ray)]
