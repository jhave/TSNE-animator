[Puffy]
I'm not wit none of that 
Standin' around lookin' cool and shit
I want you motherfuckers to jump the fuck up
And have some motherfuckin' fun
You understand what it means to be black?
I have my man the Notorious B.I.G in the back
I go by the name of the Puff Daddy
But check this shit out 
Four, five
As we procced to give you what you need

[Notorious B.I.G]
Sick of momma screamin' that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, gotta rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in the hoop
Whispered in his ear, this is what we gotta do G
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I could cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby mama screamin', your daughter twelve months
Can't live life slingin' rocks and smokin' blunts
Hangin' with the nigga's don't pay the bills
And bein' broke at 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? (Hell yeah, I see that shit)
Columbian, Dominican, yeah whatever
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, twenty G's, nigga please
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't need

1 - 	On the road to riches and diamond rings
	Real niggaz do real things
	Hanging wit the bitches is the song I sing
	Real niggaz do real things

	On the road to riches and diamond rings
	Real niggaz do real things
	Hanging wit the bitches is the song I sing
	Real niggaz do real things

[Puff Daddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I tote gats wit my nigga, clap wit my nigga
Break bread and then break backs wit my nigga
Jack wit my nigga, cock the latch wit my nigga
Now how you gon' act wit my nigga?
Just remember there's a gun to your dome
And I will lick shots and run through your home
Or better yet I put your son to the chrome
Turn the music up and unplug the phone
I will kill him, read my lips
You too, motherfucker if I don't see no bricks
See, I flips when I don't see no chips
Yeah, nigga, I know you in pain, I don't care nigga
I want the stash, keys, hash, weed, G's motherfucker, freeze
Cock sucker, you better bring the things out 
Before I blow your motherfucker frame out
Nigga what

Repeat 1

[Lil' Kim]
Real big nigga's over here talkin' shit
Yo fuck that, I'm gon' check these nigga's
Fuck that, fuck that
What you said? Speak up, I can't hear ya
Oh, thought you was talkin' to us, um pardon me, my bad
I shoulda known ya'll ain't wanted with these three time losers
The open surgeons heart removers
Niggaz think they gon' stop my ones
Put a contract out and stop ya'll lungs
We powerful, don't think that all we got is guns
We buy out everything you claim, including your name
Mama bitch squeeze the life out of ya'll nigga's
Screw barkin', I take bites out of ya'll nigga's
Crack open your safe then put a bomb to it
Fuck shootin' windows nigga, I jumps through it
With the all black hood, he beat a nigga 'till he hurl
Then pull the hoodie off so he can see it was a girl
When it comes to my nigga B.I.G 
I wanna see all ya'll niggaz D.I.E

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real bitches do real things
Hanging with the niggas is the song I sing
Real bitches do real things

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real bitches do real things
Hanging with the niggas is the song I sing
Real bitches do real things

Repeat 1</pre>
