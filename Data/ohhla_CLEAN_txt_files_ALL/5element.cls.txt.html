And it's the 5th element (uh huh)
Never repetitive (nah)
Highly competitive (all right)
Happy and elegant (yeah)
"I'm gettin' busier, can't you tell?
I got the rhymes that sound so well"

[Chorus]
And it's the 5th element, never repetitive
Highly competitive, happy and elegant
"I'm gettin' busier, can't you tell?
I got the rhymes that sound so well"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got no time to waste
Back and it's time to embrace
Kid is too nice, I ain't fallin' flat on my face
I figured it out, yeah guess I'm crackin' the case
And I ain't slowin' up, infact I'm detachin' the brace so
believe me when I say it
I ain't gunna take no shit from no man
Especially from no assholes
Class is too much, I flex words like muscle
And I ain't a hustla but I'm livin' off my hustle
Diggin' in the grates, maneuver the track
Went from rapper who produced to producer who raps
Kid, respect drive if you don't respect rhymes
We all got our taste but I stood the test of time

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And ever since I started movin' up and popped off this class
I've been gettin' more attention and often more ass
Listen, love women, can't stand sluts
Media's fucked, irritating, all of the above (yep)
My flow ain't pretty, rhymes ain't gritty
I'm in between from the country, livin' in the city
And record labels never saw a thing in me
But I can tour and a thousand kids sing with me
A modern day hippy, yeah changin' up the norm
Smoke dope, you can say I'm bakin' up a storm
I dress like I'm sixteen, spit like a pro
Wear the same clothes in every video and every second show
This is me, tryin' to do it comfortably
Lazy as hell but I run my own company
And most music, really I despise it
But I hate on everything, I even hate most of my shit

[Chorus] {X2}

[Scratches]
"Classified"

[Verse 3]
Hip hop ain't the same, I remember parents used to hate it
But hip hop is grown up and now parents play it
Everybody and the grandmother love rap now
And everybody and their grandmother try to rap now
I'm a fan but I'm loosing my cool
cos every rapper that I hear keeps abusing they tools
You can't make an album with 12 battle tracks
When your punchlines are whack and you can't make hyenas laugh {*croak croak*}
Most rappers don't like me, I can live with it
Diss me on your record cause really I don't give a shit
Say that I'm a sell out, call my beats commercial
But it's only music man, I don't take none of it personal

[Chorus] {X2}</pre>
