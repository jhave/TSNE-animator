Typed by: blohm@u.arizona.edu

Chorus:
Body movin, body movin, 
A1 sound, sound so soothing
Body movin, body movin, 
We be getting down and you know we're Krush Groovin

Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong
The ship is docking, inter-lockin
And up-rockin electro-shocking
We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Chorus

Flame on, I'm gone 
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music drivin you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame
Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

Chorus

Mike D with the master plan
Ooh my my and thank you ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream 'Ooh, god damn'
The creme de la creme is who I am
MCA where have you been 
Packed like sardines in the tin 
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
Adrock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender I could be your hyper space

Chorus
