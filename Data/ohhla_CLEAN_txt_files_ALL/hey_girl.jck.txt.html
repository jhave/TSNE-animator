(V.1-Jacka)
Hey girl, what's ya name

Hey girl, what's ya name

(Girl)
Hey boy, what's ya name

(Verse 1-Jacka)
It's the jack
Yeah I'm a dope dealer
On top of that I'm a liar and a stealer
You gotta remember I'm ya nigga homes
Real big like king kong and godzilla in the same room
I'm on the run from the boys havin fun
But I know I'll feel tha pain soon
Yo, look what I go threw
I know youu want me to stay all night
But I gotta flight
To the next state, cop me a zip
So I can concentrate
While I travel tryin to make my rhymes elivate
And ya trunk raddle at the same time
Feelin high, feelin fly man at the same time
I'm in K.C. pushin kicks
With my nigga freeway rich
I smoked a zip
And one day I'm feelin crazy
Always hella loaded so the hoes think I'm lazy
But really I'm rich

(Chorus)
(Jacka)
Hey girl, what's ya name?
(Kazi)
Flossin in ya 4 dot with ya chain
Posin in ya half top, tough and braids
Lookin like you want dick, what's game
(girl)
Hey boy what's ya name?
Lookin like a rapper, but you prolly push 'cain
Rockin ya drop top pumpin game
Frontin like you really that hard to tame

(Verse 2-Uzi)
Fresh out the plane
Pants saggin with my dick in my hand
Who am I? bitch, I'm U-Z-I yes I still push 'cain
I ain't gone front main
Feeliin it under pressure with my ninjas feelin pain
I'm a ghetto star
So don't approach sidewayz girl
Might smack ya hard
I'm still young
It might be yo ho that I flip and smash on
Run her over in my big wheel with no mask on
From Africa to England
And Back to the bay
Oochies stay hatin
Girl hey
Oochies stay hatin

(Verse 3-Kazi)
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
Yo, I push the 4's the 5s
It's not a game
Night time livin life in the fast lane
Quite live at the light
I see the boys to the right
It's a must i get out of they sight
I...tucked the 2 E
Dumb cop made a Ui (u-turn)
To my left squatin off was a cutie
Sparkin up, her car was tough
It must've her man's truck
Mommy actin like she can't talk
Her look was ill
If looks could kill I'm bout to be a dead man
Trapped in the losts of the land
It's not me, really
I just wanna get to know ya
If it's right spend the night
Blow trees enormous
You the thug type
Sneak a gun up in the club type
Heavy on the wrist ma you aint right
Stop trippin girl quit ya games
Kazi just wanna know ya name

(Chorus)2x</pre>
