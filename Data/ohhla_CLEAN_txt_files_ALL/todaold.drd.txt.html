[Tragedy]
Yeah, this is gonna be fat.  
Hold up, ayo, what happened to the track, man?

[Dred Scott]
Ayo, the drum machine is broke, man.

[Tragedy] 
The drum machine is broke?  
Then how we going to...
yo, I came down here to make this song, 
how we gonna make this song if the drum machine's broke?

[Dred Scott]
I know, Trag.  But I was thinking, 
maybe we can take it back to the old days 
and I can do a little beat box.  
Know what I'm sayin, the human beat box?

[Tragedy]
The beat box?  You're not serious, kid.

[Dred Scott]
Check it out, though, here's what I was thinking, 
listen to this.  (Starts beatboxing)

[Tragedy]
That's kinda funky right there
Awww yeah, come on, yeah, yeah
Check him out, come on!
Live and direct in the place to be
It's the beat, we got my man Dred Scott
And the brother Tragedy, and this is how we do

I'm a get busy and drop my flow
For the year '94, trying to make the dough
Brothers try to act like they don't know
You'd better act like you know because I'm on the go
Rolling through your crowd like an army tank
I wanna get loose so I can put it in the bank
Yo Dred, keep em going, and I'll keep em flowing
Doing what I'm doing while my pockets keep growing
On to break, and we're hard to shake
Yo Dred, you're hitting harder than an earthquake
Tragedy, hitting harder than an earthquake
Cause I drop the lyrics, I drop the lyrics
I drop the lyrics with shake 'n' bake
I got he flavor, check him out, come on
Check him out, yeah that's fat

[Dred Scott]
Ha ha, see what I'm saying?

[Tragedy]
True, true, true</pre>
