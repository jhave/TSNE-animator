Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Kool Keith]
Well I flick flick, flow flow, niggaz know I'm no joke
Can I get a deal, can I rhyme you dumb slow poke?
I'm not the wiggy one, heavy like a megaton
I got a shell and a pretty black shotgun
The Fourth Horseman, the biggy boss man
I do my dirty work and travel when I cross men
Don't call me Rocky, Marcy-or-the-ano
A white band with a black grand piano
People gather 'round on my pee pee, penis
I stomp out quick, you catch a porno flick
I got a major label hoppin on my drumstick
I kick anus, I rock a rectum
Who's the A&amp;R, disrespect 'em
I see brother get down and sign a whack group
You Uncle Tom, you black Fruit Loop
So what you know about rap you little fairy?
Critics can walk and suck my wee wee okay~!
I drop bombs like the paper called The Times
Rappers are whack, you paid 'em forty G's

[Chorus]
People can talk, say what they want {*4X*}

[TR Love - or at least it doesn't SOUND like Ced Gee]
Hey! I'm over here and over there, been there and everywhere
Take a look stop and stare, GLANCE and then compare
Where's your ears boy? Rhythm the top choice
You know you can't front on me, cause now I got the voice
Here I here I come, not the wannabeez
AC/DC's, and the Bee Gee's
Groups that can't - rap, groups that can't - sing
Groups that have a gimmick more image and other things
My name ain't - Quayle, my name ain't - Bush
A 4-H-M, a superstar with push
The ragga mecha don, with suckers on my cock
You know I got the flavor, so why you got the boogies?
Sham, buddy!

[Chorus]</pre>
