[Intro: Fabolous]
You know when your down, you come from the bottom
You at your lowest, there's only one thing left to do

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Stimulate yo' mind girl it's friday you ain't got shit to do
I put you on to some real shitif you ain't scared to take a hit or two
Stay away from that Reggie, can't deal with them middle men
Who gives a fuck if he keep it clean you can't ride on them little tens
They say they got it, they ain't got it, they don't seem to feel no guilt
Got peanut butter but no jelly, got cereal but no milk
Where I'm from that's a half ass nigga
Half of the time old had past nigga
Mad 'cause they can't get down with the team still sayin that they end of the draft ass nigga
Gettin high on these low lifes, dead to chumps give 'em no life
Cut 'em loose keep yo' knife, don't meet a hoe and make her yo'wife
Don't make a hoe yo' husband neither, hard to win the game when you playin with a cheater
I be tellin them that you can't change niggas, better off keepin that change for the meter

[Chorus: Sample]
We get high, high, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so shy, and fly, that it's hard to know just where ya at
We get high, high, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so shy, and fly, that it's hard to know just where ya at
We get high

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
How high, how high, just came from the O.G. man
My eyes so Redman, that M-E-T-H-O-D Man!
I'm talkin 'bout pimpin been since pimpin since been pimpin uh!
I'm talkin 'bout don't near no mu'fucker sayin that near 'nother
Uh! Tell 'em no mo' mr. nice guy, you hoes way past half baked
If I got paid to hear chicks lie, would've mad emore cheese then Kraft make
And these niggas be actin up, RiRi must be serious
Wonder what the shit hittin fo', real niggas is curious
These niggas stuck on my old joint, already know how the high feel
Let chick know she is not low, even though she in high heels
Six hundred for the gas, that ain't nothin but a hot meal
Bitch don't be a high kill, you know over here

[Chorus: Sample]
We get high, high, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so shy, and fly, that it's hard to know just where ya at
We get high, high, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so shy, and fly, that it's hard to know just where ya at
We get high</pre>
