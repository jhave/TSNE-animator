[Royal Flush]
She was sweetest young thing in this life
Had two kids and worked nights, never had shit, but we ate right
And slept tight, my daddy's livin the bad life
Used to come home nights and beat on his wife
I was too young to really understand about life
Used to cry a lot, hopin that my father get shot
Plus he sniff a lot (What that nigga beef about every fuckin day?)
My brother said something got to make him stop
Cuz mommy go to hard for every little thing we got
It was a stress and pain, had a young child, goin insane
Until one day, he slapped my brother right in the face
And my mother started running all over the place
I went downstairs and grab the nine from the safe
Went back upstairs and put the shit right in his face
What up now daddy, I shot him in the face and smiled loud
Now her body froze, lookin at my father die slow
She can't believe it though, started screamin baby don't go
He said two words, and breath went dead and blood fled
My face turned red, couldn't understand what I did
Brother scared as shit, losin my mind, my moms flip
Tears from my eye drip, I grabbed her tightly and kissed
I said we miss him, but no longer do we go thru this shit
So when the cops come, I'm the one that let off the gun
Only thing I'm askin, when I get a visit, you come
Tell my brother 'bout the story, right now, he too young
Cuz he can't figure out the things that we've been through
The lifestyles that's goin on now, life is so wild</pre>
