Rakim: 
Calling all Rugrats (3x)
Please come in Rugrats

Take it to the maximum
Take it to the max (8x)

Rakim:
All in together lets make a game 
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Rakim: Take it to the maximum

Rakim:
The trains been highjacked on track and never come back
The express, the last stop is where the funs at
I got my friends, a car full of hostages
To the destination, they'll be lots of kids
Enough said, take it full steam ahead
I give extreme direction to the team of fed
We ain't a breeze, once we hit top speed they gonna panic
But it's aerodynamic
Scream across the planet
Engines go against a airforce wind
Adrenaline, make sure the trail of force won't end
The third rail prevails
We don't pretend to spin
Next questions is when will the fun begin
What will we get there, double the kicks
Hurry up because we can get in trouble for this
Speeding the Rugrat's and them we have to come
Take it to the maximum

All in together lets make a game 
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Come On
Rakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)

Rakim:
Keep it moving, is this the fastest this thing can go? (No) 
Did we lose them?
Speed it up we're going too slow, where's the turbo button at? (Right here 
I'ma push it)
Anymore juice that can boost the blow,
Stand back give me that, I'ma play a game
Let's see who can gain on the runaway train
Everything is real so I know I'll win
While you wish you could, I know I can
It's action pack, I was meant for this
High energy and adventurous
Look around we're going faster than the speed of sound
Anymore faster and we'll leave the ground
Day designed, outlined the curve
We zig-and-zag till we start to swerve
Speeding the Rugrat's and them we have to come
Take it to the maximum

All in together lets make a game 
We can all win if we play the same
Whoever gets caught got to take the blame
We gon' take the train, take the train

Take it to the maximum (3x)
Rakim: Take it to the maximum (2x)

Rakim:
Yo, Yo, take it to the maximum, yaknahmean?
And right now I want to give a major shout out to my little peoples
To Otis, Arlo, Gabby, Little Jamie, Jerdy, Jay, Justin, Jared

Danny Saber:
