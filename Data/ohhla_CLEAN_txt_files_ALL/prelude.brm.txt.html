[Intro: Reek Da Villain]
Yeah yeah yeah, Bussa Buss, is you with me?
(There's just one thing I wanna say)
J-Doe, is you with me?
(There's just one thing I wanna say)
Tiger Woods, is you with me?
(There's just one thing I wanna say)
Flizzy Whoa is you with me?
(There's just one thing I wanna say)
Yeah, Rozay is you with me?
(What goes around comes back around again)
Strong Isle is you with me?
(What goes around comes back around again)
New York, is you with me?
(What goes around comes back around again)
Quiet Storm, is you with me?
(What goes around comes back around again)
Conglomerate, is you with me?

[Verse 1: Reek Da Villain]
Here goes the villain and you know we don't fake it
If it ain't dead presidents he don't chase it
Laying in a Bentley, or swerving in a Benzy
Two-tone chain, black and white Spud McKenzie
These mashed-potato niggaz all mushy
At the round table with each other paying footsy
Try to style on me, play me like I'm Cookie
But revenge is the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Now I'm layin' in the yard with a Mack 10
One of my five shooters with me, John Paxton
Soon as he pulled up, the car, made it back spin
Transformed from a black man into Mike Jackson
Skin all white like he Michael (Michael)
Fucked nigga, life is a cycle (cycle)
How you drive your mom in a hearse
If my 38 special revolve 'round your earth?

[Chorus:]
What goes around comes back around again
What goes around comes back around again
What goes around comes back around again
What goes around comes back around again

[Verse 2: J-Doe]
They say what goes around... come back around
They used to laugh at me for rappin', but who laughing now?
They see me stylin' on the TV and the magazines
Which only mean one thing (what?) stackin' green
My flow on fire like I lit it up with gasoline
Was so inspired by No Limit, now I'm Master P
At least that's what these hoes call me
But that's because I'm balling with no Spalding
My style is similar to no other (no other)
I'm bound to get it, word to my mother
You need Fire Marshall Bill, In Living Color
'Cause I'm burnin' shit down, year round, 'til summer ('til summer)
For those who never heard me before
Welcome to the fan club with J-Doe
Never in the box, always chains froze
I won't stop 'til I'm on top, let's go

[Chorus]</pre>
