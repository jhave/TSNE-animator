Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Cut the music up
A lil' louder
Yeah

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love... how to love, mmm
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner try and put it together
How to love... how to love, mmm
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you movin your body
like you never had a love (ay) never had love (ay)

[Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young'un your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessin
but you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're, sittin here, in this damn corner
Lookin through all your thoughts and lookin over your shoulder

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Ohh and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it - wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talkin to me, be the one listenin but
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin
Just as much as you admire bartendin and strippin baby
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin
You seem a lot of crooks and the crooks still crooked

[Chorus] sans last three lines

[Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, yeah
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usual

[Chorus] - 2X sans last three lines</pre>
