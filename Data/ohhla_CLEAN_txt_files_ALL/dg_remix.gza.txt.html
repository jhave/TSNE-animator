[Chorus: Raekwon]
POP POP POP, when it shots, whose to blame?
Three get dropped and removed from the game
One get knocked, now his whole life is changed
Cuz he's so far from freeing the world, that seem strange

[GZA]
I come from a place where they say, death comes too soon
Where the hoods on the block, dance to a different tune
Every night and every day, hotels of foul play
Turns fatal, when this hostile land of AK's
On any date, not wait to pump them rounds
The reminder; it's a murderer stomping ground
With one less witness, gunned down in the staircase
Who had led his crew, but he was moving at a snail's pace
Many suspects, many possible motives
Just kept coming with unstoppable explosives
The weak fold in these most extreme conditions
While the rivals quickly strengthen their position
The mission was to move in, with sheer brute force
And lives, they get lost, on a collision course
The streets are fascinating, so they gotta explore it more
But not without walking through some hurricane corridors
Become the most wanted, life can seem haunted
Thugs and agents who work closely up on it
Patriotic hustlers that kill for presidents
Conceal the truth, but can't hide the evidence
A man died holding some dice that he was shaking
Like a bank stop, but no valuables was taken
Shot at 8:45, but he died at 9
A video was the most precise witness to the crime, it's on

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook: Ras Kass]
Uh, crips and bloods, bricks and thugs
Clips and thugs, that's gangsta
Lifes, more disciples, send me assault riffles
Bust if he don't like you, that's gangsta
O-3-1's, and, Latin Kings with
Dirty guns, that's gangsta
Shot dozen coppers, Mexican mafias
Killing innocent, and son they dons

[Ras Kass]
Yo, a view to a killing, aim two to the ceiling
When niggas started illin', random chick catch a stray
Now her whole nose is peeling, and some girls is squeeling
So the po-po's concealing the exits
The four-four's grilling at the next shit
Homey's wetless, when they tech spit
Death is something, that's the best shit
Niggas play XBox 360, wet shit
Halo 2 and SoCom, fresh paws hit the block
There go Saddam, muthafuckas know your moms
But get frustrated and blow your bombs
Little niggas is too small to hold they arms
Drex' should of thought about that, before get gone
Sixteen years old getting charged as adult
Conservatives, want harsher sentences but get no result
And I still can't read a burner, maybe I'm part of the problem
But when the war's going on outside, you know the outcome

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
