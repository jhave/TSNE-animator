Well...this is the party where the people get hardy
where the party never just don't stop.
So just clap your hands and stomp your feet,
and make your body rock.
Well....I'm D-A-Z, the MC of the night.
Came here to jam just to rock the mic.

(Kurupt)
Now gangsta don't dance, they boogie with
a little of this and a little bit of that and a fat 50 sack.

(Daz)
Come on and break it down. Baby girl, let me see you
do your thang.
Man I love it when the party just swang.
Shake it all around and let your boo-ty' swang.

(Kurupt)
You know there's a party goin on and my moms ain't home.
The feeling is right, we doin this all night long.

(Daz)
Come on make it hot.
Baby girl, won't you do your thang, make it pop.

Chorus   2x
