Alright so what I want to talk about tonight is 
Why are your friends so annoying? 
It doesnt make any sense
These are the people you have picked to be with
You're like these people and yet everything that they do
You're never going to the right restaurant

[Wale]
I keep my friends close
Enemies on a leash like
Me and my haters is literally Siamese
I can define me but if I let my friends do it
They'll tell you I'm some bipolar, hard drug user
The J gets smaller, I'm up in my zone
Though surrounded by an entourage, I feel like I'm alone
A long way from normal, I try to keep it cordial
I made some new friends, meet recorder and touring
Shout out to my nigga
Its now for a nigga
Know some niggas back home, ain't proud of a nigga
They don't see my vision, grown man mission
They all see my life from a childish position
I'm the mouth of the District, nobody work harder
My heart is in the monuments, the life is in the harbor
So tell me all my followers, am I wrong for barking?
Am I wrong for thinking I was better off in college?
At least I'll be stable, Yea slightly less popular 
But wouldn't be the topic of my few friends talking
A few niggas talk but they do without knowledge 
I do self evaluate, Yea I know I've got some problems
Can't change who I am, I just try to get better 
So in the mean time keep it moving on accept that
And you all will respect that
 
[Jerry] 
Even if you had a relationship with someone,
Well lets say especially if you've had a relationship with someone.
And you try to become friends afterwards
Very difficult isnt it
It's hard because you know each other so well
You know
You know all each others tricks
It's like 2 magicians trying to entertain each other
You know
The one goes "look a rabbit"
The other one says "so"  

[Wale] 
Yea
You always say you wasn't ready for no man
But I wasn't having that, I gave you errything I had
No errything I had, or the very things you have
Tricking, king of the court, small forward, Cavs
Where your whereabouts baby? I care about you lady
And I left you all them letters in your mailbox waiting
And I ain't never plan to be famous
So I'm a take that rubber off, I wouldn't mind having babies
With a home girl best friend lover all that
Ex-boyfriend was wack, she had enough of all that
Look me in my eyes, say if you take it I'm a give it
And if I give it to you, don't you treat me like them bitches 
Please Wale
She used to call me late
One day she called me early, to tell me that she late
Fuck you mean? See my hands start to shake
I ain't looking in her eyes but her face
Cuz tears falling down make me ache 
We should just ignore it, you know we can't afford it
She said I cannot believe that you say we should abort it
I will not support it, what happened to you courting 
And I ain't want no nigga from the jump, you ignored it
You just had to force it, you had to keep going 
Now that lil pre cum gone be having me swollen
As we go forward, I came back from touring
The DNA result, congrats ex-boyfriend

In the case of 7 month old Jeremiah
YOU ARE NOT

[2X]
Smiles and Handshakes
Everywhere I go 
Girlfriends, groupies, then I'm all alone
So confused, these strange relationships 
I think I've got some enemies disguised as friends</pre>
