[Nas]
Ill Will
Ill Will's alive yea Killah Priest Nasdaq Dow Jones ha ha

(Hook)
Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs
Eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood coming to a theater near you
It's all love
Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs

[Priest]
I'll make Mussolini wear a Kufi
I talk like Dr. Ben but look like Malcolm holding his Uzi
Peering through curtains who would I murder?
Pearl silencer screw on my burner four four caliber
The new Nat Turner I'll make Hitler wear a yarmulke
KKK celebrate Kwanzaa
Should I pursue further?
I'm like Tutankhamen with the tools in my garment
Put a few in my cartridge the moon and stars lit
Light up the hood it looks like a techno club
We slam dance to this music when the Tek blow slugs
It's ghetto thugs, welfare and poor education and gang love
sitting in the Federal waiting

(Hook)

[Nas]
What did Malcolm think split second before he was shot?
Did he think to hit the deck on the floor before he dropped?
Or did he just say "Fuck it" I'm ah die for my brothers?
'Cause by killing him just made his words teach others
Like Martin Luther King he preached peace
Like the West East beef finally that shit is rotten
Place yourself in the shoes of a people's leader
From drug kingpin to President either is off the meter
Your best man can turn it or squeeze ya burn you and leave ya
Beside a lonely road or inside a meat freezer
That's the way it goes on the 3rd rock from the sun (earth)
Alone circling the light were we begun where we become

A follower to a general with soldiers to run
They move off every word of your tongue
Fearless and ruthless when you was young pulling your gun
Not scared to shoot shit remember it was all in the fun
If it's power you wanted can you control over a hundred minds?
And these are grown men who've killed over a hundred times
Every champ team has an arch rival
And it takes one time to mess up and niggas don't like you
You start to want peace, niggas want you deceased
Your money low, niggas want you to go
Who else but I can bring the most haunting flow? (Nas)
You soon to see the best of me
From a boy man to a king hear out my destiny

(Hook)

[Priest]
When my fam is at stake
I think of how much slander I take
Then I sit back and watch tapes on Alexander the Great
I start studying how he bloodied men
I think of rappers I'm a massacre
Metal armor cover my skin
Take me to war, fuck y'all
Priest is Ivan the Terrible
Stare at my eyes, they're unbearable
You collide with the generals
Surround me like the most high
Surrounded by Cherubim
Who'd imagine the illest collabo
Priest and Nas are incredible
He's spits ether, I spit urancha
Describe how you devils move
Scream on MC's as I recline on my pedestal

(Hook)

[Nas]
The I to the L to the L to the W the I to the L to the L
To the W the I to the L to the L
To bring trouble to all ya niggas
