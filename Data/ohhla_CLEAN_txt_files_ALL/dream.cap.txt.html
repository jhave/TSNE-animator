Song:   Dream
Typed by: Cno Evil

[Intro: Martin Luther King Jr. sample]
I have a dream, today...
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom
In the history of our nation
I have a dream...
To make justice a reality for all of God's children

"Tell me, this is a dream" - The Delfonics sample

[Cappadonna]
Of a big house, too many whips
Mad wives and kids running out, what's that all about?
Of me taking trips, overseas
Getting my stacks up, cuz baby, now I'm getting big cheese
Triple platinum sales, walking down the isle
With my cream in the background, what, I'm hearing church bells
Of getting back all of my paper
That Razor Sharp stole from me, yea, kid it's only one me
A crush and an R&amp;B chick, she looking real thick
But she was only after my chips
A free of momma love, out of the slums
Invested all my property into my daughters and sons
Of connecting the dutch, with the haze
Feeling mad tired, from guards, I ain't slept in four days
Of hooking up with all of the top rappers
Just came home from this club called Cappa's Nappy

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Tell me, this is a dream, somebody, please
Tell me, this is a dream, somebody, please
Tell me, this, is, a, dream

[Cappadonna]
Of receiving awards, for the best album of the year
And oh yeah, for still having the best broads
Of doing my thing, everybody hating
But once I hit the top, they be up under my wing
Of producing these tracks, that sound phat
Starting my own label, now, nigga how you like that?
Of my baby mother's hurting theyselves
Thinking they was jerking me, but they was jerking theyself
Of all of the police that like my style
They wasn't feeling me, but now, they loving me now
Of being down on my luck, heading for the come up
Living in the hood, but yo, still it's all good
Of my brothers locked away, they came home
Don't give a shit about slot time, they carrying the curf' phone
Of my people, stop busting them slugs
Start united our people, stop fucking with drugs
What up?

[Chorus]

[Outro: Cappadonna (Martin Luther King Jr. sample)]
Dream, this my last dream, this one is for you
Keep the mack milly by your side, don't let nobody stop you
Dream, me getting on
Me and Quazolla, gotta get that corn
Me, keeping it real
Staten Island, what, slash, Homicide Hill
Do what you do, don't forget about your people
They won't forget about you
And everything is all good
Afraid of God, man, do what you could
(I have a dream that one day
This nation will rise up
And live out the true meaning of its creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal)</pre>
