[Lil Wayne samples]
"The hottest... under the sun"
"Damn"
"Ain't nobody fucking with me man"
"Ay, you already know that pimping"
"Cash Money Records, where dreams come true"
"Fuck up my dream"
"Somebody gon' die tonight"
"Ay, you already know that pimping"
"Ay it's Cash Money Records mayne, a lawless game"

[Lil Wayne]
Un-fucking-believable, Little Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money till the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him, bury him
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight baby, so I don't let the devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar, yeah bitch I'm heavy metalling
You can the fucking Led Zeppelin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes I am the best, and no I'm ain't positive, I'm definite
I know the game like I'm reffing it
This is Tha Carter, Tha Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the god, and this is what I bless 'em wit

[Hook]
Bitch I'm me, I'm me
I'm me, I'm me
Baby I'm me, so who you?
You're not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
Yeah, couldn't ya?

[Lil Wayne]
It's Cash Money over everythang
It's in my blood, I feel it running in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a scud
What's really good? I'm bout that ruckus like thud
And I stayed on my flow at Cash Money like rug
Tied to the fucking Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams, to you
I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money million, heir to the throne
Going at their heads like hair in a comb
Sitting by the window, I just stare at the stone
Know I might get through it like hair in a comb
Your money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take a dasher as the lord is my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I am not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

[Hook]
Bitch I'm me, I'm me
I'm me, baby I'm me
So who you? You're not me
You're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
Bitch!

[Lil Wayne]
Last year they had the Grammy's and left me in Miami
Sleeping on a nigga like I'm rapping in my 'jamis
I'm rapping when you sleep, I was rapping when you were in 'jamis
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, buck 'em damn me
I'm a monster I tell you, monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the House of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck with me, I will peel like the house's paint
Let's go, niggas don't go see me cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend is when I'm seventy years old
That's when I can't hold my shit with them, so I shit on myself
Cause I'm so sick and tired of shitting on everybody else
I try to tell ya like I'm saying something
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my passed cup
And now nothing gonna stop me so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quid haha

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm me, I'm me
Bitch I'm me, baby I'm me
So who you? Fuck you!
You're not me hah
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I am a motherfucking Cash Money Millionaire
Bitch!
