[Intro]
THIS, is a public service announcement
Shootout, is a DANCE, and is not intended to incite any violent behavior

[Soulja Boy]
Ay this ya boy Soulja Boy shorty
I got a new dance for y'all
You gotta do the pool palace
Then take your arm and pull the {*EDIT*} finger, y'knahmsayin

[Chorus]
Shoot! Let me get 'em, shoot! Let me get 'em
Shoot! Let me get 'em, shoot! Let me get 'em
Now shootout - AYYYYY~! Now shootout - AYYYYY~!
Now shootout - AYYYYY~! Now shootout - AYYYYY~!
Now shoot! Let me get 'em, shoot! Let me get 'em
Shoot! Let me get 'em, shoot! Let me get 'em
Now shootout - AYYYYY~! Now shootout - AYYYYY~!
Now shootout - AYYYYY~! Now shootout - AYYYYY~!
Now shoot!

[Verse One]
It's time to do my dance, pullin up my pants
Posted on the dance flo' in my pimpin stance
It ain't the same thang, do my dance is a stinger
You gotta rock smooth then you pull your (*EDIT*) finger
All wild on the dance flo', yea I got fans
I'm doin the pool palace and they lookin at my hands
About to do my dance, but naw you can't stop that
I crank my dance up and then I let my {*EDIT*} cock back

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I see 'em on the dance flo', don't know how to act
Tryin to crank my dance but that dance don't match
When Soulja Boy up on the scene you know it's fired up
Hold up, wait a minute, WIIIIND ME UP~!
I'm gettin buck (gettin buck) if ye ain't know (if ye ain't know)
Cause I can crank that shuffle then do the merry-go (the merry-go)
I tell 'em Stacks on Deck (yup) dance on deck (yup)
For all y'all who hate, I got hands on deck

[Chorus]

[Interlude - repeat 2X]
After you get real low then rock on your toes
Rock side to side, do yo' dance on the flo'
Now shootout! (Now shootout!) Now shootout! (Now shootout!)
Now shootout! (Now shootout!) Now shootout! (Now shootout!)

[Chorus]
