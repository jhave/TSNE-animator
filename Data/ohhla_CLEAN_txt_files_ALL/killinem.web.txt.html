Song:   Killin 'Em
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah! Yeah!
I be killin' 'em
Ye ye, I'm killin' 'em
Till my bank statement reads 27 million
They said I couldn't do it so you know I gotta get it done
Acrobatic rappin' the way that Webby be flippin' son
Six mixtapes and the fans need more
I hit the fork in the road and took a detour
Fire Marshall shuttin' shows down
Cuz I blow up spots like a Dalmatian strapped up with C4
Blow minds when they heard the rap
Hustle so many tapes you think I'm servin crack
Make bass lines sizzle when I burn a track
Only dude who made Datpiff's server crash
Yo I'm nice better learn the facts
Came a long fuckin' way not a chance I'll be turning back
Uh, so you know that I'ma rap check 'em
When I put my fitted cap back like Ash Ketchum
I beat 'em up grab an EMT
Think you better then you must be takin' DMT
Dream on mothafucka I am DMC
Hard body flow cop my tape at GNC
See, I shut 'em up like they Papa Doc
Cuz I got more lines than a Stop &amp; Shop
On the day before thanksgiving yeah I drop a lot
Of shit stealthy in the game like an ocelot
Ha! Mortal Kombat logo tatted on my back
So you know I'm gonna "Finish Him" from the moment I attack
I'm a train passenger all I need is a track
To be getting' where I'm goin' and when I do it's a wrap
So step when I bust
Get left in my dust
I'm in it to the finish investin' my bucks
The best and I just don't stop: an animal
My manager found me up at Pet Supplies Plus
Plus I be killin' 'em consecutively
Without expending any energy effortlessly
I got a bag full of trees, Chef Boyardee
And a hometown throne in the 203
Motherfuckas know
They better tuck and roll
Cuz I'm the Master and Commander of this shit
They call me Russell Crowe
I'll never love a ho
So I'll wear a rubber bro
If I have a kid I'll get disowned by my mother yo
On another note nobody can step to me
I think I may have told you already but with my memory
It's hard to remember anything after all the ecstasy
But still they can't touch me like I got a case of Leprosy
I got 'em askin' questions like they playin' Jeopardy
"A dope spittin' white boy?"
Bzzzt "What is Chris Webby"
See they take shit too serious, I'm here to add some levity
Roll a J and take one to the head John Kennedy
What I'm here to do is pretty fuckin' clear cut
Even at 45 with a beer gut
I'ma still get your chick wetter than a tear duct
And make mixtapes that'll get your ear fucked
Not in Taylor Gang, not a Young Mula
I'm in Webby's World
I am the 1 Rula
Nerf Gun Shoota
With a dumb aim
Leavin' Monica Lewinsky with a cum stain
Untamed understand the flows
I'm dope, but at this point the fans should know
HBO flow with a Band of Bros
And a chick with an ass fatter then Amber Rose
Hehh!
I throw 'em off like a star pitcher
They can't follow the flow the way the bars hit cha
I'm a bar spitta
Shit
Them beaten me is like seein' Mel Gibson at a Bar Mitzvah
Yeah!
I be killin' 'em
Heh!
I be killin' 'em
Yeah!
Hahaha
Yeah!
