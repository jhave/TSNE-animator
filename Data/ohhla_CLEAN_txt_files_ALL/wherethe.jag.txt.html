The party's where you're at tonight

Don't be trippin when you see us in the club
Just show a little love, represent your side like me
'Cause 'round here if you slick you pick a hot one
Ride shotgun, couple of 'em got one
Belvedere in the rear of the club
Pulled up on dubs and we 'bout to go and buy the bar up
So So, for sure we ain't playin
Hang with no lames, hit the park and sayin...

(Hook - Jagged Edge)
Ay, where the party at?
Girls is on the way, where the Bacardi at?
Models and models, talkin all a that
Know I can't forget about my thugs
(Where the party at?)
And all my girls
(Where the party at?)
Off in the club
(Where the party at?)
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say
Uh ooooooooooooh
(uh oh oh oh)
Uh ooooooooooooh
(uh oh oh oh)
Uh ooooooooooooh
(uh oh oh oh)
Uh ooooooooooooh
If the party's where you're at just let me know

All the girls in the club in they best outfits
Just showin that skin, tryna' make a nigga wanna spit
Where you been girl? You and your friend
Need to come to the back where we got it locked down
In your white t-shirt or a three-piece suit
Don't matter what you wear all that matters is who you with
Some jiggy and some are straight grindin
All up in the club just to have a good time and

(Hook)

(Nelly)
Just show me where that party at dirty
Somewhere where it's crackin right around one-thirty
Never get done too early
Come in as is, doo-rags and Tims
I'm rollin past his, his little Jag and Benz
with the rolls, not the one with the stem, the one with the rims 
The one that seem to make more enemies than friends
I'm slidin in past doors, both eyes closed
Both arms rose, both charms froze
With the S-O-S-O, D-E dot F
I'm buyin bottles, bottles, until it ain't none left
I'm quick to go left, I blaze with no rep
I jams more than left, baby show me the club
I'm like "hey, where that Bacardi at?"
Come and mix it with the Cris', baby, what's wrong with that?
We in the V.I.P. twisted, down right spliffed it
Two way and shit, actin like they missed it (missed it)

(Hook)

(Jagged Edge)
Left side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
Right side, just put your hands up, throw 'em up
Everybody, put your hands up, throw 'em up
When the beat come back around e'rybody do it again
Do the eastside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
Do my southside run this mutha for ya? (Hell yeah)
And them haters ain't hittin on, ain't talkin 'bout us
And they look like
If the party's where you're at let me hear you say</pre>
