[Krayzie Bone]
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop, until we drop

[Ice Cube]
Krayzie Bone and Ice Cube..
The best thing in life in life is life (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Get your mind right, and get your grind right (we gotta keep goin)
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs (we gotta keep goin)
Get your mind right, and get your grind right
[Krazyie] Hey young thugs..
Get your mind right, and get your grind right

[Ice Cube]
Look into my eyes if you wanna know me
Before you hypnotized, homey what do you see
A figure that's just a little bigger than dealers
A hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
and I could rule the world with my eyes closed
(with my eyes closed..)
  
Chorus: Krayzie Bone

See the mission's to get what we don't got
until we filthy rich and on top --
-- you betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop until we drop
[Cube]	Krazyie Bone and Ice Cube
See the mission's to get what we don't got
until we filthy rich and on top --
-- you betta go get it, it's yours
Nigga the mission's to get what you don't got
The struggle it don't stop until we drop

[Ice Cube]
To all the little homies that's watchin TV
I see you tryin to be a O.G. like me
Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa
Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever 
You'll never get you life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz
Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?)
Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)
Lord knows, "In God We Trust"
and everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)
  
Chorus
  
[Ice Cube]
To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth
Waitin for health, you better do for self
Homey that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain
  
Chorus
  
[Ice Cube]
Keep goin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin
