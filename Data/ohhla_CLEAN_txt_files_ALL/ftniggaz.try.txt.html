[Pastor Troy]
Look
Listen here
Yeah I got em
This for all them punk ass niggaz in this shit (I got em)
If you a punk ass nigga you gon feel this in your heart (I got em)
Fuck nigga

[Chorus]
Motherfuck them niggaz
I'ma burn them niggaz
I'ma take them niggaz with me (With me)
(4x)

[Verse 1]
PT, baby
If it was a fifth we'd all get fucked up
These pussy niggaz got the game twist up
Cause everybody hard, everybody real
Everybody ballin, everybody kill
Everybody slick, everybody smooth
Everybody packin, what the fuck them niggaz gon' do
Everybody pimpin, everybody mob
Everybody bout to get motherfuckin robbed
These niggaz got the wrong one, pistol whippin a big gun
Extra clip with an attitude, what the fuck am I dog food?
Bite the hand that feeds me cause I dont need these
Cracker mother fuckers that I alway see constantly
Try and compare me to, fuck nigga do what you do
I'm the original, multi-dimensional
But these ol pussy boys want to be pastor troy
Bout to get blast on (?) fuckin mask on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna put violence in they rhyme
They love 50 cent cause he got shot nine times
But what about me? I done shot nine motherfuckers!
Left a nigga in his yard for his mother
I shot the brother, I shot the aunt
I fucked the sister, I smoked a blunt
I'm on a hunt for Red October
Leave them niggaz bleedin blood out them Range Rovers
Until its over, you know that I'm gunning
We looking for niggaz thats frontin and stuntin
My nigga imma be dumpin some shit (?) Russia
Some shit that I got runs deep, gonna hush ya, nigga

[Chorus]</pre>
