This might sound crazy but
I love suffering, I love struggle, I love pain
Cause what don't kill you make you stronger nigga
And I'm as strong as they come

[Chorus]
I love the streets
Cause that's what made me me
Without the streets baby I couldn't eat
I love the streets
And althought we was po'
Without struggle boy you can't grow
I love the streets
And even though we sold drugs
And paid for it in blood
I love the streets
No matter what happend to me
My hood or your hood, it's all good
I love the streets

[Sticky Fingaz]
Right now my life don't mean an awful lot
If I died today who think the world gon' stop?
There's a million niggaz just like me on the block
It's either entertainment or sports or sellin that rock
Think the judge gon' take ya word over a cops?
You be just another nigga that they stick in the box
But we are the streets, what other choice we got?
Then to go hard, give them niggaz all we got
Fuck that, as long as I got breath in my lungs
I'm livin my life, waitin for my death to come
If you made it out the hood then God blessed you son
But if your fam there you ain't out lesson one
Gotta spread around nigga that's what's real to me
Turn on the news, swear the shit be killin me
Yall from the streets probly ain't feelin me
You could take me out the hood but it's still in me

[Chorus]

[Omar Epps]
Fools is fake, I come through with the ghoulish face
Take small step, big moves I make
I could put it to your face then choose your fate
Everyday Thanksgivin, for me two plates
Yeah we do grace, God bless it all
From the mess hall to the boulervard with the dead dogs
When we cough and spit, guns they speak
The same language is the bullets, who talkin shit?
Yo Pac if ya listenin they got the game twisted
Talkin bout the hate you gave little infants
Fuck everybody here today, place ya ways
And ya fade away like the memory of Gotti
Take it back to '90, last year highschool
Didn't graduate though, still had to make dough
That's my word, word for word I understood it all
Had big dreams though the hood is small

[Chorus]</pre>
