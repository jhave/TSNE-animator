[Kirk Franklin:] Toby Mac! (huh!) Turn it up!
[Toby Mac:] Kirk, gonna get his white boy on!
[Kirk Franklin:] God, I know You up to something (uhhh!)
I can see it all right now (woo!)
You pulling back my covers
It's getting crazy (Come on!)

[Verse 1: Kirk Franklin]
Think I'm gonna walk away
You're messing up my life today (wassup)
This time I refuse to pray
Still you keep calling me (calling me)
I don't wanna see your face
The thing I love you erased (Come on!)
Nothing but an empty space
Now I don't know how to be
I know it wasn't right for me. (Yea!)
What you liking what you need.
I feel like I'm in surgery
Still you cut deeper

My secrets within
My blanket of sin
Lord how much longer 'till ya through with me
Please take what you need (Can I get up now!)

[Chorus]
Be still and know I am God
Be still and know I am God

[Verse 2: Toby Mac]
Loving you Lord is my way
Everything you don't explain
Somethings I don't want to change
So you keep breaking me (There you go!)
It's like I'm fighting for my life (woo!)
You hit me with another light
I feel like Jacob in the night
Won't stop 'till you bless me

My flesh and my will (Yes father!)
Is yours not to kill (To kill!)
Bringing myself to you (Come on!)
But living sacrifice is more (Can I get up now)

[Chorus]
Be still and know I am God (Gotta know Gotta know Gotta know Gotta know)
Be still and know (yea) I am God(Gotta know Gotta know One more time!)
Be still and know I am God (You are God! You are God! Gotta know! Gotta know!)
Be still (Be still) and know (and know) I am God (yea!)

[Bridge]
If I could I'd fly away from here
But even when I'm far you still are near
I gotta get out (There's no way out)
Where is there to run(There's no where to run)
Don't go(Don't go)
Don't go (Can't go)
No! No! No! (Whoa!)

[Kirk Franklin]
You win. (uh huh!)
I've been trying to do it on my own. (Yes Lord!)
But right now I gotta surrender.
You know what's best. (Say it like you mean it!)
It's not easy waiting on you.
It's not easy believing that you got this together.
But without faith it is impossible to please you. (We recognize you!)
So I'm gonna stand right here. (We are still before you!)
You got me. (We are still before you!) You got me. You got me.

[Chorus:]
Be still and know (we know!) I am God
(We gonna lift those hands. I surrender to your authority God! I surrender!)
Be still (we're still!) and know (we know!)
I am God (I give you my will)(Gotta know! Gotta! know! Gotta know!)
Be still (I'm yours!) and know (we know!) (I'm yours!)
I am God (I'm tired of living on my own! I'm tired of living on my own!)
Be still and know (we know!) I am God (You are God!)</pre>
