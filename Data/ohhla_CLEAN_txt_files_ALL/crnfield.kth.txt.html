[Kool Keith - voice lowered]
Yeah - it's motherfuckin Bobby Grind
I ain't wastin no time
I gave all you niggaz signed a chance
Now I'm back to piss on the world, AK Earl
My dawg ass can leak by your girl
I'm gettin the shit stains out the game
After me your ass'll far flame
Ask who, Mr. Crocodile Catcher the insane
You name a street it's mine, you fuckin with Bobby Grind
Wipe my ass with your chick's face
Y'all goin up to the afterhours, y'all headin to Dick's place
When your dime shit, I put the oxygen mask around my face
#1 spot kid, you want my place
Fuck you niggaz got, y'all thinkin they Bill Gates
Y'all know the studio keep it at bill rates
I be there recordin 'til the turd drop, your anus
New York police and governments, they know I'm famous
The big doo-doo stains of New York, can talk that talk
See the feathers fly, my foes do that chicken walk (ba-kaw)

[Chorus]
16, acres of rap, fo' cornfields
The hash is all real
16 acres of rap, fo' cornfields
The has is all real

[Donny V]
I'm back stupid, it's the return of Donny V
This happy rap shit I hear on the street
Labels done turned pop, turning thugs to ballerina
The hardest rapper in chains is named Medina
The streets said I'm crazy, my vocals is raw
The rap industry ain't safe from Mr. 3 Pour
I'm eatin livers and legs, spines abd brain
I drink Bud with no ice cause it's safe better simple and plain
I'm serve body parts for lunch, and feces for supper
You ain't know the remains you eatin was your mother
Stupid motherfuckers, I'm like Earl Monroe
Truth is a lot of you niggaz been broke
Bobby Grind leave turds on a lot of you weak rappers
Niggaz think, they original gunclappers
It's our world, and we bringin the East back
You got a mill', but your album went double wood
Spin magazine said your album was no good
Y'all fake rappers'd Milli Vanilli the game if you could

[Chorus]
16 acres of rap, fo' cornfields
The hash is all real
16 acres of rap, fo' cornfields
The has is all real

[Donny V]
