[Chorus 1]
So if you like dro 
And you let go
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
And you smoke good
I knew you would
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)

[Cee-Lo]
My name is sugar sweat sweet as a candy shop
Yes I got every car each of 'em candy dropped
Now gather round y'all here comes a sight to see
Me and Menta are comin' kill 'em consecutively 
I walk through the door I don't even look at the line
Smokin pine standin under the exit sign
Shawty greets me with a grin, then she starts to grind
We're havin big fun 'til the sun starts to shine 

[Chorus 2]
So if you like dro [smoke sumthin' dog]
And you like gold [Oh I love my money]
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
A little rock &amp; roll
A whole lot of soul
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people

[Menta]
We gon' drank good, smoke good, the interior is all oak wood
You know how me and my folks do it, it's A-Town we don't play around
Seven-Eight Sevilles on Ferris Wheels; where it's at? There it is
Did you like that? well then write back
Matter fact wait a minute I'll be right back
(Skuurt) I'm back what's up now I done went and got my truck now
Imma love you come good luck now somebody else wanna (fuck) now 
Now you 'Lo his cognac, he done been to the moon have you done that?
Get on in and lemme show you the world and you's my kind of people girl

[Chorus 1]
So if you like dro 
And you let go
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
And smoke good
I knew you would
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)

[Cee-Lo] + (Jazze Pha)
Now I can smell, somebody put good green in the air
(Ain't nothin better than some real good music)
And there's a lot, of fine ass women everywhere
(Ohh cause your eyes are just startin on me) 
All in the room, they dancin and drinkin and havin fun
(Boogie on the floor put your back into it)
Why don't you take, your dead-ass home if you ain't havin none
(Don't just stand around and just watch us do it) 

[Chorus 2]  
So if you like dro 
And you let go
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
A little rock &amp; roll
A whole lotta soul
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)
You're my kind of people (my kind of people)</pre>
