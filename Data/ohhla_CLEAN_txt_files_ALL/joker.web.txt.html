[Intro: SMB]
Some people call me the space cowboy yeah
Some call me the gangsta of love

[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
You see they label me as poorly influencin' the kids
But that's straight, I'm just tellin' 'em the way that I live
Cause I be rolling' up bud until I can barely talk even
Drinking' like a younger Kenny Powers durin' off season
I'm the reason your mother won't let your little brother listen to rap
All I talk about is chicks that I've smashed
And every single drug I've done and I'll continue to do
But this is my life, it shouldn't make a difference to you
I'm a beast popping pills like Bradley Cooper in "Limitless"
Live the life you wish you could live and I'll never get sick of it
I smoke cigarettes, my momma says I should quit
And I probably should but nah, Fuck That Shit
I be wreckin' with Kinetics you haters better forget it
If they ain't feelin' it they must have injected anesthetics
Live it like I said and every decision's reckless
This is Webb love me or hate me, you best accept it

[Chorus: SMB]
Cause' I'm a picker I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
Playing my music in the sun
I'm a joker I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooo

[Verse 2: Kinetics]
My brain's busted I don't think the shit is in service
Flippin' the finger and cursin' so I'll get injured on purpose
So when I'm with the surgeon I can be convincin' the nurses
For that prescription to purchase weed for medicinal purposes
You know that you are too damn blunted and need help
When you sittin' on the couch and you reach for a seat belt
Me and Webby just a bunch of mothafuckers who pop uppers
And get so fucked up that we start headbuttin' each other
No disrespect to the Thriller I'm a killer when I flow for y'all
Cause every night I murder the mic, Propofol
So any rapper that's bad enough to be battlin'
I'm stabbin' him and jabbin' a javelin in his abdomen
Cause I'm a joker and usually never sober
But I'm infinite, like the number 8 was tipped over
From New York to Connecticut, Kinectics has connected it
Timmy Talent sampled it and then Webby perfected it

[Chorus: SMB]

Cause I'm a picker I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
Playing my music in the sun
I'm a joker I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooo

Some people call me the space cowboy yeah
(Yeah I'm Feeling real good right now you know)
Some call me the gangster of love
(This is me and uh I'm not changing for nobody)
Some people call me Maurice
(You know you don't like it then uh)
Cause' I speak of the pompitous of love
(You can go fuck yourself buddy. Bring that hook back Yea)

Cause I'm a picker I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
Playing my music in the sun
I'm a joker I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run
Wooo wooooo
Cause I'm a picker I'm a grinner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
Playing my music in the sun
I'm a joker I'm a smoker
I'm a mid-night toker
I get my loving on the run</pre>
