Just Like That

[Violent J]
Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
Cuz it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
"What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
Guarenteed, we can fuck em both on the spot"
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I wanna let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
Cuz I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I wanna buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
"Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day"
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts
Here they come, nope, wasn't them
Seems like the same car's driving by again
It pulls up, "hey man, you're outta luck"
What, what ya say man
(gunshot)
Fuck</pre>
