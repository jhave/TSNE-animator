[Chorus]
I saw ppl dancing in the streets
Streets of a lonely city
Listen to the beats
The people strike their feet on the lonley concrete streets of..
streets of a lonely city

[Warren G]
Some niggaz quick to get it confused
This is where its cracking at (wassup ?)
Big city of music
We're only half of that
What happens after midnight
Goes up spoke of
Cos broke niggaz where im at they dont show no love
I done witness the concrete jungle in
Watch the niggaz turn soft and leave humble-in
Since i been young i hung out, hard knock
Played my hand when they delt my cards
Now check it out whats real is whats happening
Now this is where i deal with and where i live at
Not to many of us make (make it)  it to see the day we able to make a statment (statment)
The ways of the world has gone crazy 
Two things never change, thats the music and what the rules of the game is
Now everybody knows ur name 
It aint no other place to turn 
But i better get a hold on this street shit i learnt it (learnt it)

I saw ppl dancing in the streets
Streets of a lonely city
Listen to the beats
The people strike their feet on the lonley concrete streets 
streets of a lonely city

[Warren G]
Take it back when i never had much
A little bad nigga scrappin over mad stuff (gimme that fool)
But i was born with a hunch for this shit
My nigga dead beats, still i hustle a bit
Help my mother make ends meet
Its hard is god watchin?
Non stop while the cops roll by on my block
I see paper dancing in the street
So whats the chance i can make the money work for me?
But it hurts to see yo niggaz doing dirt
For a livin so i put in work with this gift i was given
Now might i mention that i was blessed by god
And im down for anything that makes life less hard
No matter where you are it can happen to anybody
Its how it was when i came up
And now i talk about it
LBC city of music
G-funk you tell me 
We do's it</pre>
