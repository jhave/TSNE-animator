When I first saw ya, I thought that I knew ya
Now I know I don't just wish that I did
Honey made a right, stepped off, took flight
Upstairs, up more, made a left, and hid
Looked down at my shoes and the cuff in my slacks
Hand inside my pocket, came out with somethin stickin
Doublemint goes in my mouth, jaws are breakin North and South
Look around to see who's lookin, figure that my breath was kickin so
In the bathroom I go; and fixing his 'fro..
.. you guessed it, the Lawnge one
'What's up Black?' goes the hand smack
I get the feeling that it's time for some Black Sheep fun
The club is on the bourgeois, urinal holding a cigar
Then you never know, probably a Phillie
Lawnge cracks a smile, oh no, here it comes, then says
"Yo Dres, honey made you look silly"
Step back in the joint, and yeah it's kinda funky
My breath no longer kickin so now it has pep
Strobelite hoe that I don't know
walks up, asks Lawnge's sign, we quickly do the step

	Where you at, hon? Where you at?
	Where you at, hon? Where you at?
	Where you at, hon? Where you at?

Then I change my style
Movin through the crowd, the smoke has got me chokin
Funny that I'm chokin, could it be that I am smokin
Pounds are goin round, but this is nothing new
Hoping that eloping with a dip is what I'll do
System's kinda boomin like a drive-in called the Sonic
Find the bar kid, my state of mind would like a tonic
There she goes, "Where?" Take my thoughts out of the dumps
Lawnge, over there, over there, look at bumps
From the time that she was born, she was raised to be all that,
Gave her no food (what?) Strictly Similak
Felt like a punk on Dick Street, a coupon in the ghetto
I said, 'Hon, whacha drinkin?' She said, 'Milk and amaretto'
I took a seat beside her, I would not be denied
I ordered L.I.I.T. and fill 'er up, she's got a rider
She showed her dental work, and said I looked familiar
I touched her on the hand, I had to feel her!

[Chorus]
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winnin
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're the woman

[Dres]
I said, 'Hey', she said, 'Hi'
I said, 'Us', she said, 'Try'
'And if you're thinkin strictly boots then I'll say baby, bye bye'
She said, 'I know you got at least a dozen that you're seeing
You think you own the world, at least New York because you're G'ing
You claim to be the man. you want me for a lover
So you can do my girlfriends and my sister and my mother'
I said, 'You're very blunt, with quickness to the cue
So whassup with your mother does she look as good as you?
I'm playin, but let me not delay in what I'm sayin
Initially attraction found your way before the weigh-in
I'm single so I've got at least a dozen on my door step
Doesn't boost my ego, it doesn't mean we've slept
I'm in the public eye, so I try to be an eyeful
Do not own the world, but yes I have some pull'
My chorus rose a brow, she's curious of me
'Please give me more iced tea, and her vitamin D'
She said, 'Me?'  Yes.  'Why?'  Guess.
Sweetheart you've got ten cushions, besides I like your dress
I'm playin but let me not be weak and let me speak
Your mind is brighter than your booty it's the courtin' that I seek

Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child - you're definitely winning
Similak child, drivin me wild
Simi-limi-lak child -  you're the woman</pre>
