The motherfuckin south is in the house foe the nine fo
Memphis niggaz, nigga and we killas who gon run the floor
One of you hoes step
One of you hoes gonna die bitch
Aint no thang 
Civil and plain bang
In your eye bitch
Tricky type ass niggaz 
Always wanna flex they nuts
But they gonna get fucked
With this nine 
Stuck up they butt
Unload this whole damn clip up in your ass hoe
Naw, its to late to squash the shit 
I'm gonna blast hoe
Fuck the five O
And the motherfuckin jumpin grass 
Searching a real nigga in his draws
Like they ass a fag
Get yo god damn hands of a real one
Just before I make you feel the bullets from my steal some 
Big ass cop think I'm playin 
But I'm from tha hood
North Memphis hoe
Yeah rank it bitch Hollywood
Ready and prepared 
That's the exit que to 
With my tone
Whatcha gonna do 
When my nine crones at your dome
Bitches

(Chorus)


Nine motherfuckin millimeter 
Aint no tradin hoe
This some real shit 
Street shit
Lettin sucker know
If yo ass step
Go head make me pull the triger
Fuckin with me dawg
You gonna make me catch a charge nigga
Figga out a way
With these holla points (?) tips
Slip, trip, cock back, quick
Then I shoot a bitch
Aint no damn fuckin around
13 rounds at your head
Aim point blank 
At your face
Makin sure your dead
Headed to my motherfuckn ride
Dichin evidence 
Mask on, lotces on
Headed to my residence
Consequences
They accur when you talkin smack
Thinkin you the big man
But you betta watch your back
Rat tat tat tat
With the sound of the tech nine
Take this trick bitch ass nigga tryin to take mine
(Oh naw man I aint gonna take yours) 
(Aint nothing like that dog you know what I'm sayin)
Nine to yo fuckin dome bitch
 
(Chorus) Till fade</pre>
