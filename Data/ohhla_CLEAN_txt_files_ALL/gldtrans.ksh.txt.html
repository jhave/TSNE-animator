Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This song makes me wanna
Have sex in my car (ugh)

Wham! Bam! Thank you, man!
Get inside my fuckin'
Gold Trans Am!
Wham! Bam! Thank you, man!
Get inside my fuckin'
Gold Trans Am!

Pull over, sucker!
Now spread 'em
Let me see what you're packin'
Inside that denim

Pedal to the metal
Lookin' straight amazin'
I can't help all the hell
That I'm raisin'! (Sorry)!

Stoppin' traffic like
An ambulance
Try'na get my hands
In your worn down pants

Hey, you, skinner
(Hey)! T-Shirt tight
Baby, need a ride? (Ow)!
I'm the captain
Of this ship so
Shut up and get inside
(Get inside)!

Come on climb into
My golden cockpit (c'mon)!
Love you till you're seeing
Stars and stripes, (get inside)!
Burning rubber on the
Southern highway
Gonna take you for a
Freedom ride, (c'mon)
(Get inside)!

Wham! Bam! Thank you, man!
Get inside my fuckin'
Gold Trans Am!
Wham! Bam! Thank you, man!
Get inside my fuckin'
Gold Trans Am!

A sweet-ass mullet, (ugh)
Caught my eye, (yup)!
Now you got me jonesin'
For a moustache ride!

Twenty bucks and a
Switch blade knife
American metal
With a devil inside!

Daisy Dukes showin'
Off my ass
And when I walk past
Give the boys whiplash!

Hey, you, skinner
(Hey)! T-Shirt tight
Baby, need a ride?
(Yeah you do)!
I'm the captain
Of this ship so
Shut up and get inside
(Get inside)!

Come on climb into
My golden cockpit (oh c'mon)!
Love you till you're seeing
Stars and stripes, (get inside)!
Burning rubber on the
Southern highway, (highway, yeah)
Gonna take you
For a freedom ride
(Get inside)!

(C'mon! Do it! Get inside)!
(Get inside)! Freedom ride!

(Get inside)!
Come on climb into, (c'mon)
My golden cockpit (don't be scared)!
Love you till you're seeing
Stars and stripes, (c'mon, boy)!
Burning rubber on the, (woah)!
Southern highway
(Southern highway)!
Gonna take you
For a freedom ride
(Get inside)! </pre>
