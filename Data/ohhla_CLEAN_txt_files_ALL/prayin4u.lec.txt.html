Father God
I'm prayin to you for somebody
who knows you Lord but just hasn't
hasn't been seein you in the right view lately
Hear me out...

Father
I'm prayin for a friend he and I are pretty close
and out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin daily but he ain't really learnin
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His face weak, he ain't prayed in a week
he wake up and just weep with his face in the sink Lord
You gotta help my man, I'm prayin for him daily
he ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin crazy
He say he feelin' trapped, can't even head up the mall
cause every lady's half-dressed temptin him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off
videos just make him feel that he ain't really nothin without money
girls and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he felt less a man
cause he ain't have a five-year plan or a piece of land
and man it's crazy cause his family think so much of him
plus he got a godly wife who always showin love for him but he's strugglin
even though he talk to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he oughta' be
I'm scared for him cause there's people that look up to him
he got some younger siblings who been changed
by what he's done for them but is it done for him
Lord don't let it be
if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me
is it done for him
Lord don't let it be
if he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me...

[Chorus]
Yeah
I'm prayin for you
yeah
I'm prayin for you
Yeah
I'm prayin for you
yeah
yeah
I'm prayin for you...

[Lecrae]
God his condition is worsened since we were last conversed
and I'm with him now and he ain't doin well and this I'm certain
He say he tryna' trust you
doesn't wanna disgust you but he was in the mist of sinners
and did not discuss you and just today his anxiety's got the best of him
he knows Christ but for hours refuse to rest in him
he's not the best of men but Lord I know he really loves you
and I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin of you
People trust this dude
you could crush this dude
Father he needs more of you I pray you touch this dude
what can I say to him? I'm determined to pray for him
Father empty and brake him I pray you'll just have your way with him
cause there's a change in him and the effects are strong
I pray you open up his heart before the next song and when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter you wrote
and soak it up cause he ain't hearin you and he ain't feelin me
and God I know it's killin you because it's killin me
and matter of fact there's somethin else he's concealin see
the person that I've been prayin about is really me...
