[Intro]
He threatens everything I built
The man who fights for no flag. The man loyal to no country
How many battles have we won? 
This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen
We need the greatest warrior

[Verse One]
Listen, I'm the nicest in here
I don't even write rhymes
Words assemble themselves out of fear
There's no need for me to start sayin' names
If you hustlers wanna claim you ain't rappers, get the hell out the game
Go back to the keys you keep sayin' you push
With the same dumb broad that hides the work in her tush
So called thugs, brainless thieves
Showin' guns and drugs like young cops don't watch them DVD's
Makin' more room for me
Yeah, I pack up the jail
This MC is takin' over the street
Corner to corner
Every last spot on God's green 
7 Wonders of the World, I'm the greatest ever seen
Spittin' 16's
Y'all just spit at 16 year old girls, y'all dudes are thirty three!
Killed your career, call the coroner
Y'all are no match for Chaundon, I"m the ultimate warrior

[Chorus]
You don't really wanna go to war
Throw shots till you can't take it anymore
One man standin', one on the floor
Seems to me that you're no match for the greatest warrior
Give up
Go ahead just
Give up
No way you can win against me
Give up
Go 'head just
Give up
Quit and just 
Give up
Not too smart for you to test me
Give up

[Verse Two]
Why play chess? I'm nice at checkers
I can just jump you niggas, take your pieces and get crowned
It's on the same board, it's just different rules apply
But the object of the game is to shut you niggas down
Strategy is key
Now watch every move
The heart of a Maverick, I know what the deal is
Son is trump tight
I know what's in your hand
So enlightened, I'm puttin' Con Ed out of business
Mr. Relentless
Rules with a sentence
No guns, all of my words are lethal weapons
Walk through detectors
Rushed by detectives
Known to have plans of mass destruction in possession
Dangerous with a mic? No question
No second guessin'
Who's the nicest rapper in the session
First album left an impression
Breath life back into the music, people pay attention

[Chorus]
You don't really wanna go to war
Throw shots till you can't take it anymore
One man standin', one on the floor
Seems to me that you're no match for the greatest warrior

[Talking]
He thinks God will protect him. But gods protect only...the strong. 
I'll attack him with the greatest force the world has ever seen.

[Verse Three]
Bitch made, plain and simple
Your girl don't give you wop
She lay you back and play with your nipples
All that tough talk is sweet
And yo' ass diabetic
You're goin' into shock, call a medic!
I'll apply pressure till these bitch niggas break
With they broads gettin' off on my latest sex tape
WAIT!
They sensitive, might pull a gun on me
Nah
Might make exec's wanna front on me
Bitch moves, somethin' a homo rapper would do
If you take it personal, then that homo rapper is you
Serve no purpose
Truth will surface
Shakin' like you got Parkinson's, you seem nervous
Best to work with me than against me
Beef ain't nothin' but another reason for a feeding frenzy
Be easy, I'm warnin' ya
Y'all are no match for Chaundon, I'm the ultimate warrior

[Chorus]
You don't really wanna go to war
Throw shots till you can't take it anymore
One man standin', one on the floor
Seems to me that you're no match for the greatest warrior
Go ahead just
Give up
No way you can win against me
Give up
Go 'head just
Give up
Quit and just 
Give up
Not too smart for you to test me
Give up

[Outro]
I brought all the kingdoms together. I created a nation. Me! I built it!</pre>
