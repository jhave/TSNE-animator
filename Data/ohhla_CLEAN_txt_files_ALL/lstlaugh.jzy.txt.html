Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Please tell these niggaz there's no hoe in me
These niggaz takin all these shots but ain't no holes in me
So what you shootin at niggaz you ain't hit shit yet
Just check my black tee and it still ain't wet --
Please tell these niggaz there's no hoe in me
These niggaz takin all these shots but ain't no holes in me
So what you shootin at nigga you ain't hit shit yet
Should be aiming at mah head, I'm top down on ya set!

Bring em cheechs and them lil niggaz got
Imma keep it 100 till mah fuckin heart stop
Catch me doin 200 in mah fuckin hardtop
I do it for mah niggaz sitting in them cell blocks

Muh fucka I'm nice and I don't mean kind
See that I'm the truth then they must be blind
Deaf, dumb ? either how, either way here's the outcome
I'm showin up a hundred deep like Malcolm
Imagine Farrakhan, meets Babylon; Enemy of the state ? Verse 48
I'm goin psycho in this bitch, Nigga Norman Bates
And when I'm done goin hand every notivate
Time to get em straight, lemme coordinate
Two sexy ass right about a quarter cake
Say that weight is over, yeah tha weight is over
I'd really hate to be the one to say I fuckin' told ya

What would I ever really been without that baking soda?
Remember waking up in Granny's to that baking odor
Sat down kitchen table had my first meal
And at that same kitchen table seen my first mil
In that same backroom I seen my first half
And in that same backroom opened my worst half
A nigga lost so bad it was my worst math
Look like the shit you put off in a bird bath
What cud I say even the realest niggaz got got
What cud I say even the realest niggaz quote Pac
So confident it's like he's relaxing
Quit being shy nigga just ask him

EY MR. YOUNG JIZZLE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE MAP
YOU EVER BEEN ON 75 WIT ONE IN YA LAP?
One better Kelin Road ? wit two in mah jeans
Cabb County ridin' hard yadadamean?
THEY SAY YOU MAKE IT THEN THEY HATE
THIS IS WHAT THEY MEAN?
A real nigga to another ? that's just how it seems
Thought we was from the same cloth even the same seams
Even wore the same jersey on the same team
These niggaz really outta place they so outta bounds
So go on take ya lil shots till ya outta rounds
Then Imma smoke it till mah weed man outta pounds
Then we goin blaze until you pussy niggaz outta downs
Critics say he on hold, he won't change it up
A real nigga won't fold ya'll can hang it up
Bring me the Jury and the Judge watch me crank it up
Ya'll know this real shit cost you can ring me up!</pre>
