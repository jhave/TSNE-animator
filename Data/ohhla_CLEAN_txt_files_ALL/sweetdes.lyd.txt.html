Song:   Sweet Despair
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Tell me what do you see in her
Cause I've been living in sweet despair
I don't really know what's in the cards of life
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight

Love was hidden within your smoke
Blinding lights and disheartened hope
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in
Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on put the knife in

You've been foolish
And I've been stupid
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go and put the knife in

I hear voices inside my head
Something's different inside this bed
I don't really know what's in the cards of life
All I really know is my tears won't dry tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in
Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go and put the knife in

You've been foolish
And I've been stupid
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go and put the knife in

I'll be crying you'll be screaming, I'll come crumbling down
Just the thought of you and I another face in the crowd
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this battle ground
I'm on my own now, I'm on my own now

You'll be sorry, I won't worry
I'm OK with it now
Just remember what you did and how it didn't work out
I'd rather wake up in an empty house than this battle ground
You're on your own now, you're on your own now

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in

Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on put the knife in
You've been foolish and I've been stupid
Oh-oh-oh-oh

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in</pre>
