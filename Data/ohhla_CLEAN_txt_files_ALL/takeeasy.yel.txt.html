Song:   Take it Easy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
I left my family at home
To go and sing my song
I know the music pays the bills y'all
But I still feel wrong

[Bridge]
Baby I'm doing the best that I can yes I am
And I catch myself running everytime
Really only fall behind
That's why I gotta just rewind

[Chorus]
Take it easy
There's no need to speed
Slow it down
Take it easy

[Verse 2]
Baby what's wrong
Are you alright?
I'm only here for a few days
Lets make it a good night

[Bridge]
Baby you're doing the best that you can yes ma'm
If you catch yourself running sometimes
Take a breath and recline that he loves you
Just rewind

[Chorus]
Take it easy
There's no need to speed
Slow it down
Take it easy

[Verse 3]
I've been around
I've had my back to the wall
But it's a humble inexperience
To find that I haven't been through nothing at all

[Bridge]
Cuz even when you doing the best that you can you can die
If it don't matter leave it behind leave your family your time and your love
And just rewind

[Chorus]
Take it easy
There's no need to speed
Slow it down
And take it easy

[Outro]
There's no need to rush, slow it down [repeats], take it easy [echo]
There's no need to speed, no need to rush, hurry up, slow it down</pre>
