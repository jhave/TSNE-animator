[Mr. Cheeks]
Basically, LB Fam to the motherfuckin death
Park side, Queen's niggaz represent
Long Isle, how we do? They new our style
Represent niggaz in and out the P now
Yo, I could do this mother shit for a while
I don't give a fuck, my rap style be true yo
Yo, eh yo, yo, yo, how we do this

Hey yo well back on my South Side, Jamaica part of town
where us real niggas love to get down
Where you only hear G and P finessin tracks up on the tape
We stuck in Queens and I'm not tryin to escape
Yo Im havin cess', drinkin, I'm kickin raps and Emceein
LB for life, kid my way of bein
Its time to, set up shops, wild in this game and got props
and fuck cops, we puffin lah wit windows up in drop tops
Nothin stops my crew from gettin it we learn from the past
Puffin on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass
Conversatin with myself, what does my future hold?
Niggaz is dyin, will i make it past 30 years old?
I can't run, I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done
What the fuck's the deal? I been doin this here from day one
Official Queen's nigga, be a Lost Boy till my death
Until I breathe my mothafuckin last breath

Chorus: Mr. Cheeks {2X}

Eh yo from boyz to men
We're strictly Fam, no longer friends
Lets keep it thorough, I hold it down till its on again
Until we meet again, yo I'm back up on the street again
I'm tryin to make it, throw out my nine but pack the heat again

[A+]
Check this out
Yo, yo
My mind is reachin twice that size than it only did last year
Three times its likely to feel clear
A+, I transform into a super emcee
With super vocals quicker than Superman can find a phone booth
The whole truth nothin but the whole truth, I roast you
Thermonuclear vocals get hotter that in Shanobal
The double O, just abide nuclear explosions
Exposin radiation like a vulcan
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
was stolen by five soviet spies
They told me to lie, they dont want to hear the god spit
Chop my hands off at the armpits but i regenerate limbs
Like Star fish, comin at you with the hard shit
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin arson
Walkin the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight
down...

[Canibus]
Yo A+ fuck the nonsense
I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand Horsemen
And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here
I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
battling for world supremecy
Who wanna get touched
The CAN-I-BUS will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushin emcees jumpin out the trees
like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves
Interrogatin you wack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses
Askin you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive you cant recall or understand it
Thats how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
and take advantage of oppurtinites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
with the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
in the back of his cranial cavity which is actually
what happens to any motherfucker for tryin to battle me

Chorus {2X}</pre>
