[Intro] [Envelope]
Hehe. I overcame a speech impediment
People don't know that about me man. Crippling speech impediment

[Verse One] [Envelope]
My nana
Told me these words one time
There are no, shortcuts in life
And I don't ever wanna hear that came to your surprise
If you made something wrong you better work to right 
From that first breath your lungs, gasp to hold
To that, last moment when your casket closed
There is, one principle you have to know
If you never worked for it, you never had your own
Now I ain't tryin' to hear cats about keepin' it real
I keep it true that's how I keep my appeal
Sometimes my shit is stupid or deep in the field
I'm still conscious, of every word I speak for real
Don't know what you're sayin', I ain't got no bitch
She's a woman, better watch your lip
To that boy and girl that got a relationship
If you ain't got trust then you ain't got shit
And most definitely then, you got's to chill
But who the fuck am I?
Doctor Phil?
Shit, I'm not man, your mom's for real
Just a middle class kid that's got a skill

[Chorus] [Envelope] [x2]
Do what you gotta do
Use what you gotta use
Just be your own man, everything else is optional
Fool who you gotta fool
Move what you gotta move
Just be your own man, everything else is optional

[Verse Two] [Illogic]
Yo, every aspect of livings floatin'
As an origami pigeon with golden wing tips unfolded seamless
My heart pumps rigorous till cart bumps awesome
I spit with purpose while he spits worthless, lost 'em
I write for my son's eyes to see, no disguisin' me
Straight laced with a straight face just in case they watchin' me
I'm not perfect but I perfected White-Out and correctional tape
Hindsight's 20/20, no reason for repeated mistakes
Skipped the rock across the lake to watch the ripples spread
To symbolize the vastness of existence when driven by persistence
Led by the light while most are led by the night
Use insight to fight for the right to right the wrongs
And fight for the right to write the songs
That breath life into the mic, so all y'all can sing along
I try to open minds with ever scripted sentence
I take over the game of Life and y'all can keep ridin' the benches

[Chorus] [Envelope] [x2]
Do what you gotta do
Use what you gotta use
Just be your own man, everything else is optional
Fool who you gotta fool
Move what you gotta move
Just be your own man, everything else is optional

[Verse Three] [Blueprint]
It's a hard life
So I stay away from dog fights
With the animals that hang out all night
That don't really give a fuck if you alright
Cause to them, your life is a small price
Fast cars open scars from bar fights
Turn around and do the same thing tomorrow night
Hidin' they face from the rays of dawn light
Try as they might they can't escape from God's sight
Cause God's sight runs free without harness
Illuminating the way and total darkness
From the rich and high rise apartments
To the poor that's stuck in housing projects
Even though I hate it
The hardship I face keeps my notes updated
I'm stimulated by hatred
Plus the cracked pavement reminds me that escape is near
You just gotta find it

[Chorus] [Envelope] [x2]
Do what you gotta do
Use what you gotta use
Just be your own man, everything else is optional
Fool who you gotta fool
Move what you gotta move
Just be your own man, everything else is optional</pre>
