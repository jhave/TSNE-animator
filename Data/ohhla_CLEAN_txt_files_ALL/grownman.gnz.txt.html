[Young Chris]
Yeah, C and Neef baby
We grown men (rock wit me)
I don't know what they told you (rock wit me)
But I'm a grown man ma (we grown men ma)
Neef grown to baby (he grown to baby)
(we gettin couple dollars to baby, yea!!)
(we get our own cake to baby)
I know we in our late teens

[Verse One - Young Chris]
She my down ass chick
Love me plus she like to come down my strip
Get paralyzed wipe down my shit
I love ya boo
Your my bugaboo
Type bug your boo
All day all night then I murk when the birds chirp

[Chorus - Young Chris : repeat 2x]
"YEEAAH", If you want it
"YEEAAH", Baby you can get it
Still doin shows and after parties
And after the party its back to the party at our crib

[Verse 2]
Niggaz stinjy we party where I live
Niggaz offended like beg your pardon that my chick (is that yo chick)
Excuse me this ain't her first time here
And don't approach me like that, get roasted like that
Damn shorty playin wit your emotions like that
You a grown man she got'chu open like that
You put somethin around her finger
Now she got'chu wrapped around her finger its official
Well that's you that's what'chu get for trickin
Keep givin her doe she take care of the Chris- and

Come in her come soon as I'm done tell her I'm skippin
She like, now that'chu got what'chu wanted you actin different

[Chorus - Young Chris]
"YEEAAH"
"YEEAAH"
Still doin shows and after parties
And after the party its back to the party at our crib
"YEEAAH", If you want it
"YEEAAH", Baby you can get it
Still doin shows and after parties
And after the party its back to the party at our crib

[Verse Three - Young Neef]
If you want it, you can get it
You can come, but'chu can't live here
If I hit it, I want Chris to hit it
To I know you wit it bitches
Mad cause I partied then danced up wit your girl friend
Smoked and bent mainly drunk off Cris'
And I wasn't even feelin that bitch
She actin all pissy same time saditty
A little bit silly I can't even get a quickie
Never that, got a area code for every city
Couple young freaks, couple old heads that dig me
Thinkin they gon' mold me, knowin they can't control me
Young'n been fuckin old head ain't shit you showed me
Got a walk like George and I talk like Goldie
Nope you can't hold me from hittin your homies
I do enough rappin at work listen to oldies

[Chorus - Young Chris : repeat 2X]
"YEEAAH", If you want it
"YEEAAH", Baby you can get it
Still doin shows and after parties
And after the party its back to the party at our crib</pre>
