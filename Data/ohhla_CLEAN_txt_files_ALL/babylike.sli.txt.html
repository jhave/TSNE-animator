Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Baby I like it
Baby I like it when you move that way
I like it
Baby I like it when you move that way

Baby won't you tell me what it takes to be your man
Baby won't you tell me what it takes to understand
Now when your body's talkin' to me girl
You know what's on my mind
I wonder if you're the kinda girl who thinks would blow my mind
And if youre not pleased don't you worry, I don't discriminate
I said I like those kinda girls who put food up on my plate
But then you tell me that you want it girl, you know I want it too
Well, Wrap your legs right around my neck until my face turns blue
Because I like it in the mornin' time, girl
I like it late at night
I said I like those kinda girls who's pussy's really tight
So please girl don't keep me waiting so long
Please girl now don't keep me awaiting alone

[Chorus]

I smell the pussy but no pussy can I get
'Cause you keep your pussy hot just like your name was Boba Fett
I'm like hansolo gettin'a deep deep freeze
Nothin' I say can break the ice, not even pretty please
I keep it cool, respect you everyday of the week
But expect everyday of the week I wanna freak
Spread your legs a little wider I run up deep inside ya
She wrap me up and smoke me like my name was easy rider
Rider rider rider rider [2x]

[Chorus]

So did you have to run, did you have to run
did ya did ya did ya have to run, did ya have to run away [2x]

Baby won't you tell me what it takes to be a man
Baby won't you tell me what it takes to understand
Now when your body's talkin to me girl, you know what's on my mind
I wonder if you're the kinda girl who thinks will blow my mind
So please girl now don't keep me waiting so long
Please girl now don't keep me waiting so long

[Chorus]</pre>
