[Intro - Aaron Hall - singing]
Girl, hey baby, girl
(I like), girl, hey
(I like), oh I like ya baby
(I like) oh, hey baby
(I like), girl

[Verse 1 - Loon]
Check it out
Yo there's a reason I like you
And there's a reason I wifed you
Cause I never seen nothin like you
So sweet my team even like you
There's no limit to the things that I might do
And that's why you stay in the finest
Everything major, never in the minors
We dine on yachts, far from them diners
I'm by your side, far from behind ya
And I ain't gotta buy cars to remind ya
Gas you up, put your heart in the grinder
You don't know what you mean to me, girl
Cause you more like a queen to me
And, I just want you to cling to me
Cause you came and you changed my scenery
It was just like a dream to me
That's what it seemed to be
You need a ring it's not a thing to me
Cause I bet ..

[Chorus - Aaron Hall]
(I like) The things you do to me
(I like) It brings out ecstasy
(I like) You've really turned me on
(I like) I like the way
The feelings, good things from you

[Break - Aaron Hall]
Girl you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave, I'm on my hands and knees

[Verse 2 - Loon]
Uh, and now I'm back by popular demand
Rocks is in your hand, so let 'em know girl you got a man
Even though you know, I got a lotta fans
See me in the club with them bottles in my hand
Models on the side, try to holla if they can
Get a nigga home, try to swallow if they can
But you know they can't holla at your man
I'm focused, so they can't bother with our plans
White sand, we done did that
London did that, Saint Tropez we done did that
Went to Sydney and dropped dough
Trips to Morrocco, Paris popped more, we did that
So ain't nothin else left to do
But spend the rest of my life and invest in you
I know them haters be testin you
But don't let nobody stress you boo
You know they like that

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Loon]
Aiyyo, now that we made our bond
It might sound crazy ma, but it's time to get our baby on
It's time to get a life together, cause you gon' be my wife forever
Cause I made up my mind, it's crazy at times
Envisions of you and a baby of mine
With half the hassle, livin in half a castle
There's no way that I could pass you up
Blessed to have you, pain that I loved done last through
Can't nothin in the world surpass you
I have to ask you, please be my only girl
I can't breathe in this lonely world
Cause I'm often hounded, concerts surrounded
By chicks that think Loon is astoundin
But without you ma, Loon won't be grounded
Loon would be runnin 'round clownin

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break - Aaron Hall]
(I like) I like the way you wear your hair
(I like) I like the stylish clothes you wear
(I like) When you kiss me I feel warm
(I like) Give me all you lovin all night long

[Chorus] - until fade</pre>
