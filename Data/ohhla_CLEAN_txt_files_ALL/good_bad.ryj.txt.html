[Chorus 2X: Ray J]
When a good good girl's gone bad
When a good good girl's gone bad
She's - gone forever, gone forever

[Ray J]
You shoulda been there girl
When I was in love, with you
Listen girl, I said
If I'm not here for love
Then what am I here for?
Tell me baby, got me goin crazyyyyy
I'm like ooooooooooooh, what am I supposed to do
when my heart and soul is still into you?
Ooooooooooooh (oooh) oh what am I supposed to do
when the girl that I once knew starts changin?

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Ray J]
Ohhhh if I'm not here for love
Then what am I here for?
Youuuuuuuu, ohh baby

Then what did you think it was?
Tell me baby, got me goin crazy yeahhhh
I'm like ooooooooooooh (ooooooh) what am I supposed to do

Ooooooooooooh (ooooooh) oh what am I supposed to do

Changing yeah, changing yeah.. changing yeah!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Shorty Mack]
Uh-huh, I lost mine too (Knockout)
Sent her packin though, you know?
Wipe your tears baby, yeah

Mami, nah not at all, papi's never forgiven ya
I can only honestly say, I'm gettin rid of ya
I pity ya, did it to, only yourself
So when you're cryin understand that you noosed yourself
When a girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
Better say bye J, I'm understandin that nigga
So all the Prada that I bought, you can keep that gold
But when I get to the pad have your shit out the do'
I'm Shorty Mack

[Chorus] - repeat 2X to fade</pre>
