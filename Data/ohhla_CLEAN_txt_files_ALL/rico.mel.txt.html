We in the studio
I said, we in the studio
Is this mic on?
Check, check
I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
Cause I know some people living who ain't livin this life
Read about starved children who ain't eatin this right
Drug lords declare war, sellin cheaper the price
Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the blacks sellin bags of the white
Niggaz can't get a job, so we self-employed
If the coppers come a-knockin, we gon' help that boy
Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money
See - seashell money, we sell money
Rain, hail money, heaven what the hell money
Dusty paper stale money, I thought they restricted it
Did for most people but we out here gettin it
Uhh, yeah

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Put your hands under her dress, we get the feelin that she's faded
And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
The sex it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
Villain wolves screaming kill 'em all, fuck 'em all
And that go for anybody that come around here, that ain't from around here
Hoe you too, you ain't special, Wolf Gang kill them all, fuck 'em all

[Hodgy Beats]
She handles herself with class and she got a nice ass
but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes, jeans bleached with the holes
but she can't get my bank homey
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good it's so good
she can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag, poppin tags on the ave
but she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
by the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin it
Dealin with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple let's go
To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
Bring the pipe, blow the weed, punchlines to be received

[Chorus]</pre>
