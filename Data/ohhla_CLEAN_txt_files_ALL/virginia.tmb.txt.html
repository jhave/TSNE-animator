[Verse 1 - Timbaland]
I'm comin straight outta VA (oh)
A nigga named Timbo, growin up a nigga never had cash flow
Catch me dippin in the banana ten fo'
With my nigga Antoine and Theo (c'mon)
Probably hit the high school football game
Salem versus Green Run and that's the shit mayn
After that we gon' meet up at the food line (what)
Little Ceasar's pieces motherfuckers ain't tryin
To go against (what), probably three (uh huh)
Keep talkin nigga you'll get found in that creek (oh)
And that's how we do it in the V (oh)
I can't forget my nigga Pharrell and Camsky (oh)
Y'all remember them house parties (oh)
When a nigga name was DJ Timmy T (oh)
Queen bread, Blackness had the Cutlass Capri (oh)
Look at this nigga, I'm reppin my V (uh, oh)

[Break]
Yeah (oh)
Yeah (oh)
(nah, nah, nah, nah)
Yeah (like this oh)
Oh, oh

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)
I'm comin straight outta VA (yeah)

[Outro - talking]
Homie, that's how we do it (hey man)
