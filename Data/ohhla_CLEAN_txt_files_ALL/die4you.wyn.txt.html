[Lil Wayne]
Heyyyy, I tried.. to treat you like no other
To be like no other.. in your life
Heyyyy, and I cried.. to see you with another
To see you with another.. to win your life

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Hear me out, please hear me out
Hear me out before you walk up out the door
Hear me out, please hear me out
BEFORE YOU WALK UP OUT THAT FUCKIN DOOR!!

[Chorus One: Lil Wayne]
I love you like no other
I do you like no other
I swear to God I motherfuckin tried
I do you like no other
I treat you like no other
Without you in my life I'd fuckin die
I'd die without you, I'd die
I'll die without you, I'll die
I'll die without you...

[Lil Wayne]
I'll cry... until you see an ocean
I'm sinkin to the ocean's floor... to my demise
Ohh I'd die.. here to see you with another
To see you with another.. to be in your life
Ohhhh, ohhhh-ohhhh

[Bridge]

[Chorus Two: Lil Wayne]
I love you like no other
I treat you like no other
I need you in my motherfuckin life
I'll treat you like no other
And there won't be another
There won't be another Mr. Right
I'd die without you, I'd die
I'll die without you, I'll die
I'll die without you, I'll die
I'll die, ohhhh

[Lil Wayne]
Bury me a G.. yeah, bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G when she cry
And I'll be lookin down from the sky
Bury me a G.. yeah bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G.. and I I swear
You gon' hear me out, yeah hear me out
Hear me out before you walk up out my door
Yeah you gon' hear me out
DON'T YOU WALK UP OUT MY FUCKIN DOOR!

[Chorus Three: Lil Wayne]
I love you like no other
I treat you like no other
I need you in my motherfuckin life
I'll do you like no other
I'll treat you like no other
I promise, I swear
I'll die without you, die without you
Die without you, die without you
I'll die without you, die without you
Die without you, die without.. you</pre>
