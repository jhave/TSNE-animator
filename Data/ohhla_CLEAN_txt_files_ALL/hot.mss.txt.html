(Missy)
This is an old school Missy exclusive

[Verse 1]
Look I ain't on no ra-ra shit
You dont wanna test how far Miss get
Me and Tim's cars got kits
But we don't drive around trying to prove you shit
Everyone trying to be that bitch 
but there can only be one bitch, make hits
I know I must make y'all sick
Cuz Everytime I spit you beg to quit
I used to drive a six 
And now I drive a mercala gold and shit
On the plush gold seats to sit
And I own my own click 
Man I must admit
And my S is it
Misdemeanor have you seen she the best it get
And those who try to test this chick
Where they at right now in peace restinin'

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin up ya ass is some smoke
See we rich folks, we buy boats
And you is a broke bum nigga that's for sure
I know you broke just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' out ya is some smoke
Cuz rich folks we buy boats
And you is a broke bum liar that's for sure

[Verse 2]
Yeah boo you know you a joke
Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro
Claim you down with so and so
Ya whack on whack, bows I came to throw
I might just let you mop my flo'
Here my autograph take this flick to go
(CHEESE)
Miss don't say no mo'
Cuz you know what I do 
And you know what I know
And I dont think so 
You dont wanna lose a arm or elbow
If ya broke man just say so
Cuz that bentley that you renting
Man its got to go
Back to the black man sto'
Along with ya weave cop a new afro
Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low
But if you try to test me I just check ya slow

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz we rich folks, we buy boats
And you is a broke bum nigga that's for sure
I know you broke just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' out ya is some smoke
Cuz rich folks we buy boats
And you is a broke bum liar that's for sure

[Verse 3]
In old school we used to call out names
But I ain't tryin' to get y'all all my fame
My credit card gonna bring ya pain
To know ya bank account just don't change
No need to wreck ya brains
Trying to see who Missy gon' slain
I roll solo not with a gang
Don't carry guns kick ass wit a chain
Don't let me say it again
Don't carry guns kick ass with a chain
(WHASSSSA)
Like a chinese man
Reverse it 
(ti esrever)
Know what I'm saying

(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz we rich folks, we buy boats
And you is a broke bum nigga that's for sure
I know you broke just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' out ya is some smoke
Cuz rich folks we buy boats
And you is a broke bum liar that's for sure</pre>
