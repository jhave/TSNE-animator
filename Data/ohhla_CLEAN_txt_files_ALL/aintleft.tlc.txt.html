Ladies and gentlemen
It's the adventures
Of Left Eye

Respect just as one
The request from the Left Eye
I need a dose just maybe two only to get me high
But I'm not speakin' in terms of drugs you see
I'm talkin' you and me with this temporary insanity
Please baby I say baby four more times
And then please breakin' it down
I start with P-L and you end it with Ease
It's not hard you see
But taken literally
That is exactly what I want it to be
Cuz if I need it need it need it in the middle
The middle the madiddle of breakfast
Stop and correct this
I broke somethin' that need ta be fixed
Got no time to be wastin' when we admitted into the remix
Take it that you're steppin' to a start that is slow
Instead of me and my left lip you'll blow
And right at the left one it's wet as a fountain
Speed it up G with 3 minutes and countin'

Chorus:
Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the night
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
If the lovin' is strong and he got it goin' on and
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
2 inches or a yard rock hard or if it's saggin'
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)
So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the paddywagon cause
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg, I ain't 2 proud 2 beg

For me to beg it is nothin' but a sixth sense
The other five is aidin' me in helpin' me to dispense
Cuz seein's believin' when seein is what I saw
If it's wrong let the left hand commence
To touch what such great thing lies ahead of G
Tempted enough I taste till it comes back to me
Movin' up to rock the boat and I won't see
So till you increase to the reason of your mindless beats
And what the hell there is no smell
But I can always tell it's left here here as well
And if the lovin the lovin the lovin was that strong
Then he gotta get at it all day and night long
Oooooh but as for you another minute ticked away
We're down to two
For those who don't know the three letters in TLC
Stand for T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli

Chorus

Chorus

Yo left eye kick that shit

Realize the realism of reality treats
Us both the same
Cause satisfaction is the name of this game
So I choose to explain it's evident
Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant
In other words lets refresh your head
About pullin' down curtains and breakin' da waterbed
Yeah I like it when you (kiss)
Both sets of lips
Oooh on the TLC tip

I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
For what I call my own
Just you and me (uh)
Heyyyyyyyy

Bridge:
When I need 2 feel love
Why wait 4 so long
Cause I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
4 something that I call my own
And I want 2 be touched
And feeling so much because
Everybody needs some good lovin'

Chorus

I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
Yo I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg 
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg ya'll
No I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud I ain't 2 proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud 2 beg ya'll
You think I'm too proud 2 beg
I ain't 2 proud I ain't 2 proud...</pre>
