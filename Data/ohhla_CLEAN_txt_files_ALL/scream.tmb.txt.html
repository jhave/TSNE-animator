I got a plan for you and I
Let's journey across the Venetian skies
Can I have some of your cookies, can I have some of your pie
May I cut the first slice, so won't you

Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right

Intoxicated with desire
And you're the designated driver, yeah
I'm not afraid, 'cause I'm a rider, yeah
Ain't nothing wrong with feeling right, so won't you

Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Scream)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Oh)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (You make me scream)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right

I love it babe, got me here doing things I don't ever do
You hold me down thats why I'm here making sure, things are up for you (get it)
Like a getaway, the lights go off, you turn on
I love your place, cause I can hear the echo when you make me ahh

Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (If your feeling good)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Let me know)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Scream)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Show me it feels good)

In the car, at the party
Got his hands, On your body
Don't fight it, Ooh
If you like it, Ooh

In your room, on the rooftop
Feels good, don't stop
Don't fight it, Ooh (Don't you fight it)
If you like it, Ooh (Why don't you)

Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Scream)
Scream, at the top of your lungs, everybody's feeling right (Scream)

Cuz when it feels good it (don't fight it)
If you like it
