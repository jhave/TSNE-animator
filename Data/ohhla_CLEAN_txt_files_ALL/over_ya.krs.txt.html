Song:   Over Ya Head
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Well am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?

Huh?  What?  Where?  Who?
What?  Whattyathinkinabout
when who says what when how
You can't maybe follow my style
You be the child, I be the teacher
Smile, who said when, what
mouth not shut, what?
Whenever however whenever
whatever the cut
How you maybe could you ever
believe, that you could so quickly achieve
these crafts, please laugh at his stupid ass
upon your knees in glass
You lust, for everything but trust
So we bust back, with conciously charged art
with a mic instead of a brush

But am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
Yo am I over ya head?
Listen..

Yes, us must trust us, who?  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss trusting us
Us must trust us, who?  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must trust us discuss thus trusting us
Trusting us, us must trust discuss
Discuss not trusting us must not fuss
Us with us means us discussing trusting us
Us must trust us, who?  Us must trust
not fuss with us, us must dicuss trusting us

But am I over ya head?
Yo am I over your head?
But am I over ya head?</pre>
