[Malik]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Diamond D once again, youknowhatimsaying?
Illegal in the house, crumbsnatchers
Snatching up all the crumbs, taking over

I'm the original crumbsnatcher, making money master
Choose to do what I gotta do cause I have to
Die to survive, take a ride down the darkside
Dipping and I'm dabbing with my man Diamond D, right
Tell you a little story, listen close to what I say
When I stole one's car cause they home all day
So I jumped in the ride, cranked it up and I'm Audi
Stole got me right, so I'm feeling buckwild, G
Hit the highways, die ways, which way should I go, oh no
I packed the 25 toe show
Single just released so the hype got me mellow
You heard of Cloud 9 where the world is supposed to
Pedal to the metal, ride it on this roller coaster
Who's gonna tell David that his Malik got mad?
Went over the last hill and oops, I crashed
I wasn't too dizzy to put the stack in the stash
The story is the real, best believe it's the truth
Don't wanna up them keys and them locks better be bulletproof

[Diamond D]
Some crumbsnatchers, some crumbsnatchers
Some crumbsnatchers, they're snatching crumbs and all (Repeat 2x)

[Malik]   It's little Malik and Jamal
[Diamond] Diamond D coming at ya
          Some crumbstachers, some crumbstachers
[Malik]   It's little Malik and Jamal
[Diamond] Diamond D coming at ya
          Some crumbstachers, snatching crumbs and all

[Jamal]
Every day on the corner of 6-0 where I only got two more packets to go
I'd better hurry up and sell 'em so my uncle don't know
Cause yo, I'm on the verge of a form
That means I'm slipping, if I'm slipping then it's on, a ?setting form?
A hah, I'm not having it, I'm on a hideout now
My grandma can't handle me, so they threaten to put me out
But there's no stopping me, I'm back the next day
To get a packets from Kenny, cause that's my regular play
And see me spot, and it's bet to rhyme hard on my own block
And an automatic 25-7 shots, so rock, I got my clip to pop
And anybody trying to see me getting dropped, that's right
I was a bad boy with mad ego
Hardheaded, and never listen to the way things should go
But yo, I had a reason: it attracted many audience
You see it every day, kids getting ignored
But that's aiight though, I'm here the responsibility is mine
I best to get into something that's gonna take up some time
But it was still crime, I still got mine, got still stoked
Hookey school got caught, but I was never too old
To do the time on primetime, there goes another dead teenager
(Why's that?) Cause he chose to be a crumbsnatcher

[Diamond D]
Some crumbsnatchers, some crumbsnatchers
Some crumbsnatchers, they're snatching crumbs and all (Repeat 2x)

[Malik]   It's little Malik and Jamal
[Diamond] Diamond D coming at ya
          Crumbstachers, some crumbstachers
[Malik]   It's little Malik and Jamal
[Diamond] Diamond D coming at ya
          Some crumbstachers, snatching crumbs and all

[Diamond D]
I'm standing on the block with the glock
Don't give a damn about a cop, I got the white rocks in my left sock
So if you want a cop, hurry up cause it's hot
Take your jumbo then scram off the block
I gotta make dough quick fast in a hurry
Telling my girl, "There's no need to worry"
Raking in the loot, no time to be cute
Mark-ass kids start quaking in their boots
Yeah, Diamond D kicking it with Illegal
Won't take a slip cause I know my style is regal
Props like a cop and I can't be stopped
Step outta line Busta and get mopped
Ain't nothing changed, so get with the crew that
Wrecks it, next it's "Diamond how'd you do that?"
Getting papes like George Siegal
Peace and I'm out on the track with Illegal

[Malik]
Ayo D I know that you've been there before
But I gotta keep slanging, cause in the game ain't no playing
Maintain the game, cause when it rain it's pain
But when you're on like popcorn, it's simple and plain
I got a mastermind and a street brain
To be a crumbsnatcher, a crumbsnatcher, yeah
