[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
(You... should beware)
Beitch! Joey time! I mean
(You... should beware)
Ay!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
My all black shiny with my all black glock
My all black hooptie, muh'fucker I won't stop
Now any nigga in the way consider roadkill
Any nigga in the way consider roadkill
My all black shiny with my all black glock
My all black hooptie, muh'fucker I won't stop
Now any nigga in the way consider roadkill
Any nigga in the way consider roadkill
Line 'em up! .. Point 'em out .. {*2X*}
Now line 'em up! .. Point 'em out ..
Line 'em up! .. Point 'em out, ayy!
(You.. should beware) {*4X*}

[Fat Joe]
Aiyyo Cash this is hard right here nigga
Hey yo the 9 got the muffler, shorty got the pump
Jose I'm a hustler, watch a nigga dump
Bronx on my back, nigga I'm an icon
King of the streets, who you think keep them lights on?
Get some much China niggaz thinkin I be Asian
Have a nigga tied up like the preacher in his basement
You PC niggaz can't come to the yard
Joker face niggaz; leave 'em permanently scarred
Got the top off gon' be a hot summer
And the goons with me case you niggaz on the come up
This is not the best of T.S., it's just a preview
Hard to keep it humble when everybody's beneath you
You are now rockin with one live nigga
AIDS with the flow yes I'm ten times sicker
Line 'em up .. or point 'em out ..
Call Opie Megatron, time to air 'em out muh'fucker~!

[Chorus]

[Rob Cash]
Ha, hahaha
What they gon' do now Coke? Beware nigga
Any nigga in my way consider roadkill (kill)
Shotty shells as long as the feet of O'Neal's
Hey Krillz give me the word his cap's gettin peeled
I hope baby boy got some stacks in his will
You know Cash was lettin it clap before the rap deal
I lay somethin flat for a sack and a good meal
All I need is some weed, 'gnac and a good pill
I be layin in ya lobby, pop ya with blue steel
On the low like a Navy Seal, playboy I'm crazy real
You gon' need Paul Wall when I flame ya grill
Where I'm from in the slums, we keep it trill
Plus make it rain on your brain like a fire drill
They can't stop me, cock me back then refill
For some cheese beat his knees like Grant Hill's
That's what happen when you slackin and don't pay bills
We get it crackin in Manhattan, don't test my skills

[Chorus]
