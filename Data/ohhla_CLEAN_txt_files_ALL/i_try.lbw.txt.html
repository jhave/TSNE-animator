Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Born 1987, no daddy around
Just me and my moms, I had to get on my job
See I got 2 sisters but I hardly seen em
You ask why and I tell you my career's the reason
Two nephews and I got a couple nieces
Grandmother so sweet just like Georgia peaches
Now don't get mad at me, oh we can fix it though
And I shall you know I love you, just to let you know
See I neglected ya'll but I now I need ya'll closer
'Cause nowadays I'm feelin like the devil's on my shoulder
My little sister's 18 and got her own car
Just so she ain't actin fast for them young boys
See I wonder if I'm dad will see his granddaughter
Facing all my obstacles as life gets harder
Chyeah, and I know that I can make things right
I gotta start now to get a second chance on life

[Bridge]
I know I ain't perfect, nobody on earth is
But God I'm workin to better myself
Shit, I know that I can, got a daughter to raise
And when all else fails, get on my knees and pray

[Chorus]
It's hard but I try
Get on my knees and pray
It's hard but I try
Eh, eh eh eh

[Verse 2]
Feel like I'm dyin inside, bullshit aside
Put away my pride, it's okay to cry
Can we go back to how it used to be?
This distant shit is new to me
Tryna remain positive, these haters tryna get to me
Putting on for my daughter, putting on fr my aunts
Me and my moms got a connection like a feeny and pops yea
I love my homies like blood brothers
And even though we don't talk, I still got love for em
All my homies on lockdown doin the bid
Try to maintain, keep your head up kid
And even though it's a journey just to make it to the top
Young and black widow Ferrari, I get sweated by the cops
They don't like it when a youngin got more than what they got
This is for they young man hustling on the block
Shit, you can be whatever, not like me but better
When that road get tough keep yo head up

[Bridge]
I know I ain't perfect, nobody on earth is
But God I'm workin to better myself
Shit, I know that I can, got a daughter to raise
And when all else fails, get on my knees and pray

[Chorus]
It's hard but I try
Get on my knees and pray
It's hard but I try
Eh, eh eh eh

[Interlude]
Man it's been minutes to holla at my pops
Ya feel man? Just talked to my daddy the other day
Ya what I mean?
Real shit man, that shit felt good
So man we caught up and I mean we talked about
Oh shit, ya know what I mean?
Ain't seen my grandmother in a long time though
Ya feel me?
Yea
See all my life I wanted to be famous
So sure you know I wanted to be like a rapper and all that shit but I ain't know that
Ya know what I mean?
It was gon take me away from the ones I love a'ight
And now I'm tryna
Now I find myself tryna go back and pick up all the pieces, all the shit that I left
Ya what I mean?
'Cus whatever man, you get one chance to live man
Take full advantage of that shit
Real shit dog

[Bridge]
I know I ain't perfect, nobody on earth is
But God I'm workin to better myself
Shit, I know that I can, got a daughter to raise
And when all else fails, get on my knees and pray

[Chorus]
It's hard but I try
Get on my knees and pray
It's hard but I try
Eh, eh eh eh</pre>
