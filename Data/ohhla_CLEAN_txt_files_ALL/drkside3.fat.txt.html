Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Modern day productions was the soundtrack to my life
I was bumpin that while I was puffin crack up through the knife
Cuban link that 15 Yoda, flooded that shit out with ice
And put shadow shadows shadow shadows to strike it that's 2 sides
We the ones they callin when they need to spray they blockas
I got shooters on the corners, guaranteed they hit the shot
G's it's shadow work you know we got that far
Moving turkeys up til Christmas
Reach and call em by the bars, stunt on ya'll
Rolls gold Rollie, presidential
100 racks on me â that's the beretential
Don't tell the feds though, they got me for a ticket
But when I touch it down I'm droppin 50 on the strippers

[Chorus 1]
Darkside 3, Lord provide me
With a couple I'll niggas
That'll hold it down
That'll bust some rounds yea yea

[Chorus 2]
Darkside 3, Lord provide me
With a couple I'll bitches
That'll hold it down
They gon be around and lay down yea

[Verse 2]
I'm more than obnoxious bitch to the Trayvon rally
Hit em with Compton shit, she giving me brain in the alley
Leave the curtains open on purpose to let a bitch see
If she curious I'll put her on the work to lick be
Most of these rappers is actors buyin they entourages
Write prescripts to the judge just to duck a few charges
Strong force shoots, slinging them pies
Try hang me out the job for my criminal ties
Uh wettin yay way before I ever made the tape
Closed caskets, them ghetto bastards still an open case
Crocodile tears, you niggas never bust a gun
As long as you picked your last and you give her a son

[Chorus 1]
Darkside 3, Lord provide me
With a couple I'll niggas
That'll hold it down
That'll bust some rounds yea yea

[Chorus 2]
With a couple I'll bitches
That'll hold it down
They gon be around and lay down yea</pre>
