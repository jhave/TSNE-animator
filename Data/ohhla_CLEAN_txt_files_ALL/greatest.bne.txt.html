[Big Chan] 
I'm still the greatest 
I'm pretty 
I'm still the greatest 
[Layzie Bone] 
And i'ma bad man 

[Big Chan] 
Hot child in the city 
walkin' round lookin' pretty 
playas call m Sidity 
fuck pitty 
chitty chitty bang bang 
it's a Westside thang 
bitches get banged on 
and stole on 
in the city where the grass is green 
and the palm trees lean 
been ballin' 
shot callin' since 83 
I know the mothaphukin' industry 
ain't ready for me 
or these ghetto fab queens 
already platlum in the streets 
I even got them jail house niggas 
sendin' they cheese to me 
Big Chan in japan 
bitch I'm over seas 
I'm pimpin' this gat 
watch me hidy flice these hoes 
leave em short changed 
take they fame and roll 
wacth em all fall to tha flo' 
it's a t-k-o 
all you heard was Big Chan 
don't hit me no mo' 
shit this ain't a game 
street niggas know the m-o 
I kill em with words 
serve em like them dealas 
do them birds 
ya heard me 
can't a mothafuka serve me 
I still hold the title 
reposessed it from some of my 
greatest idols 
you punk ass bitches is hollow 
I cave yo whole fuckin' chest in 
my nigga young Lay 
hold it down 
it's goin' down 
like Holyfield and Tyson 
this is for them bitc ass hatas 
I'm signin' off 
I'm kickin' ass and takin' names 
late late late 

Hook x4 

[Layzie Bone] 
she pulled the curtain 
fo' certain

Lil Lay the great 
runnin' this earth 
I'm ready to serve ya right 
nigga done paid my dues 
and took my loses 
it's all about murder right 
fuckin' with these Cleveland bosses 
we flossin' 
ya get paranoid 
cuz me and my boys 
makin' noise 
shuttin' shit down 
heard the buzz around town 
these niggas wanna fuck with me now 
well step in my arena

lilttle nigga meaner then Lay 
nigga back in the day 
when a nigga had to play with the a-k 
boys had em all blown away 
nigga don't play 
I be flippin' my lid 
sippin' my gin

cuz in 99 
I ain't wastin' no time 
makin' that money 
while I'm pushin' my line 
design to prime nigga 
nigga with the automatic status 
daily on the trigga 
hatin' on me 
cuz I'm an original thug 
jealous of a nigga 
cuz I got these figures

A gotdamn thing 
we can go toe to toe 
blow for blow 
slug for slug

doin' these everyday thangs 
and it consist of 
bank bud the brew and the bitches 
and the bustas never could hang nigga 

Hook x4 

[Flesh~N~Bone] 
Now he better lay down 
Test me boy 
I trust my dawgs 
In the name of the Lord 
T-H-U-G 
Were not raised in hell 
Just spray 
With the G-A-G-E 
Smack em with the buck shot 
Guard your face 
Next mornin' 
I read on the front page news 
And o-bit-uary 
You stup[id mothafucka 
Shoulda known not to step to Flesh 
None the less 
He is one less bitch 
For me to worry about 
For the people in time 
I sex my wine 
Hit em up two times 
With a three peice nine 
then dumps the body and 
He's the one got the gun 
With the most of niggas 
Realease the beast 
Nevertheless 
They sleep in silence 
It ain't over for you snitches 
Can't handle the truth 
It hurts punk 
And the next shot 
Off the floor 
Inside his stomach 
Bitch now put em in the mud 
Slowly slowly 
See it inside you 
Open your mind 
Deep in your mental 
Flesh'll get your best 
Shoulda made you realize 
I stay thirsty by the flesh 
It'll be test to try me 
Little bit on the front 
In the aftermath 
When the long gone home 
It ain't shit 
Thought you knew me 
Til I made it known 
Nothin' to pick up the gage 
Explotion blow 
Contest not the Fith Dawg 
Never they know 
Check out my future 
From the second league 
They take out the streets 
Where this thugsta dwell 
All up in St. Clair 
Hit em up S-C-T 
Where them hang 
Niggas trippin' 
Sippin' the fifth of rose 
Everybody buzzed 
Steady remenissin' 
On back and to think how they roll 
Unloaded fo-fo's 
Niiga makin' my money daily double 
It's the reason they call me stack 
That nigga to peel back 
Your mothafuckin cap
