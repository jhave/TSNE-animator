[ VERSE 1 ]
Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 2 ]
Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, "Nikki, sleep tight," then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 3 ]
Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl
