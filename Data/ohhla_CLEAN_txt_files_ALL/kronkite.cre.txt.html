[Intro]
Yeah y'all. Yeah y'all. As we keep it game tight
Respect the work ethic. Blow the kronkite. Proper etiquette
Keepin' it technologically advanced for everybody. Exactly. Move on
What y'all need? Check it out y'all. Phil Da Ag, what you gotta say?

[Verse One]
Periodically I flow a rap Odyssey
That slaps you in the face and then accepts your apology
P-H-I-L Da Agony
Smoke more smoke than the smoke from your factory
Accurately aimin'
Top gamin'
Phil Da Agony, I just had to throw the name in
The lottery
Lower your blood count like a phlebotomy
Is that the Barbershop cats right there?
Gotta be
Seen 'em on Cressant Heights
Just last week
Brand new sneaks
Spittin' game at the freaks
Technique turntables spin
I get my second wind to do it all over again
For me and my friends
Spit it, alcohol consumption
Don't get the wrong assumption
I ain't fucked up
I'm always up to somethin'
Even when I'm throwin' up I get and roll to Tri City
Just another trait of my Likwit committee
Eradicate the beat break and do whatever it takes
Take money to make money but money come late
Wet dog
I catalog like the junkyard dog
Jump back and smack you in your monkey ass mugg
On the lake
Puffin' blunts
Canoein'
Chillin' like a family reunion
Just brewin'
Scrimp on the barbie
Vince Lombardi
Hit you real harshly
Sell you weed and give you parsley

[Chorus: x2]
Keep the game tight, Walter Cronkite
Get up and rewrite and recite
The key to the light
Is simply keeping the game tight
Every days and every night
The darker the light
Remarkable mics
Three strikes

[Verse Two]
Yo, I used to roll wild, actin' wild, smokin' Black &amp; Milds
Now I roll with a pack of file snappin' crocodiles
Agony
Big bang theory
Those who didn't want to hear me, cheer me
Next year don't even come near me
Secret societies
All sorts of anxiety
Police pullin' me over, they keep tryin' me
Die Hard
Jean Claude
Tobacco distribution, rugged rhyme execution
Twin turbo boostin'
Axillary
Silly of me to ask if you feelin' me
Knowin' that I'm rockin' like I'm supposed to be
Bitches standin' close to me
Next to me
Butterfly's in their stomachs off of ecstasy
Wet pussies
Legacies, legends, all time great
Platinum plate
Lovin' the way of my mind state
Critical thinkin'
Ink sinkin'
Heat seekin' lyrics
That follow y'all the first time you hear it
Talk a big game, play a big one
Even your own boys be like, "That nigga won"
The undisputed champion
Top notch contender
Mind bender
You caught up in an earthquake epicenter
I spend a 100 dollars on Nikes
While they give another million to Mike
Somethin' just ain't right
Phil Da Agony
Fuck it everythings for free on me
Y'all just keep rappin' about Gs
While my craft/Kraft automatically gets the cheese
My staff automatically squeeze on y'all wack MCs
Perpendicular
No in particular fix
When I be searchin' ashtrays for vehicalar nicks
Blitz
Sack the quarterback
The New World Order lacks Latinos and blacks
I had to pay to get activation
Now I'm on solo albums
Makin' 'em sound like compilations
Jason, Lawrence, Smith
Smokin' spliff with E-Swift while I listen to the mix
Pick of the first round draft
Build with staff
Your life is fucked up with no map

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Phil Da Ag y'all. And I'm out of here
Unprecedented. Rhymes I invented
Cressant Heights. Check it out
Barbershop material on Premeditated
As the world spins on it's axis
Things go...how they're supposed to be
Phil Da Agony. And I'm out y'all</pre>
