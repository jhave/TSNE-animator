This is for my twenty-five to life bidders, pork fried rice eaters
New York, New York - ice rockin tight wifebeaters
We the truth - don't let yo' dead body be the proof
Leave your Wisdom rottin with holes - and I don't mean ya tooth
I'm hundred proof, that's perfect percentage
Since birth I inherit the gift to spit a verse that refers to ya parent
The spirit's born, here to bring light to the dawn
Made right where you starrin from night to the mornin
plus the light that give light to Muhammad
or Christ how you want it I got what you need
From God to the streets, c'mon motherfucker you talkin to me
Big Pun!!  The papichulo out to screw you
?? ??, hunchback, like Quasimoto

[Big Punisher]
I bring death to your front door like an escort from Hell
or ring the bell like you wanna just talk, and just - rock your world
like ?? believe me, my Squad get busy if you try to diss me
Cock the glizzy give you one back word to 'Pac and Biggie
Cause my commitee ain't only known for the flowin
Put they holes in your colon send you rollin like when you're bowlin
a perfect strike - let me show y'all niggaz what I learned from Ike
I hurt your wife - put the trife ass in the earth aight?
I'm shootin at you - and that's off the top like Supernatural
?? ?? turn his moves to statue like Medusa was lookin at you
Clap you with your own heat - by all means
If this was L.A., I'd be a motherfuckin O.G.

Chorus (first 1/2)

[Lil' Fame]
I breaks the world off with a bang (BANG!)
"How About Some.." FUCK THAT!  Look nigga, you know the name
It's the One slash, Seven One Eight, slash
M dot O dot P dot, First Family dot
Boogie Down, Brooklyn (DAMN YOU)
Step the fuck back, before I get Big Pun to earth-slam you
I rep for my cellblock niggaz
and cats from Puerto Rico, Uptown screamin out, "Perrico!"
Yep, this nigga strike, I've survived mad nigga fights
Lil' Fame, insane brain, to fill your gigabytes
Merc out on machines with loud pipes
Niggabytes, six-double-oh's, and ?? bikes

[Billy Danzini]
You want Seven One Eight Terror (SQUAD), William (DANZE)
First (FAM).. easy soldier!
I'm not a killer, I just pop a lot
Grew up in Brownsville, in a brownstone, by a vacant lot
Seance got - my mind, my body, and my - SOUULLLLLLLL
Ohh!  I don't blame you - you switched your gameplan
when you found out your main man was named Danze
Nigga - I'm filled with anger!
You fuckin with a hooded soldier, Code Red your life is in danger
(FIRST FAMILY STYLE) all the way out
BANG (BANG) BANG (BANG) til your brains hang out</pre>
