Song:   Nothing Left to Say
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

There I was unconscious on the floor
This place I never knew departing from me I'm sure
Awaiting the hand of God knowing I stand to fall
I stared into the pitch black to no hand at all

When your all alone and you think of home
Places you may have been and who you've known
This beauty they speak of I cannot see
As I imagine as a child it's make believe

Good ideas hard to find, get one and stand in line
Been judged and judged what's one more time?
Adoring suffocation through the pain of humiliation
I would discover both sides of manipulation

Family picked up and went away
Some friends have left and some have stayed
I've trusted one and been betrayed

When you grow tired of lying on the ground and
People walking on you
If you get to your feet and struggle to stand
People you know withdrawal their hand
And you don't know why

I know why
I know why...

I am just unable to feel or God fear
Some people you may have met on this planet are not here
Life taunts of violence death flaunts a silence
If your soul is priceless it's cause no one wants to buy it

If you relapse your quietly falling no one to catch you
So the monkey on my back is still flinging shit at you
Wipe it off let's move on we have so much to do
So much to see, I have so much pain for you

When your life is suckin you've got vices that are something
To hold onto as you fall into nothing
It's like your drowning but too good to take a hand that pities
While you cling to your addiction like a kid in swimmies

Silly habit, drugs are for kids not adults it is
Not free to live unless it's under a bridge
New york city can gauge it's health with colors
They said I was a danger to myself and others

I have CC brothers, forgive my enemies
WM will live on like the Kennedy's, every amenity
You lovin this un-American not to be gluttonies
Should have a big chain to accentuate the ugliness

My soul is stuck in this unaware of it's appeal or purpose
And manufactured for you to steal or purchase
You leave behind what you get from money, oh well
What's the weather like kids? (It's always sunny in hell)

I have one thing left to say, I'd like to share it with you
If you don't care is it too bad for me or too bad for you?
I know it's complicated, he suffered he tried to make it
Now maggots just want to be compensated and live through Camu

Live through Camu

You picked at his flesh the day of his death astounding
A WM on his arm and a circle around it
I'd like to think what he left behind you could really use it
Instead of saying his name just to move your shitty music

The day I feel the need to stand in a bathroom
And shovel cocaine into a human vacuum
I'll look you up, the day I need another hole in my face
When you pass away people think that your checking your myspace

Then your enemies give you public head quick
So why not at my funeral just pull out my dead dick
Thought to project see him at the gates they let him in
I guess they needed you as much as we do yet again

I looked to the sky and opened my eyes then the weathermen
Symbol in the clouds just a memory of my friend
He stuck his head in the future where they sing his art
Where the wild card will be crowned the king of hearts

If I had things left to say, why would I share it with you?
How you suck the life from the dead is even too low for you
The time you spent depleted, his soul has just left so beat it
Go join the kids and eat it up and tell them how you knew Camu</pre>
