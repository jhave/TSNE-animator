Yeah, yeah
Check it out, y'all
Just clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Just clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Just clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah

Tell me why all these ?bumaclutz? try to clown me
I tell em move away, me need some privacy
Don't you know I am the man that come up positivity
Never negativity 'cause we create then do-re-mi
My name is Will I Am from BEP
Black Eyed Peas, numero uno, we be jammin' like Marty
If I'm technical with my rhymes, let me know now
I shake it all around, niggas know how we be throwin' down
Too much looky, who be ditchin' y'all like hooky
Honey's wanna get up on me like suki-suki
They call me on my telley talkin bout mushi-mushi
They pullin on my body, feelin on my tushi-tushi

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah
And don't you know, I need some privacy
Excuse me young girl, me need some privacy

'Cause the Black Eyed Peas is coming woofin mighty-mighty flow
I'm deliverin the rhymes because my mama told me so
I'ma do what my mama say and rock dollar y'all
Mama say, mama sah, mamu-makusta
Too much looky, and we the last cookie
Where pastry, dippin like, umm umm, ?le criste?
Lickin on your finger and you lickin your hand
That good, finish that man
Make sure (sure...) make sure

Chorus:

Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah
And you know, I need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy

We open up, bottle killin, the business, showbiz
We be passin the Peas, purposely and positive
Wonder if is, where does it last, say "Here it is"
Should be all up in your ear, with a test and a quiz
See ya dance, say "Damn, now what it is?"
Want to in sync with all the Pea body kids
You be nodding your head back and forth like this
They be feelin my move, then your mind is in bliss

So put your hands together now we ready to bounce
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce
You can either jump up and boogie or just lounge

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah
I thought I said need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy

Recite more poetic, a tactic from the attic
Apl De Ap, gets critical and droppin' shit
Like a dimensional picture
You architect, so I free you to get the scripture
But when it hit ya, I got you turning like elixir
Back a glass of coniac, we divide the mixture
I'm about to fix you up, with a new texture
More information better down like a letter
And in the sector

Chorus

Clap your hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon
Just clap our hands y'all, c'mon, c'mon

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah
You know I need some privacy
Go play somewhere else, me need some privacy

So put your hands together now we ready to bounce
Got the whole world waiting for this, to be announced
Know you just got satisfaction by the ounce
You can either jump up and boogie or just lounge

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah
You gotta give me privacy

Chorus

It's too much looky-looky-looky
Too much watchy-watchy-wah
They looky-looky-looky
And they watchy-watchy-wah, uh-ah, uh-ah

Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people stomp your feet
Clap your hands now</pre>
