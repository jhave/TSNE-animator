Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yeah
Don't
Don't
Damn
Don't leave, cause your my oxygen without you I won't breathe
Your everything I want, need, for you I wear my heart on a short sleeve
I know some things need changing, that takes time I need more, please
Say I ain't do everything I coulda done, like the shit that I did ain't good enough?
Your friends said they been woulda left, ain't do you right so you head to the left
I can't say that I blame you, I never though that it would be this painful
People do it everyday I can change too
But dealin with the heartbreaks what she can't do
True, and that's as real get, what you feel ain't easy to deal with

[Chorus]
When you find the girl you love has gone
You ask yourself why life must go on
You thank alot about what she said
But deep inside you pray he'll bring her back someday

Don't go
How to live my life without you I just don't know
But you feelin this relationship, it's not that it can't it just won't grow
I say I love you you say it don't show
Fuck the money and them gifts don't count
What about them smaller things you needed
And why the fuck you had to leave before I seen it
Damn, I need your love like a weed stick
Me without you like kathy no regis
I kept secrets, and couldn't apologize enough times for messin with that freak bitch
But I can still tell that your leavin, and like I said I can't blame you the least bit
The cryin shame is, and times changin
Best friends become strangers, that's how it is

[Chorus]</pre>
