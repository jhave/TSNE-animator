Yeah, black woman

[Grand Puba]
This one goes out to all the black woman across
the whole planet Earth, givin our black nation birth
Nothin in this universe is worth your worth
So we dedicate this song, black woman

[Lord Jamar]
This one is for every woman I was ever with
The ones that I cared about and ones I just wanted to hit
I feel ashamed for all the times that I called you a bitch
And I, know I was wrong, can you ever forgive?
The negative, we used to use sex as a sedative
I abused your respect for me
I would choose to react disrespectfully
Never thinkin the impact would come back to me
Now I'm the son, and I know you're my reflection
Let me give you love and my protection
Proper education Allah's correction
Eternal lies, within your eyes
I hope you realize that I apologize, for all the lies
I never meant to make you cry - all the mistakes that I
may have made, and games that I played
Been put to an end, black women

	Let me take this time, to let you know
	You've been on my mind, and even though
	I always haven't been kind
	I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
	(repeat 2X)

[Grand Puba]
Now she's the most beautifullest thing in creation
She give me motivation causin constant elevation
Seein more than booty used in lustful situations
So feel the vibrations, she's the mother of our nation
Now for oh so long you stood by us so strong
even when we done wrong, so I dedicate this song
More priceless than a worldly treasure, you bring
love joy pleasure, countless things that are unmeasured
Some raise seeds all alone with no father in the home
but they still find the strength to continue on
I see you more than a crackhead or a chickenhead
or just a piece of somethin I'm tryin to get up in my bed
You often say a lot of times we demean
Sometimes we do to lift the hardhead ones up to queens
Our whole purpose is to give a proper surface
cause the black woman always is a queen

	Let me take this time, to let you know
	You've been on my mind, and even though
	I always haven't been kind
	I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
	(repeat 2X)

[Sadat X]
My fondest thoughts and memories go out witchu
And I'm sorry for that time that I hit you
The finest lights you radiate, you lookin bright
And that's why I love you with the chocolate skin
Finer things were never made in this world
There you are lookin like somethin worth somethin
Make me feel pride when you walk with me
Sit down and talk with me, for a minute
It's kinda hard for me not to stray
But I think I'm gonna start today
Hey I'm tryin, at least I ain't lyin
(Like that frontin ass, you know what I'm sayin?)
Send a rose to your wife, she probably saved your life
Put up with cheatin and she mighta got beaten
You can't build a _Foundation_ based on lies and deceit
I'm tryin to be right, I want my cypher complete

	Let me take this time, to let you know
	You've been on my mind, and even though
	I always haven't been kind
	I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
	(repeat 2X)
