Sticky Fingaz: Official Naz Takeover

Chorus:
Yo, Yo, Official Naz Comin' Through betta raze it up
All my hoods' on the block better raze it up
All my peoples locked up better raze up
You better raze it up
You better raze it up

(Sonsee)
Yo Yo
Lyrical Assault
Mics outlined in chalk
Gun Talk, homicide in New York
Caught a raw deal, horror Amityville
Hand me the steel, breathe in ya' man to get killed
Put a knife to the love of ya' life,
Put a slug in ya' wife
Blood on ya ice
Mud on my knife
Drug price, chain snatch cocaine crack
Goin they jacks with the gat blow ya brains back
Switchin' lanes and drop vests
Blow the top of the jet
Cock and wet you rocked for death
Driveby's pain in eyes painting black lines
All the way live
Guns in the sky
Move and die
Survivin' niggaz leave you left for death
One in ya head
Runnin from Feds
Drugs under ya bed
Crime kills blast rhyme skills like nine mills
So nigga dead
Cuz I kill so what

Chorus:
Official Naz comin' though betta' raze it up
Where my real thugs at you betta' raze it up
All my villains with the checks you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

Official Naz' comin' through you betta' raze it up
If you don't wanna get wet you betta' raze it up
If you from the projects you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

(Fredro Starr)
Right NOW, we gonna hit you up with the joints like BOW
Blast nasty
Fight pow
Styles takin' you to the bank
Me crew always  pack shanks??
Lick that clit in a 600 Benz tint
These degrees is hot
MC's get got
Comin ta tangle from wild angles
Get mangled
Buck fifty game is blow you
Till ya moms won't know you
It take 2 cheap niggaz just to sell you
Its arrested then, me and my crew
It won't be beautiful,
All that shit you talk is new to who, believe that
Words hit you like a semi-gat
Any act, unaccordingly wait, gimme that
So core tight it was house
Complicated in death
Me and my killas still here
And yo ass is out
We up out the gutters
And let you get touched
Its such, blood rush
Raze it up!

Chorus:
Official naz comin through ya betta' raze it up
Everybody from the streets betta' raze it up
And if you holdin heat you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

Official naz comin through ya betta' raze it up
All the willies at the bar ya betta' raze it up
If you bouncin in ya car ya betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

(Sticky Fingaz)
Sticky Fingaz
Madman, tear down stages
Ain't nobody dead or alive who could get with me and my rages
Throw my clip in a gat and I'm sick of this yap
And I'm ready to bust a cap
And if you happen 
Ya niggaz will get shot fuck the rap
Get ya ass kicked
Set you up or get you blasted
Closed gasket
I'm the bald headed bastard
Black dust gave me black lungs
I pack guns
Im used to action like dodgin' bullets over crack funds
Reaction!
Blaze the mack 10
Shogun
I could spot the sheisty villains cuz it take one to know one
Remove my mask and reveal myself
Heal Myself,
If I was you I would kill myself
So play dead eyes stay red
Spray lead
I'm way fed and ain't leavin without they head
Son holders they bout to get roughed up what
When you see me all you hear is: (gunshot kinda noises)

Official Naz Comin through ya betta' raze it up
All my shorties in the spot you betta' raze it up
If you don't wanna get shot you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

Official Naz Comin through ya betta' raze it up
When you see the Cops come you betta' raze it up
East coast West coast you betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up
You betta' raze it up

Sticky Fingaz: What?!
