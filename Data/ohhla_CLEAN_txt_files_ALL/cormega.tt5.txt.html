[Cormega]
Yo.. yeah shit is real right now yaknahmsayin?
Who the nigga - motherfuckin Cormega
Queensbridge, that's Q.B.
Uptown - Connecticut, niggaz is settin it
Tone Touch - you just don't give a fuck
What nigga?  Far Rock', Iraq, to Southside
Son we gon' show these niggaz

Yo, yo, what?
Niggaz recognize the method I perfected rhymin
Rappers insecure, verbally I'm jeapordizin
Check the way that I be exercisin
My pen work for me for years, it's ?-defyin (ooh!)
You know the saga, the drama
The Queensbridge Kingpin, 'Mega Montana
To Touch I pledge allegiance, drugs sold for many reasons
Some for prestige, others they only way of eatin (no doubt)
My niggaz pray to be in, a better life
We had plans to bag grams and get ahead at night (what?)
I fuck with officialist, thugs that hit you wit
cop killer dum-dum shit, your whole shit is split
Livin this life, drippin in ice (uh)
Holdin my position like pimpin, Friday composition
Trife uhh I'm takin mines like in Perry Mason times
Any attempt to stop me (check this) you wastin times
I could blaze a nine or infilitrate the line between paper
rhymes like solidified white rock, shocked in eighty-nine
Rhyme for FEMA's, ??, overachievers
Hold a heater to them other cultures, who deceive us
Blunted on a wanted poster with a golden millimeter
You think it ain't real?  Check me on my next re-up, BEOTCH!

What nigga?  Who could fuck with this?
What?  Hahahah
Mobb Deep, C-N-N nigga, Shan
Nas nigga, Poet, Kamikaze, Killa Kid
Nature, what?  Q-B nation nigga
Back together, ha ha..</pre>
