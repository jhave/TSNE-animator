[In Essence]
You will never find another lover like (mine)
You will never find another lover like (mine)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (mine, you will never find)
You will never find another lover like (mine)
You will never find another lover like (mine, oh)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (check this)

I was at two thirty-third and White Plains
Me and my boy - we was riding the train
I saw you! (saw you) Whoa - oh ohh
You were with - (Ronnie) and (Bobby) and 
(Mike - are those the type of guys that you like?)
I know you feel me
Was what you want will never be, you'll never find

You will never find another lover like (no!)
You will never find another lover like (noo!)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (you'll never find)
You will never find another lover like (oh, ohhh)
You will never find another lover like (nooo)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (ah)

I heard he's paying your bills
Tell me can you give me those thrills
My love (my love) is better (is better)
never (never) measure (measure)

(Fall and hard and why?
You'll never find a love like mine)
I know you heard me, cause what you want he'll never be!

You will never find another lover like (mine)
You will never find another lover like (mine)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (mine, never find!)
You will never find another lover like (mine, oh no)
You will never find another lover like (mine, no)
You will never find another love to cum and when its done you'll
never find another lover like (mine)</pre>
