[Intro: Sharissa]
I can't get off my high horse
And I can't, let you go
You are the one, who
You are the one, who makes me feel
So real, heh yeah
No, what am I supposed to do
No, what am I supposed to do, baby
When I am so hooked out on you
Then I realized, that you are, somebody else's guy
Oh yeah, why you wanna go and do this to me, boy

[U-God]
You knew from the jump, I'm not a one woman man
That's how it started, get out my life, now scram
I don't give a damn, slam the door behind you
Need I remind you, don't let false love blind you
Cuz I wine and dine you with coiffure plates
Threw logs on the fire at the Pocono Estates
On Temptation Island, we was wrecked shipmates
I knew from the gate, you was kinda shiesty
You called all my numbers in my phone, you wasn't wifey
Go 'head try me, I plead my case
While you and your friend talk all day on the Sprint
How I ain't no good, better leave his ass quick
But you keep on stalkin' in the Ultima with tent
On some psycho shit, whoa, you make no sense
Peekin' over fences, you not my wiz
I just ran on through you and handled my biz

[Sharissa]
Can you remember, the times we spent together
Sharin' our days in the sun
That's when I found out, that you were somebody else's lover
And after all the plans we made, now they shattered
But still I

[Chorus: Sharissa]
I can't get off my high horse, I can't let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy

[Sharissa]
See that day in September, I'm sure you can remember
That's when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie, and you didn't have an alibi
But baby, hell, I still cared, you know I

[Hook: Sharissa]
Love you so, baby, that I can't let you go, no, no
You are the one that makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do, when I saw you
And I realized, that you're somebody else's guy

[Raekwon]
Read the letters sweetie, your style is fuckin' me up
Completely I ran, dropped you at the grand with the TV
Lacin' you with jewelry was nothin', brought a flower home, you frontin'
Couldn't even cook to do nothin'
Feel the pain and shit, the sexy and funny style, I laughed
Dick told me just lay in the shit
Now I'm givin' you what you gave me
Keep that broke ass nigga you got, hope he got your pocket
I'm airin', peace

[Hook]
