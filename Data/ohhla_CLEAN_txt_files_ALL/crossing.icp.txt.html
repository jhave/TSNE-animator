(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Dearest almight creator...
 
(Violent J)
I've lived one hell of a life, if your to take it tonite
I've lived the life of a king, but so much to darken the light
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Lookin 360 degrees, 2 hundred thousand disease
How can I lay back and chill, so many down on there knees
 
(Violent J)
But then again who am I, I'm just some typical guy
I ain't no fuckin hero, I just been wonderin why....
 
(Chorus)
I seen some children crossing the bridge 
What kind of life did they get to live?
What kind of choice do they get to make?
What if it was a child's mistake?
 
(Violent J)
I'll never question the book, but let's say I lived by the book
I never ate meat on Tuesdays, how much bigger would my wings look?
 
(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I try to pray everyday, but sometimes get lost on the way
I seen the holiest spirit, so much to miss lead the way
 
(Violent J)
I gave the visions I got, I been told i'm gonna rot
Inside the devil's intestines, I'm still here holdin my spot
 
(Chorus)
 
(Breakdown)
Come on up and open up your door
What if it's a pergatory door (repeat)
(fuckin take me instead)
 
(Chorus)2x</pre>
