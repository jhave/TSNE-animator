[Tyler + Hodgy]
RANDOM DISCLAIMEEER..

[Tyler - Intro]
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay? It's fuckin fiction
If anything happens, don't fuckin blame me, White America
Fuck Bill O'Reilly! Four, three, two, one... 

[Tyler, the Creator]
What THE FUCK I look like, sayin I'm sorry
to a bunch of fuckin fags that can't potentially harm me?!
I ain't NEVER gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fuckin WOLVES that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash black hoodies, try somethin
Make sure your fuckin feelings end up up in a Glad bag
FUCK all yo' opinions, I'm tyin 'em with a shoestring
And FUCK the fat lady, it's OVER when all the kids sing

[Chorus]
KILL PEOPLE, BURN SHIT, FUCK SCHOOL
KILL PEOPLE, BURN SHIT, FUCK SCHOOL
KILL PEOPLE, BURN SHIT, FUCK SCHOOL
KILL PEOPLE, BURN SHIT, FUCK SCHOOL
I'M FUCKIN RADICAL, NIGGA! I'M FUCKIN RADICAL
I'M FUCKIN RADICAL, A MOTHERFUCKIN RADICAL!
I'M FUCKIN RADICAL, NIGGA! I'M FUCKIN RADICAL
I'M FUCKIN RADICAL, A MOTHERFUCKIN RADICAL!

[Interlude with "Left, right, left, right" chanted in the background]
Odd Future Wolf Gang...We came together 'cause...
We ain't had nobody else...But you...
You just might be one of us... Are you?

[Tyler, the Creator]
FUCK cops, I'm a fuckin rock star
Rebellion and defiance makes my muthafuckin COCK hard!
FUCK pigs, FUCK guards, all some fuckin retards
FUCK school, I'm a FUCK-up! FUCK Harv-ard
I ain't got no fuckin money (Hey mom!)
I ain't got no motherfuckin daddy, he ain't teach me SHIT~!
Child support ain't come, that faggot STILL ain't bought me anything
FUCK the fat lady, it's OVER when all the kids sing

[Chorus]

[Interlude with "Left, right, left, right" chanted in the background]
They want us to, go to they schools and...
Be fuckin miserable at they fuckin college, studyin that bullshit...
Fuck dat...Do what the FUCKIN makes you happy
'Cause at the end...who's there?... You

[Chorus 2X]

[Interlude]
You hear that, nigga? That's CULT shit right there, nigga
Wolf Gang, FUCK everybody else, nigga!
Stand for something, get money, nigga!
Wolf Gang in this bitch, nigga, we six feet deep!
FUCK wit me, nigga! Odd Future nigga!
Stand the fuck up

[Another interlude with "Left, right, left, right" chanted in the background]
I'm not, sayin, just to go out and do some stupid shit
Commit crimes, all I'm tryna tell you is, do what the fuck you want
Stand for what the fuck you believe in
and don't let NOBODY tell you you can't do what the fuck you want
I'm a fucking unicorn, the FUCK to anybody who say I'm not
Wolf, Gang

[Bridge - Repeat 3X]
FUCK your tradition, FUCK your positions
FUCK your religion, FUCK your decisions
They're not mine, you gotta let 'em go
We can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know

{*beat changes*}

You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em....go
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go
You gotta let 'em....go 
You gotta let 'em go, let 'em go {*continue chantings through the outro*}

[Outro: Dr. TC] (Tyler, the Creator)
You gotta let these shits go, man
It's not making sense to you right now but..
All these little dreams you got, they're not shit
All this rebellion... 
All this crazy shit you got, sayin this shit...
Gettin too old for this shit, man, you gotta grow out of it...
Growin up, your dreams are gettin bigger...
You gotta look at reality, understand that shit so you don't get caught...
I'm just being real... (Nigga, FUCK you!)
I'm just tryin to help you man... Trust me...
(Look, I mature day after day nigga) F'real?
(You don't know shit, you're a fucking therapist)
Whatever, nigga...</pre>
