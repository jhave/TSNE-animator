[Verse Two: Ace Hood]
I'm the flyest I suppose, suicide flows
Lambo wide invented doors suicide doors
Kill 'em with the swag in some shit you can't afford
From '98 Accords to chorus on billboards
No more shoppin in stores it's meetings with Tom Ford
Pretty women on board your bored they so adored
Gangstas to the core put four g's out on the porch
Know some jamaican killers with choppers and C4
Yeah we are the hottest like satan my correspondent
Yeah I know the pilot the meanin of flyin private
Yeah a nigga shinin my presidential with diamonds
Call that my Obama, pistol for mo' drama whoa!

God if your with me! Show the lighters let me know!
Lighters let me know! You know!
Hands in the sky if your with me! It's the Gullyside life you know!
You know! You know!
Real niggas on di corna, catch me if you can
AK, with the clip the banana
You don't wanna fuck around I will bring ya drama
Hot like a sauna middle east Osama
(OH OH OH!!!) Only if your realer with me!
Suicide on dead road!
No mercy on the streets! Incase you never know

[Chorus: Mavado]
So suicidal! First they ever seen this!
Gangsta for life! The realest!!!
So suiciddddeeeee!!!! First they ever seen this!
Gangsta for life! The Realest!
