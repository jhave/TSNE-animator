[Intro: Girl]
And you will never break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
Yo everytime I turn around they say 
How I deal with that weak shit
I told y'all of the stages I can't agree wit
We showed y'all, promoted y'all on how to freak shit
But here's a little secret...
Uh uh we still number one, blazin Hip-Hop and R&amp;B quick
Cuz it's simple and plain, now can you sit and complain quick
When we payed the way for you to get in the game chicks
Nigga's wuteva...it's only the real that they recognize by the real
And since you dont recognize you know the deal
How I feel? I don't know emotions get showed
If anything I feel violated being that we been cloned
Reporterz quit, I dont get caught up in the mix
10 years deep, I was brought up in this shit
OG , big truck series, the cars is gone
Any questions? I'll be directing your comments
To alkatron...sing that shit

[Chorus]
A primitive mind is all I, all I ever had 
And you will neva break me til the day I die

[Verse: Angie]
My reputation and my name is superb
Now add that with animal house and a flow that's like rain down a curb
Cuz I, write a verse and I change a few words, edit and perfected it ..
And and... I'm still on the air about the dough
Be clear, you gotta go each year we lock and load 
Beware I'm outta control animal mode will let you know not to 
hand me no goal
Everything I write hot like my hand on a stove
The (?) know bullshit dont effect me like a "Die Hard" knicks fan
So no mas if's and's
I could show you how power shit get ran and I can't get budged
Cuz when your best friend is the jury bottom line is you can't get judged
And that last line went over ya head so
You'll probably never know til your dead either way
What I said is real, sing!

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse: Angie]
Uh yo uh..
And I'm not bein cocky
Cuz I work my way up
And even tho' it hurt never gave up 
Went from handin' out fliers to number one major.. I don't
I'm about dollars, hold your to cents saved up
Dropped my first album never rock in my life 
Did everything on mah own wrote the songs, hit the mic
Get the beats all nice stayed up got it right 
Minimal help, felt alone
Now you got a problem right?
Cuz it's animal house, the team is here
It's a new day with me this year be clear, I'm focused
Best coaches, way too many peeps
Pro to machines and way to much heat
Still grounded never been way up in the sky
Workaholic still spend days inside
Angie, you could never break me, I move wise
And that's til the day I die, ohh, my, GOD

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
