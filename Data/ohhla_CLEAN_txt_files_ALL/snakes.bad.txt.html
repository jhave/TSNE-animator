[Intro]
Free Max P
Owww (owwwwwww)
Uh uh (uh uh) [x3]
It's like (it's like)

[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Sometimes I feel alienated
Because I'm not up in this alien plant
Or on the radio sayin'
Fuck 'em: broads we don't love 'em we degradin' 'em
But always find my self back at the backanadian
Blood vessels poppin' out my craniums
Niggas askin' when the tape gon' drop
But I got nothin' to say to them
Because I been stackin this skill
Although my passion is real
I'm too cool to cash in the feel
When I should be cashin' a mil
It's something bout me being younger
That affected my hunger
Got older in number
Realized I can't count on these hundreds
To determine my elation
Pursuit of happiness I keep pacin'
These motherfucka's faces
These ain't fear races
They just let the fit erase us
Adopted by the slum
Son of cards this is how they raped us
Yo son we gotta raise up
Don't let them just array us
'Till we raisins in the sun
So we gotta wake up

[Hook: T'nah Apex]
Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent
Apex on the vertex
And I'm with seven serpents

Cause they always be behind in the cut
Always in the skies watchin' stars when they up
So don't you confide into the evil and corrupt
This is urgent

[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]
Got a whole bunch of shit up on my plate now
Thinkin' like in the man garden it's a snake now
Cause I don't know who to believe
Or who to deceive
Got me thinkin' I
Sold my soul and they received a receipt
But I won't proceed to retreat
Jigga told me watch your thrown seat
And now I sees it
And the respect to big
I gotta cease it
And I hope he see me
Cause these niggas don't want beef with my talents
They ain't fit for this green
They just caesar salad
You think because you avid they just gonna let you have it
It's a lot to learn and that my nigga need to ask us
It's the axis of the earth at the birth
I found a new balance
And now I walk on water just like I knew balance just like a relative
Marijuana sedatives got me thinkin' I should put a bomb right where the senate is
Cause they corruptin' the youth
We ain't inductin' the truth
Lookin' at the president like yo it must be nothin' to you

[Hook: T'nah Apex]

[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]
I passed the dutch to left and it started to make sense
It's funny how I see it more straight when I'm bent
You've been warned on the wrist to take a sit on top
Been on clock
Cause you could see that I been on watch
It don't stop
'Till you make the sacrifices
Trainin' was priceless to ices and devices
When the light switch I shift like I'm typin'
Livin' in the era where christ is the crisis
The lifeless in the trance actin like yo mans
Bitch niggas only know that transactions is the plans
But the mic is in my hands so I faild the booth
The blacker the berry is the more sour the fruit
They ejectin' us to make us cowards
To the power of truth
Became flowers from roots
And now we just move in cahoots
I move from the stoop and put my foot right down on the asphalt
Every night I ask lord if this what I asked for
