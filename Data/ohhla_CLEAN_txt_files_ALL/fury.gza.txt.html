Chorus- Rza

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
fuck wit the Wu we bustin ya whole snot box
Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop

Verse 1- Hell Razah

Here's something to advertise, promote it keep the fan satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave em paralyzed,they stolen every word i provide
Without no clearence, i nurture this track like Amish parents
Got requests from retail stores, for my appearence
First we target it, then they market it, to kill ya artist wit
The hungry shark, contra hit, whoevers starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers, for how much this record ships
Fuck them niggaz you record with,I make them forfit
Send a bomb rap fed ex into ya office, son we buil and deliver
Came to build with the Gza, 
check the chorus from the Rza, the real album spitta
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
Its the comming of the  newest hip hop christ
Pop you, try the BDS and soundskins from war fans
Ya whole roster cant take on, one Sun of Man
Get ya street team,get ya sickest out, put ya posters up
Boost ya bucket up, still Razah gonna fuck it up!

Chorus- Rza

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
fuck wit the Wu we bustin ya whole snot box
Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop

Verse 2- Gza

Industrialize niggaz change soon as ya get in
Throw em on a auction block, CEOs bidding
Highest price paid, for them wack rhymes made
It's over rated, cut off, never reinstated
I be fruitful, and multiply with marvelous tales
Feed the hungry MCs and be starving as hell
I laid the first verse and quenched a dry ass niggaz thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water, till his stomach burst
Full tank, with the premium quallity raps
Mickey mouse niggaz get caught on the trap
Ya cottonelle kids from scottsdale cleanex
Looking like rockwell wearing Vnecks
Ya learn from this earn from this
Niggaz getting tossed and turned for this, burned for this
Extort from a thousands degrees of live MCs
I melt ya niggaz down to the size of fleas

Verse 3-Timbo King

The microphonus, collect the bonus, aiyo we on this
House niggaz verse the homeless
Ten to one, Tim's the one
Royal famous,the verbal painless
The dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Import from poor to riches, leanin on doors
We move across the broklynn bridge doing 60
Illegal driving, from dusk to red dawn
The Gza/Genius, Wu-tang we live long

Verse 4- Dreddy Kruger

True indeed, I hook tracks like my seed
Persona, wack MCs do me notta
King solomon the great,came to evaporate the fake
Yeah you, you know your power-U
Ya reconize the voice, it's that nigga from the Wu
Every dart i spit gets mastered and promoted
ya just been demoted, cause ya sweet and sugar coated
Ya folded, ya style is half stale and molded
So mold it

Chrous- Rza

You crunchy chump crabs get crumbled up like crack rock
fuck wit the Wu we bustin ya whole snot box
Throw ya right ear and ya bitch up in a zip lock
Spazzola to ya fury form of hip hop</pre>
