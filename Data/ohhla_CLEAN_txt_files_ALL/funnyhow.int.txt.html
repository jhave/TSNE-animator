[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong

[Verse 1]
Saturday night, I feel alright
Heading to your place
Kiss your lips, fingertips
Slide down past my waist
Feel the heat, rising me
Just inside your drawers
Throw me down, back to the ground
Under and explore, yeah

You keep my mind goin' baby
You know what to do
The way you slide down on me
I get so into you
Girl your love is what I need
And I don't want to be missin'
So do whatever you want to me tonight
And let the time keep on slippin', slippin'

[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized, mesmerized
Inside your thighs, gonna take a ride
In and out, just let it flow
And I don't want to let it go
I feel your body start to shiver
Ready to deliver
Can I get wet, can I get some baby
Oh here she comes

You keep my mind goin' baby
You know what to do
The way you slide down on me
I get so into you
Girl your love is what I need
And I don't want to be missin'
So do whatever you want to me tonight
And let the time keep on slippin', slippin'

[Verse 3 - Lil' Kim]
I'm momma diamonds linin'
Rolex shinin' niggas bustin' like a bitches hymen
Lil' Kim excite all you freaks Bentaon sheets
with the leather trim down the pleats
bank rolls and Moschino pillow cases
clocks with platinum faces, whatever the case is
the sexiest, the dressiest, yeah it's the messiest
the high genus the cleanest
So why you peepin', creepin', sneakin'
Dreamin' of sleeping with this queen bitch
Didn't you wish for nights like this
5 subtract 3, heart beats in 2 see
There's gonna be a lot of back scratchin', eye catchin'
lit matchin, it's on if only we could just skeet all night
Sip grandma yay, the hen rocks we getting ice
but now its morning, yawning
sure its a lil' early so go home to your girl
or better yet call her up let her know
You was with a gangstress
left you anxious and vanquished
Uh, Clarke Kent, Intro, Lil' Kim just to let you know
Stop the slippin', the mo sippin' and let the
(time keep on slippin')

[Chorus]
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong

Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong
Funny how time flies when you're making love
It goes on and on and on
We just can't go wrong</pre>
