Revolution~!

Yeah

[Pharrell]
All I know is I can't get the recipe
For how to make my pie taste just like the tree
Oh it's so revealing, feeling I have no feeling
But I bet they tell you don't worry 'bout it just add the cream

[Chorus]
AND THEN YOU FEEL GOOD! {*3X*}
LET IT GO AND YOU SHOULD FEEL GOOD!
Here we go...

[Pharrell]
How does every man endure the heckling?
Every phone, internet, and TV selling pie {*ka-ching*}
Tell me the type of pie it is, that's your vision buying it
Don't bother with hello, just say buy/bye

[Chorus]

[N*E*R*D]
Here we go, here we go
Uhh, uhh
Hello, how are you-ah?
Just stopped a second on my cruiser
Nice to meet ya, wanna recruit ya
To the muffin girls of the future
Let me school ya, and renew ya
(Free your mind~!) Hallelujah
First I move ya, then go through ya
When I do ya

[Chorus] - "here we go"

[Outro]
ALL MY MUFFINS!
Revolution
Liberation
Hm-mmm-hmmmm {*3X*}
