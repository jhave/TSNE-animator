[Planet Asia]
It's the professional [3x]
Easy now, easy now, easy now
The Architecht-Planet Asia collaboration
Yo I speak in ghetto star gallactics
Reach passes teach the masses
What they need to teach in classes 
Bout these fascist self-maskin wealth bastards
I'm way beyond your sixty-thousand entries of speech
My rhymes million man march over beats
Architecht remarkable, we drop the hotness
Dirty hundred-thousand dollar locksmith
Open your conscience
I sneak preview for the evil infiltratin information
Restricted inside the sector
Even if you had a hieroglyphic booby-trap detector
You still couldn't detect
The threat, you best respect my cold to kill nigga debts
I build wit wise guys
Gods and earth, broads and flirts
Frauds, dirt hustlin street niggas that walk they dogs
If I act right, I could probably make black people unite
But some people think that I'm wrong and some people think that I'm right
Deluxe one, be back in seconds though
Show me some love for these acts
My man G-Love just hit me off wit a scratch, it's the professional

"Rebel to America" [Nas] 7x

[Planet Asia]
First off, I stays flamed in my membrane
When I  burst off axis, I shake the earth off
I rush my opponents, and clutch moments
My manufacturing's happening
I keeps it crackin-ing
You know the clock, stop askin-ing why
I got more styles than 
One hundred ninety six million nine hundred and forty thousand
Miles of rhymes pile
Call me the time traveller wit the astro
Cuz I'm way past your average savage rapplin assholes
Accurate marks like this, I leave my targets destroyed
Accomplishments of a premeditated language entroy
Since my last jam jumped off, many been stimulated
But I've innovated, 
you couldn't believe what I've received and generated
Much to touch, I lust to bust the unknown
Trust in my zone, symbolize without the dust in my dome
I'm super-nice, top notch
Beyond your ice watch
Material serial killers, connect the wet that ass  for price drop
Now we movin on 'fore the millennium's changed
Strange times they face my journey but I must maintain
I bust veins on microphones because the soldier gotta train
Just like Ford I Mus-tang 
I let my nuts hang, it's the professional
