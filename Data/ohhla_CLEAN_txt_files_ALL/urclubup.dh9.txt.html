Yeah, the ghetto maintenence
It's all about survival now
To switch places, you Da Hol' 9 now
They paid just to marinate us in the pot
And while ask more people in the club in the spot now
And urbody movin like they got evicted
Hands in the urr, whole clicks wit they wrists slit
And they fingers lit, in they best kicks
Charms on they necklace, wearin what best fits
Aint nobody tryin to fight or get arrested
It's all about them tellin mo tonight, and 50 cent
It's 5 dime pieces, chocolate reeces,
3 aunties, and 2 nieces, so pledge it
Gon' break it on in for a thurl bread
Lemme see ya do it again, yeah, girl, yeah
Gon' work it like I'm hittin it from behind now
