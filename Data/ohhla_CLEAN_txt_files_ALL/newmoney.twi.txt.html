[Chorus: Mishon]
Girl thats new money right there

Oh Oh Oh

[Twist (Verse 1)]
New money right here
this is Lil Twist and Mishon gear with no fear
cause we eating them haters steady tweeting
top of the game while them suckas steady peakin'
So hush up
yea be quiet when I'm speakin'
big money talk Twizzy F.
the deacon preachin'
Im just takin' off and from them suckas thats leechin'
for instance I'm ballin
them other lil suckas is reachin'
Kinda foul
especially now [?] girls talk about
especially now that I'm legal baby
I'm wildin' out
The young boss ballin babygirl YM the scout
you wanna know if its clout? No doubt
count it out...

[Chorus: Mishon]

[Twist (Verse 2)]
This how money really feel
never slowing down
none cash [?]
can I right to have a bill
and me I'm just a chef tryna make another meal
Please hand it over
Young Money Soldier
meditate on cash
Lil Twist doin' yoga
so much green like the kid mixed with ogre
and I'm so paid wonder why they call me broker
Sandy-like smell
thats my black card odour
star on this track
Lil Twist the young yoda
in a minute I'ma have my momma like Oprah
but for now I'm gettin' new money like I told ya...

[Chorus: Mishon]

[Mishon (Bridge) x2]
New money right here
young money right here
old money ova' there
move ova'.
Mo'money

throw money like yea
new money right here it's ova..

[Chorus: Mishon]</pre>
