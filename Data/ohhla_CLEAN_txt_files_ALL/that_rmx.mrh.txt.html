Ohhhh, yeah! It's Cook, Scotty Storch!
And another one (And another one) MC
She's back!  We in the hood now, we in the clubs right now
Yeah! Crack!

[Mariah Carey]
I came to have a party
Up and off the Bacardi
Feelin' so hot tamale
Boy I know you're watching me, so what's it gonna be?
Uh Oh, takin' me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy you got me inspired
Baby come and get it if you're really feelin' me

It's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just makin the most of life

[Chorus]
Everybody is livin' it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
'cause me and my girls on the floor like what
When the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's Like That Ya'll, (That Ya'll), That Ya'll, (That Ya'll)
Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll
It's Like That Ya'll, (That Ya'll), That Ya'll, (That Ya'll)
Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll

You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby come and get it, let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion, Mimi's Emancipation
It calls for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me

Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just makin the most of life

[Fat Joe]
It's Like That's, Ya'll, it's like fat, y'all
Matter of fact, it's Cook Crack, y'all (CRACK!)
My new name is B.B.S.
Cause my shit keep spinnin' like B.B.F.
Soon as the dog 'rive or you see T.S.
on the side of the bosses, probably The Markets
Get on some Ying Yang shit and start whisperin'
(So many mamis is wanted for pickin')
She likes my raps cause my raps the best
And them cats is aight, but not like T.S.
April 26th is "All Or Nothin"
and we gon' get it poppin' with some Storch production

This is my night, (It's my, it's my night!)
No stress, no fights, (No stress)
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears (No tears!), no time to cry
Just makin the most of life

Chorus:
Everybody is livin' it up, (I said, everybody!)
All the fellas keep lookin' at us, (Lookin' at us)
'cause me and my girls on the floor like what
When the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's Like That Ya'll, (That Ya'll), That Ya'll, (That Ya'll)
Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll
It's Like That Ya'll, (That Ya'll), That Ya'll, (That Ya'll)
Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll

[Fat Joe]
It's Like That, Like That Y'all
[Mariah Carey]
Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll
[F.J.] It's Like That, Like That Y'all
[Mariah] Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll
[F.J.] It's Like That, Like That Y'all
[Mariah] Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll
[Crack] It's Like That, Like That Y'all
[Mariah] Like Tha-Tha-Tha-That A-Like That Ya'll

[Fat Joe]
