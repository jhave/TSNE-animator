Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Grieves]
And in come the strings
Playing my patience like a note that I never had the guts to sing
I've been living with your lies
Cause my life don't feel quite right unless I'm swelling from the honeybee sting
And look at what you bring me, girl
Nothing but drama, holding on strong to making me feel your woes
How long can we go until we're nothing but a pile of bones?
Stand tall in the cold, right?
You tell me that it's over
And show me what it's like to have a stomach full of sulfur
And loving you has taught me to keep a hand on the holster
In case I gotta shoot a couple holes
But what the hell do I know, huh
Yeah, I don't know shit unless I'm hanging off the curve of your lips
I've been looking for an angel like you since the devil in me
Made it obvious it doesn't exist

[Chorus: Grieves + Budo]
How, how will I figure this out?
Undertow dragging you down
Beneath my comfort zone
Where that love I gave you drowned
I'm freaking out
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away

[Verse 2: Grieves]
I'm into the fake smiles
Walking 'round like a stray child
Trying to find a quiet place to sleep
I don't know if you can feel it in the air when you step into the street
But I've been finding it a little hard to breathe
And look at what you brought me, girl
Nothing but pain
Spending my money for a walk in the rain, I'm drained
And never wanted this to be the outcome
When I can never trust you and all I get is "how come?"
Why, after everything I gave you
You can share it with a stranger every time I went away
I've been lied to before girl
I see it in your face that you don't care about the broken heart I taste
But what the hell do I know?
I know the world will go blind if I open up the cage of my mind
I've been running from an angel like you
Since the devil in me showed me heaven's not a bottom bottom line

[Chorus: Grieves + Budo]
How, how will I figure this out?
Undertow dragging you down
Beneath my comfort zone
Where that love I gave you drowned
I'm freaking out
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

How, how will I figure this out?
Undertow dragging you down
Beneath my comfort zone
Where that love I gave you drowned
I'm freaking out
Speaking with your name in my mouth
And I don't wanna live without you
I just want to clear your clouds
Away, away, away</pre>
