[Intro]
Mike Jones...Mike Jones
Who, Mike Jones
Who, Mike Jones
Ballin Underground...huh

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who is gonna be down with me
And won't clown when I ask you go down on me
About a bitch that ain't quick to clown on me
She shake her ass then she bring me my money
I'm looking for a jazzy, classy broad
In the sheets she's a freaky nasty broad
In the streets she's real and never fraud
If you see her tell her I got some questions man

[Chorus]
Girrrrrrl are you really down with me
Or you loving my currency
Let me know, cause if so I got to pack up and goooo-ooo
Girrrrrrl are you really down with me
Or you loving my currency
Let me know, cause if so I got to pack up and goooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
If you caught me cheatin on you would you give me some hell
If I was locked up in jail would you send me some mail
If I was gone for a while tell the truth will you still..
Send letters, take calls, and pay all of my bills
Mike Jones...If I was broke would you give me some cash
Fresh out the pen would you give me some ass
Without a job can I stay at ya crib
And let me run it like I'm paying the bills
I can't lie, I been peepin yo frame
And I see you can't stop looking at the rocks on my chain
Mike Jones... you all on me cause I got me some fame
Would you still be down if I was broke with no change

[Chorus]
Girrrrrrl are you really down with me
Or you loving my currency
Let me know, cause if so I got to pack up and goooo-ooo
Girrrrrrl are you really down with me
Or you loving my currency
Let me know, cause if so I got to pack up and goooo-ooo

Mike Jones..
Who... Coming Soon</pre>
