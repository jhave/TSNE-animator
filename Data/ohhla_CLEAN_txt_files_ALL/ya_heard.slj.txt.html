(Slim talking)
Gimme a cigarette mane
Gimme a hump. An ol' penitentary hump
Camou'd Down. Ya know I'm penitentary
Look

I'm A real nigga you love to soulja hate, ya heard me
I beat the game and balled in '98, ya heard me
You like the Benz, then fuck it, I navigate, ya heard me
You lay down the law, then I regulate, ya heard me
I spreaded the whole world with some soulja love, ya heard me
And I done negoticated with some thugs, ya heard me
I had to let 'em know bout who run shit, ya heard me
Was bout to be some ol', pull out the gun shit, ya heard me
I tried to dump the game but I'm still affiliated with it, ya heard me
If you want it, I got it, come and get it, ya heard me
One thing for sure, I aint to be bullshitted, ya heard me
Labeled one of the Boss niggas in my city, ya heard me
Them hoes say I think I'm all that, ya heard me
I say "I aint that same ol' nigga from way back", ya heard me
I'm A Tank Dogg, now I'm a nationwide artist, ya heard me
So Boss Bitches be my only target, ya heard me
Got to get that ghetto pussy hea and there, ya heard me
Keep it in the game for the coming up millionaiares, ya heard me
She's a boss bitch, she the boss bitch, i done had her, ya heard me
Pass that ba'dussy to Trenitty and let 'em stab her, ya heard me
When you finish don't pass the bitch back to me, ya heard me
Cause I'm a toss that ho to the whole U.P.T., ya heard me
Keep me undercover, she workin wit somethin
you know how we do it ya heard me
These wannabe ballers pop bubble gum game and shit
so I can chew it ya heard me
These niggas know game gone recognize game, ya heard me
He like hearing himself talk
bout to fuck around and get his ass scorched ya heard me
Bruise blocks and my bitches fill em wit bullet wholes ya heard me
Catch ya gettin yo shine on and put that shit on froze, ya heard me
My army be on all ten toes, ya heard me
Be bout to draw down (BLAWW!!) when the wind blows, ya heard me
That's how niggas I fuck wit be, ya heard me
In the process of ballin, aint a damn thing sweet, ya heard me
I'm A give the game the way it was gave to me, ya heard me
When I first jumped off the porch, way back in the 'G, ya heard me
Remember moms use to serve em two for three, ya heard me
When Roy Lee busted open Willow Street, ya heard me
Now, I don't fuck around with the fuck-around niggas
when they fuck around ya heard me
Drop it like it's hotter
men done double crossed, and ducked around ya heard me
These niggas be asking too many muthafucking questions ya heard me
You a grown boy now, make your own suggestions, ya heard me
You A Hot Boy? No I'm not boy
I'm a convicted felon (No, I'm not), ya heard me
Three times loser elgible for the triple bailing, ya heard me
So fuck you, and how you feel 'bout my situation, ya heard me
The world revolves around nothing but soulja hating, ya heard me
My niggas be tweeking when they wanna hear some of this real shit, ya heard me
That camouflaged in the dark is making a nigga kill shit, ya heard me
Now tell me the fuck you know that i was coming, ya heard me
Or I'm from Uptown so I love stunting, ya heard me
You got me fucked up with my people though, ya heard me
No matter how we coming we creepin low, ya heard me
Ain't nothing under a 4 4, ya heard me
Uptown niggas got artillery fa sho, ya heard me
I said I'm just running it to ya soulja to soulja, ya heard me
Fuck no a nigga ain't made me change my name to Soulja, ya heard me
From Magnolia to Soulja Slim was a power move, ya heard me
I'm a real soulja, now I done paid my dues, ya heard me
I'm like a veteran, I sit back in a rocking chair, ya heard me
Put it out on paper with the smell of doulshia in the air, ya heard me
I said I'm a holler at ya'll later in the game, ya heard me
Stay away from that dope playa, and stack yo change, ya heard me
I said I'm a holler at ya'll later in the game, ya heard me
Stay away from that dope playa, and stack yo change, ya heard me
