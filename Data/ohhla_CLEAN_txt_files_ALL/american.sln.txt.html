[Slaine]
Goes a long way
Yeah
I went from...
Irrelevant to villain; now you know what I'm about
to where my story start from and how the fuck it come about
Where'd I get my heart from? Defiance in my arteries
There's giants in my neighborhood, the violence is a part of me
Silencers on shotties while Illuminatis eyein me
The future's in my palm, this is who it is that I will be
It's intuitive probably, I just knew that it gotta be
My come down and paranoia's like I'm through with a robbery
I came through with the mob with me, my brothers are gangsters
For real fuck the pinstripe suits, we shoot to kill
I ain't no guinea drivin around in a Coupe De Ville
I'm an Irish alcoholic starin with the ruthless grill
I've been around the world from the rhymes that my hands wrote
Fiends shootin dope in their veins cause they can't cope
I read the letters from the prisons that my mans wrote
And screamed the pain in my life from my damn throat
Cause I am

[Chorus]
No superstar, no father figure
I keep it simple for you, it ain't hard to figure (OUT~!)
I shouldn't have to scream and shout - to get my point across
When I was young this is what I dreamed about
Crispy Benjamin bills and heroin hey
Code of silence, violence they never could say
Fly hoe suckin me off ev-ery day
Fuck the world, this is just The American Way

[Slaine]
Rosary beads hang from my neck, sixes on my dice repeatedly
with Jesus and Judas at the Last Supper
They both startin to eat at me, I started bogartin the scenery
when nobody believed in me
My friends are OD'in and leavin me; people are pussy
pushin me over the edge perceivin me evilly
Even if I deceivingly mean to be mean, it's all meaningless
And I'll be locked in a 6 by 8 box as a genius
If the genie's comin out to lamp them three wishes
Then I ask first to stop bein so vicious
Remember back when I was broke and cleanin those dishes
for 5 bucks an hour, all I wanted was power
Number two, I wish that I could be understood
It's time to be before I'm six deep under dirt, under wood
Finally, cause I'm a piece of shit, I got plenty people remindin me
I have visions that you gotta be blind to see
My third wish is for my son to be a champion
And see the light when the world's dark and the lamp is dim
He can't be me and thank God that I can't be him
Let him know who loves him, this is what I was then

[Chorus]
