Where's the love
Where's the love
Where's the love
Where

Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

[Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
Hey look kids you need to change your tune
That avenue you traveling unraveling soon
You'll be battling doom but does it matter to you
Worried bout who was laughing at you
Your appearance is more important that whats really real cause here it is
situation's bad not meaning good
A lot be in the hood that got me with nowhere to put
my trust in no discussion
Spontaneous combustion
Lust and greed if you ain't up to speed
You's a duck in need
Cats ain't got enough to eat
So there's bluffs and beef
Chicks up the street
That tricks come to see guns under the sheets
Shells pummel your meat
Forgetting former, still
dude you're sorta chill sitting on bout 40 mill
But his whole quart'll get spilled
Over those sort of deals
That get you sorta killed or up in court looking for appeals

[Barrington Levy]
Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had
Take me away
Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

[Alex Karpranos]
So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

[Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
Yo what up fam
You don't know who I am
Last week you was acting like you was my man
But you wasn't hey
Served you're purpose dog
At the end of the day
Is it worth it all
Immersed in all the worth the world got to offer
But perpetrating proper like nothing can stop ya
Can't even trust my doctor she in it for profit
And everybody looking for some kind of profit
Situation mad toxic my man got hit
Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topic chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian, European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

[Barrington Levy (Alex Karpranos)]
Yes the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had
(Take me away)
Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world

Cause the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

[Del Tha Funky Homosapien]
If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he saw for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel and snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the hate cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relaxing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

[Barrington Levy (Alex Karpranos)]
The worlds gone bad we've lost the love we had
(Take me away)
Yes the world's gone bad we've lost the love we had

[Alex Karpranos]
So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

[Barrington Levy]
Cause the world's gone crazy
Even though love no more
Show Love
Show Love
Show Love
Show Love
Show Love
Show Love
Cause the world's gone bad</pre>
