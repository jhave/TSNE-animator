[Bridge - Juicy J] x2
Rob one of these cowards, tell them D-boys to drop that
Rob one of these cowards, tell them D-boys to drop that
Show up at yo' house, tell them D-boys to drop that
Show up at yo' house, tell them D-boys to drop that

[Chorus]
Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya
Get-Get that up off (nigga you know what this is)
Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya
Get-Get that up off (nigga you know what this is)
Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya
Get-Get that up off (nigga you know what this is)
Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya
Get-Get that up off (nigga you know what this is)

[Verse 1]
I's a big black nigga wit' a big black gun
Fo' snaps 'cross ya head and the blood gon' come
Some'll run, but'll get flipped off, by the sawed off
Slugs to his knees like a pitbull gnawed off
Hauled off, nothin' but the goods my fair hood
Niggaz be on blow all night, like werewolves
Prowlin', bitin' at yo' pockets like the howlin'
Shoot you in the foot, grab cheese, get on downin'
Loungin', on marijuana leaf, free based-ed'll
Run up on ya fast, no mask, bare faced-ed
Fired off the glock, snatched loot, then ska-ted
Shells wiped down, the police couldn't trace it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Stackin' me, up a money scheme, robbin' a fool
Murder rate, get away, but, that, ain't the move
Long as he, drop the green, then I'm-ma stay cool
Connect the dots, if ???, then I'm lettin' loose
Niggaz play these tough guys like they wanna rum-ble
Knowin' that they mama's boys in this ghetto jun-gle
Hot skillet, wit' them toys mayne, we never hum-ble
Buck shot, to ya dome, don't you make a mum-ble
Brains hangin' out'cha head, people lookin' "wowzers"
It's a bystander, put the tone, in my trousers
So that he, couldn't see, sight, he, couldn't handle
Ain't 'cha birthday but I'm blowin' out'cha candles

[Chorus]
