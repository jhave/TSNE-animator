[Intro]
Burrr! It's Young BURRR~!
Ay, "The State vs. Radric Davis"
It's still Gucci
And we wasted! Huh

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it (wasted!)
Livin life high, every day clique wasted (wasted!)
Sippin on purple stuff, rollin up stanky (wasted!)
Wake up in the mornin, ten o'clock drankin (wasted!)
Party party party let's all get wasted (wasted!)
Shake it for me baby girl, do it butt naked (wasted!)
I'm so wasted, she so wasted (wasted!)
Tell the bartender send me twenty more cases

[Gucci over beginning of Chorus]
Whassup man? Birdman in the building
My boy Weezy
Jadakiss, Gucci!
... wasted!

[Gucci Mane]
My alias is Gucci Mane, my name is Radric Davis (who?)
If you take the time to step in front my shine, that time is wasted (wow)
See I don't got time to waste, 'less I waste it with the crew
Your girl drunk, she dropped it low and waste Crist' all over my shoes
(Well damn!) Back to the bass (back to, back to, back to) man I'm racist
Though I'm not my Range Caucausian plus my goons smoke like Jamaicans
You hot but hatin on me you sleepy; Gucci ain't hot? Homeboy you trippin
Still concealin coke in my car, so so yo' kinfolks gon' keep drippin
I'm movin that 'caine like I'm movin my Range
Don't soil my name just step up yo' game
I'ma leave this game same way that I came
Cain't waste my breath no need to explain
Baby girl I wasted it on my bracelet (burrr)
Didn't wanna walk through we maded it
This Wasted Remix with Baby, Wayne
and 'Kiss and I cremated it (GU-CCI~!)

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Ahh! Rock star lifestyle might not make it
President got him in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it said right now
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Penn &amp; Teller Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
South beach, Miami ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video, and the women want that cameo
I just want them pantyhose and I'm higher than Geronimo
And I got them tools tell them boys to get mechanical

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
D-Block! AHHHH! Yo
Rock star lifestyle might not make it (uh-uh)
Wasted, just performed "We Gon' Make It" (yeah)
Bitches get naked off the stones in the bracelet (haha)
Said you got coke, I brought a fiend along to taste it (uhh)
Money come fast now, we ain gotta chase it (nah)
Kush got a nigga feelin like he in The Matrix
Hennessey, Patron, Grey Goose, Aces (yeah)
Alcohol, tobacco, firearm cases (ATF)
Duffle bag double up, big, faces (yes)
Tony Montana shit, crib, spacious (yes)
Futuristic automobiles, spaceships (ha)
Jadakiss laced it, the remix, "Wasted"

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
Uptown, yeah nigga
Shinin like chandeliers
Big money make a pearl handle with two clips
Cash Money, Young Money fly, in new whips
All white pearl, money from the earl
Poppin Dom P, iced out my baby girl
Catch me in the club with my mac and my strap on
Bitches high rollin, white doves gettin they freak on
Get my clap on, get my money on
Shinin all the time, now watch me bring it home
S-so she love me, how we do this?
Maybach, lay back, baby how we do this
Longest jet G4, high to the sky bitch
Mo' money than I've seen, no ceiling bitch

[Chorus] - 1/2 {*echoes at end*}</pre>
