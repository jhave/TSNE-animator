[Lil Wayne]
Uh-huh.. yeah.. uhh!
Skinny-ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggaz keep trippin they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands, my gang poppin niggaz
Smoke that kush and not that Reggie for you name droppin niggaz
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "bad bitches only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get merked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "pew"
Got-got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah, all my niggaz nuts, and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce
Yeah I talk that shit, bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast
Welcome to the murder show I am the motherfuckin host
They call me Weezy F baby yes I do the fuckin most
I'm at they throats until they choke, the God has spoke I need a smoke
Wait... now let it breath to 'em, yeah

[Chorus]
It go, all these bitches, and niggaz still hatin
I used to be a baller, but now I'm Bill Gatin
Got a list full of problems, I'll tend to 'em later
Yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her
Man all these bitches, and niggaz still hatin
Yeah I used to be a baller, but now I'm Bill Gatin
Got a list full of problems, I'll tend to 'em later
Yeah life is a bitch, but I appreciate her man
Yeah

[Lil Wayne]
It go dark-ass shades, I can't see them haters
Now eat these fuckin bullets don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shawn White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I donât fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F baby and the F is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch, with the diamond faces
Still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth I cannot make out what you tryin to say
And if they want a war, then tell them motherfuckers bombs away~!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Let it breath to 'em...
Just let it breath to 'em, yeah, hehe
Young, Young Mula baby {*3X*}
...
Just let it breath to 'em</pre>
