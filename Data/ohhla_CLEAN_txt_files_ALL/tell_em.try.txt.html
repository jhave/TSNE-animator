Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, hey
There's a lot of people out there
This the fricky-fricky under the track
There's a lot of people out there
Fricky-fricky-fricky-fricky-fricky, under they track, ow, tell 'em

[Timbaland]
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, V-A, G-A
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, yo
Tell 'em it's on, yo, say what, say what
Tell 'em it's on

[Pastor Troy]
I'm the ?, the A-T-L with the flow
Keep it coming, got the A-K under the doe
Why you runnin' talkin' mad but you ain't mad
Cause I'm bad, the P-T billy, the bad ass
I heard you clappin' your jaw, talkin' bout the A-T-L
How you got it on lock, boy stop
Cause I'm reppin' the city, East Point to ?
I come from the city that don't play that
I done came back with a song of my own
Timbaland on the matter feel, tell 'em it's on
P-T I'm a cruise, I'm a cruise, I'm a cruise control
I'm nothin' till the motherfuckin' music slows
I got some killers in Carolinas, some killers in Virginia
Some millers off in 'bama and I'm not to mention Atlanta
Just remember that you ain't got nothing on lock
So make a nigga set your clock, it's P-T

[Timbaland]
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, V-A, G-A
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh, yo
Tell 'em it's on, yo, say what, say what, yo
Tell 'em it's on

[Pastor Troy]
? ? I'm a tell 'em it's on
Talkin' shit like them gangsta, sweet-as cologne
I roll on in the ? with the quickness
So southern Pastor, can I get a witness
It's fitness the way that I work out on a track
Got the gat, I'm a leave them niggaz right where they at
Matter fact, anybody wanna get some, then fuck they
Tell them others where I come from, the letter A
When I came through already knew that it was on
The misrepresentation of my home
We're never Zone 3, we're never Zone 4
And if it's in the hood you better not go
Cause niggaz in the hood you better not see
The D, the S and then the G-B
It's my hometown, I am crowned as the boss
Don't make a nigga break ya off, tell 'em it's on

[Timbaland]
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, V-A, G-A
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, yo
Tell 'em it's on, yo, say what, say what, yo
Tell 'em it's on

[Pastor Troy]
No apologies, I don't need it
Written lyrics, homeboy, and read it, read it
I got the big, buggle up and down
This for all y'all monkey ass niggaz in Atlanta
Talkin' bout Collipark and New Georgia
Give a little money and hang with new folks
And here come back to the hood open arms
This is not a kidnap-a-thon
But where I'm from the real stay down
Live and die and took up the A town
If you think long at me you think wrong
Nothin' else to say homeboy but it's on

[Timbaland]
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, V-A, G-A
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now
Tell 'em it's on, say what, say what
Tell 'em it's on, fricky fricky oh

[Timbaland]
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now
Tell 'em it's on, I bet you didn't see it coming, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, V-A, G-A, oh
Tell 'em it's on, so what you gotta say now, oh
Tell 'em it's on, say what, say what, oh
Tell 'em it's on, fricky fricky, ooh

[Timbaland]
