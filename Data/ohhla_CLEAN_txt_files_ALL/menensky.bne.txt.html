(Bizzy) 
Menensky-muthafuckin'-Tribe mobbin' on muthafuckas 
See, it's like the Menensky Mob, see 
They used to be the ones who was fightin' the slave master 
So the people didn't go on the boat, you know what I'm sayin'? 
B-L-A-C-K-H-O-L-E 
(Shit, smoke, can a black man get some paper up in this place, man?) 
(But I'm a black man in a white man's world) 
Fuck this shit 

Oh, Menensky (Menesky!) mobbin' 
Menensky mobbin', nigga 
Oh, Menensky (Menesky!) mobbin' 
Menensky mobbin', nigga 
Oh, Menensky (Menesky niggas around the muthafuckin' world) mobbin' 
Menensky mobbin', nigga 
Oh, Menensky (Menensky!) mobbin' 
Watts niggas with problems 
And the ?? thugs are from the projects 
smokin' chronic with love with the gun in the glove 
Nigga run, nigga run, nigga run 
Menensky mobbin' muthafucka! 

(Bizzy) 
Menensky mobbin' muthafucka with Watts niggas 
In Cali ready to riot and rally around 
brawlin' in my back door ready for warfare, declare like my Capo 
?? Gettin' wacko and smokin' tabacco 
Yeah my niggas with tatoos, a sack of crack, and I'll pat you down too 
My voodoo with that flip flop flow, don't make me blast you 
Right past you with the mask on, bitch 
Sippin' the passion, get it twisted mister bitchafied 
This introduction bustin' 
I'm bumpin' properly, property of my poverty, God we need a job 
Clock me in my Saab, Menesky mobbin', bobbin' and weavin', no pron 
You niggas' sloppy, don't copy, get popped, nigga don't jock me--you're raw 

(Chorus) 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
(I'm tryin' to get high muthafucka') 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
(You're over here trippin' and shit, man what the fuck's wrong with you?) 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
Man, we mobbin' on niggas 
You niggas can't fuck with me 
Watts niggas with problems 
And the ?? thugs are from the projects, 
We smokin' chronic with love with the gun in the glove 
Nigga run, nigga run, nigga run 

(Bizzy) 
Hock my Benz 
Fuck a bitch for the babies and Christmas gifts 
When I'm lifted ridin' down the strip: same niggas, the same shit 
Workin' the graveyard shift back on Brackland where the broads flipped like a 
movie 
And my raw dogs trip in the line of duty 
Look at the groupies, holler, holler, from the hoopties and my Lucciano's 
groovy 
Judge and jury my movie confuse me with those other thugs 
On a high speed chase say 
Say don't swerve in the mud, and the tight weed taste like love 
We thuggish in Columbus slums, suburbs, muthafucka word 
Sift through my proberbs 
And I heard that we're rockin' up birds 
When out in Florida and CaliforniaNew York, Little Pomona, shookin' soldiers 
Smokin' doja, composure suppose 

(Chorus) 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
(Menensky muthafuckin' mobbin') 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
(Watts niggas. With Watts with muthafuckin' problems, c'mon, c'mon) 
Oh, Menensky mobbin 
Watts niggas with problems 
And the ?? thugs are from the projects 
We smokin' chronic with love with the gun in the glove 
Nigga run, nigga run, nigga run 

(Bizzy) 
Born to be ?, crushin' crucial, not the conflict, and b-b-b-bomb shit 
I'm on the chronic chokin' bubonic, harmonic 
Eyes blood-shot red, loc'd out like Eazy--he dead, surprise 
Fuck the Feds, fuck the bitches instead 
Step in the bedroom, I'm about to get some head soon 
She's wet in the womb 
I'm kinda nast and mad at ya, but boom, it's till the sun up 
What up, done up, shut up, it's all in the game, it shouldn't be painful 
Well why the fuck I feel so much pain stressin' my brain?   
Let the train pass, look at the sky, play, laugh 
With visions back in May on how I played dad 
Don't say that and criticize yourself, I'm'a tell the truth 
Roof nigga from glock-glock, no truce, the punk enemies deadly 
And shoot if you wanna   
Smoke water, but you can die, bitch, it's normal 
Eventually your number's called through the portal and muthafucka fall 
Here's a quarter to call your dogs 

Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
(Nigga, Menensky mobbin' world-muthafuckin'-wide on these hoes, c'mon!) 
Oh, Menensky mobbin' 
Oh, Menesky mobbin', Watts niggas with problems 
And the ?? thugs are from the projects 
Whoo!   
We're smokin' chronic with love and the gun in the glove 
Nigga run, nigga run, nigga run 
For sure   
(Menensky niggas mobbin' world wide 
Are you down with the Menensky Tribe? Getready for war) </pre>
