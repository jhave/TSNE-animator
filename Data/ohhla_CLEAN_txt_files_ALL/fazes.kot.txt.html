Y2KMK, why not y'all
Suburban Noize Records with that 2000 sound
(??)

Daydreamin' fazes, time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreamin' fazes, I yes I

Daydreamin' fazes, life elevated
Chillin' in the back of the bus gettin faded
I blaze all hell with my dogs all day
Feelin' the rage with the blood on stage

Too many knuckle heads fuckin' with my business
Soakin' up my 'fluence can I get a witness
Seven days deep in a smoked out haze
D-Loc rolled the T, Daddy X is in a daze

Smoke don't fight it, I watch your eyes
Surrounded by abuse and our boy is getting high
Presidential lies, keep on wondering why
We got the sound that you can't deny

Daydreamin' fazes, time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreamin' fazes, I yes I

Lost in the world of distrust and greed, there's no time to blink,
So we plant our seeds, got no time to think
Always do what's real, speak what we feel, and pass the (??)
You know, shit still ain't changed, Richter got game
Need to try and contain from the truth and refrain
If you don't know I'ma let it be known, I be in the penetration zone
That's some whole other shit, and I hold my own
D-Loc's the kinda kid with the bomb homegrown

Daydreamin' fazes, time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreamin' fazes, I yes I

What a long strange trip it's been
Sippin' life from a 40 ounce bottle of sin
Daydreamin' fazes walls caving in
What a long strange trip it's been

Life goes fast, like a blunt it don't last
Like flash to the past on the porch outside
Thinkin' of old times, sittin' around gettin' high
Daydreamin' fazes, time goes by

Anything you got we gonna put it to the test
Any strain, it's all the same
Call me the deep cess profess,
In the (??) high as fuck, amazing blacklights (??)
D-Loc and Johhny Richter straight BSO!

Daydreamin' fazes, time goes by
That's what happens when you get high
Head's always cloudy, words is lies
Daydreamin' fazes, I yes I</pre>
