[Intro: Twista]
It's a tight Mike production
Yeah, it's Twista y'all
Straight from the Chi, reppin the Midwest

And you know I give y'all that street shit
But I gotta do one for the jukers and the jackers
I'm from the west side of the Chi
Let me see if you can get with this
 
[Twista]
When I meet a ho I gotta hold her

When the Twista get her in the bed after I get the head

Fine in the face and your booty lookin juicy

Uhh, a pimp like me just wanna work that bitch hard
Look me see you take it from the top of the pole
