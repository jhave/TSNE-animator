[Verse 1 - Pressure]
It's the calm before the storm that sends that feeling to my frontal lobe
As thunder roams the sky at night I seek shelter yet run alone
The rain soaks me to the bone, assisted by the winter wind
(The chill is blisterin'), my patience for this world begins to thin
Handed in by heavy clothes, the hail rains heavy blows
Heavens chose to endeavour the weather, my very foe
Can barely close my frozen hand around my own fucking dream
With each breath, puff and steam, the night it cools my blood stream
The freeze gripping my chest, my knees strip into flesh
My screams echo through the night but no-one's listening unless
they seeing eye to eye, but it's like the fog slowly buries me
They light their lights then scar my vision, shows me momentarily
the edge of the roadside, thanks to cars I'm covered in spray
Then I try and hitch a ride, the traffic moves the other way
Then I ain't see the sun for days, just like my lifes energy
I stagger on relentlessly and see something ahead of me
I cramp by shelter, I'd take a life for some space
And knowin' lightning never strikes twice in one place
I fight for a taste of the dry life, better known as the high life
But I'm expelled into the winds and that's heralded the story of my life
I keep on through the raging storm and all these distorted sounds
Thoughts of how I'm getting mine no matter how watered down
I'm quarter drowned, quarter frozen, quarter lost, quarter fucked
Man it's been raining for days and I think I'm wet enough
Enough, treading water just to be the next man's shelter
Enough, drowning victims even though you know I felt ya
I've got enough problems of my own, find a sanctuary
within the eye of the storm, I feel the calm anger me

*Muffled*
Storm, storm clouds gathering on the coast...
Don't give into emotion, be strong, be strong

[Verse 2 - Suffa]
I walk through life like a drunk in a bar
I no longer see the light that comes from the stars
Cause clouds hang overhead like paintings in the gallery
And rain pats on my head, voices in my head sing "Battle me"
I challenge the sky, and the sky spits and runs
So the moistures at my heals and I run quick and fast
From the mystic dancer, that is the weather the pattern
It's either clapping, attacking - a peaceful night can never happen
Weather rains for days and leaves you soaked to the bone
I exhale steam like I was smoking a bone
I try coping alone but the rain goes through the night
And then opens my dome like raining blows in a fire
I've been inside for days, I've been trapped in the south side
Cause the fogs a haze and the sky's a blaze outside
I put in my headphones and listen to some Daddy O
To try escape the drone of rain pissing on my patio
But the rain always comes back, never stops, never fades
Banging on my window like cops, in a raid man
What, would I trade, for sunlight I feel like grabbing these
And knockin' myself out, relieving Suffa from this cavalry, ah
The winds are wailing, even howling at my shutter's 
Gutters overflowing, blowing the wind, it whispers 'Suffa...'
I wish another day would come and bring the sun in tow
Cause this storm's a raging ocean and I'm sucked in by the undertow
The thunder throws a frightening blow, the lighting glows and disappears
It appears, that it'll be days before the fog and mist will clear
Sticks and logs and missiles here, watch that they don't take a
eye out, cry out - and get drowned out by mother nature, nature uh

*Muffled*
Storm, storm clouds gathering on the coast...
Don't give into emotion, be strong, be strong
