[Intro: Michel'le]
Yo, this is the number one bitch
Where y'all know, comin' straight from the center of Compton
Radio Station B.G. K.O. - 2456 on your dail
Where we play all the Dope Shit

Uh, real Compton City Gs ----&gt; B.G. Knocc Out

[Hook: Eazy-E As a Radio Host]
Yo, this is Eazy-mothafuckin-E 
And you're listin' to the Radio Station B.G. K.O.

[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rollin' in my hood, twistin' on them Dees 
Age ninteen and I'm pushin' straight kis
Me and my BG's, baby gangsters
Puttin' it down right because we don't allow pranksters
Girls come through, lookin' by and all fine
But I know in their mind, all they see is dollar signs
So back off, yo, I might met to a hoe
Wait til night fallen and take her to the Mo-Mo (Motel)
Blaze up some Indo, sip a little a Eight Ball
5 minutes later, I'm all up in them Drizzos
Knockin' down them Wizzos, with my Bull Doggs up
When I'm ready to switch I'll tell the girl to bend over
Do a little smackin, trippin' and then I'm through
Tell her yeah give me a call sometimes ?? roll around two
It's now 2 O'clock and she hit me on the hip
But I can't call her back cause I'm tryin' to stack my grip
The trick might trip the next time that she see me
Messin' around to get her ass slapped by the B.G.
I'm not the women beater but still I ain't givin' 
Up a damn thing, yeah trick, that's how I'm livin'

[Chorus: DJ Yella]
K.O. lettin' you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in '94
Yeah, let it flow
K.O. lettin' you know
That you can't live with this 
That's how livin' in '94
ooooohhh yeaahh

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Before the brother was rappin, the brother was straight robbin'
Gafflin' up, my name was a part time jobbin'
I did it cause that's all I knew
I dropped out the school in the 8th grade
Doin' drive-bys with the 12 gauge
Livin' foul as a child back in the day
Until I find out, that the crime does not pay
At age thirteen I went to juvenile hog
And on the inside they treat the brother like a dog
So being locked down really ain't the lick
They get to tell the brother once you sleep don't sniff
But forget that, I'd rather be free out in the streets
Gettin' lay everyday and don't have to beat my niece
Be gatherin' to sneak with E, when and where I wanna
Hangin' with the homies drinkin' 40's on the corner
Now I'm on wax, kickin' straight gangsterizm
Lettin' fools know in '94, cause yo, that's how I'm livin'

[Chorus: DJ Yella]
K.O. lettin' you know
That you can't live with this 
That's how livin' in '94
Yeah, for '94 y'all
K.O. lettin' you know
That you can't live with this 
That's how livin' in '94
Awww noooo, yeaahh

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Now I see the small delight in just bangin'
Goin' state to state on the plane entertainin'
The world, rockin' shows, knockin' hoes, everywhere I go
Everybody knows K.O.
And I said: it feels good to make it out the hood
And be some body like I heard always said I would
But though I'm still starvin, no more drive-byin'
The streets get worse but still the brother keeps tryin'
To be the best I can, with no time to waist
And since I went straight, I keep the smile on my mamma's face
Now I'm a father, I strap a little harder
June 19th of 93 out comes my daughter
Sometimes I get a flirt and think about doin' dirt
But I checked myself, and put my focus in her
That's how I'm livin'

[Chorus: DJ Yella w/ Minor Variations]
K.O. lettin' you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in '94
Yeah, that's how I'm livin, y'all
K.O. lettin' you know, yeah
I know you can't live with this, no no
That's how livin' in '94
I let you know, Awww noooo, yeaahh
