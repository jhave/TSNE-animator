Song:   What I've Done
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

In this farewell
There's no blood
There's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done

[Chorus]
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done!

[Chorus]

What I've done
Forgiving what I've done</pre>
