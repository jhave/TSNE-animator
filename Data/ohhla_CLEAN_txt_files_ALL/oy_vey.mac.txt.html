Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
One day I'm a be so rich and I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch
I'm a have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

[Verse 1]
Hey, walkin' out the crib with a smile on my face
Super hero, utility belt tied around my waist
Tryna be next, quicker than the reflex
Chainin' down in keywest
Every class recess
Na-na-na-na-na,
My pockets deeper than your v-necks
Hoes up on my dick 'cause I look like Ryan Seacrest
I'm buzzin' like a bees nest
Stay up out my beez wax
My people like to party so I'm formin where the freaks at
Livin' out my dream, people still sleepin'
The best night of your life, but we do this every weekend
Life couldn't get better, I hope it lasts forever
When I spit my verse they gon' remember every letter like
Day in, and day out
We tryna get this cake now
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces

[Chorus]
One day I'm a be so rich that I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch
I'm a have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow

[Verse 2]
Hey, they seem surprised, with the look that's in their eyes
How I could be myself and do away with their disguise
I advise, homies to stay homies
Few people you can trust, so the OG's told me
When I was just a shawty strummin' my guitar
Playin' my piano, had a band in my garage
Sittin' down with the homies, playin' playstation
Tryna find a crib where the parents on vacation
Hey, why you grillin' put a smile on your face bitch
We takin' shots all around gettin' wasted
Came a long way from freestyling in my basement
Show some love to the people that I came with like
Day in, and day out
We tryna get this cake now
You think you fly just wait until I pull my cape out
Hey, life is good don't waste it
We ha-ha-ha-ha laughin' at the looks on they faces

[Chorus]
One day I'm a be so rich and I can buy my moms a house
Have a livin' room with a big TV and I'm a still sleep on the couch
I'm a have 'em like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow
It seems I'm gettin' fresher every time they turn around like
Oy vey, holy cow, oh my god, wow</pre>
