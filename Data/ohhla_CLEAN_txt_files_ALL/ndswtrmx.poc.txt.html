[South Park Mexican {*dialing*}]
Man, let me call this boy, man
Hey, your boy doing bad

[Juan Gotti] Dope House Records
[SPM]        What up, Gotti
             Say man, I need a ride to the weed house man
[Juan Gotti] Fa sho', homeboy, I'll be right there

[South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet
With short red hair
And when a sweet
I need to be there
I need a sweet
Hear what I say
A killer sweet
To get me through the day

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet
So I can blow
A forty dollar sweet
Full of indo
I got a buzz
Uh hun, that's why I does
I put diamonds on my daughter's hairbrush
In this times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To get us out the rain
Jealousy
A little greed
I been thinking
Of what I need
Purple leaves
With crystal flakes
If it's not hydro, please get that out my face
Two-twenty five for a half of O-Z
In the club, with my homeboy Joey T
My science project was in the school arena
Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner
Ya mon

Chorus: South Park Mexican
I need a sweet
With short red hair
And when a sweet
I need to be there
I need a sweet
Hear what I say
A killer sweet
To get me through the day
Help me out
I need a sweet
I really do
I need a sweet
Can I smoke a few
I need a sweet
To get me right
I need a sweet
Everyday and everynight

[E-Dubb]

             We blazing a pound, from the west side, down to the south
             Three buds, no seeds, that's what I'm talkin' about
             We smoke cal til ya black out
             I'm in the zone and I don't wanna come back out
             Hell nah
             Let's all get, high

             I want a super red hair with green eyes
             Til I die, I'm a get my smoke on
             And write a song when I'm hittin' a bong
             All day long
             Ain't nothin' wrong with that
             And if you ever wanna chill, better bring a sack
             It's like that
             You'll get high off contact
             Don't ever let me catch ya dippin' in my chrome bat {Come on, Beesh}
[Baby Bash]  I need an

             If you smoke with Baby Beesh, don't tell the police
             Cause I'm on that paper, mayn, that's wrong
             Cal with a sweet and fat O-zone
             If you want that dope
             I got a boat load
             While my girl got my baby momma in a chokehold
             Smoke til my eyes turn Japaneese
             Me and Carlos lit half-a-tree
             Now I don't pimp
             A jigalow
             I blow big indo with my niggaros
             Gotta mouth full of cotton cause I'm off green butter
             Marijuana, mayn, I love her
[SPM]        This some good ass weed, Beesh
[Baby Bash]  Ain't it, though?
             I will not think they'll play this on the radio
             I hope so, I need to pay my rent
             Now split that sweet down the middle, pimp

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican]
Man, that was some good ass weed, bro
I'm feeling good
Uh hun, my name is Los
Uh hun, I'm feeling good
