[Verse 1]
I know what you've been doin [all day]
That level you've persuin' [all day]
The rat race, the paper chase [all day]
You felt the weight, you dealt with hate [all day]
I know you feelin' aggression [all day]
Cuz they askin' too many questions [all day]
You been tryin' to make connections [all day]
You've been dyin' to have a session [all day]
Some homies could just kick it [all day]
Roll up and get lifted [all day]
When on the grind, they got the time [all day]
Get behind, I handle mine [all day]
From needle shuckin' and jivin' [all day]
Stayin' hustlin' and strivin' [all day]
Some homies is nine-to-fivin' [all day]
But off this music you'll be vivin' [all day]

[Hook]
Party cause you been workin' [all day]
And money was on ya mind [all day]
I know you been on the grind [all day]
mmmmmm...Hmm....
Can't be wastin' no time [all day]
The radio gone rewind [all day]
When music is on your mind [all day]
All day.........

[Verse 2]
Needed a home cook meal [all day]
I've been chosen to see my girl [all day]
It's the way that she makes me feel [all right]
Sexin' me with skill [all night]
Daydreamin' about you [all day]
Thinkin' of bein' wit you [always]
Then it's back to workin' [all day]
To make a livin' we earnin' [all pay]
Got me wit this as we travel on this journey [all day]
To overcome trouble if it gets in [our way]
It's been a rough I took enough [all day]
And givin' up, let's live it up [all day]
How we do things, daily routines [all day]
It's an abstract rude thing, make ya music [all day]

[Hook] [x2]
Party cause you been workin' [all day]
And money was on ya mind [all day]
I know you been on the grind [all day]
mmmmm...Hmm..
Can't be wastin' no time [all day]
The radio gone rewind [all day]
When music is on ya mind [all day]
All day...</pre>
