Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow

Uh, Wizzy-wizzy wow

Drop a top to make you say... WOW
Sleep with the top, let that make you say... WOW
Pop in approach, makin' the industry... WOW
I can do a mile in like 20 seconds like... WOW
Pick up a chick and the body's like..WOW
Hit them and ??? throwin' the face was like... WOW
Went to the crib and her mouth dropped like... WOW
Took off her clothes and then
OH-OH there always was trouble

Yo', this girl was so kinky like... WOW
The cranium was crazy, it made me shout... WOW
Touchin' her clothes with her hands and mean...WHILE
She got me in her carpet and sweatin' like... WOW
I can't be greedy, that's not cool like... WOW
Phat expressin' her to my peeps, that's... WOW
Hit up my dawg on a two, he hollered... WOW
He called my cell and said, "I'll be there on the double"

[Chorus]
Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy WOW

I'm with my crew, my niggaz, like... WOW
We all eatin' up bank accounts, it's like... WOW
So many Os, 64s, it's like... WOW
Where we go we go drop our clothes like... WOW
Ice and the chains, it's exotic like... WOW
Different colored diamonds hypnotic like... WOW
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we shuttin' it down
How you likin' me now, I got a new style

Shake your ass, won't you sleep with me now
Wiggle the middle, shake the shit up in the middle
Touch what's really simple, don't get stuck in the middle

I'ma, I'ma fuckin' legend
Keg up to my Os and 7
Any where I go I'm winnin'
Matrix to keep your head spinnin'
You know how hot it is gettin' (Wizzy-wizzy)

Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow
Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow
Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow

Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow
Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow (Wizzy-wizzy)

Stop teasin' me like that, I ain't playin' wit' ya!
I'm layin' wit' ya, but I ain't stayin' wit' ya!
Since you be movin' it like that, think you'll be doin' it like that!
When I be throwin' it at you, will you be bringin' it right back!!
Wizzy-wizz, that's my CONDOM, BITCH!!
She can't cook but she can ride that dick!
Know she ain't smart but she got a nice tits!
She mess around but that still my chick
BIZ-I, IS I off the chain?!
Wizzy-wizzy-wizzy-wizzy wow
Is it things she ain't!
Teddy Riley, Michael Tyler, big trump thang
Million dollars, sunny holler big bucks ma'an
I came to put it down like it's SUPPOSED TO BE!!
They fall up in my verse knowin' it's me!
STAR....LOUD...PROUD...(Wizzy-wizzy)
