[Skit #1: Sample of Old St. Ides TV Commercial]
I got something to say, man, you dig?
I mean you cats been up here rapping 
Ain't saying nothing about the real thing, you know what I mean?
Now, I got something to say, man
The real soul brother.. HEY!!

[King Tee]
It's Friday night, on the streets of L.A.
I'm going out, been hanging around the house all day
So I'll take me a shower, dress like a big daddy
Stop at the Arco, put some gas in my Caddy
Armor on my wheels, shine up my daytons
Check the 12 Gauge, I see jackers just waiting
Filled up my tank, slapped on the Gas cap
Police scooped on front, rolling back

[Skit #2: Police Officer]

(*Sample of Patrol cops sirens*)
When we reach up the corner, put your hands on your head..

[King Tee]
Just because I wear Khakis and a big old poke
I'm either in the gang or either sell dope
So I said what the Hell? - just to show ain't fear ya
Search inside the car, but don't mess up in the interior
And when you all done and everything is cool
You better call Swat cause I'm finna act a fool

Now I'm on the move, a few grand in my pocket
Reached for my phone, plugged it in the socket
So the roam lights, so I dialed up Aladdin
He answered the phone and said "What's up?" I said "What's happenin?"
He said, "Where you been? I said the boys had me jacked
They searched the whole car but they couldn't find the Gat
So if you wanna roll, I'll be there in the Jeepie
So throw on some locs, some silk shirts and some dickies
Stopped at the store to buy me a Cisco
A 40 ounce and some crackers by Nabisco
A pack of (Alcohol Trademark) then I pulled out a $10
Oops! - forgot the Supersacco and Gin
I'm finna act a fool

[Break]

[King Tee]
Now I'm driving down Compton on my way to get Aladdin
Feeling like a pimp 'til my tape started dragging
It's a old tape anyway, it ain't no thing
Pulled it out and slapped in Big Daddy Kane
Got to Aladdin's house then I honked my horn
He said, "When we're coming back?" I said: 6 in the morn'
So he got in the car, looking half dead
So I gave him my Cisco and took the 40s to the head
Now, we're feeling tipsy and we're heading for Watts
Boy, what do we see sitting at the bus stop?
Sexy Susanna, had a butt that kill
Pretty long hair, but they say it's not real
Aladdin yelled (this is fake..) she threw a rock in my glass
So I busted a U, must she broke out fast
Checked around my back but everything was cool
She must have knew the King was out acting a fool, fool

We're finally arrived at the party, been like a jerk
Got out my car, pressed the kit so the alarm would chirp
After that I made my way, I tried not to fall
Couldn't walk a straight line if they let me crawl
Get inide the party, suckers staring at me down
I stared right back, except I stared with the frown
Get in the middle of the floor with my gangster stand
Now, we can either get a love or grap a freaky and go dance
This girl asked me to dance, but I told the freak no
Cause she was on my tip cause of my big gold rope
So she tried a lot of talk, just made a little scene
I said: Listen up! - you dirty old scandalous dope fiend
You're talking to a gangster and I just don't care
About a girl with fake drag, fake eyes, fake hair
Fake clothes, fake nails and all that fake jewelry
All you wanna do is tell your friends that you screwed me
I get nutty, act a fool when I want 
Run up when I'm drunk and I just might stump 
Take your car, your money, your super liquid girl 
Cause my attitude is.. I like to fool on the world
