	"At midday today, some Americans attended memorial services
	 for victims of Tuesday's acts of terrorism.  Thousands
	 gathered at Chicago's Daily Plaza.  Hundreds more looked 
	 on from the windows of surrounding office buildings.  
	 Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill.  
	 On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a 
	 police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted 
	 the flag.  After a minute of silence, church bells rang."

{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
 Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}

[Chorus: repeat 2X *sung*]
No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there

[KRS-One]
Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
on the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days

[Chorus]

[KRS-One]
Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
"But I say, unto you
 Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
 Do good to them that hate you
 And pray for them which despitefully use you
 and persecute you"
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on?  Turn now to Matthew 5:46
"For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
 Do not even the publicans the same?
 And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
 do not even the publicans so?  Be ye therefore perfect;
 even as your FATHER which is in heaven, is perfect.." {*echoes*}</pre>
