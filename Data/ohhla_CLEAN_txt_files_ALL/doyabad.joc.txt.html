[Chorus]
Babe if it's a problem go on let me know
And if it ain't shit, nigga go on let it go
But while it's on my mind, I need to let you know
Them choppers on deck and I ain't afraid to let 'em go
Yea I'll do ya, do ya (do ya bad, do ya bad)
I'll do ya, do ya (do ya bad, do ya bad)
I'll do ya, do ya (do ya bad, do ya bad)
I'll do ya, do ya (do ya bad, do ya bad)

[Verse One]
Is that right?
Let me talk to y'all niggaz one time
You on that dumb shit (dumb shit) ain't wit it man
That's the main reason murders get committed man
It can go down (go down) any minute man
Goon squad jump out, that black on black mini-van
So you better be (be) quick and on your toes
Where them chopper bullets stop, nobody knows (knows)
Babies cryin, niggaz dyin all over the place (place)
Momma cryin cause there's blood all over her face
This is not a game (game) this is not a test (test)
Swiss cheese your brain, mayne you'll be laid to rest (laid to rest)
I'll bust your head (BWAH) ask questions later (later)
Throw the deuces, sayanora to you haters

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
That's right, talk to 'em, ay look
I don't know your bitch (bitch) she don't know me either (shit)
I suggest you keep it movin if you wanna keep her
You don't want these problems (oh no) that's a bad idea
Machete'll have your ass runnin like diarrhea
Nobody move (move) nobody get hurt, shit
If I pull that tool, er'ybody hit the dirt, look
This could be avoided only if you keep your cool nigga
Act like you grown instead of still in middle school nigga
You don't really want this beef bruh
Put in back in the freezer
You'll freeze up when I pull the heat
Then squeeze {*BLAM*} from the knees up
This is not a game (game) this is not a test (test)
Slow your roll (roll) or you'll be laid to rest

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Yeah; I'll sell you wet dope just to make it weigh right
Call them boys, set you up in broad daylight
Yeah I'll bang your bitch (your broad) I'll do you bad
Nine months later, now she screamin you're the dad
If you lose your bump, say I never found the shit (nah I ain't seen it)
If I owe ya guap', pay your ass with counterfeit (yeah here you go)
Oh yea I'll flex ya nigga (flex ya nigga) don't think I cain't
(Don't think I cain't) Have my broad put some suger in your gas tank
Cut your brake line (line) slash your back tire (tire)
When you crank your car (car) your engine catch fire (OH SHIT!)
Now I don't know (know) what you've been told (told)
But these are brief descriptions, of how this hook go

[Chorus]</pre>
