[Intro: Angie Martinez]
{*laughing}
Whoo! Cool &amp; Dre baby
Oh! {*laughing}
It's club but it's still sexy
Hey! life is good
Yea, uh, uh, uh, yo
What is that?

[Angie Martinez]
What's that sound?
If you outside the club, and your joint c'mon
You just pop the truck
Pull the car up and the line is packed, and you far
You tired a' waiting, you  better be catch a charge like
"Move bitch, get out the way", flash the bouncer to get out a payin'
And that sound make you wanna get on stage
Oh, you gotta' "move dem thangs"
Beat change, it's a Cool &amp; Dre thing
That'll move your thang thang, remove your ring change the sound
Get your jewels all sweated up, the booze is deaded up
Anything goes bring it back, if you just catchin' up
The sound coming outta' the club - that's wassup!
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
Movin' aroung, DJ Keith - I need that sound (da-mn)

[Chorus: Angie and Missy]
That new shit, that hot shit
Make you move shit - what's that sound?
That move crowds, that new sound
Make you can kick down - who's that chick?
That's Angie, them bambi's
Screamin' Angie - what's that sound?
[Missy] And this Missy gettin' tipsy off the wiskey

[Missy Elliott]
2002 be sceered, cause I'm runnin' this shit this year
Haters 'n haters you better be clear
Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear
What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South
Is a drug-drop, c'mon check me out
Ain't nobody does it easy-seezy
And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (owwww!)
God damn, what's that sound?
Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down
I'm no punk, but a killa like Cam
Get on the flo', yes yes mam
When I show up the club get cram
Insecure bitch watch yo man!
Me and Ang like butter on toast
I don't mean to boast, but we do
[Angie] I need that - yea

[Chorus]

[Angie Martinez]
Hello-oh? oh that's my ears ringing
I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch - we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home - I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you wanna get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get.. and that's DJ Keith - playin' that sound (I need that)

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
