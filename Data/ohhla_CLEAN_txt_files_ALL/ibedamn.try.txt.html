Cause I be damn (what) (3x)

(Lil Pete)
Cause I be damn
If my niggas don't be riding them vogues
Cause I be damn
If my niggas don't be pimping them hoes
Cause I be damn
If my niggas don't be burning that dro
Cause I be damn (say what) (2x)
Cause I be damn
If DSGB ain't ready for war
Cause I be damn
If I don't have that tek 9 in my car
Cause I be damn
If Lil' Pete ain't gone shine bright like a star
Cause I be damn (say what) (2x)
Cause I be damn
If them niggas run up and they don't get done
Cause I be damn
If my pot don't blaze hot like the sun
Cause I be damn
If you don't know you done fucked with the one
Cause I be damn (say what) (2x)
Cause I be damn
If them boys don't be keeping it hot
Cause I be damn
If them boys don't be busting them glocks
Cause I be damn
If them boys don't be cranking the spot
Cause I be damn (say what) (2x)
Cause I be damn
If my niggas won't shut down the club
Cause I be damn
If my niggas don't be pumping them slugs
Cause I be damn
If my niggas don't be selling them drugs
Cause I be damn
Cause I be damn (say what)

Cause I be damn (16x)

(Pinhead)
Cause I be damn if a nigga won't
Damn if a nigga will
Damn if I won't get my glock out and shoot to kill
Damn if I'm gonna miss
Damn if I'm getting bitched
Damn if you gonna play me out like I'm new to this
Damn if it ain't a hit
Damn if this ain't the song
That you realize that them Georgia boys dropping bombs
Damn if I ain't gone ride in the Benz getting high
Damn if I ain't in the back loading up a 45
Damn when it's time to blaze
To the hood getting paid
Damn when my niggas busting shops full of that gunplay
Damn when I see a hoe, got to let that bitch know
That I'm rolling dro in that motherfucking optimo
Damn when I'm gonna leave with your bitch smoking weed
Got them fucking hoes in the club steady jocking me

Cause I be damn (12x)

(Blackoutt)
Cause I be damn 
If my niggas don't be riding on dubs
Cause I be damn
If DSGB don't be throwing it up
Cause I be damn
If you swerving through my block with a mug
Cause I be damn (3x)
If I let them coppers catch me in traffic
And I be damn
If I let them fuckers stop me from rapping
Cause I be damn
If run across, this shit gone get drastic
Cause I be damn (3x)
If I let this fuck nigga ride wit me
Get high wit me, your chicken head ass girl wanna get
right beside me
Cause I be damn if I let that bitch ride for free
Cause I be damn if I let these demons dwell wit me
Cause I be damn if I let these crackers bury me
And give a fuck if they murder me CAUSE I BE DAMN!!

Cause I be damn (17x)</pre>
