[Lecrae]
I'm sick of being sick (sick)
Sick of being tired (yeah)
When it comes down to the wire
I should just retire
Because I've been rewired
Had a bad connection
Now I got full bars (what's that?)
Good reception
Yeah, I've been received
I used to be deceived
Don't let my thoughts run wild
Even though my mind is free (yes)
And I'm coming home
Back where I belong
Racked up a lot of charges (yeah)
Outgrown and on my own
They say when in Rome do as the Romans do
But I found when I do that I die like Romans too
Yeah, I'm reading Romans 2 (What's it say)
Your words are on my heart (truth)
But I ain't got no excuse (no)
It's time to play my part
Yeah, so better get up (yeah)
It's time to hit the road (let's go)
Been rehabilitated
Rest for my weary soul
Cause yeah my life control
Death had my life on hold
A strong addiction to myself is all that's been unfolded
I would live for me
I made myself an altar
I sacrificed myself
For lust I was a martyr
For pride I gave my heart up
Now my heart's been changed
Made a deep incision
You made a heart exchange
Tore down all my idols
Now help me fight to live
Moment after moment
My life is yours to give
Able to forgive
Your love is my only hope
Without it I'm left empty
Looking for ways to cope
Was doped up, coped up, now I woke up
I used to date destruction
But now we broke up
And I get choked up
I'm drowning in your grace
Who would have thought that red cross would rehabilitate? (yeah)

[Chorus One]
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming home tonight
I'm coming home tonight

[Chorus Two]
Yeah (Because) I was living my life away (away)
Not knowing that I was making my home a grave
(I was) Killing myself
(Slowly) wasting away
(Just) moments from death
Taking lust in my vein
But I stopped living my life today (today)
Cause I found a sponsor who can show me His way
(So I'm) packing my bags
(And I'm) hitting the road
(Putting my) foot on the gas
You know I'm coming, coming home

[Chorus Three]
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming home
Coming home tonight</pre>
