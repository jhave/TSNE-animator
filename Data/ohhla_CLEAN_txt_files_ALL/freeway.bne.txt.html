Bizzy &amp; (Cat Cody) 
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
(She's ridin' on the highway) 
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
(She's ridin' on the highway) 
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 
(She's ridin' on the highway) 
She's ridin' on the highway, highway, highway 

(Bizzy) 
Tellin' me to be careful 

(Cat Cody) 
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,zoom 

(Bizzy) 
Tellin' me to be carful though so dangerous 
I say let's change it 
Put on your coat and call up the chauffer 
Oh, gotta leave the babies 
Face-to-face it's goin' down 
Baby lace it with some basment as (just a little) 
Just a little temptation, and bury it underground 
And make ya nigga feel famous and say "Hey, fuck the pages"   
Off to the freeway, anxious to play 
(Damn) Baby protect my health and yourself and everyone else   
And lady respect my patience from temptations 
Let off all that frustration, all is well, hell, what are you waitng for?   
Basic relations waitin', wakin' up in the storm 

[Bizzy - 8X]
Roll with me 
Roll, can't you come over? 

[Cat Cody - 2X]
Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway? 
Have you ever met your lover out on the highway?  Ah, ah, ah, ah 

(Bizzy) 
When I Put you in my car (Zoom, zoom) move far 
We chose to lose time and, my, why there you are 
When I saw that night, I had to call 
It's gotta be right, it couldn't be wrong 
Lookin' in far fallen and gone, lookin' at the stars, all of them, long 
And on the freeway, baby believe me, gotta take it easy 
Yet appeasin' to please 'em 
Oh, Jesus, she's breathin' on me! 
But I ain't that weak to put her to sleep 
So respectful, respect your temple, subliminal 
Probably pause in the distance, reminisce visual, member my car 

[Bizzy - 12X]
Roll with me 
Roll, can't you come over? 

[Cat Cody - 2X]
Have you ever made love, on the freeway, the freeway? 
Have you ever met your lover out on the highway?  Ah, ah, ah, ah 

(Bizzy) 
We're peekin' each other's secrets (Shhh) 
No speakin', just heavy breathin' 
(Why don't you take a ride with me? C'mon) 

(Cat Cody) 
Friday! 

(Bizzy) 
Friday evenin' clear through the weekend we're peakin' each others secrets   
No speakin', just heavy breathin' 
A quarter inch from your cleavage 
The reason you got me 
Teasin'--be gentle 
Interested sexual in a room to touch you eventual, too much potential 
Lookin' at you sensual 
Let you go, roll, have your space 
And I'll be paper chasin' up and down, straight ghetto face 
And have you ever fell in love 
Just as much that you forgot about everyone just for their touch? 

[Bizzy - 8X]
Roll with me 
Roll, can't you come over? 

(Cat Cody) 
Just for that touch 
Roll, come on and roll with me 
Stroll, come on and stroll with me 
Girl, can't you come over? 
Stroll with me? 
Yea, you can. 
Yea, you can go with me 
Yea, I know you can 
C'mon, yea you can 
I know you can 
Just ride with me</pre>
