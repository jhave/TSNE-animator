[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
A bay, lately, you been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin like Katrina with no F.E.M.A.
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't +Rome+ without +Caesar+

[Chorus: Dwele] 
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Come on! So flash your light on me (Flash your light on me)
So that the world can see (So the world can see)
