[Intro: Snoop Dogg] + (Damian Marley)
Say man.. lemme-lemme get a light homey (Yeah!)
Aye.. aye Timbo.. this yo' crippin cousin Snoop Dogg cuzz! (Yeah!)
I told you we gotta get gorilla on this one right here man
Take 'em to the zoo!
To the L.A. zoo, take these niggaz to the L.A. zoo
A hah! Yeah nigga.. 'bout to get..
Ain't shit crazy in here in a long time (Snoop Dogg!)
Dig this... uh..

[Snoop Dogg]
I need a light, let me step up in this motherfucker 'til I get it right
(Get it right Dogg!)
I need a light, let me lean, make it bright, everythang is dynamite
(Ahhhh true!)
Bust a bitch, tryna feel like a pimp would
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in ya neighborhood
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that
Take a sip of this, nigga have a puff of that
You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back
Now lay ya head back and roll in the Cadillac
How we do what we do, what it is, where it's goin down.. and the
motherfuckers flip it
Rip it, get specific, and dip it and then they drip it
'Cause you know we like to pop it 'cause you talkin so different
Fix your Focus and ride.. I want the bangers to bang
Or get hyphy with my niggaz up north by the Bay
Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz
'Cause I'm rollin with my nephew and we smokin again
"Turn your music down low, man yo' shit too loud!"
What the fuck you talkin 'bout, I put my gun in yo' mouth nigga! (in yo' mouth!)

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Niggaz better get it right
Let me get a light, nigga let me get a light! (Get it right Dogg!)
Yeah, better get it right
Nigga let me get a light, homey let me get a light!

[Chorus: Damian Marley]
To get it tight they gotta get a light
Well, to get it tight they gotta get a liggghhht! (Get it right Dogg!)
To get it tight they gotta get a light
No, to get it tight they gotta get a liggghhht!

[Snoop Dogg]
Hip-Hop! I ball like a split end, I'm all like I been in
I'm tryna put my bid in
Rip ride and try to keep it all hid in
Slide to the left and let yo' G homey get in
Gloccs of Velveeta, yep I'm off the meter
Ride by and see ya with my hands on a heater
Wanna be like the O but you act like a hoe
Gotta lot of Patron, with a shot of the malt
Wanna be's wanna beef like nine-ninety nine
You wanna battle me? You better learn how to rhyme
Boys stop tweakin 'fore I light up the place
What he say? Who you talkin 'bout? I'm right in ya face
Aye! Aye! Baby girl you know we hit the coot a lot
Me and my nephews, yeah, we stayin true to life
They get the party live, Dogg is the motivator
Rockin the block socket and knockin down the player haters
Yeah nigga.. you better know, it's incredible, unforgettable
Yeah, I bet I'm slow and I bet I'm low
We at the L.A. zoo, I'm whylin out like an ambulance!

[Hook] + [Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg] + (Damian Marley)
Lemme get a light nigga! (Snoop Dogg and Jr. Gong)
Lemme get a light man! Real talk man..
It's yo' uncle, Snoop D O Double G, bangin down yo' do' with my nephew Timbo! (Yeah!)
You know how we be! I.. indo, ooohhhwee, somethin brand new.. y'know what I mean?
Get it right nigga! (*"Get it right Dogg!"*} Real spit cuzz...

[Chorus] - 2X

[Snoop Dogg over Chorus]
