Typed by: Lil Hustle

[Chorus]
Where is the love - 2x

[Z-Ro]
Nobody loves me, but I prefer to keep it like that
Cause most friends are falsified trying to steal out your stack
So I keep my partnas to a minimum even though I know half can't be trusted
The only feeling in the world might steal your girl if I know flesh was lusted
Nigga now who was to blame for the pain cause fucking with me nigga you get sprayed
Hardheaded that's like fucking a bitch with no condom
And knowing that hoe got aids, better be smart, better keep your distance
Ain't got elements from loose leaf pages
When I'm going off in the rage of furious chambers of twin gauges
My calico murders offending my mind and my mind is so ready to click
Better freeze, better not breathe all I want is the money
Remember you dead if you twitch, cause I'm a killa that's killing for cash
I show no car crash when I'm stealing your stash
Don't fill in the streets because I'm too fast
But never revealing what's under my mask
I'm making a dash, I jump in the Hoover and I smash
With a foot on the gas and then I'm off in the night 
A nigga was buried alive
but he really should of died dig him up his coffin too tight
A nigga was showing a busta love, but now it's hunting for a busta season
And he can't be the reason, to run in your crib and leave you bleeding

[Chorus - 4x]

(talking)
The question at hand is 
Where's your motherfucking love
I'ma do like that boy Al D said
I'm showing love to the ones that showed love back
Fuck friends, so Mexican D, Grady
You know where your love at

[Z-Ro]
I was raised to never let em see me sweat
And how to dodge bullets never let em hit my chest
I saw the ways of the wise and how to live in peace
But fate said we got to stand and fight the beast with open eyes
Which means I got to keep my glock, on a day to day basis
Always protect myself and no more catching murder cases
Niggas will try to erase me and that's a fact, but if I got to go
Nigga I be damned if my trigga finger isn't pulling back
I had niggas I was real with and use to chill with
Now they coming to me with the drama that I can't deal with
I think they out to get me but I can't let em, just like Pac and Spice 1
The jealous got me strapped, so when I go to spraying I'ma wet him
I had love for y'all, I use to cut for y'all
Nigga we was family I shed blood for y'all
But now you hate me cause of my progress, you want me dead
I'm waiting on you niggas you know my address
But if my name is on the bullet and I die, you got to
Lay it down one day guess who gone be waiting on the other side
Go on and pull your pistol from your belt, but no man
Can take my life away from me until I lay it down my damn self
Tried to kill me once and paralyze my mobility
Now that I can walk again don't even think about getting me 
Not saying I won't die, you hoes can try to murder me and get me
And if I kick the fuck it nigga, fuck it you kicking it with me
Cause I'ma be drama best to put to the rest cause you don't understand
That I ain't down with dying at the hands of another man

[Chorus - 3x]</pre>
