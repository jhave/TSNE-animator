So what you saying, I hear complaing
I could repeat every statement you made verbatim
I treated you better back in the day and
Now you feeling like I'm changing, like I'm not the same man
I used to force your heart rate to run a race
And now it's safe to say that it's running out of patience 
Frustration, you want some separation?
You want no placement within this mess I'm making?
I'm painfully aware of my mistakes 
And maybe you should break an escape from the situation
Or take a little taste of the blame 
Then instead you still full of hate telling me get out your face, yeah

You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show

Now you wanna threaten me, is that what you're telling me?
Like if i don't step it up, what you gonna step from me?
Where you gonna go? You next to me steadily
At this point it's like I'm joined with your chemistry
Guess that it just wasn't meant to be our destiny
It's upsetting, see, I gave you the best of me
All my friends are like just let her leave, huh
So go ahead and pretend that I set you free, what?

You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show
You don't really want, you don't really want me
You don't really want, you don't really want me to go
No you don't, that's just for show

Alright already, now you make this headache pound
I ain't trying to mess around, you ain't allowed to get me down
It's no sweat at all na I won't stress about 
Anything projected out of your passive agressive mouth
Let it out, if we walking on a separate ground 
Go ahead and step off with all of those brand new friends you found
Hit the town, you'll be back for a second round 
If you was gonna leave me you would have already left me now</pre>
