(T3)
Yo me and my man fin to get on some disco
Come on

(Chorus)
What you want Disco
We got it for you
Up up in the club we make 'em disco
On the street corners make 'em disco come on
What you need Disco
We got more for you
In the barber shops make 'em disco
In the beauty shops make 'em disco come on
What you want Disco
We got it for you
Thug ass niggas wanna disco
Pretty ass uh wanna disco come on
What you need Disco
We got more for you
Up up in the club Disco
Uh come on and disco

(Verse 1: T3)
Come on
I wanna see y'all take it there on the floor
You wanted the Slum so we came with some more
I hate y'all people who hate them people who
Like to make y'all shake and make good music who
Us, we coming in the pl-ace
No time to conversate get funky like the bass
Get down to the sound cuz the Slum is on the tr-ace
Don't worry about the Sobe cuz the Slum is on the c-ase
Dirty District, dusty music
The funk so nasty can make you lose a nugget
If you want to, bring your bloozey
Watch out for this one, this here's a doozey

(Chorus)
What you need Disco
We got it for you
Up up in the club we make 'em disco
On the street corners make 'em disco come on (Yeah)
What you want Disco
We got it for you
We got the funk to make you disco
Elzhi drop a verse to make 'em disco come on

(Verse 2: Elzhi)
Don't sell yourself to "Fall In Love"
You're in "Climax" cuz after it's done then "Go Ladies"
I mean what's up with all the "Jealousy"
You knew that it was you, her and me
You tryna "CB4" you better "Raise It Up"
Out of my crib take a cab
Cuz "Conent Gardens" is where they flatten your wig
This for a certain chick whose name remains "Untitled"
This is "2U4U" and by you
Got sick and tired of going "Forth And Back"
Arguing about paper stacks, told you to "Hold Tight"
But you stayed tryna "Get Dis Money"
Asked you where my dough, you said "I Don't Know"
I know the sex was "Fantastic"
It's the "Thelonius" when I'm boning chicks
It gets the mattress
Girl "Tell Me" if you want something you can just
Make plump and if so then keep your "Eyes Up"
Now we buckwilding "What's That All About"
"Once Upon A Time" you was down now we falling out
Sweetheart we the "Players"
You wouldn't understand if you bought Volume 2 from the bootleggers

(Chorus: T3)
What you want Disco
We got it for you
Up up in the club we make 'em disco (Yeah)
On the street corners make 'em disco come on (Yeah)
What you need Disco
We got more for you
We got the soul to make you disco
SV will drop the funk to make you disco come on
What you want Disco
We got it for you
We'll make you disco
Pretty ass women wanna disco
What you need Disco
We got more for you
We got the funk to make you disco
You wanna disco come on</pre>
