[Drake]
Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, Rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spitting that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it repping, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doing them shows getting everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters going have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm going off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, called hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast you, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy, no toaster
G and Tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They jus handing chips to me nigga, no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runnith over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go

[Lil Wayne]
And I take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, big location
Im going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch +Departed+
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recording, I'm jus C-4ing
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face falling
Watch the game from the side, I'm play calling
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My piss don't got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y no homo I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say bout when your palm itch
I'm going get money, money I'm going get
Young Money in your tummy and we going shit
And get that toilet paper quick like when bones split
That's right bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That ought to Marvin Gaye, no ice just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, Fuck the world with a long dick
Motherfucker I'm me, yeah bitch I'm me
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'm a take off when I leap, bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, head butt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger jus screaming, motherfucker, do you hear her?
Drizzy Drake what the lick read
We make magic boy, Roy and Siegfried</pre>
