Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Lost am I in my memories of my forefathers' legacy
I am one of you you are one of me
Why don't we set the people free
How I grieve to see fulfillment of prophecy
Naive of me to think things could change
While man remain the same so war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine

Shalom salaam shalom salaam

Who will take the blame for the blood of my children
To who does vengeance belong to no one no one
We're dying from tanks and suicide bombs
The only answer is to live as one
And justice will come for my sons and just will come for my sons

Shalom salaam shalom salaam

And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
Children are children no matter color or faith
And I wonder if history will teach us again

So war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine

And justice will come for my sons

Shalom salaam shalom salaam</pre>
