[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Ok lil mama I know your kind and I like 'em grown
Do this do that never hold back I think I'm ready come on
Sh-shorty I see ya thong That body is what I want
I Got it written in stone Let's start off sippin' Patron
However, Whenever, Whatever, This here what I'm all about
Spend cheddar the weather get better Put on I'ma give you this crown
Forever and ever on schedule Yea baby I'ma take it to the top
I'ma take you to the spot
I'ma show you what I got
But you gotta make it drop
Get it poppin' never stop - Heyyy
Cash ain't a problem I really got dollars so baby get straight to the business
Poppin' them collars I know if I holla I'm lookin' for shorties with thickness
I'll be your personal fitness
Girl I'ma get you addicted
So could you be my, would you be my, won't you be my, can you be myyy

[Chorus: Pleasure P]
Can you be my action
Cause from the way that you're dancin' I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action
Heyyy (You could be my shone, you could be my shone)
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby you can be my action
You can be my - whoaaa

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]]
You can be my action
Plenty satisfaction
I really got a fetish she bowlegged that's my attraction
Set it off there baby with the blackberry that's my collection
What it do on everything that sexiness is my passion
Whatever you like, we turn off the lights go'head n show me your back strong
The end of the night if you get me right got stacks to blow like a saxophone
Do ya thang mama keep killin' 'em
Dead presidents I'm peelin' 'em
For the record I'm feelin' ya no contest shorty keep grillin' 'em
All the way all day don't play get straight to the point raise the temperature
So hot, celebrate girl I just wanna give you this cake let's get physical
Baddest in the club how you do that baby you too much
Just my luck let me touch be director let me cut

[Chorus: Pleasure P]
Can you be my action
Cause from the way that you're dancin' I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action
Heyyy (You could be my shone, you could be my shone)
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby you can be my action
You can be my - whoaaa
We Shonin'

[Verse 3: Pleasure P]
I live in Hollywood but I still be in the 'jects
Shawties wanna holla when they see what's on my neck
My money very long, I ain't gotta make it stretch
And when I say shone I be talkin' 'bout sex
Say little mama you know I'ma make you holla
Walk in the club and we gon' toss a couple dollas
Pop a few bottles make them hatas wanna follow
Ain't nothin wrong you grown, so baby can you be my

[Chorus: Pleasure P]
Can you be my action
Cause from the way that you're dancin' I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight
Can you be my action
Heyyy (You could be my shone, you could be my shone)
You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby you can be my action
You can be my - whoaaa
We Shonin'</pre>
