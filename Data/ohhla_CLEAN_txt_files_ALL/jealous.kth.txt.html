Song:   Jealous
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

I used to be at Mars with Flex; now everything changed
He was the only one in the room DJing - empty room
He was cool back then, used to talk to niggaz
Now he can't say hi on the street, big boy
I knew Angie Martinez - 12 o'clock midnight nobody listened to her show
Now she wanna rap

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, all the motherfuckers are jealous of each other
All that click shit is bullshit
Everybody mad, cause this guy got the record before this guy
This guy don't play this guy
because this guy got the record before that guy
DJ, This is bigger than DJ That - and all that bullshit
Niggaz - actin like they don't see a motherfucker
Turnin they heads the other way, that's some ol' bitch-ass shit

I can't fuck with them mixtape niggaz
A lot of them New York DJ's are jealous
I don't give a FUCK about Funkmaster Flex
He don't give a FUCK about me
They ain't playin my shit on MTV, a bunch of wack niggaz kissin ass
Same commercial MC's, you ever notice niggaz look at your feet first?
Envious faggots are worse - fuck the 106 Park shit
I'm on some dark shit, niggaz are plastic
Tec-9 blast through your Avirex fabric
What's the fuck up with Mister Cee and Mr. Magic?
Steve Smith, gon' STILL act like bastard
A lot of niggaz need to see some cables and rope
Tied in basement with New York police department smellin gunsmoke
Act like you don't see me, turn your fuckin face backwards
A decade of jealousy
What the fuck y'all tellin me?
Don't act like you don't remember me
You used to bump my shit in Mars
Now you on some trim goatee shit like El DeBarge
Fuck the Tunnel tonight and that petty shit at the Garage
And Jimmy's Cafe shit, I ain't on nobody's dick
I remember when BET wasn't shit!
After a certain time on that channel, owned by white people
Fuck y'all night people
Suckin ass ain't my forte, you fuckin with the right people
Is Stretch bumpin my shit?
Do I have to pay niggaz with envelopes and a bottle of Cris'?
Fuck a Rolex, I got the same shit you got on my wrist
All that jealousy shit is mayonnaise and celery shit
Y'all hated down South and West coast rappers one time
Now everybody that was frontin is now slurpin they dick
Inhalin like Menthols and Vicks
Most of y'all can't stand to see a nigga shine with jewelry and kicks
Bad bitches and chicks, stop hatin each other
Motherfuckers this is the "Jealousy" remix (Hot 97, remix!)

Jealousy, jealous motherfuckers
Jealous..
Jealous motherfuckers (W-B-L-S)
Y'all jealous of each other, jealous of each other
Jealous..
Jealous of each other (92.3 the Beat)
Jealous motherfuckers
Jealous motherfuckers! Y'all some jealous motherfuckers
Jealous motherfuckers

Yeah
Now I used to know, Bambaataa used to play everybody's shit
I ain't think even Kool Herc came out with some ol' bullshit like that
When all the DJ's, back in the days, them niggaz stuck to-fuckin-gether
You see, Theodore, didn't mind, Mean Gene, on his set
Now these new motherfuckers, are like, on some new futuristic shit
But I'ma give y'all some 2003 shit to work with, for a little bit

Jealous motherfuckers - jealous of each other
Jealous.. motherfuckers</pre>
