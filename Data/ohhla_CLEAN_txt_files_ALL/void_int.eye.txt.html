Silence is what we all need for a minute
Dyin' is what we want to avoid while we're livin'
Life and tryin' to make some noise
The screams sort of seem like we're cryin'
Reaching towards our dreams, I offer an exhausted sigh
And rhymin' keeps the posture of my back in fair condition
But why in the world do I do this music when so few people listen?
Climbin' a mountain that might eventually crumble
It's a bumpy ride into that light side of life where no one goes
Violence saturates our surroundings, my heart is pounding
I am one of the strong that noticed the sirens sounding
Strivin' to wake you up, so we can grow to maturity
While we're all buyin' the government's repent from social security
Wine and cigarettes promote good life, bad health and tax
I am one of the strong, but also in the same trap
Exercisin' my brain
Realizin' that pain will be arrivin'
If I dive into the cesspool of my mind
So I'm rewindin' the recorded version of my conscience repeatedly
Not easily blinded
Nor do I find it hard to ignore you weakling's weep
I shine with this terrific, twisted piece of metal
Strangely changing climate as they increase the level
I said I wouldn't sign shit, 'cause I don't want to meet the devil
But I lost my mind, and I'm tryin' to find it in the dimension of space 
between bass and treble
Shattered is my existence, in so many pieces I can't count
Chatter is the substance that comes from most people's mouth
Matter is what you don't to me, he don't to she, we don't to we
But hopefully we can gather together and figure out what life's about
Patterns of emotion change shape from different situations
Lanterns shed light on the dark side of imagination
Scattered is good and evil, through various people and areas of the ego
But we know we can be peaceful with the right participation
Now batters, stay behind the base and get ready for the pitch
Rappers mold their soul into plastic and get filthy rich
The ladder to paradise is infested with parasites
And if you don't ride in the carriage right, you would swear that life's a bitch

[Refrain x6]
Nothing gets you nowhere
But everything gets you somewhere
One pair of shoes is great compared to two feet tryin' to run bare</pre>
