[Verse 1]
Like me be smoking while I'm driving
Getting higher than the Bee gees, sayin' we both just stayin' alive an' (stayin' alive an')
Watching the time go by (time go by), climbing (climbing)
Told you I did enough hash, to make a mountain (make a mountain)
And you could sit right on your ass (right on your), doubting (doubting)
While I'm somewhere rolling up grass, going up where the clouds is (clouds is)
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' with' em'
I say if them niggas ain't get that high then I ain't fuckin' with' em'
Doing nothing with' em, rolling up or puffin with em'
Going on the road, doing shows or getting duckies with' em' (duckies with' em')
I been smoking in my pictures since myspace
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing
but I just tell em' to do what they do (do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road
so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed and my joint
and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game
If I'm ever going I'm not going the same way

[Hook]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

[Verse 2]
Niggas like me be smoking while I'm rappin'
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen (just make it happen)
Say they be smoking, they be acting
Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain (with the captain)
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin
got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin (in a napkin)
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers
never smokin that bullshit with them fucked up names of them flavours (flavours)
I remember puttin weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane (insane, insane)
Now every time I turn on the video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas ain't you
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose
The homie I gotta ball, it's something you can't do
So suckas hate

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do (do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too, too, too)
Just give me weed and my joint and I ain't need it for nothing homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going I'm not going the same way

[Hook]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug</pre>
