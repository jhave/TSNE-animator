Every woman have a snapping point
You don't want her to snap no

Someone stop Linda
She just left the crib with a beretta
She's on her way to pop her fiance
Cause the word on the street
He was sleeping with Renee
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda
He don't even know she's coming
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'

My father used to tell me, son, listen
There's a thin line between love and hate
Once you cross that line, see there's no escape
She love me, she love you not
You don't wanna open up Pandora Box no, no
She will see that you been cheating
When you said that you been working
All I'm saying is just watch your back
Cos tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack
Linda's got a gat

Someone stop Linda
She just left the crib with a beretta
She's on her way to pop her fiance
Cause the word on the street
He was sleeping with Renee
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda
He don't even know she's coming
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'

Listen to me now
Every barrel got a Linda
Trust me you don't want that drama
When you laughing she's crying
Mascara running down her face, now she's plotting
Like Method Man, she gon' bring the pain
Like Cypress Hill you got a insane in the membrane
All I'm saying is just watch your back
Cos tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack
Oh my God

Someone stop Linda
She just left the crib with a beretta
She's on her way to pop her fiance
Cause the word on the street
He was sleeping with Renee
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda
He don't even know she's coming
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'

Someone stop Linda (Samson fell for Delilah)
Someone stop Linda (Ahab fell for Jezebel)
Someone stop Linda (King David fell for Bathsheba)
And coming in the mist
Linda wants to head up the baptist
Someone stop Linda
He don't even know she's coming</pre>
