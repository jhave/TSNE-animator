Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh uh uh uh my friends roll lexus and benzs and spend instrumendous
uh like those endless business niggas from the start
was already hot no prob openin shop the flow ready rock
so many tryna knock my hustle half of ya'll don't ain't even got no hustle
I'm into livin good so I bring heat with the flow
just how a nigga should come between me and my dough
I wish a nigga would roll O's and cigarillos
my black rim low the way I stack indo
attract nymphos cats sick tho
to impress by how that honey walk me
I'm trying come up on some ways to make that money talk
sink or swim I'm a hungry shark
and I want it all cribs and a foreign car
all tomorrow I could be gone tomorrow
that's why I grind like it's my last da
 hundred fuckin roaches in my ash tray

[Chorus:]
Now I know I ain't livin right... but it feels good [x4]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh huh uh my weed kicks like jet lee flicks test me kid slap shots like gretzky
hits the best kept secret yes he
is the cats out the bag I puff puff
and I pass you dumbfucks and I laugh
what you hatin for why you just standing outside
what you waitin for I'm blowin on and 8th
or more touring for my paper boy before I hit the club
I need a blunt a two a three a four bad bitches
thirsty for stars with mad riches
wanna ride with em rest they head on televisions
I don't bag bitches they hop in you just follow
and you bag bitches you're not a pimp I was schooled by the best of em
now they cuttin checks for him
ain't gettin money then it's prolly for the rest of them
somethin like a legend when I?
what I wrote be in the big cloud from the blunts that I smoke...

[Chorus]</pre>
