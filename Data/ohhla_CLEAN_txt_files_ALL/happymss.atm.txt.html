[Verse 1]
Remember that time that I made you so mad
Last week right ha ha you know that
It's not like it's all that rare
So put it here and let me cherish the embarrassment
I realize I've been a dick head yes
And I respect how you question your investments
I take the plane but it ain't to be impressive
It feels like a cop out to label it lessons
I've been though the rain but I've put other people
through a hurricane just to work the game
Some time I swim through so much shame
I think my little man's blessed that he didn't get my last name
And here you are right in front of me 
offering it all like tell me what you want from me
I wanna love you today and forever
Let me clear my through and rub my wings together

[Chorus] {X2}
It goes: I'm not perfect but I'm this that and this
My hands are dirty and I'm this that and this
You've been searching for this that and this
Let's break the surface and make a little happy mess

[Verse 2]
Whoo girl, you're the most beautiful thing I've seen
Enticing, exciting
Even the sound of your voice gotta nice ring
Ya seem like the type that might help me tighten up my pipe dreams
We can keep digging through this dirt
Team up, you and I against the universe
Think about it, What cha say to yourself
You can wear my cape and I can play with your belt
The truth is there now
Stand with me, look into that mirror now
And tell me you don't see the same image
Gonna be a brand name babe once the rain is finished

[Chorus] {X2}

[Verse 3]
I can't believe she got me on a ball and chain
It's not a complaint, I appreciate it
For all the dumb mistakes I make 
I'm surprised baby girl ain't threw me away
I never meant to hurt no one
I just want to stay productive till the work is done
I dance to a sertain drum
but when I fell off beat you didn't turn and run, no
You see me at my lowest moments
You gave me sight when I had broken focus
With a smile that opens up like a rose does
Even when it all seemed so fucking hopeless
And here you are, right in front of me
Offering it all like 'tell me what you want from me'
I want to thank you today and forever
Let's make a little happy mess together
You know

[Chorus] {X2}</pre>
