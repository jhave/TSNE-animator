See...
I wanna get next to you, freak ya body
Sexy baby, ooh wee, aah
My super freak
I wanna get next to you, freak ya body
Sexy baby, ooh wee, aah

[Verse 1]
I ain't even like them other types
I'm like a thug nigga but I don't fuck with dykes
Call me your undercover lover, I do want you like
We can do it anyway, anyhow, any night, so tight
And you can feel it in your dreams, don't cha
I gotta drug habit for ya like a fiend, won't cha
Anticipate the point to I see ya, put the squeeze on ya
I cop a fifth and take a sip and put the please on ya (ooooh)
You got me thinkin bout you and I'm gone
And I don't smoke no cigarette, but I be in the zone
My fam jokin cause I'm always on the phone
Tellin me to get the business when you get home
You know that... oooh, aaaw
Baby boy I know you feelin it too, bout to do what ever... you, like
Getting lose while we sippin the goose
You got me feelin like...

[Chorus]
My super freak
I wanna get next to you, freak ya body
My Sexy baby, ooh wee, aah
My super freak
I wanna get next to you, freak ya body
My Sexy baby, ooh wee, aah

[Verse 2]
Now the boy got me wide open
The kinda the way he get up close and get my thighs open
You the, uhh uhh, when we start movin
This nigga got me make love with my eyes open
Keepin goin with up and down, back and forth
And the side and around and he askin more
And he tying me down the backboard
And it sound like we tearing down the back wall
And I ain't trying the play your mind shawty
I'm trying get up in ya mind and make you mine shawty
And ask my best frend if you think I'm lying shawty
You got your game right and I think you're fine shawty, for real
And you ain't trippin off my record deal
Or how I'm lookin in my picuters with my sex appeal
We in the Chevy dro'ed out playin Let's Chill
I got some orange juice ready for them X pills
Still...

[Chorus]
1x

[Break] (Man)
(Ah come here...) Uh-un...
(Come here...) Uh-un baby...
(Come here...)No baby...
(See...)No baby, no...

[Verse 3]
Now we back to the handcuffin
Bed banging down crazy cause I can't touch him
He got a way he wanna lay me with my legs up, and
A super freak and ooh baby I ain't sayin nothing
I'll be you private dancer watch the way the booty drop
And you can throw that thang back and make the booty pop
And we can get the freak and freakin with the oohcie-waa
I like the way he licky-licky with the juicy pop
And when I get on top...

[Chorus]
2x</pre>
