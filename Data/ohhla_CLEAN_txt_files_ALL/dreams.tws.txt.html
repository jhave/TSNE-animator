[Chorus 2x]
Hey lover, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I who you thinkin' of, who you thinkin' of)
Hey lover boy, am I the only one
Or are you selling your baby a dream
(Am I a sucker for love, a sucker for love)

[Mayz]
Damn, I'm trippin' 'cause I never really felt like this
To me women used to be only fuck foxes
But it's like with you I cherish every kiss
I know it's a risk but you make me wanna come clean
I wanna make you my queen
Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend
'Cause the way you put it on me make me wanna scream
And fuck you in places you ain't never seen
In a private boat as we float down stream
Yeah I already know you done heard this before
But the way you make me feel is real
Playas don't love no hoes but stayin' true like you do
Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby
'Cause you lookin' too fine to not be mine
And I ain't gon' never be satisfied
Unless you're on my side to the end of time
I can tell you think I'm lying
But I swear to you girl this ain't no scheme
You stay on my mind, even in my sleep
You keep a nigga havin' wet dreams, on the real

[Chorus 2x]

[Liffy Stokes]
From the first time I met ya, you was on my mind all night
A Maybelene queen with a body too tight
Wearin' black and white and some brand new Mike's
Draped in ice, attitude nice
You the type of woman that I need in my life
To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice
I can see ud one day man and wife
Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child
Plus our marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin' me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe
But this way's got the best of me
On everything, I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of "what's his name"
And let me in your world
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month
Babe, only time can reveal a dream

[Chorus 2x]

[Twista]
Baby I'll drink your bath water about a pint
Think I'm ever gon' give your love away, uh-uh
I ain't sayin' you never lovin' another nice stud but shit
I'm cravin' you every night and we just met on a night
But it seems like I've been knowin' you all my life
Ain't it funny how you be thinkin' you never be true enough, but you the one
A helpless seeks succumb, lovin' you more than everything
But my dollars, (?) and smokin' sticky up through the lungs
I can see you havin' my sons, screamin' your name on my next tape deck
In the city, no hear my pretty go
Quick to break a 54, put you on my video
Young and witty hoe, the only thing I'm feelin' pity for
I don't know what I was frontin' on
But I don't see nothin' wrong, sprung or gone
My every heartbeat's weaker, follow the leader
I promise I won't hurt you baby
Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall
Get you the finest things like diamond rings
Even though my mind is strain, I'm tryin' to change
How we fuck and kiss and the hugging make me bind the pain
No lying, no game, you gon' give me some, hey now, we freakin' up in the cut
'Cause I just sold you a dream hoe, like a girl did to my homie
Your house was spittin' and we fuckin' the uh
A sucker for love, a sucker for love

[Chorus 2x]
