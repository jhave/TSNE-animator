Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I rolled out the bed as the alarm started going off
Rubbed my head with my arm it was the crack of dawn
I'm late fo work and I really just hate my job
I kissed my wife good-bye and then I walk across the lawn
Got in the car out the driveway and I'm riding on the road by the mall
Past the highway that I'm flying on but
It slows to crawl cause some guy was just driving wrong
And I'm getting mad cuz I wonder why it's going on
Get out the way I just scream as I'm driving on
I hate my day and this way that it started off
I change lanes and I thought that I was pulling onto
The main lane but just then I saw this green Honda
It straight came next thing it was the window shattered
Felt a great pain my body being bruised and battered
It all changed went black and I knew I had it
I coughed blood breathed my last breath that was it
Chorus
What ya gonna do when there's no time left?
What ya gonna do when ya take ya last step?
What ya gonna do when ya take ya last breath
Out ya chest and find out that there's life after death? [x2]

Next thing I know everything just got real quite
I opened my eyes to my surprise now it's real silent
I realized I had died now it's my judgment
I'm standing before the Most High now and all of the sudden
He said to me, "Why should I let you into My heaven?"
I told God, "Well usually I'm a good person."
He showed my life and all the times now that I was sinning
Every line to every curse to every bad decision
From every lie to every word there was nothing hidden
He showed how Christ died and with my life and that I'd killed Him
He showed me time after time how I'd reject Him
I never cared about the sacrifice God had given
I never cared about my life or the way I lived it
And now I've died and it's too late to be forgiven
Guilty of my crime I'm sentenced to eternal prison
It's dark, I'm alone, I feel my flesh burning

[CHORUS]

I rolled out the bed as the alarm started going off
I scratch my head and then I yawned it was the crack of dawn
I'm praying and I'm thanking God that I got my job
I kissed my wife good-bye then I walked across the lawn
Got in the car out the driveway and I'm riding on the road by the mall
Past the highway that I'm flying on but
It slows to crawl cause some guy was just driving wrong
But I'm not mad I just wonder why it's going on
I use the time to pray for my family now and for my mom
I'm thanking God for the way my day had started off
I change lanes and I thought that I was pulling onto
The main lane but doesn't that guy see my green Honda?
It straight came next thing it was the window shattered
Felt a great pain my body being bruised and battered
It all changed went black and I knew I had it
I coughed blood breathed my last breath that was it

[CHORUS]

Next thing I know everything just got real quite
I opened my eyes to my surprise now it's real silent
I realized I had died now it's my judgment
I'm standing before the Most High now and all of the sudden
He said to me, "Why should I let you into My heaven?"
I told God, "I never was a good person."
He showed my life and all the times now that I was sinning
Every line to every curse to every bad decision
From every lie to every word there was nothing hidden
He showed how his son died and with my life and that I'd killed Him
But He showed the time I chose Christ and I didn't reject Him
He showed the time when I took the love that God had given
He tried to serve thru my life whenever I lived it
And now I've died but I thank God that I'm forgiven
He wiped the tears from my eyes as I cried and thanked Him
Cuz forever I'm a be with Him just in Heaven
