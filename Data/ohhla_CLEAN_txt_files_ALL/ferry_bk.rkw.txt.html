[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, pass off, man
You know what it is, man
It's that shit, yo, Alchemist, what up?
Good looking

[Raekwon]
Ferry Boat killas, Park Hillas, infered lasers
On the top of the ceilings, can't sneak by
Go downs is like blow hounds, we smother the block
Jumping in front of cars, lending niggas four pounds
Walk, keep it moving, yo, hop in the range
I know you real, cuz I raised you, not gon' front on your aim
We spit together, rocking wrist lights, stunting, right in front of
the parking lot
I'm like that shark wearing, lighting, been Niking
One bling, two bling no, only Boeings
And trips to Australia, yo, my niggas is smoke fiends
Fucking every part of the planet, slam a forty with a salmon
Hit your ho on target, we family
These are big niggas, grown men, who travel the world
Calling global drug dealing niggas, moguls
Never locals, only courts I now is sober
And this is real nigga food, Chef giving out his soul food

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Get a plate, man, for real, man
Come eat, man

[Raekwon]
Bulldogs they calling, phantom doors lift up, crawling
Kiss Shallah hand in the Holland
Larry and his guns is weird, six hundred onions a year
No more running, see the morgue, shorty
Wild nights, crew gunning cats, animal jackets and axes
Bulletproof buses, forty backs
Niggas is Romans, then turn around and they gon', then
Hoods is paro', niggas is logged in
Channel to channel, hammer to hammer
Rock a bandana knife like Rambo on the scrambler
Get high, trust your trigger man, logic is the bigger man
Get shit done, hit Orlando
New improved killas is beemer, plasma walls with the ninas
Stick your arm in the back, you jink
Thirty seven, three one five, eleven oh nine
With two T's, it's like rolling up new trees

[Outro: Raekwon]
Light up, man, light up, man
Open that nigga, I'mma blow ya, I'mma give ya a hundred, nigga
Just for that right there, my arm is...</pre>
