{*a parody of Color Me Badd's song "I Wanna Sex You Up"*}

Step outside, take off your coat
You got me so mad I wanna slit your throat
You puked on my food spilled food on my tux
And you take it out on me just because your life sucks
I think you've had a little too much wine
Now I dare you to step accross that line
You think that you're great, but you're such a faker
So now I think it's time that you meet your maker

I'm gonna make you feel real bad
I'll beat you so you'll never get up
Your face will soon be part of the road
And this is what I'll do

I Wanna Beat You Up
I Wanna Beat You Up

You spilled crap on all my clothes
Come a little closer I'm-a break your nose
I'll rip and tear you up limb by limb
And the same to anybody who will try to help him
You had to push me just far enough
That talkin' won't work so I gotta act tough
I'll knock your tongue down your throat so far
That the next words you say will come out as a fart

I'm gonna make you feel real bad
I'll beat you so you'll never get up
Your face will soon be part of the road
And this is what I'll do

I Wanna Beat You Up
I Wanna Beat You Up

Beat your face in all night long
I Wanna Beat You Up
You're such a wimp, no you're not strong

I put my fist right through his head
I Wanna Beat You Up
Call the morgue, I think he's dead</pre>
