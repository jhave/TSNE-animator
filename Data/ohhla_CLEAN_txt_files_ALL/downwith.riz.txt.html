Yo, you might hear me make a racket like Wilson
Cause I love summer no Rachel Bilson (YES)
The winter will come
We just have parties inside it's still fun
(We're jammin') pump this (We're bangin')
Change your boyfriend (let's 'av him)
We're rowdy, girls make our judgement cloudy
but when the sun comes through we're still alcys
We don't wanna be lowsy, or shameless
but we're running round like we're brainless
now I've got grass stains on my brand new white trainers
(ON MY BRAND NEW WHITE TRAINERS)
Ummmm... I know a few guys hate us
they're as compelling as neighbours so laters
it's blaters we've got our own style, you know now
so go wild and get hosed down, n-no no

YEAH YEAH
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets 
WHAT
Let's get down with the down with the
Let's get down with the down with the
Let's get down with the down with the 
YEAH YEAH
Let's get down with the trumpets

When I get down
I get respect now
and when our tunes drops
you know it makes your head bounce
yeah I move with the flow
and when I enter the room it shows
I move sick (WHEN I DANCE)
then chicks (WANNA DANCE)
move in and move quick (WHEN I DANCE)
at risk (WHEN I DANCE)
just be careful you don't lose your chick (WHEN I DANCE)
that might just happen
so listen deep
stick with your madame
or she might just leave

YEAH YEAH
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
WHAT
Let's get down with the down with the
Let's get down with the down with the
Let's get down with the down with the
YEAH YEAH
Let's get down with the trumpets

Ummm... how much sound from the brass to the air
will it take, to put your bras in the air? (PARDON ME THERE)
just don't pretend that
if I wasn't older you wouldn't wanna dance with me yeaaah
you're the last of my fears
I was top boy of the class in my year
well not really but I was half way there
and I coulda been the headmaster so yeah
got vibes and charisma (lighter and rizla)
baccy and filter (shine for me mister)
I want the sun to (SH-I-I-INE)
till I'm looking at a bright blue (SKY-Y-Y)
yes, and we drop it like anvils
bring your whole crew to a stand still, still
stick us on at clubs and I
guarantee that no body would stand still

YEAH YEAH
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
Let's get down with the trumpets
WHAT

Let's get down with the down with the
