[Verse 1: Time]
I bought my first pack when I was only 8
I went to the store and put a 5 on fate
My heart started to race, I pulled out a Barkley
Then I high fived the clerk, Jordan dunking on Dan Majerle
Forget cloud 9 I was on the Upper Deck
I was unstoppable, like Olajuwon's stutter step
Magic Johnson Larry Bird, I pulled them from a Fleer pack
Then I got another Jordan, I couldn't hold the tears back
Now I'm addicted, the cellophane is ripping
Out my mind like Rodman praying for a Pippen
I used to sell all my doubles and my extras on the corner
Listening to tapes, by Styx, Pac, and Foreigner
The only book I ever used to read was the Beckett
All my cards were mint condition, I had to protect them
Cause every cards valuable, at least most are
Unless you get an ad or a Sam Bowie card
On Christmas I thought I went to heaven damn
Cause my mom and dad gave me a Michael Jordan hologram

[Chorus: Giuseppe}
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my Jordan's safe

[Verse 2: Time]
Back in 95 my mom bought me a box
It was the whole 92 season from Topps
But not any old tops this was Topps with 2 P's
I was P Funk on NBA Jam with Bootsy
Boomshakalaka, I was dunking from half court
These gods made of cardboard were hard to ignore
I got LaPhonso's autograph by a Joslin's clothes rack
Then I went home and played ball till my Sprite went flat
Dad drank Dr. Pepper, mom made cookies
I was in my room praying for a Jordan rookie
Basketball cards in my spokes, yes I was troublesome
Under my desk at school, I'd hide my Topps bubblegum
Baseball saved us, basketball made us
Back in the day, I was nothing without my fade cut
I first found god in a pack, my memories are my wealth
Now I see him everywhere, even in myself

[Chorus: Giuseppe}
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my Jordan's safe</pre>
