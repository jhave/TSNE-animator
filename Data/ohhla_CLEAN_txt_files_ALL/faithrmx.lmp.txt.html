Well I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body
I know not everybody, has got a body like me baby (like me baby)
But I gotta think twice, before I give this heart away
cause I know all the games you play (what?)
Cause I play them too baby

Oh but I need some time off, from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith
(uhh, ya gotta) Faaaiith
(do ya feel it, don't stop) Faaaiith
(uhh, yes yes y'all, gotta have) Faaaiith
(ya don't stop; one, two)

Baby (uhh) baby (uhh) baby, uhh
I know you're askin me to stay
Say "Please, please, please don't go away
because I'm givin you the blues (blues) baby (uhh) baby (uhh) baby" uhh
You like me, but all them words you say
I can't help but think of yesterday
and another who tied me down to the leather board please

Before this weather, becomes that notion
'Fore you pick my heart up off the floor
When our loves come down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith
(uhh, ya gotta) Faaaiith
(do ya feel it, don't stop) Faaaiith
(uhh, yes yes y'all, gotta have) Faaaiith
(to the beat y'all; one, two-two y'all, ya-y'all)

Can you walk like a pimp, is your +Bizkit+ +Limp+?
I got +Faith+ like Miss +Evans+, make you run like the reverend
+Will Smith+ you get +Jiggy+, yo I'll stick +Biggie+
It's +Life After Death+ and I be livin proof
The roof is on fire, it can't get much higher
I'm rockin this spot so hot, you've expired
You call me a liar, I might get upset
Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet
