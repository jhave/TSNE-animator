[Chorus]
I need a girl who'll ride for me (Keep her self real fly)
Damn near die for me (Stand by my side)
Gon' call for me (Stand up and cry)
Pay my bail for me, make sales for me
Have a baby with (This is what she'll do)
Lie to industry (Be my baby momma too)
Someone who'll never leave (And always be true)
How I wish my wife could be you

[Loon]
I need a girl that'll ride for me
Situation get real bitch'll die for me
Even step in the courtroom and lie for me
I'm talkin' about right hand in the sky for me
Do twenty-five for me, nigga steal a pound for me
Shorty probably blow a nigga to the sky for me
And go and sit in a chair that'll fry for me
And lord know if I die she gon cry for me
Never say bye to me
I can't deny shorty love is official
Even though love ain't the issue
Shorty still smuggle the pistol
Packin' a gat then hug you and kiss you
Show you love when other niggas that diss you
You on the real
That's the type chick a nigga need  
The type smoke all a nigga's weed
And still move at a nigga's speed
Never a victim of a nigga's greed
Especially if she runnin' round with a nigga's seed

[Chorus]

[P. Diddy]
I had a girl that woulda died for me
Didn't appreciate her so I made her cry for me
Everyday she had tears in her eyes for me
I caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me (Thank you)
At first we were friends then became lovers
You was more than my girl we was like brothers
On late nights we would play fight under covers
Now you gone can't love you like I really wanna
But every time I think about your pretty smile
And we used to drive the whole city wild
Damn I wish you woulda had my child
A pretty little girl with Diddy style
Shit is wild
Now these's days that I reminisce
About my little mami I'ma always miss (I miss you)
But long as you happy I'ma tell you this
Ain't nothin' that's broke that we can't fix
Mamacita

[Chorus]

[Loon]
Now I done seen chicks come and go
Some in it for the love some want the dough
But some of them confused and don't really know
The difference between a woman and a silly ho
But on the low
I'ma tell you how it really be
'Cuz I be chillin' where the young willies be
Strip clubs, sit buzzed spend twenty G's
Shit bugged stick dubs where they titties be

[P. Diddy]
This nigga Diddy be chillin' with the prauda mamis
Posted up with the chick with the hottest body
Yo shorty all on me little hot tamale
 (But I'ma ride for you Daddy) Then I got you mami
Cause all I wanna do is take care of you
And do things that the playas ain't prepared to do
Like if I rock ice you gon' wear it too
Fuck wit me I have the whole world stare at you
You feel me girl?
