Intro:

Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun

Verse One:

All of that fuss was as my raps crushed
niggaz to slush I bust rhymes to Ice like Just
I spark thoughts, I get Biz to go off and
smoke rappers, who can't blow up July 4th
Jam, it runs in the fam when I slam
Shaq-Attack, I Ja-pan like Ro-dan
I rip sets and wreck and get lifted like a gym set
Hit the deck, I get more milk than Wheat Chex
Who am I?  Joe Sinistr, come on down now
Ron but I G, when I rock like Me Phi
Fire drill, I burn rappers like Marshall Bill
Licensed to Ill, my crew gets fresh like Chill Will
I'm shit hot, I drop like sex in my 'plex
I'm in deep some say it's similar to Loch Ness
When I draw with my funk niggaz from the Yard
They hit em hard, so EN GUARDE!!

Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples...

Verse Two:

The Big Bang, my dick hangs like Klu Klux
I'm too much, I rap sick like... niggaz with the lupus
I got wears to the gears looka here
I got more skills than, Cheers have beers
I shoot bop pops, we call his cough drops
It's Tojo, some say I'm more evil than the walla
I start fume, my rap packs more than carpools
I crack heads, like the Dead when they spark fools
Cough in the record, nasty foul like Patti Austin
Wanna be startin, I lose more kids than the
orphan-G from straight up like, if you want beef
I socks punks and wreck it from the jump like fair beats
Beats, instant replay
I got Flavor like the Units who led, Mr. DJ
Who split the loose ends, Off and On like Trendz
My rap bends, my god, kids, how I accent!!

Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun

Verse Three:

Hellelllell yeahhh I get, more Fresh than Bel-Air
My rap triggers, that pack more niggaz then welfare
I got Speech, a-aight, I hit the temple I rock chrome
Some say I'm not home like Mr. Wendal
My nine's gonna bring you more drama than Tawana
My rap blasts'll run through more track than Jack Horner
Joe struck the puff, more Mighty than the Duck
to get props, when I Wreck Shop like A-Plus
Cos that's how I feel, I'm real, let's not deal
But I shoot em up, to slang on pop steals
I kick diction, I'm more hot than Hell's Kitchen
Gates, The Man Without Face like Mel Gibson
Weed fair, hit the Phillies lit I rap like a grip
so rough, I gets it up for that chilly bitch
My style rips reals, here's the deal
Get out or, get killed like a fuckin soldier in Israel BITCH!!

Da-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun
Wa-dum, da-dum, here comes the peoples from under the sun (Repeat to end)
