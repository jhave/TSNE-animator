Psssh, I didn't realize we'd be cashin in
Makin dollars, makin shit pop around here
(nigga!) Fiends sniff to cops gang-bangin
Where my block?  My everyday is a crime
A nine to five, slangin bucks, nine millimeters
Three-eighties and gauges and glocks
(?) made you not wanna sit back
and I watch the clock (hah!) watchin anybody and any
For every fuckin dime, every penny, what a pity
I'll be livin the city, livin greedy, lookin for (??)
Wit a spirit that'll jealous the belly, then now
Two wanted killers slang crack, shit
Smokin boodah's off that brown orange boodah
Stabbin motherfuckers in the back, I ain't afraid to do ya
Roll wit niggaz, that's the same, or roll wit a gang
Roll up in a school and bang - bang!
And hang out, to sellin (?) struck out
Fiends, who's worries kept green, or stick the merry, dream
that could make 'em run and get the pistols, the shit
This ain't a damn thing funny (fool!)
Niggaz around my block, start actin so crummy
When Atlanta dawgs reach that G status, just to have it
and anything that'll (?) out my jock just to have us
Hoppin down the steps, where my homeboys chill
Sippin hundred, had a bomb smoke that's real
I hate see the homies pass by, they creep inside
lettin niggaz know that this the C-SIIDE! (yeah)

Licorice nigga like "You give 'em what he deserve"

Jumpin for scrappin bottles, jackin faster
Quick to say "Bitch," quick to say "Fuck you!"
Quick to say "Motherfuck ya momma and yo' hood too"
