First the sheep next the shepherd
Chuck¹s run amok multiplying like leopards
Spots em up the long bombs a record
A long shot / 3 minutes 15 seconds
If i was cloned never would i be alone
Just the two of us mutherfuck the lexus
Strange fruit be hangin in texas
Rope be holdin the necks
Poison politics affects us
Get my flow on a show of flexes
Got too much love above
For the battle of the sexes
Now i won¹t go as far as romancin myself
Or dancin with wolves or runnin wit the bulls
Shit i be in two places at one time
Split spaces wit one rhyme
Get 3 nickels outta one dime

First the sheep next the shepherd

Fill generation gaps wit mad raps
Get slapped 
Give four smacks the hell on back  
Be the father son and the holy ghost 
As i represent both the east and the west coasts
Whatever that¹s worth 360
The planet earth that¹s the whole black man¹s turf
Now i be the rational national 
Ever present international
Spy wit the third eye against the conquer and divide 
Now wit three of me i can run a country 
Make apocalypse quit do mad shit on the side
I go on wit my bad self if i had four of myself 
I would sacrifice two to get that slave outta you 
In my eyes be the anger of the furious five
Flashbacks cut across psycho tracks
Been there done that and i swung a big bat 
Like that there it is i be the startin six pack  

First the sheep next the shepherd 

The east to the west south to the north 
The music might switch the rhymes never fall off
Non alcoholic avoiding the bomb 
In abortion clinics i be the hero up in it 
Jack the cracker dat did it
Now the magnificent 7 
Hip hop gangsta rappin 
Holdin it down makin it happen
From oakland to manhattan 
If i was eight / i be damn great
City to city / state to state
Won¹t never be too much on my plate
Flow like watergate
Wit  nine of mine 
I¹d get piece of mine
Again and again
Wit that power of ten men 
Duplicated by the split
Of one mean gene an shit
Back to the lab
Wit them scientific crabs, what next?
3 minutes and 15 seconds
