[Verse 1] 
Imma do my thing 
Let me tell you right now 
Cause I dont know any other way 
Of living my life now 
Some of you know the struggle 
Some of you live in a bubble 
Some of you hustle 
And some of you just looking for troble 
I dont follow or lead 
Tommorows a dream, 
Pray to god to intervine 
On all the sorrow ive seen 
You want out of here 
You can leave if you wanna 
If thats your type of persona 
Life is shorter, 
Now dont make me say it ten times 
I keep going for mine 
Even in the end times 
I can beat the system 
Come on and say it with me 
Show me some optimism 
We can take over the city 

[Chorus] 
Real life represent the sound since the first day 
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way 
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase 
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imaa get it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imma get it anyway 

[Verse 2] 
There comes a time in your life 
You gotta go for yours 
Staying paid
Is like the battle of forever more 
I stay peddle to the metal 
Foot on the floor 
Imma keep on the streets
Knocking down your doors 
I'm by the dollar
Like everybody oughta be 
Don't burn nobody
And make the money honestly 
Open your home with the internet technology 
I get it anyway 
Just find it in the economy 
See I aint coughin 
Unless it makes a profit 
Im dropping this so hot 
Like every day gossip 
Regardless of the climate 
Im gonna get it everday 
Even if the bullets spray 
Imma get it anyway 

[Chorus] 
Real life represent the sound since the first day 
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way 
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase 
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imaa get it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imma get it anyway 

[Sing] 
La la la la la 
You know we blazin up that 
La la la la la 
All around the world 
La la la la la 
Our peoples getting money 
La la la la la 
Let me hear you sing 

So let em hear us holla 
Or we'll guide em by the collar 
Making it harder for you 
Dont wanna make an honest dollar 
You wanna sip a little, 
To make your pain numb 
Tippin that bottle 
Got you forgettin where you came from 
But I'm the same one 
Where you think my name's from 
Imma keep it moving 
And never stop till the games done 
Forever we live it, forever we spit it 
Remember the minute 
You witnessed the realest that ever did it 
Still I'm committed 
No matter what I hear from the critic 
People can see through a gimmick 
I'm putting on a clinic 
We in trobled times 
Swerving through the double lines 
You're in a head on collision 
Cause now you served your time 

[Chorus] 
Real life represent the sound since the first day 
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way 
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase 
Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imaa get it anyway 
Regardless what the haters say 
Imma get it anyway 
Imma get it anyway 

[Sing] 
La la la la la 
You know we blazin up that 
La la la la la 
All around the world 
La la la la la 
Our peoples getting money 
La la la la la 
Let me hear you sing 
La la la la la 
You know we blazin up that 
La la la la la 
All around the world 
La la la la la 
Our peoples getting money 
La la la la la 
Let me hear you sing 
La la la la la 
You know we blazin up that 
La la la la la 
All around the world 
La la la la la 
Our peoples getting money
