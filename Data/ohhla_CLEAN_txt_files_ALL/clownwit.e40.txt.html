(E-40)
Forty water and Mystikal 
What cha know about that nigga? 
Huh?

(E-40)
What cha want girl?
You interested in a thug ass nigga 
Wit battle wounds and scars 
Lawyers, doctors, rappers, R&amp;B singers or sports stars?
Wig splittas and dome crackers that s all I'm accustomed to 
Allergic to suckas and bustas and get to sneezin and shit aaachew!
Ain't affiliated wit pathological liars and name droppers
Just bosses and mafia niggas
Slick talkers and collar poppa s
Drug traffic and racketeer bank robbers
Young pits pants saggin totin and packin choppers
I'm having this ghetto money tryin to stay papered up like a fax  
I keep tellin all these niggas out this way 
you ain't got to have dandruff to have scratch 
Protect yo neck and yo chest 
See my mentality hasn't changed just my physical address nothin less (less)
I smoke wit the gromiest and the highest 
Takin my chances on hepatitis 
Sharin my forty s of malt liquor drinkin 
211 after any old nigga thinking&amp;
 
(Chorus)
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
I mean sic wid it 
 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it 
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
 
(Mystikal)
Nigga you must have been drinkin dog water 
If you think you can fuck wit the bayou godfather
Smoke like scaldin water I'm come from the 12th ward 
Cuts and welts and scars whoever face-off
Burnin and turnin they lights out makin them stay dark
Body beatin and sweepin keepin em sleepin 
heat seekin deletin 
cause bitch I ain need cha 
feel like bullets hit cha when the rhymes flyin off 
when I get finish wit cha   
you gonna feelin 
Dog tired boss   (John Cofey from the Green Mile) 
Jump shop, hop flight, cop ride and 
Tellin finally smell it and chop it up wit Fonzarelli 
These niggas be sounding like they talking bout they on one   
but when I come they only fuck up one run like homerun  
Fire-bringa 
Rhyme-singa 
Pussy-banga 
Young dick- slanga 
They funky like Kunta Kinte own thang 
on my bike I'm ridin the fuckin rap game on the handle bars 
 
(Chorus)
Clown wit it, Clown wid it 
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
I mean sic wid it 
 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it 
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
I'm talkin sic wid it 
 
(E-40) 
Livin in California ain't always to cute 
Like New Orleans 
You can fuck around and get yo head put on flat in a road rage dispute
The poor get poorer 
And the rich keep gettin richer 
These hoers keep pourin 
And the spicks keep getting slicker
I play the game for what it s worth 
Hard like penitentiary steel not soft like a Nerf
I know some cats, seriously homey maybe twice, 
ain't neva been pass four blocks in they li-a-life 
dudes can't even dream a dream about gettin paid 
just sittin on the corner sittin there for about a decade
I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm a rebel 
Some cats'll bury their self alive 
just to prove they know how to use a shovel
And about you sounding like everybody else ass rappers knock my flow
But in the back of your head you really be sayin 
that their nigga right their be snappin   
that nigga from the bay
I ain't even gon lie pimpin 
That nigga a fool right their 
He got a fool style 
That nigga their can go&amp;go  
 
(Chorus)
Clown wit it, Clown wid it 
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
I mean sic wid it 
 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it 
Pimpin mob wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Player boss wit it
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
Give a fuck wit it 
Clown wit it, Clown wid it
I'm talkin sic wid it</pre>
