[Afrika Bambaataa]
True school, you got to stop BS'in, with this
New school you got to stop BS'in with this
Cause y'all don't know that y'all ALL are bein controlled by corporations
Where's your hip-hop museum? Where's your hip-hop doctors?
Where's your hip-hop judges? Hip-Hop lawyers?
Where's our hip-hop agriculturalists? Our hip-hop army?
We better have some hip-hop police police our hip-hop self
if we gon' do all this killin
We are at war brothers and sisters...
{*leads into "Everybody Rise"*}</pre>
