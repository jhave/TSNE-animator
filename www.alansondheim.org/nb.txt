sometime we should aid the world in killing
human scum that populates the earth -
there's nothing that could be more thrilling
than human slaughter - beginning first with birth
and moving upward - no one spared the knife
or poison bullet which will do the trick
in taking care of this pest and its life
creating chaos - illness - driving fauna sick
as victims rove as if they were a shunt
from one horrific moment to the next -
while there's no stopping humans from the hunt -
it's built into our genes - our muscles flex
to take us out before it's much too late
for holocaust - and victims' guilt bears fate

struggling with landscape -
it infuriates me - 
there's always a perspective i want to rid myself of all perspective
of seeing without positioning or without eye
it is my obsession
it is as if it mocks me
everywhere it sees
it says look where you are you can't see me otherwise anotherwise
it's true i can't
but i keep trying
there are always new times and spaces but i keep trying
it's my discomfort with landscape
i would efface every human eye on this earth
these are blind works
they refuse me as i make them
i refuse to talk about them
it is my obsession

MY MIND ON BUSH (READ ON)


Because of the fact that we cannot, absolutely cannot, analyze this hated
fuhrer of ours any further (fuhrer-further), not even for a farthing
(fuhrer-further-farthing), there remains only the possibility of an
examination of the faring (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring) of our hatred
for his forming (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring-forming) of the most
violent furious (fuhrer-further-farthing-faring-forming-furious) regime
this bloody country has been subjected to as long as I can remember.

Our hatred knows no bindings or bounds; were it legal, I would hoist the
man to toast his incarcerated body, held by a military tribunal, within
its desiccated stockade. He was born barren. He is evil and believes -
beeviles - in an evil god. He lives - evils - in an ugly world. His
ugliness wears ours thin. He sleeps in his livery - evilry. We are
bedeviled - bedeviled. He is vile - evil. He should not be alive - aevil.
We are no longer lively - evilly. We are believed - bedevile - veiled - 
eviled - and dead. We are dead.

Limbs


Both the my work and the world fundamentally consist of four types of 
Limbs:

Limbs - undefined primitives of which nothing more need be said;

Interstitial Limbs - which appear in the midst of others, therefore 
possessing multiple borders, cohesions, and lubricants;

Supernumerary Limbs - which appear as extraneous or useless extensions 
from interstitial or phantom limbs, therefore breaking with any 
conceivable tradition, and suitably protected from external atmospheric 
processes or considerations;

And Phantom Limbs - which are ontologically impaired, peripheral, and
largely responsible for inscriptive, cultural, or other manifestations.

Consider among other things, the limbic, limnology, the limen, the
limner. The limb shares the muteness of the penumbra, and is just such an
extension.

Examine the world: examine the limb.

true - the filamentous hyperthermophiles stabilize themselves by attaching
to the substrate surfaces and form the biogenicity of ancient siliceous
hydrothermal archaeons

insights into the structure and substrate interactions of the basis for
interpreting the biosignatures for ancient hydrothermal ecosystems and
