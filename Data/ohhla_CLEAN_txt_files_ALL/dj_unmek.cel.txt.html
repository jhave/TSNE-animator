[Intro] [Celph Titled talking]
What you want now? What you want now? Celph Titled
Motherfuckin' DJ Unknown &amp; Mek (that's right). Feeding you assorted biscuits
Hollow tip kiwi you know how I do. Yo, check my ace boon coon cameo
It's goes somethin' like this, hope y'all can dig this
Yo check it, check it, check it

Yo, I hold rappers hostage
Spit saliva that's toxic
From the NYC to the F-L-A tropics
AR-15 schitzo
Make your chest blow
Nothing to say like Greg Nice without the echo
A cross between C4 and C3-PO
Explosive intelligence
Pack the heavy metal 
Out the window
With that demo that you're tryin' to sell me
I'd rather listen to a Rob Base comeback LP
It's not healthy for you to come around here like that
Run your mouth off like that
Get your wig pushed back like that
I'll make you swallow the grenade
And put the envelope and stamp in your hand
And mail the pen to Afghanistan
What I say makes sense in the mind state I'm in
While you Babylon/babble on, like the Mediterranean?
Throw you down the escalator just to sterilize you
Deranged doctor
With the scalpel to slice through 
Anyone who contest
My cliques hard as nails
It'll be a done/dunn deal like Mobb Deep on sale
Escaped convict
Puttin' out mob hits
You probably a homo, that shave your armpits
You ain't real
You ain't seen the streets before
Hold the heat before
Know what it's like not to eat before
When I speak words I make it clear to you
That what I do in a minute
Would take you a year to do

[Scratches]
"Wanna be hardcore but don't know what it is
To get paid in the streets or to really get biz"</pre>
