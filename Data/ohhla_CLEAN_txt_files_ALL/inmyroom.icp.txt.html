[Verse - Violent J]
2:45 and the bell went off
Thank God, many people think I'm odd
But I talk with no one and I walk alone
And I avoid sunlight with a chalky tone
I get home and don't say hi, it ain't no one there
I don't care I walk in and go right up the stairs
To my room, get in bed and just wait for dark
Because that's when the real show start (tap tap)
"Tap tap" on the glass go the piece of ass
So young and pretty it's too bad she past
But she comes to my room and we talk at night
She's demonic and bloody, but she holds me tight
In my bedroom, with her I'm never alone
And I kiss her cold lips until the morning come
Then she gone, I can still hear her voice loom
But she only exist in the dark of my room

[Hook - (Violent J) &amp; {Shaggy 2 Dope}]
Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

[Verse - Violent J]
I try to smile a lot, but I'm always frontin'
But I do love a ghost and at least that's somethin'
She don't talk much, when she do it gets cold
Usually we just lay there and we hold each other
We're lovers, we don't need others
One of my mother's cats jumped up on the covers
And it scared my baby, guess she don't like pets
So I twisted it's fuckin' head off at the neck
Look baby, it's bloody, it's gone, it's doomed
Please...come back to the room
I'll do anything for thy, don't ignore me
This is more than a sick love story
Without you I'd bring a shotgun to school
And I will if you want me to for any reason
I hate that you leave when the lights come on
And if I had it my way the fuckin' sun would be gone

[Hook - (Violent J) &amp; {Shaggy 2 Dope}]
Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

[Verse - Violent J]
Sometimes I kiss her, I start shakin'
She slips me the tongue and it tastes like bacon
Uh oh, something's wrong baby's upset
She told me she was spotted by the neighbor's kid
She can't come back now 'cause they know our secret
Unless I can make them keep it
If I do she may come to life
Now I'm in their yard with a shotgun and knife
Cut the screen, went in and found the kid
Blew a bowl of spaghetti in the side of his head
And the daddy was next runnin' down the hall
I shredded his throat and he was quick to fall
Tossed the Mossberg and gripped the knife
Started stabbin' the shit outta his wife
Went home a bloody mess with a job well done (tap tap)
Wash up and wait for my baby to come (tap tap)

[Hook - (Violent J) &amp; {Shaggy 2 Dope}]
Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

Love..(I can't ignore you)
In my room..(do anything for you baby) {tap tap}
Love..(I do adore you)
In my room..you and I...{Tap tap go the piece of ass}

[Bridge - Violent J &amp; (Shaggy 2 Dope)] - x3
I waited 2 or 3 days, 4 days
Waitin' for the "tap tap" like always
I waited and hated this (tap tap)
I created a bloody mess (tap tap)

I waited 2 or 3 months, 4 months
Waitin' for the "tap tap" just for once
I waited and hated this (tap tap)
I created a bloody mess (tap tap)
