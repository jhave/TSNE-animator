[RZA]
Yo, yo, back on the track
Bound to make your neck snap
Like riding the Scream Machine with no seat strap
Bob, bitch, hot throb, bitch
Get on your job, bitch, suck my knob, bitch
And get the fuck out my face
I ain't got no time and I ain't got no space
I pop again until you're finished
I'm charged up like Popeye and two cans of spinach
Laid out in a beach in Venice
Bitches all up in my grill like the dentist
Talking "Bobby, when we're gon' party?"
Big ass hoes with the pussy hair notty
Smoke until the throat get groggy
Fucking all night til the mirror go foggy
Cute cat like Heathcliff, I speak with the speech
Three gift, ginseng keep the meat stiff
If you wanna take a sniff or a whiff, bitch
Bow down, get the fuck on your knees
And just don't squeeze my nuts too hard
I won't slap your butt too hard
But let me just fuck you hard
Hard, hard --- listen

[Chorus: Free Murda]
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
When you know you a freak on the inside
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
See them rims, rotating on that G5
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
You a dime, fat ass and them thick thighs
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
I'm trynna do nice things for the whole night

[ShaCronz]
You can catch Crizzy with a bad freak
We got hoes that take care of us, my team's spoiled like bad meat
We rotten like bad teeth, roll with mad heat
TV's in the rearview, with armored glass seats
If I like your butt, means I like the cut
Weight on triple beams, bitch price is up
Fight the rush, on sight, we like to bust
Steel, hype as fuck, team nice as fuck, what?

[RZA]
I bring catarack on forty feet back
And I bang rap beats over 43 tracks
Wu-Wear fleece and a Gucci lenin
Get drunk with the cops, fucking police women
Playing poker with the squadron sergeant
Get free food and clothes, muthafuck the bargain
The black ghetto prince, leave no metal print
Get put through the hood on the back of an elephant
Police escort, gat in the JanSport
Napsack, plus I just left court
And I was late for that court date
Because I was up all night fucking Strawberry Shortcake
Bad Power Rule from out of Pelon
Who had the pink &amp; blue panties, do like the neon
Lights, the free on ice, the ebon' life
Clothes drop like one blow from the Leon fight, listen

[Chorus]

[Outro: Free Murda]
So fly, on the inside
So fly, on that G5
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
You a dime, fat ass and them thick thighs
Ma, stop acting like you so fly
I'm trynna do nice things for the whole night</pre>
