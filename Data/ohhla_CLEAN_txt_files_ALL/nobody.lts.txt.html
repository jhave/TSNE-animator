[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Everybody love me (NO)
Mom and Daddy love me (NO)
All my neighbors love me (nope)
Someone gotta love me (NOOO)
Everybody love me (NO)
Mom and Daddy love me (NO)
Anybody that has heard of me
I know they love me (NOOO)

(Monoxide Child)
Everybody treats me like uh...I'm the anti-christ
They wanna kill my momma for givin' me the life
I'm out my tree yhey say I walk a different way
Get on your knees and pray Lotus is your judgment day
I like to hang with the hookers and wine-os
And let them give me tats with they heroin needles what?
I love to kiss on the bitches with bad breath
And choke her by the neck while I just fuck her to death

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Now tell me Do you love me? Or do you love me not? Nahh?
Well kiss my ass the red eye marks the spot
Tell me how ya be behind my back and always hate
To my face be straight 'bout to make me catch a murder case
Tell me what make your brain tick? what the fuck
To even find the lotus clique well ya gotta look
But you can't see us with tri-focal heat specs
Matter of fact muther fuck you and my rep

[Chorus]

(Violent J)
Come over here I wanna tell you a story, it's an ugly one
It's about neden, and how I can't get none
I could have cocaine cum with a crack pipe dick
And I couldn't get a basehead to buff my shit
Speakin' of crackheads I am a crackhead
I mean I don't smoke but I gotta crack in my head
My daddy used to slap my face around with a brick
Until finally the back of my cranium split
I took my shoelace off and sewed it back shut
I wear this goofy wig now to hide the cut look!
Nobody loves me i'll be quick to admit it
My momma says she loves me but she won't let me hit it i'm kiddin'
Then you got my brothers, they call me mental case
They beat me up and put they cigarettes out on my face
AAAAUGH!! My head throbs
I'm about to enroll in Columbine and finish the fucking job
POP POP POP POP!!

[Chorus]

"Hi Kelly. It's me, J. Listen
 I know you don't like me callin' you and stuff but
 fuck you, you know, I mean, gimme a chance.
 I'm not that stale. I mean, just because..."

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Terrible thoughts run through my mind causin' my head to fill with anger
Anybody I don't know I wanna strangle
Does it make me such a bad guy?
Y'all like live bitches I like the dead kind
Hang with killas creep like phantoms in the darkness
And even though we like to murder we ain't heartless
Can't help it I got a bad reputation
For devastation, all out panic, for decapitation

(Jamie Madrox)
Don't nobody love ya, don't nobody care
They'd rather sit and stare and make fun of my hair
I'm a killa, i'm a devil, i'm a punk, i'm a traitor
My momma hate my guts but I could never ever hate her
And this bitch I used to fuck say my dick to small
She wasn't sayin' that when she took it all in the jaw
And all my dawgs and my true friends think I'm insane
They say "Jamie doesn't rationalize or talk in normal ways"

[Chorus]

"Just give me a chance and call me back.
 Ya know, just give me 5 minutes. Just gimme 5 fuckin' minutes.
 Just quit suckin' dicks like a fucking cunt bitch and call me back.
 I'm askin' for a second chance. Everything I do is always my fault.
 You're such a fuckin' slutty fuckin' WHORE. CALL ME BACK, BITCH!"</pre>
