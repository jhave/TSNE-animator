[Canibus]
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you

[Canibus]
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
I still got a lot of fight in me too
It's the dragon in me, against the tiger in you
It's already around my neck, they want to tighten the loop
Ten steps ahead, twenty steps behind you
Spit a rhyme in your ear just to frighten your boo
Most niggaz rather ask me, 'You nicer than who?'
When they really want to ask me, 'Who's nicer than you?
The mic on the bicep is the proof, it ain't a lie it's the truth
I'm just doing what I'm [___A___] to do
I'm a two-thousand and two Canibus type-two
Mic guru with gurus and [___B___] too
Modules with blood vessel designed tube and
My mind is moving to rewrite blueprints with new ink
Click on Canibus and choose a link
I abuse how you think, just get off my dick
Rhymes so cold, I spit block-ice
Gotta wear night socks at night, to stop vocal cord frostbite
The R-type I.P.P.E.R. aconite
Burning [___C___] and dark Hip-Hop nights

[Canibus]

You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you
You know who snatched the mic from you know who
But let's keep that between me and you</pre>
