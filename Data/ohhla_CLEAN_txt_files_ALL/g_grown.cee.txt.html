Hey
Little boy you're not allowed to stay
You have to evolve inevitably
And I've sure come a long way

The road up ahead is so unclear
Back slidin down the bottom of beer
Nobody knew if I would make it here

Sweet music set me free
From the statistic that I started to be
I wish my mama was alive to see

The memories of pain have scarred
And when I fall it's usually hard
But I get up and keep followin' God

Hey, I'm Gettin' grown, (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin grown
I'm Gettin grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin grown, hey

Now I remember the good ol' days
Broads and boxes and blunts to blaze
Now I got three children to raise

I never won't be perfect I know
But workin on it is worse than I know
Life is just learning as you go

Been selfish once or twice
I had to learn how to sacrifice
To live to my late nineties be nice

Every day that goes by I find
It either hits me or it robs me blind
God I owe you this life of mine

I'm gettin grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin grown, 
I'm gettin grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin grown
(whistling)

Oooo, time changed but it feels the same, 
There's no tellin what tommorow will bring, 
Even if I could I wouldn't change a thang

Hey, Lord I know I'm not here to stay
But thanks for wakin' me up today
Prepare me for what may come my way

Say, young man, there's no need to cry
Because I know you will get by
Look your destiny in the eye

Everyday my heart burns to try
You got to walk before you learn to fly
And we all got to earn to die

I'm gettin' grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin' grown
I'm gettin' grown (la la la la la, la la la la la) I'm gettin' grown
