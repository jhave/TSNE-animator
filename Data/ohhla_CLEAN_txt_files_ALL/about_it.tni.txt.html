[Dr. Dre]
Hey, hey hold up a minute
Let me stop up here and use this pay phnoe real quick
[* Telephone dialing * ] [* Sighs *]
Hey, hey Toni, it's me, I was just calling ya know
Just calling to let you know, don't wait up for me tonight
I mean I just got a lot of things on my mind
I gotta think about, you know
Just umm, I'll be over Brian's house
You know, just for tonight
I mean, I know things are different, but you know
It's not you, it's me, you know, it's really me, you know
And basically, I just think I'ma need some space

[Toni Braxton]
Why you calling me on the phone
Why you're not at home on time
You say you're staying over your friends
Cause you've got a lot on your mind
Now you're swearing up and down that it ain't me
So you say that things have changed
So tell me what exactly does it mean
When you say you need your space
Just don't make no excuses, no no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no (Just be a man about it)
If you wanna leave (Why do you wanna leave) go on
(Just be a man about it)
Come and grab your things (So come and get your things and leave)
And go on right now, whoo (Just be a man about it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Dr. Dre]
I mean, you gotta understand I love you
You know what I'm saying
And I love you enough to say that I think
I think you deserve somebody better than me, you know
And right now, I can't give you what you need, you know
I mean, I wanna love you and I'm gonna love you
One day but you know...
I mean, you just gotta understand where I'm coming from

[Toni Braxton]
You say right now that you're not what I'm looking for
And what you really need is time to grow
You're promising that one day you may come around
And I'm supposed to let that go
But where the hell do you get off
Telling me your mama said I'm not what you need
Tell you what, since she knows it all
Then that's where you need to be
Just don't make no excuses, no no

[Chorus]
Why you gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
(Baby you ain't gotta lie to me, no no no)
Baby, you don't gotta lie to me, no (Just be a man about it)
(If you wanna leave, go right now)
Why do you wanna leave (Just be a man about it)
(Come and get your things and go baby)
So come and get your things and leave (Just be a man about it)

[Toni Braxton]
Can you tell me how
You can say you're in love
And then treat me so bad
Boy, you know it just ain't right
I cannot believe the way you handled things
You want to lie
If you were a man...

[Chorus to fade]
Why you gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
(Just be a man about it baby)
You don't gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
(You ain't gotta lie to me, no no baby)
Why do you wanna leave (Just be a man about it)
(If you wanna go grab your things and leave now)
So come and get your things and leave (Just be a man about it)
(Don't wanna stay, don't wanna be no more lying)

(If you wanna go on and leave, just be a man about it)
Why you gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
(You ain't gotta be here so leave no)
You don't gotta lie to me (Just be a man about it)
(Baby just be a man whoo)
Why do you wanna leave (Just be a man about it)
So come and get your things and leave (Just be a man about it)</pre>
