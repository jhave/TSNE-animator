[ Charlie Wilson ]
You have no idea 
[ Roger Troutman ]
(You have no idea)
[ Charlie Wilson ]
what I'm goin through
[ Yolanda Harris/Shirley Murdoch ]
(You have no idea)

[ VERSE 2: KAM ]
How much mo' can I take
I'm all alone in a world gone mad
Brothers is doin bad
I had hopes and dreams, it seems like though nobody care
Who says life is fair cause ain't no justice out here nowhere
I prepare myself to hold court right here in the street
Don't come at me with no b.s., homie, give me five feet
I can't get no sleep, peace and quiet or rest
I got ulcers, migraines and pains in my chest
So God bless my soul, I feel old when I'm not
But physically and mentally I'm going through a lot
I know my time on this big blue baloon is short
Stress and pray everyday while people playin sport
Worry myself sick, so I be tryin to stay active
But death is lookin more and more attractive
Lord have mercy, why me, I know you ain't make no mistake
But look at what a brother down here goin through for yo sake

[ Roger Troutman ]
(So much stress and trials and tribulations)
[ Yolanda Harris/Shirley Murdoch ]

[ Charlie Wilson ]
It's so bad out here
The young killing the young
It's so bad, makes me sad
You have no clue
You have no idea

(Don't you know it's drivin me mad)

[ Charlie Wilson/Roger Troutman ]
You have no idea what I'm goin through

[ VERSE 2: KAM ]
Don't think I'm happy, homie, just because you see me grinnin
But honest, ma, stress got my head spinnin
And I'm just tryin to be polite, I had a real rough night
And I don't wanna see no friends until I get my ends right
I got enough problems, and it's messin up my health
I keep puttin my family and friends before myself
When I'm the one who need help but too proud to ask for it
When there's somethin wrong with me y'all be the last to know it
Cause I don't show it, I handle it and privately suffer
Havin patience is a mutha
Trials and tribulations, that's how my lessons begin
I'm overpowered by death and the impressions of men
I'm tryin to overcome these obstacles that I meet
With women, kids, work, religion and my friends in the street
I done spread myself too thin, fell into a trap
And I'm just about ready to snap

What can we do?
[ Yolanda Harris/Shirley Murdoch ]
(What can we do?)
[ Roger Troutman ]
(What can we do?)

(Teenage babies)
[ Yolanda Harris/Shirley Murdoch ]
(Teenage babies)
