[it's just between you and me]
[i've got something' to say]
[i wanna get it straight]
[before the sun goes down]

Sorrow is a lonely feeling
Unsettled is a painful place
I've lived with both for far too long now
Since we've parted ways
I've been wrestling with my conscience
And I found myself to blame
If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel my pride away

[Chorus]
Just between you and me
I've got something' to say
Wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom now
Just between you and me
I've got something to say

If confession is the road to healing
Forgiveness is the promised land
I'm reaching out in my conviction
I'm longing to make amends
So, i'm sorry for the words i've spoken
For i've betrayed a friend
We've got a love that's worth preserving
And a bond I will defend

[Chorus]

In my pursuit of god, I thirst for holiness
As I approach the son, I must consider this
Offenses unresolved, they'll keep me from the throne
Before I go to him my wrong must be atoned

If there's to be any resolution
I've got to peel this pride away

Just between you and me
I've got something' to say
I wanna get it straight
Before the sun goes down
Just between you and me
Confession needs to be made
Recompense is my way to freedom
It's my way to freedom

It's my way to freedom (2X)
I've got something to say, so let me say it today
It's my way to freedom (2X)
I've got something to say, confession needs to be made
It's my way to freedom (2X)
I've got something to say, confession needs to be made
It's my way to freedom (2X)
I've got something to say</pre>
