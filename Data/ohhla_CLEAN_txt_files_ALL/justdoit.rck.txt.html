[Hook 1: Pharoahe Monch (Pete Rock)]
(Yeah), uhh, (uhh), yes
Yes, uhh, come on, (do it), yeah, uhh
You want that iced out watch don't ya (right)
You want a brand new glock don't ya (right)
You want to hold the block down for ya mens locked down
Till they get back home, Just Do It (Just Do It)
You want to start the revolution right (right)
You wanna burn the constitution right (right)
You want a solution for wack motherfuckers on the mic
Anyday all day, Just Do It, (just do it), just do it
(Live long, stay strong, just do it)

[Verse 1: Pharoahe Monch]
I get attacked by a wack marine rap machine
Or some brilliant current team seem when I dream
Fuck those individually iMac's on wide screen
Space shit from the basement like ?fyleens?, I mean
For real dog how you fuckin' with my team
We gleam shine like 7-45 high beam
You seem fine like menage a trois the fly scenes
Like you wait the sirenes and then I scheme to see
Niggaz online for coke and do line
Make a thousand a line man I ain't lyin'
That's sixteen g's a verse without tryin'
If you fail mathematics than press rewind
Please, do not get it twisted like rubic
Got emcees runnin' back for their teams like Mike Ruic
You wanna obtain things pursue it
For in the game remain strong and just do it

[Hook 2: Pete Rock]
Just do it anyway you pursue it
Pete Rock Pharoahe Monch can't be touched along
(Just do it,) just do it cause we roll right through it
Show love how we do this move back and pursue it kid
(Come on just do it,) just do it cause the street music
Come on bounce to it your body's movin'
(Just do it,) just do it cause there's nothing else to it
Live long stay strong, just do it

[Verse 2: Pharoahe Monch (singin till -)]
In this world today, too many people tryin' to maintain
We gon' take the liberty to explain something to you
Ain't nothing to it, your dreams just pursue it
Lord lord lord lord come on just -
Brace yourself for the awesome in wear
Pete Rock, Pharoahe in your atmos..
I'ma survive the desert of Queens like cactus
Maxin' in the cut with a vaccin for wackness
Why I react tactical flows with rap madness
My weaponry is definitely not average
Put a astrofist by my name for bein' passive
The bassist in the game should've been got they ass kicked
On the Pete Rock tip, we hit the streets
Like we rock classic Pete Rock funk or then the jazz shit
It's digitally remastered
Critically acclaimed black funk soul from the past hits
Pete's my numero uno soul a mano
I'm mister Jameson I set it off like Serreano
With the disco fluid from Queens to Frisco
Set it off, just do it

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Just do it, yeah, Pete Rock, 2003 come on</pre>
