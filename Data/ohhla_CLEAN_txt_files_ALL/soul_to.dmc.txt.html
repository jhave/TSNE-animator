[Run]	Rock the house!
Gonna tell you bout a groove comin from the heart
Gonna make your body move, climbin up the chart
These ducks tryin to prove that you got the art
better move better move better do your part
Get busy, get a job, stop messin around
Say isn't this fly, how can he get down?
Black bone to the hand givin up the hug
Crack known to the fans SAY NO TO DRUGS
Gotta lotta ambitions, as I was told
Now the heart stop wishin, 'fore you get old
Gotta speech and teach, reach for your goal
We the king here to bring with a lot of soul!

"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK", "I'm the king of.."  "ROCK"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
 "I'm the king.."

[DMC]	That's crowned, to rule the sound
Fly world renowned, from town to town
My hat's my helmet, my mic's my sword
My ?'s by the door so PRAISE THE LORD
Born a King, to rule this thing
Treats are the beats that battles bring
I can't be beat, I won't retreat
Victory is sweet, so I defeat
Like a slave I gave, the world I saved
This is the hated and ungrateful tool that's raised
Not to be cool, I rock and rule
I'm crowned with a jewel cause I'm down to duel
You bled from my blow, so know one thing
that you gotta be strong and as real as the KING

"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK", "I'm the king of.."  "ROCK"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
 "I'm the king.."

[both]	KING, MEANS RATED SUPREME
FROM QUEENS, NEVER SELLIN OUR DREAM
IT'S D, JOE, THAT THEY DON'T KNOW
OUR TEAM YO, I AM A PRO
DON'T BELIEVE, ME, YOU CAN GO ASK JOE
OR GO TO SEE, DEE, NINE TIMES THE DOUGH
RAISE HELL, YELL, FOR ETERNITY
RUN-D.M.C., K-I-N-G!

"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK AND ROLL!"
"I'm the king of.."  "ROCK", "I'm the king of.."  "ROCK"
"I'm the kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing OF ROCK!!!"</pre>
