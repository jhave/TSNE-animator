Ugh, Ugh, Ugh, Ugh
Aiyo I woke up in a daze wit da slight headache
You know tha usual tha studio gettin red late
Serious jetlag when I get to bed late
That why I fuck cause I be weak when I get head late
Today I got a session wit Ronnie I mean Veronica
Met her last year about a week before Hanukkah
Sounds foolish I mean honey wasnt jewish
But she had a lot of dough and she was nice on computers
She told me she was born and raised in Bermuda
And came here to get a job as a tutor
I pursued make a long story short screwed her
She moved and she came back still on tha same track
Same wit same chips ass it was still fat
I aint really think she wuz a freak
But she did ask a lotta questions bout Stylez and Sheik
She called me and said she was in town fo a week
The Westside, Manhattan, the Suite and tha Marquise
How I felt about gettin up fo old times sake
Ima bring Stylez and Sheik wit me datta be great
Jus have two friendz we gon bring da truck and tha new Benz
Desert in da stashin da Sony cam zoom lens
All have ourselves one big hell of a weekend
Eat at Puffs joint an catch a show at tha beacon
Twist a dutch blaze from Y-O to the Hudson
Pass tha tall one 2-5 we still puffin
We got tha heat on a cold night n da winter
Stylez you remember, Sheik you remember

(Sheek)
Oh yeah, I remember dem hoes dat night
We wuz at da beacon right
Chris Tucker performing
All of us wuz in der outside it wuz stormin
Cats and Dogs
Aiyyo dese hoes wuz tough
Besides tha air condition on high we wuz icy enough
From my neck to da belt buckle to our shoes shall i go on
Wit 5 of us up front he needed shades to perform
Mose from tha flo up we inside toe up
I drink dey smoke no coke
Besides tha shit he said on stage tha cash we had on us wuz no joke
I slid fo seats down she sittin der smilin
Lookin like she from an island not them chicks dat be out wilin
Told me dat her name wuz Cindy
Favorite show Mark and Mindy
Favorite color green no kids but plan to have plenty
We chit den chat bout dis n dat
From what kind of whip she push
To what bar she be at
She played hard to get
But we made it from tha movie to tha jacuzzi
From tha jacuzzi to the bed
We fucked until we both got woozy
Woke up breath stinkin
Yawnin and shit
I smelt breakfast in tha kitchen but where wuz da bitch
I walked in der it wuz cheese eggs and grits on da table
Wit beef sausages and orange juice next to da cable
Wit a note sayin sorry I had to rob you baby but
I need  cash like you I aint your ordinary slut
or dick teaser please I need food in my freezer
and by the time you read dis note I done been spent yo Visa

(Stylez)
I remember Beatrice but niggas like me call her B
Cause she like to fuck doggy style plus hold da D
But now I got to handle dis cause dey skandalous
Cindy robbed shiek and moved to Los Angeles
Like I wont killa frienz
Went to bounce stole a Benz
Note in tha garage
Tu yall ontaraj
Yall 3 rugged niggas but yall gotta get robbed
Dont take it personal we didnt finish the job
Manaje Twa
We kill niggas wit dey dick hard
They got me lookinat da letta stuff
Why da fuck dey left da truck
3 bitches in my house
probly try to wet me up
Crept to tha kitchen
Seen Ronnie by the cabanet
Tried tha gun holster with tha forty fo maganet
Shot her in da heart
Den caught tha earchess fabanet
Den I seen Cindy
Tha bitch tried to end me
Running out da living room
Bustin off Kissimee
The bitch couldnt aim
So I blew her out da frame
Turned around to Beatrice
Why you look speachless
We could have lived it up and jus fucked on tha beaches
And now you gotta die
And da stupid bitch is reaching
Bfo I cocked it back
I heard tires screeching
Saw Sheek and James
Started muthafucking squeezin
