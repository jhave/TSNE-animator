[Verse 1 - Louis Logic]
Well it's the clown prince of the rhyming with a buzz like a bee hive
Always willing to separate a slut from her Levi's
And I don't need 3 tries like some of these weak guys
I'll tell 'em sweet lies until I'm stuck in-between thighs
I get a rush sippin suds with lightweights
Pass my glass of Vodka ask 'em how the spite tastes
For Christ sake this nigga's as cold as the ice age
Here I go again taking cheap shots at White Snake
And just as the Starship faced terrible hardship
Nothings gonna stop us now from settin' the mosh pit
Whenever the Logic and Lexicon mix
It' upsets your mom quick 'cause we're a step beyond sick

[Verse 2 - Celph Titled]
Runnin up on stage with a motherfuckin' gun out
Throw them hands in the air before I let them dum dum's out
I'm sellin' records nigga, makin' a killin'
At your crib with a black ski mask, makin' a killin'
Makin' a million before I'm 30
If not I'm gettin' dirty
Beat you with a 3 Iron until you see the birdies
You ain't under-par, leave you under a car
With big-foot monster trucks lining up from afar
Celph Titled's a star
Get my pimp cup filled at the bar
Bitches massaging me and feeling my scars
And after they're through, get the fuck out my bed
Impale your skull with my CD, now you got my song stuck in your head!

[Hook - 2X]
Rock to the rhythm with them
Got to give it to them
Got to give a lot more than the minimum

Rock to the rhythm with them
Got to give it to them
Go to give a lot more

[Verse 3 - Big Oak]
You gotta rock to the rhythm, can't just say that
You gotta display that, shit man no time to be laid back
Ryu, Celph, J, and Louis on the same track
With the L, give them hell, swingin' like its payback
Wrote a song that's not dope we can change that
Oak's at your door to repair that shit like Maytag
Not for nothin' cause you know we need a wage, Jack
"Fuck you, pay me", ya S.O.B. explain that
We'll take the money to the bar with the same cats
Who can out-drink anybody from here to White Plaines and back
Youth Is Yours, motherfucker where's your brain at?
2004, we get more spins than Pat Sajak

[Verse 4 - Nick Fury]
I was young man, a little kid in big sneakers
Attitude and ego twice the size of the speakers
I met hip hop, dated her, fucked her
Fell madly in love, and eventually I hated her
It was all her, I said it was me
Started to see other people, so goes the story
And me? I went right for her older sister
Every girl in her family I probably kissed her
And her? Depressed by her dude of the day
So she was vibin' pretty hard when I saw her yesterday
Me and the crew got her drunk and wild
And now she can't seem to wipe the smile

[Hook]

[Verse 5 - Ryu]
Yo when I rock it's like I'm poppin' off gats
With sharpened up raps that penetrate tanks in Iraq
You fakin' them jacks
I'ma start drinkin' then snap
Your ankle and dangle you off the (?) map
Yo who that? (??) guzzling rum
Life of the party with balls like I'm smuggling plums
I'm on the above, cocky, arrogant, great range
Ain't been in a damn battle since I was in the 8th grade
So you wanna freestyle? The answer is no
Take your faggot Von Dutch hat and pamper to go
Teach you how to stunt quick; I'm a dick when I get dough
I'm spending my whole rip on a bottle and 6 hoes

[Verse 6 - J-Zone]
J-Zone you can't beat with a bat, you need to relax
I got a big dick and big ego to match
You actin' hard at your show
10 years ago I bet you wore your pants backwards and listened to Quo
So kill that bullshit around me playa
Attitude is gettin' worse and I ain't even on a major
I walk with a swagger like I owe you bastards
Like Suge owns everybody's masters
I like musical hoes, yup, that's my weakness
And your gave my balls the harmonica treatment
"Fuck you prick! Eat a dick" is my motto
I'm not the type to pay a trick; she's better off hittin' lotto
