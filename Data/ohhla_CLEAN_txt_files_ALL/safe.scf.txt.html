I got the new 'Face tape I'm about to, pop in the deck for you niggaz
Turn up your radios

[Scarface]
You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggaz done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
and lived off the five, and never ever fuck with ya safe
But when

[Chorus]
When he hustle and he robbin
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin

[Scarface]
I'm bout my paper, these other niggaz slang for the sport
Like unaware tommorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggaz get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
to set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
to be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
it's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggaz want they come up
so bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggaz is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
And feel my homey, hittin my head to crack in my safe
And that's when

[Chorus]
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin (when these niggaz start robbin)
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin

[Scarface]
So listen up my niggaz, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggaz gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thang
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggaz know where you stay
Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hit and you say..
.. true motherfuckin game.. true motherfuckin game

[Chorus]
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin</pre>
