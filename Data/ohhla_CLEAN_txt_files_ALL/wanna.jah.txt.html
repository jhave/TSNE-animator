[Intro]
Yo, yo, uh
Ja Rule, heh, Murder Inc.
Come on, come on
Yo. yo

1 - I'mma ride to the end of the road baby
    This life will drive me crazy
    Be gettin' right lately
    On the real, will it overtake me?
    Where all my gangsta's at? (Yeah)
    Where all my ladies at? (Ahhh)

Never gon' see life without the Lord, they say
What's a thug to do but kneel down and pray
Lord, forgive me
They're lookin' down on it
Sometimes I feel I need out of it
Spin me 'round one time
Close my eyes, then sleep
Want some Ja, baby?
I deserve all this
World, get off of me
Playa skip that jive, what it sound like?
Mad playas gettin' at Ja, don't even sound right
Like, now you caught in that whiplash, ? open eyed
You're all welcome, and you know you wanna live my life
May God help you
Am I possessed by my sacrifice?
Women and ice got me lovin' evil paradise
You feel me?

Repeat 1

My life is caught up in that madness
But I do deal with it
If the blood's your heart, live it
Baby, don't die wit it
Have to judge my soul (uh)
Trippin' outta control
Smashed up on the freeway
Gotta be ?, give me leave-way
Slidin' back into low, murderers don't fold
Any action need to be shown?
There we go, wrapped and sold
Always rap in front of my foes
I keep playas on they toes
Women know ?who get jacked doe?
Playas know to get that dough
We that heat, can't be froze
We that burnin' ? you ?
We them ones, destroyed your shows
We that platinum, not that gold
We them thugs, just too much
We them thugs you just can't touch
Y'all don't wanna deal with us
We them thugs, murderers

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

2 - How many wanna die wit me? (7x)
    How many wanna die wit me, die wit me?

Can't ya see they all wanna off my life
If you had your way, I would be dead, off side
What a shame, so now my love is high
People hatin' on Ja, ain't even half his size
Hey, you feel me?
Make me wanna get too close, it ain't no joke
I'm blown away, like bad, yo
You ain't know?
Ja Rule's the one, baby
? always be played with
Mess with me, get dealt with
Murder Inc., the clique baby
You feel me?

Repeat 1
