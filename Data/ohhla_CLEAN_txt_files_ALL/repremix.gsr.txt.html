Stick up kids is out to tax (2x)
And this is how the story goes

Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
'Cause in the night, you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a 4-5th, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
'Cause they could maybe bust you for self or wit a crew
No matter is you or your brother's a star
He could pop you in check without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame
From the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain
That the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way, he'll have the chain on his neck
Claimin' respect, Just to get a rep

Ten brothers in a circle
Had the kid trapped, the one wit the hood, he said, "We'll hurt you"
If you don't run out your dues and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See, they were on the attack
And one said, "Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?"
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the 3-8, yo, he was inchin
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings and ran frantic 
But shorty said, "Now" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gansta figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, mack and jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
'Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it
You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset
Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep
