I'm seein' sleep walkers, and as cheap as talk is
I'm feelin' nauseas speaking in this three ring with artists
Hearts set on dreams and contracts
They laugh with my brothers, know who's wondering where I'm at?
Bathing on stage savin' all for tomorrow
Maintaining' the sorrow in a coffee, a Marlboro
If the past has any reflections of the future
I don't see me on easy street
But the truth flirts with destiny
It's the remedy herb, we scream for longevity, with obscenity slur's
We prefer the best dressed and like being lied to
Gettin' signed upset to find I'm back in high school
Livin' out his window, all these roads shitty
These headies t-shirts, we hurt our own city
But the phone sits still though I owe these bills
Only focus on the thrills of the shows we killed
Can we rebuild? 'Cause the road to travel on is unraveling fast
While you grabbin' on to Babylon
Come with me, one foot on the bank
While you're laughin' downstream for to take all the goods
The name on the hood, the fame on the stage
So why you drowning with one leg on the bank?
Come with me, one foot on the bank
While you're laughin' downstream
For to take all the goods
The name on the hoods, the fame on the stage
So why you drowning with one (leg on the bank)
It makes no sense to me these fences screening off you
No chance to pass your analysis, I'm dreamin' through you
And time to stop burnin' my brain, it's time for certain
But the lines ain't working, shit sprayed on the train
It has to rain sometimes, but whys the sun hate us?
Trying' to hide this moon tan with two hands of make-up
But it's time to wake, I couldn't hold this wealth
Above these swelling' waves of hands, and this fame don't help
Dreaming' of letter box places, I'm better off taking' my time
But whys this ride half-pacin'?
And twice the car fare on the dot from what I got
To well a hundred blocks and it's never gonna stop
And when it does it's not fare, just felt like runnin' huh?
Wheres the blunt end try to tell the sun something
Your wishes won't float when you choke the fish bones
Above the fluid sewage for this colonists home
It's cold in the water, it don't hurt to live
Was it worth gettin' wet? You gotta learn to swim
Come with me, one foot on the bank
Why you laughin' down stream, for to take all the goods
Your name on the hoods, the fame on the stage
So why you drownin' with one leg on the bank?
Come with me, one foot on the bank
While you laughin' downstream, for to take all the goods
Your name on the hood, The fame on the stage
So why you drownin' with on leg on the bank?</pre>
