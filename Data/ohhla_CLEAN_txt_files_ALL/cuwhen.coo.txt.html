[Verse One: Coolio]
Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin and smokin
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
Cause my crew is rollin homers and your crew is rollin dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

[Chorus]
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

[Verse Two: Lek Ratt - 40 Thevz]
More temptation than faith, I guess we livin for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin lifted
I'm just tryin to take care of my kids and handle my business
Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the struggle
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag colour, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there with muted sounds bumpin

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: PS - 40 Thevz]
You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryina stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut till it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta put ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
Cause nothing worse than a quitter
you gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

[Chorus]

[Outro: Coolio]
As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

[Chorus] - to fade</pre>
