Verse 1: Lil' Pete
 
The Last Supper, the last hustla's, the last bad muthafuckers
We killing you suckas undercover
Brothers, and other niggas that's gone run up
Run in the chamber muthafuckers getting burnt up
Cause you done fucked up
You shouldn't of fucked wit dis
Go out to kill yo kids, and now we splittin' wigs
It's DSGB, you know we psychopath
We killing everybody, a Georgia bloodbath
And if we fucking come, go get the timebomb
I'm like a thunderstorm, I'm screaming "Red Rum"
Until you fucking dead, because I'm pumping lead
Directly at yo head, nigga we gotta eat
Just make my meal complete, a leg or a feet
And I'm gone eat you up cause I don't give a fuck
The Last Supper

The last niggas, the last supper
The last bad muthafuckers, the last hustla's
I asked the Lord to reveal the last niggas to me
And he told me its DSGB
 
The last, the last niggas, the last supper
The last bad muthafuckers, the last hustla's
I asked the Lord to reveal the last niggas to me
And he told me its DSGB
 
Verse 2: Blackoutt
 
This is the last fucking supper not the daily bread
And so to any interruptions we choppin heads
We choppin' legs lettin 'em marinate
And I'ma hustla in this game I pull is penetrate
Eliminate, bitch niggas buy the 12 pack
I walk wit Outbacks and tilt my fucking fitted hat
I asked God to reveal the real me
My vision was kind of blury but appeared an O.G., O.G.
And Lord have mercy on me on me
And Lord have mercy on DSGB
We riding on niggas until the day we fucking die
And when we die, we still gone fucking ride
So how bout piercing till these muthafuckers bleed
I'm choppin' 'em down to they muthafucking knees

Verse 3: Pinhead
 
This is The Last Supper, break bread with real niggas
We choppin heads, ain't scared to kill niggas
For real nigga, slow it down and we'll be fine
You can have my blood, drank up cause it is wine
Your soul is mine, you pursuing my wicked thoughts
And the way you move and the slick shit that you talk
DSGB, come in and have a seat
See all this food, sit down and let's eat
And you will see better days they shall come
And if they don't get yo gun and drop bombs
The Last Supper

Verse 4: Pastor Troy
 
My body the bread, my blood the wine
Pastor Troy and "My niggas is the grind"
Ain't got no time for no fake muthafuckers
Bitch say ya grace, this the last fucking supper
We hustla's nigga, I'm the muthafucking boss
Fresh out the womb till they nail me to the cross
Done took a lost, so you know my mindframe
"What the fuck that muthafucker name?"
On everythang I ever loved reppin thugs
DSGB you may drink of the blood
Now haters, just admit my perfection
And keep yo Smith &amp; Wesson
It is my resurrection </pre>
