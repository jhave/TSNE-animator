[Intro: Ryan Leslie]
Yeah! They tried to put me in the box!
It's impossible! R. Les!!! (Oh Yeah!)
And this time it's all or nothin (I said it's real!!! Ohhhhhh!!! Yeah!)
Listen!

[Verse 1: Ryan Leslie]
I'm a take ya ten rounds like a boxer baby
Show you how I put it down with rocks on lady
Promise ya ask ya when I'm done for more
I'm a switch it up and make life comfortable
I'm a be the reason your not sleepin baby
I'm a invade the thoughts you keepin baby
If your still not convinced I'll tell you more
Make you forget the way you felt before
Uh Oh! I can be your wake up reason daily
You could be my first and leadin lady
I'm a make you happy that you waited, for me to settle down
Uh Oh! I'm ready and I'm not afraid to say it
I'm tired of the game already played it
I'm over all them other girls I dated
I'll tell you what you are

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one that I quit the game for
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the reason  I quit the game for

[Verse 2: Ryan Leslie]
I can't explain just how much you shine
Give me your heart I'll give you mine
I'm puttin my future on the line
Baby it's just you, and I!!!!!!!!
From this day on let's make a deal
I'll stay true you keep it real
Don't be shy 'bout how you feel
Baby don't be shy! HEY!!!!!!
Uh Oh! I can be your wake up reason daily
You could be my first and leadin lady
I'm a make you happy that you waited, for me to settle down
Uh Oh! I'm ready and I'm not afraid to say it
I'm tired of the game already played it
I'm over all them other girls I dated
I'll tell you what you are

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie] (Kanye West)
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one that I quit the game for
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the reason  I quit the game for (Throw ya diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe!)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm in the club doin the same old two step
While Omegas doin the same old Q step
I have my money on my mind she was thinkin green
She's a pledge AKA she was kickn green
I want a good girl she want a gentleman
We sayin the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin game I was scrimmagin
My penmanship is so hard I need censorship
I'm a Chicagoian till Chicago end
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid
I just know I'm gettin one the other's gettin away

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one that I quit the game for
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the one, I put the rock on
Your my diiiiiiamond girl
Your the reason  I quit the game for

[Outro: Ryan Leslie]
Yeah! (Your my diamond girl) I know you wanna hear it again
(Yeah!) Run the record back (Your my diamond) R. Les! Yeah!
Uh! Just rock with it (Your my diamond) (It's Next Selection)
(Your my diamond girl!)</pre>
