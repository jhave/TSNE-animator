[P. Diddy]
Uh, this that sexy right here
Da Band baby
Bad Boy
Too Hot for T.V., yeah

[Chorus]

[Babs]
I like your style boy
I really need to know do you wanna chill with me?

[Dylan]
We can chill girl
Let's stop playing, you need to come roll with me

[Babs]
So what's the deal boy?
I got a little time, I really want a piece of you

[Dylan]
You know the deal girl
I'm down for whenever, whatever you wanna do

[Verse 1]

[Babs]
Hot damn boy, what's the plan?
I got a whole day free, I done ducked my man
Wassup?  Got the truck rimmed up last weekend
The haze that I blow got my interior stinking
Yeah, so what's the deal boy?
I'm trying to chill with you, I like your style
Baby don't get it twisted, I don't want your child
And I don't make prank calls, you can press redial

[Chopper]
I guess you like my southern drawl
I stay down no matter the cause
My attitude's like fuck em all, feel me?
I'm on my game, I ain't got no flaws
I'm so jealous, so don't make me have to touch nobody
Or cut nobody, you like it when I tell you shit like that
And when I'm on my ass, I flip right back, like that
Real nigga that I am, so if you need me you can call on Slim
Fuckin' right girl

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?
All the looks that you giving me
I'm feeling that you're feeling me
I can keep a secret boo
Just to be alone and get next to you
I like your style, beautiful smile, you're kind of wild

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]

[Ness]
She pretty in pink, damn what they put in my drink?
It's either I'm color blind or too pissy to think
Straight, take it slow, wait for a minute, uh
Chill, fall back, we can date for a minute, uh
I'm renting out with an option to buy
She blow weed so her nosebleed top of the sky
Female with an attitude as cocky as mine
When I ride, she right there in the passenger side

[Fred]
Well this week I made plans that were set in advance
Lobster and shrimp in  Sevilla, then we jettin' to France
Under the stars, sippin' Cristy, laid back in the sand
Tellin' me ways how you act when you were back with your fam
How your mother was smoking crack and your father was dead
See that's the type of stuff that get in my head
And you're very emotional, you make a real thug wanna get close to you
With the permission you give, your lotion, let's get ghost girl

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?
All the looks that you giving me
I'm feeling that you're feeling me
I can keep a secret boo
Just to be alone and get next to you
I like your style, beautiful smile, you're kind of wild

[Chorus]

[Chopper]
Yeah, Chopper City
It's Da Band, ya heard?
The next generation
Bad Boy
Sara, take us outta here, ya heard?

[Sara]
Baby how ya doing?
Off the scene for a minute, but right back into it
Tell me can you feel it?
All the looks that you giving me
I'm feeling that you're feeling me
I can keep a secret boo
Just to be alone and get next to you
I like your style, beautiful smile, you're kind of wild

[Chorus]</pre>
