*"hey" repeated throughout the Intro and Chorus*"

[Intro - Classified - talking]
My word, ha!

[Chorus - Cuts by DJ Jorun] - w/ ad libs
"We don't even speak the same kind of language"
"They want to know if he still got it" - Dr. Dre
"Plug my mic back in, let me begin" - Classified
"I'm on the mic, you're on the run"
"Because, this is how it should be done"
"Word up"

[Verse 1 - Classified]
Yeah, uh, yeah, I wipe off a fresh pair of Nikes and roll my pair of 
dice (yeah)
Infectious, I'm passed on like a parasite (ha)
I've seen the Eiffel Tower and all the Paris sites
But comin back home, there ain't no comparin, right?
It's time to play ball and it's a big inning, I mean the beginning's here
And the picture is clear
Your whole team's played out like a pitcher's career
While we home celebratin with a pitcher of beer
And yeah I do this rap thing but don't say that I sing
That's just me spreadin the icing (icing)
Huh, I'm goin end to end like hockey icing (yeah)
Fuck up the flow, so you don't know if I'm wrong or writing
I've been here, holdin down base (base)
Blowin out the speakers, turnin up the bass (bass)
Back to the basics, basically I do this shit faithfully
And no one is replacin me, take a seat

[Chorus - Cuts by DJ Jorun] - w/ ad libs
"They want to know if he still got it" - Dr. Dre
"Plug my mic back in, let me begin" - Classified
"I'm on the mic, you're on the run"
"Because, this is how it should be done"
"Word up"

"They-they want to know if he still got it" - Dr. Dre
"Plug my mic back in" - Classified
"The verbal-the verbal-the verbal combat, position number one" - Zaakir
"And this is how it should be done"
"Set it off"

[Verse 2 - Classified]
Uh, yeah, now back in the day makin diss tracks on your tape deck (yeah)
You could get your face decked with a skate deck (bap)
You might want protection like safe sex (ha)
Or you'll get robbed for your cash and the safe's next (gimme that)
I ain't the thug type (nah), nah it just don't suit me
But I'm never clean cut, no dress shoes or suit please
I chop it up like Bruce Lee, I'm too sweet
And gettin groupies like honeymoon suite (ha)
And all these MC's want a piece of me
But ya, playin yourself like reality TV
All in syndication, shit you a repeat
Talkin bullshit, other words you a feces-ces-ces-ces ...
And I'm a drug like morphine (yeah)
The music got you hooked generate a few more fiends (come on)
Floodin through your neighborhood like New Orleans
When Katrina came through, with no clue and no warning

[Chorus - Cuts by DJ Jorun] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Classified]
Yeah, uh, yeah, aiyyo, I coast through the east coast, ridin with the 
crew (crew)
Sunday afternoon, with the car on cruise (cruise)
Try not to breath when we smell Seaweed
But we love to breath in the smell when we see weed (huh)
And I don't rap with a Bronx accent (nah)
But shit sometimes it slips out by accident (yes y'all)
Yeah I'm infleunced, the birthplace of hip hop music
Got a hold of me the first time I rocked to it (ha)
I learned how to converse with flow (yeah)
And took off the Converses, got the shell toes (yeah)
They say it's all negative but on with the show
'Cause they don't ever look at the con versus the pros

[Chorus - Cuts by DJ Jorun] - w/ ad libs
"They want to know if he still got it" - Dr. Dre
"Plug my mic back in, let me begin" - Classified
"I'm on the mic, you're on the run"
"Because, this is how it should be done"
"Word up"

"They want to know if he still got it" - Dr. Dre
"Plug my mic back in" - Classified
"The verbal-the verbal-the verbal combat, position number one" - Zaakir
"Because, this is how it should be done"
"Set it off"

[Outro - Classified - talking]
This how it goes (on and on and on)
Yeah, yeah and now you know (on and on and on)
One more time tell 'em (on and onnnn)
("We don't even speak the same kind of language")
("Cats don't understand what they facin")
("We don't even speak, speak the same kind of language")
