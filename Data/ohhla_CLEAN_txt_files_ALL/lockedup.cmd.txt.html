Sittin here in the belly of the beast (belly of the beast)
C-Murder (Momma grieve for your baby)*in the background repeated
Trapped in crime behind bars (T-R-U)
I'm locked up, ain't no love
They won't let me out
Think they testin me (this world's so sure)
Check this out

[Verse 1]

Incarcerated, eliminated I sure hate it
It's hard labour for life thats what the judge stated
Dieg trippin and shady I think he wanna kill me
Talk to my cell everytime I'm mad I know he feel me but baby
I moved on you can keep the pictures
That's my girl she left me she ain't keep it real wit me
Now I'm stressin I need a victim so I can hit him
and 30 days in the hole is cold, but watch me ride wit him
I'm steady tryin to find the motive (motive)
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't gettin no closer (closer)
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen (stolen)
No registration
The cops patrollin (patrollin)
Now that ain't stopped me and I get

[Chorus]
Locked up
They won't let me out (locked up) x2
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (they got me botched up)
They won't let me out (locked up) x2
They won't let me out no (caught up)
I'm locked up but they can't stop us

[Verse 2]
Some more visits and ripe chickens across the border
Whats your number I'm hurtin let me get a money boarder?
I owe my lawyer some change now he might drop the case
Now if my player don't shake it I might hop the gate
Starin at these walls I'm fallin he set my court date back
Payback when I shake back and cop a mate back
I'm eatin things and lusting on kings, magazines
It seems, I'm home free but it was just dream, damn

[Chorus]
Locked up
They won't let me out (locked up) x2
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (they got me botched up)
They won't let me out (locked up) x2
They won't let me out no (caught up)
I'm locked up but they can't stop us

[Hook]
Visitation no longer comes by (comes by)
Seems like they forgot about me (about me)
Commissary is gettin empty (empty)
Cell mates eatin food without me (without me)
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life (move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
but instead I get locked up

[Verse 3]
I'm spreadin my gangs cause I'm straight done in like a gangbanger
Don't play no games and mess around and get shanked with the hanger
That's how I'm comin and I do my dirt and stick and move
Tears tattoed a head busta walkin in these shoes
Snitches workin with the Warden
Eyes open and scopin and these humps I'm smokin, got my lungs chokin
I'm the big dog on the blocks, I got 2-for-1's
and 21 (5) with a L I'm hopeless son I'm locked up

[Chorus] - 3X</pre>
