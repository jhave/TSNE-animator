[Kane has a conversation with himself]
Aiyyo what happened last night, did you forget?
You said that you was pushin through my way with some Moet
	Nahhh, see I was witcha man Devon from Calloway
	He came over with Bell and Fay and a bottle of Alize
	The honies wanted to watch me in _Posse_
	but the picture was sloppy
Oh that bootleg copy?
	Yeah
	We tried to beep you before we went to the motel
Word?  Damn, my battery was on low cell -- oh well
	We took em to this down low spot
Man skip the part about the journey; did you hit the skins or not?
	Oh no question -- when have you ever seen my game go nervous?
Was y'all trickin?
	Nahhhh, not less you're countin room service, huh
	Besides player, what's a couple of bucks?
Was it lobster?
	Fuck no, cheeseburger deluxe
AIGHT?
