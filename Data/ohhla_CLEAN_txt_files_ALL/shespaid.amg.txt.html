[Dru Down]
Dru Down... players up, tricks down
Bosko, AMG mayne
Let's get some green out these tenders mayne
Cause they got it

More doe, more green, she's paid by the game I laced her with
Draped her with, ready to be like me but yet a soldierette
(Raided knee deep in this) Stolen wallets
Fake checks, burnin' the daddy, all cash for that ass
And she knew this, if it wasn't her it was a new bitch
Game don't stop for a pimp, pursue this
Break yourself bitch, the trap broken
She wanted to know why I talk like this (I'm outspoken)
Coughin' off the weed chokin', hop in the back of the two-door
drive Knievel before I see the penelopes
We weave, don't have time, for the po-po's
But we got all the time to where as I speak right now hoe
My Vogues oh, my suit boots and pinstripes
Recouped up on meth the next night
And plus um, at the house I got a new one, you know like major
The new big head bitch Ben Franklin chaser

[Chorus: Bosko]
She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through

[Bosko]
(She's just my fantasy)
Convertible XO, Gucci and Diamond XO
(Like an image in a magazine)
Sex me like R. Kelly plus pays for my celly
Lobster in my belly, jeans from Pelle Pelle
Private sponge baths so a playa's never smelly
Beach house in Malibu I can always swing through
From breakfast in bed plus head and tails too
Not your gigolo, Bosko's a playa pro
Fo sho' not diggin' but I ain't mad at cash flow
We be bouncin' out a stretch, stratosphere Las Vegas
The rich chose me and choosies can't be beggers
I'm, down to Bone like Thugs-N-Harmony
(For the love of money!) Plus chicks and Mastercard
See, she love to spend and I can't complain
Cause like I told ya before man, the hood has changed

[Chorus: Bosko]
She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through

[AMG]
Now the pimps ain't dead, the hoes just scared
And every time we end up in bed I'm well fed
Money don't make me, hoes they can't break me
Pimpin' ain't easy, baby please pay me
You got the lips, the hips to coach bag money clips
And while you're countin' your chips ya like to sip
cappuccino, but I'm far from a hero
Used to be less than zero
Now I'm multi-million, playa with no children
Livin' in estates, acres with the gates
Ferrari 512, playa haters go to hell
Hoes pop for show-n-tell, can I rock the bells?
Uh, who could it be now? The nigga AMG
With my homie Bosko and Dru Down
California sounds - bumpin' all in the trunk
Cause I'm wreckin' plenty hoes with that physical funk

[Chorus: Bosko]
She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through

And I like it, yes I like it
I like it, and I'm her perfect playa
I like it, yes I like it.. 
That lady's paid..

She's paid, and I like it
She's paid, and she makes me rich
She's paid, rollin' down the avenue
She's paid, she always brings my money through</pre>
