[Verse 1]
Macauly Culkin, "Home Alone" lustin
Tuesday night we stop by Justin's
Check the scene, immaculate
Grab the bottle from the bar and dismantle it
Who you wit, spot a chick for my man to get
She a big body girl, I can handle it
Cuz my money blow 'em
If I had the voice of my man Sisqo, I could see the thong
But I'm not so I flash the yacht master
And the gold seal so I can get it faster
Eye contact, said my name Onasis
Check myself from catching hot flashes
This girl is just too much
Quench my thirst wit a glass of, "Puffy" punch
And that's the real, I'm the realest nigga ever seen
Fuck a gun, stop me, try a laser beam

CHORUS 2X: Dave Hollister
Where we goin, goin
How we movin, movin
What we doin, doin
Who she bouncin wit? "Keep bouncing"
Can't stop movin, movin, movin "Keep bouncing"
[Can't stop groovin, groovin, groovin]

[Verse 2]
Yo, same night, shit's right, glide down the block
Club Cheetahs, the other spot, uh
It should be closed, FUBU had a A-list fashion show
I bought the hoe, "you know!"
Inside, Deborah Cox, LL Cool...
J, broads hangin off the barstools
Uh, I'm the shit, I break down to any figure
"Trick" 'em you don't know "Nann Nigga"
Uh, around the chicks I flash the bread
Never, ever get over my head, I front instead, "trust me"
Me, I won't risk it
I do it all for the "Nookie" like Fred from Limp Bizkit
So I snooze 'em, seven day yacht cruise 'em
Do what I want to and then lose 'em
For real, me and my squad's off the hook
Case closed, end of story, close the book

CHORUS

[Verse 3]
"I hate E so much right now"
I don't give a fuck, I be like ch ch BLAU!
Gettin hoes with asses like WOW
Laughin at y'all how you like me now, uh
I get the money baby, aint nothin funny baby
Carrots are for Bugs Bunny baby
To each his own, I rock til the spot is blown
Club hoppin, once again it's on
