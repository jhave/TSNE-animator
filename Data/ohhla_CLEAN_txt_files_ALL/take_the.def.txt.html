[Defari]
Take the weight of my hand, the breath of my life
For those who don't understand I do more than just right
I do by my family man, the realness inside
The stress always wanna test the black men pride
But I be damned if I hide or I fall
I'm too tall, I just rise stylistic
Payback is a dogg and youse a fool if you think I'ma lose
I'ma still toast bottles wit drev, vintallo and juice
And I'ma bang over the illester beats
Doin my thang and keep a good name out in this streets
Break ya neck, hook nigga, better show some respect
Alkaholiks is the fam, a nigga's mind on his check
Give your children a change without bread
How can they advance when they 18
The devil sells broken dreams
Why you always ask me if I play ball, all the whiteys
Is it because of the Barron Davis jersey and new Nike's
Take the weight of my hand, the breath of my life
For those who don't understand I do more than just right
I do by my family man, the realness inside
The stress always wanna test the black men pride
