[Verse 1: Deacon] 
Look, Ice Cube said Laugh Now, Cry Later 
It's sad to see us living like that till pine laid up 
Not straight up about death or missteps 
No regrets, just weed, sex, worldly patterns 
I miss Vatos and Bless, I miss my sister 
The other day my nigga was stabbed to death 
I laughed with Step bout holy scripture 
Holdin blunts bigger than his casket, growed amongst grass un-kept 
Still smoking, bet he's still blowing 
Singin with Sam Cooke about a change comin as we keep pourin 
Liquor out for those that passed 
It's killin our livers because we dying so fast 
Low on cash, who ain't? Ain't no jobs 
Either you slang, you make music or you detail cars 
You cut hair, you sell clothes or you live on charge 
I barely got enough bread to give a cell phone bars 
Fuck puttin bars on paper, there's bars on the face of 
Half my niggas, spark the Garcia Vegas and ride country 
I'll be damned if they stealing my pride from me 
Fuck the world, I ain't destined to die hungry 
 
[Hook: Kno] {X2} 
The lies, the pain, the truth, the hurt 
The music, the soul, it's all in the dirt 
 
[Kno] 
Lay back and just ride 
Lay back and just ride 
Just ride 
 
[Verse 2: Natti] 
Yeah, enter my zone, blunts stuffed, 'nough for self 
Brave in this world, putting up smoke for help 
Peace pipe under the street lights, type of wealth 
Greenery coats the scenery, my whip turn left 
Right away from them rollers posted up at the corner 
Schemin to meet they quota off of niggas with soda 
They love to get 'em together like lime and Corona 
Twisted, like my niggas still reppin they hood 
Don't own a brick up in that bitch but swangin they wood 
Going to bat for that? Shit, I wish I would 
In the thick of it, only with my Kyn I stood 
Make sense of it with dollars only if I could 
To trade children and a beautiful wife for a crack pipe 
Or biddin in a system, just missin the daylight 
Or missin in a system of hustlin all night 
Shit must have been aight in some point of our sight 
Till in a fashion we rationed off a portion of life 
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, uh come on 
Coastin into a future that we strive to make bright, let's go 
 
[Hook: Kno] {X2} 
The lies, the pain, the truth, the hurt 
The music, the soul, it's all in the dirt 
 
[Kno] 
Lay back and just ride 
Lay back and just ride 
Just ride</pre>
