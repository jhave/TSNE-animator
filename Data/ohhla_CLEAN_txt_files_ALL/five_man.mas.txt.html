[Daddy G]
Trendy wendys you know what I mean
Hangin' around with girl who's rolling up her jeans
She watches her street cred 'cause she's no dummy
Saw rockin the microphone and now she's calling me a honey
Says I know what I want don't move with thugs
We're house parties hip hop and smoking drugs
And whoever's been the boss she's down with 'em
She's always on time 'cause the girl got rhythm
To avoid all complications i'll give some information
About a certain location under Paddington Station
'Cause when I host my show-a I avoid the girl called lola
Who's more pu-pu-public than the drink they call it coca cola
I'm just practice posing face is shaded in black
Is dominating as my color the massive attack
Right now I hit it kick it flow smooth hit middle wicket

[Tricky]
I take a small step now it's a giant stride
People say I'm loud why should I hide
Only had a small taste so what a waste
I quietly observe though it's not my space
Bottom end's heavy you know we're never even
People call me Tricky for particular reason
I've got you see and I've got to let you know
See we're rockin' in your area rock beneath your balcony
My baby just cares for me well that's funny
Her touch tickles especially on my tummy

[Daddy G]
Now who's got the microphone

[Tricky]
Now who's honey

[Daddy G]
A turbo turbo and chant with a charge
Addy, Daddy G wild bunch crew at large
Don't call me an officer just call me a sarge
Mashing up the country planning also abroad
Plan to go to America when I get a visa card

[Tricky]
But gettin' a visa card nowadays isn't hard

[Daddy G]
So keep your ears glued listen to every chord
Tokyo city's one place that we toured
Four technic plus two mixer board
Sharper than a Wilkinson razor sword

[3D]
When I was a child I played subbuteo on
My table then I graduate to studio one
'Cos D's my nom de plume you know but 3's my pseudonym
And around my neck you know I wear the sony budokan
Indigo blues you got me in my own shoes
The people dancing in the shape for what they make
They can't lose
Yes waxing lyrical but this time it's not satirical
It's kinda spherical so jam me in a circle
This is the miracle of the dubplate dub selection

[Daddy G]
So whether you're black white or half-caste in your complection

[3D]
Yes pull out your phono plug and tuck you in your phony
It's started by marconi resumed by sony
A summary by wireless history and only
The massive attack enorme explosione

[Horace Andy]
Get away with you gangsters
We don't want it
Get away with you gangsters
We don't like it
Eternal love eternal love
Money money money
Root of all evil
Money money money
Root of all evil</pre>
