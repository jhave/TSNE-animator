Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Lil B]
Yo yo, wait up man, wait up man
Lil B, wait a second man
I gotta ask you something
Man, you know, they say life's hard
But I wanna see what you think about it

[Verse 1: Lil B]
Respect, I gotta lot of problems
But okay, it takes time to solve 'em
Don't rush, don't fuss
Keep your hands together, and just trust
Suckers said I'd never make it major
Homie you sound like a hater
Dude trying to build a couple schools
Teach what I love and do what I do
The youth is the only ones who save us
And who cares if their parents is a hater
We gotta step up to love, have a good day
And go give a hug
Don't be fake for the money
People turn snakes for the money
I found out living was a job

[Chorus: Lil B]
Damn, life's hard [x4]

[Verse 2: Lil B]
My mom said I need to go to College
But I feel like I got street knowledge
If you take the time to look
You will see that the world symbolizes a book
I really start to pick up the paper
And I feel like I'm living in the Matrix
Everyday in my hood
Somebody's up to no good
I live down the street from the dope man
Around here only fast food open
I went out for lunch trying to buy me some food
But he handed me a blunt
Now my minds getting hazy
I feel like the world's going crazy
And I just lost of my job..

[Chorus: Lil B]
Damn, life's hard [x4]

[Outro: Lil B]
But don't give up
You know I love y'all, yea
Like I said I love y'all man
Listen to this, never give up
You know
Keep loving people, please, for me
Love people, don't give up on the whole race of humans
Or what ever, or anybody
Just because of one person man
Just, don't give so much, know what I mean
So much credit man, love the whole earth man, one</pre>
