[Hook]
Y'all niggaz, don't have to fuck with me
Cause I, can do bad just being one deep - 2x
Y'all niggaz, don't have to

(*talking*)
Right now, for my next selection
All you bitch ass niggaz, and all you bitch ass bitches
This ones dedicated to you
Cause y'all mo'fuckers ain't shit, I promise y'all ain't shit

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Come around my way, cause I don't need
Another fair whether friend, with a trick up his sleeve
Acting like he really my partna, but he after my cheese
I'm suffocated by the weak, please leave let me breathe
Remember, y'all ain't want me to hit the weed
Now I'm rapping, you see me and tell me to hit the weed
Thinking you can get a VIP pass, and get in free
But Joseph McVey, is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me, cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it, when I was down on my ass
In my corduroy britches, y'all was in Louis Vatone
Laughing and pointing at a nigga, trying to ruin my fun
Years into the millennium, I'm money by the ton
You niggaz ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showing love back, I ain't showing none

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
With or without your support, I'ma still be straight
The less niggaz around me, the better I can concentrate
When I can't think straight, I open up a chest plate
It could be your death date, get beside yourself
We ain't cool, I think you better rewind yourself
'Fore a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So beat your feet, and let the do' close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need, is the help of the good Lord
Trying to kick it, but mo'fuckers sing too hard
I'ma be keeping it real, they gon be keeping it fraud
A hundred and fifty-two percent, are real with me
Instead of running with a gang, keep steel with me
I can do bad one deep, so I chill one deep

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
If you know a bitch ass nigga, throw up your hands
And if you know a bitch ass bitch, throw up your hands - 4x

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
I remember how you niggaz, decided to player hate
I'd like to take this time out, to give a special thanks to y'all-thanks to y'all
I remember how you fellas, decided to player hate
I'd like to take this time out, to give a special thanks to y'all-thanks to y'all</pre>
