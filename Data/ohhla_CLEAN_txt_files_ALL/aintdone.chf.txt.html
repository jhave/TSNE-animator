Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch
I ain't done turnin' up, bitch

[Verse]
Say, I ain't done turnin' up, shit
I'm too busy turnin' up shit
Countin' guap, bitch I get it quick
Try and take it, you'll be burnin' up quick
Tadoe off the drugs on that fuck shit
Bad yellow bone doing my laundry
You say you wanna fuck, well I want some head
I've got a hundred dollars, where you want it at?
Cause I'm countin', girl, I'm money countin'
I ain't gotta count it, I've got a money counter
I'm up here at the top, started from the bottom
I can't really trust niggas, so I gotta watch 'em
Cause these niggas plottin' cause I'm gettin' guap now
Back then they didn't want to fuck with me
But they fuck with me cause I'm hot now
I see what Mike Jones was talkin' 'bout
Now I'm 'bout to pour a four and smoke my lungs out

[Chorus]</pre>
