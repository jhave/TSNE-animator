Uh, uh, yeah-yeah, C. Weezy nigga..

[Chris Ward]
Things just ain't the same, for mobsters
That's why it's so hard, for real niggaz to prosper
Everybody acting like, they want Oscars
Claiming they real with you, when they not your partnas
There's way more fakers out here, than you thought cuz
They can't help themselves, from being those lost duds
I'm high, buzzing off blueberry frost buds
Cause that's the way I collect, and gather my thoughts up
And I know, you all think I signed with the Boss but
I collabed with him again, just to get me some boss bucks
If you don't like me, you don't got to
Cause you're not me, and I am not you
Half the shit you industry, I promise you this
It's not you expect for you stop it, in a drop that's blue
Now what you got to do, it's better than that
The way they bragging, I thought you was better than that
Keep bumping, I'ma put that lead in the gat
Cock it back and watch the buck shots, spread in your hat
Then your bitch ass, be dead as a mat
Laying there staying, ain't nothing deader than that
Some slicker than wet ice, admit it I'm that nice
You did down to get, one verse is that price
Come on down, double or nothing that bet's twice
My number one fan's wifey, I'm that sheisty
I'm the pimp you the punk, I'm the champ you the chump
I'm the skunk you the punk, I'm the funk in the trunk
I'm the shit that stunk, plus that nigga
That'll run up in the club, and get that hoe crunk, watch me

[Hook]
I know, you got your eyes on me
I feel you watching me, but it ain't hard to see
That you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw
Ain't what you thought you saw
You're better off, not looking at all

(*Dr. Dre*)
Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo'
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo'
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (the watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low</pre>
