[Will.I.Am]
If the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club

[Will.I.Am]
Yeah, I try to party on out
Step to the disco can't work it out (yeah)
Let's go and get this party started now
Parties and getting naughty is what I'm all about
So many girlies in the house
With bangin' ass bodies and party ass mouths'
After the club were going straight to my house
I got-ta-got-ta got to get you on my couch
I rock steady no doubt
You ask for a celeb so I had to turn you out
Don't give me drama baby
Baby don't pout
I don't want a baby mamma
Don't wanna spout

[Chorus]
Cause the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club

If the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club

[Will.I.Am]
I like the way that you move (move)
Don't hold back baby, do what you do (do it baby)
You make a nigger go "ooo"
How the hell do women get as fine as you (so fine)
I'm trying to holla at you
First time I seen ya, I was like hallelu (hallelujah)
Turn around let me view ya
Got-ta-got-ta got to damn I wanna do you
Baby let's get into it
Make moves like me and you was intimate (sexy)
Let's pretend that this beat is our heartbeat
Bloom wit intimate (hotness)
Sex with clothes on
Dancing on the dance floor getting my blow-john (rising)
And I gotta Trojan
Just in case we get-it-get-it going on and

[Fergie]
La-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
If the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club

[Bridge]
The ladies in the disco club
Ain't the ones to be falling in love with
If you go to the disco club
Protect yourself and don't fall in love
The ladies in the disco club
Ain't the ones to be falling in love with
The ladies in the disco club
Ain't the ones to be falling in love with

[Fergie]
Playa listen yeah I'm the missin'
Yeah I go to club and sip on Crystin'
That don't mean that I'm like the rest of dem tricks and
The party gettin' naughty she's in money and dicks and
No
You got me all wrong brother, no
I'm a women that's strong brother, yeah
They ain't nothing wrong with a women in the club
Getting freaky to the song

[Break Chorus]

Thurday at the disco club

Saturday at the disco club
Sunday at the disco club
Everydays' a disco club
See us at the disco club

[Apl.de.ap]
We're going to break it on down
Rub it on your belly like an ultrasound
Shake it a like jelly and move around
Really want to see you flaunt your style
Get why baby get a little crazy
Don't hesitate won't take no maybe (move)
Not like an eviction
But me and you baby it'll all cause a friction
As my eyes undress ya
Just wanna let you know there's no pressure
Body conversation they both want pleasure
But your girl Cock Block won't let cha, hmm
What cha going do now
Bounce, rock, shake and we could wild out
It'll all fall like a river now
Check-me-check-me-check-check me on out

[Chorus]
Cause the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club

If the ladies in the disco club
Are freakin' in the disco club
And dancing in the disco club
And shaking in the disco club
Then take me to the disco club
