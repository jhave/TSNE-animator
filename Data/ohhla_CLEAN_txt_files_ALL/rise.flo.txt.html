[Verse One]
So, much, pain, we
Don't know how to be but angry
Feel infected like we've got gangrene
Please don't let anybody try to change me
Me, just me
In the middle of a sea full of faces, full of faces
Some laugh, some salivate
What's in your alleyway, recycling bins or bullet cases?
It's not equal, it's not fair
We're different people but we're not scared
We ain't never scared to pave a new path
Make a new street, build a new bridge
Say can you see by the dawn's early light, free slaves running
Songs words weren't right, now a new day's coming
The few stay stunnin while the many are handsome
Your soul is alive but they want it for ransom
The base drummin is the anthem
We step to the heartbeats of our granddaughters and grandsons and
Rise together we, rise together we {*repeat 4X*}

[Chorus]
Rise together we, rise together we {*repeat 3X*}
Rise together we, rise!

[Verse Two]
Lost, hope and found need
Grounded by our surroundings
Did the walls scream, universities?
Or you and I verse-the-T's?
React automatic and we burst when squeezed
And make 9-11 each emergency
Urgency, amber to red like the turnin leaves
Oh please let the hurtin cease
And don't let apathy police the populace, we will march across
Those stereotypes that were marked for us
The answer's obvious we, switch the consonants
And, change the sword to words and lift continents

[Chorus]

{*guitar solo*}

[Chorus]

[repeat 4X]
If you believe in redemption
I'm callin to you from another dimension</pre>
