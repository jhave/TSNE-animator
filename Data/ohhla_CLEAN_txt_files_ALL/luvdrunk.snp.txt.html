[The-Dream]
Oh oh oh
Who is this?
Close the door
Gon' lit it
That's for sure
Gonna lay you out
And I know you'll love how a nigga break it down
And everytime I'm with her her I get her her love drunk (hardly going away)
And everytime she wit me me she get me me love drunk

[Snoop Dogg - each line x2]
You know who I am I'm the motherfucking dogg
The sheets fucked up and you know it was me
You can hear the bed squeak all the way down the street
And it sounds like a song cause we're fucking to the beat
I put my rat tat tat in her boom boom pow
And then she put her tit tit tit all up in my mouth

[Snoop Dogg]
I might've said it before I don't love them hoes
I told you before I don't love them hoes
But she got that good good I can't let her go
And I got to let her know that

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And everytime I'm with her her I get her her love drunk (hardly going away)
And everytime she wit me me she get me me love drunk (love drunk)
Mmmm she make me say good love is what she's fiending for
And I got that fire loving
The more you need the more
Let me hear you say oooh, ahah, oh yeah
Right now everytime she's with me we all dizzy
We love drunk

[Snoop Dogg - each line x2]
Shoot to the spot cause the spot is the lim'
On your lunchbreak let me hit it real quick
And back to your job 'fore they know what it is
Loving so good we done made three kids
I don't know what it is but I love what it did
Hugging and touching and all that shit
Drink 'til you're drunk, see my love is a fill
Yeah this for you boo, it's a gift

[Chorus]
