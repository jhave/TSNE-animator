Song:   Trap Life
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus x2: Quavo]
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Man I'm tired of selling bricks
Gotta [?] hit licks
Can't wait till I sign that deal
The trap life, I'll give it up quick
Listen up, nigga speaking real shit
Cause it ain't all what it seems
You can have it all at one time, then end up losing everything
And I put that shit on my mom
I'm a make it out of the slums
I'm a get [?] in a mansion, in a penthouse, living lavish
We at the top floor of the condo
We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo
I got J's at the front door
I serve them up with that combo
Got birds flying like Dumbo but I keep a 9 like Rondo
I locked the game, I got the code
Cash coming fast that pronto
Making plays, Tony Romo
Two bad bitches, they homo

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Trap game risky but it's so easy to flip them fishes
Popeyes, [?] chicken with them biscuits
Fuck an iPhone, trapping off a Tracfone
Give the Feds [?], they can't even track the phone
[?]
Ride through the city in a coupe [?]
Overseas with Muhammad [?]
Got a date with the money and the kush is my cologne
Sippin on lean out 2 styrofoam
I finesse a nigga for that cash in the red zone
You ain't never ever live the trap life nigga
You don't know nothing bout the rap life nigga
Hell nah I don't want to [?] it out with you
Cause you don't even know what you taking bout nigga
I don't know you but I know your [?]
But a nigga never ever got gwap with you nigga
You ain't got cash, you ain't never ever sold drugs
You ain't never chop it up with the plug
You ain't never roll down 85 with a 100 birds in a Lamborghini truck
When I'm filthy rich that's when I'll give this trap shit up

[Chorus x2]</pre>
