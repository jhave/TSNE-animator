Song:   Just Me &amp; My Walkman
Typed by: UGRLS Webmaster

Constantly stay blazing
Yo, it's that FLA kid
Smooth it out ya'll
Smooth it out ya'll
Smooth it out ya'll
Smooth it out ya'll

[Verse 1 - Dutchmassive]
Yo a lot of credit due to my sidekick
My "get me through the day" kit
My wake up in the morning with a smile on my face thing
My energy, my mellow out in stressful time of needs
My drugs to block me out from the world when I feel
My man who keeps me new to all the music that I hear
The one who's always close to my pockets and my ears
My man throughout the years always been my best friend
And I introduce to ya'll my one and only walkman

Yo did he say walkman?
Yo I know this cat ain't dedicating this song to his walkman
Whats this? Some me, myself and my microphone type ish?

Yo, yall don't understand, damn, my headset is my man
First to play me KRS when he dissed MC Stan
Been there for dividends passing me by
Still bumpin' De La, Del, and what's left of Tribe
My god, the mix tapes I've gone through
And the shoes I've worn out walking down Waters Avenue
My lunch money would go toward batteries
They was from the dollar store but that ain't matter to me
Sadly in the same predicament
I'm addicted to listening
Hoping that my kids will see the visions
That I had a as a child playing tag in the courtyard
Dreams to proceed, overcome all the odds that God
And his headset never let my ears rest
I stay zonin' out listenin' to Com Sense
The best of (?) from beginning to the end
Throughout all the problems it's just me and my walkman

[Chorus]
It's just me and my walkman
When I wanna here the classics
I don't wanna hear that loud-mouth ish

It's just me and my walkman
When I'm stressin, I wanna get away
I have nuttin' to say

It's just me and my walkman
When I wanna just chill, sit back, relax and ill

It's just me and my walkman
My walkman
My walkman

[Verse 2 - Dutchmassive]
Now I've grown a little older
Released vinyl, got exposure
So my memories on tape to reach the lower
End of what you call music
But it's polluted
I never buy hip hop anymore cause it's foolish
No excuses, I need new cassettes
Had you made better songs then I might represent
My walkman would hate me if I play some wack ish
So please do me a favour and make more classics!
I push pause and wonder...
What if he was gone cause he died of hunger?
Live in the past though, never regrettin'
Trade all my tapes for CD's? Forget it!
Never feed him wack tapes cause that would be a no-no
Always rockin' classics, never play a demo
To the dopest friend to ever touch the slang
C'mon! Give a hand to my motherfuckin' walkman

Yeah, the best friend in the world
The best friend in the world

[Chorus]
It's just me and my walkman
When I wanna here the classics
I don't wanna hear that loud-mouth ish

It's just me and my walkman
When I'm stressin, I wanna get away
I have nuttin' to say

It's just me and my walkman
When I wanna just chill, sit back, relax and ill

It's just me and my walkman
My walkman
My walkman</pre>
