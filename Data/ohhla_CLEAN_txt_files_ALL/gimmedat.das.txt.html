Oahh-kay, oahh-kay; as we go and do it, do it like this
It's like this and you don't stop
Word is bond when we kick
So I'ma get on, and swing it somethin like this

Verse One: Books, Drayz

You punk niggaz gel up, when I swell up, spark the el up
By the way troop -- oops, I feel a new style developing
So safety stellar, I'm not the Baby Bubba on the level
I crush shins, the roughest hardrocks to Fruity Pebbles

Well nigga, boo hops, you know my crew rocks, who wanna test me?
I'm next G, heavens to Betsy, I sting like Pepsi
or Coca, Cola-swola, niggaz higher
when I fly up these niggaz bitch-ups, but y'all can dry up

I be the jibber-jabber, quick to make a nigga stagger
like some rocka, Blanka, I bake that ass like Betty Crocker, momma
You need to stop in-filling your pockets off that pop *shit*
Ai yi yi my dreads, I think I'm toxic

Well yo I'm cuckoo but not for Cocoa, some say I'm loco
*Fuck* around and catch a cap like Mary Buttafuoco
So you know, that I'ma follow you wit the drama
Slice em, dice em, and ice that ass like Jeffrey Dahmer

Verse 2: Books, Dray

Tick tock, can I slide that cock up in your tummy dear?
I drop a ounce and then I bounce just like a Gummy Bear
Be kickin it like the rapper kicks the bucket dig it
Uhh, ah *shit*, now whatta I have to do to prove I'm rugged?
I wear my hair crazy like them niggaz Red and Grady
Punks just serve up, clever like Alice, serve the Brady Bunch

I makes em wheeze up, cause when I ease up, I eat MC's up
I leave em on their backs layin flat with they knees up
Eureka, musta speak uhh, re-aversin person
No rehearsin I can flip it in reverse and
change em, rearrange em, supa-dupa
Faze em, daze em and blast that ass with diff'rent days-in

Verse 3: Skoob, Dray

Well blow, me down, great Scott, I'm wilder than the rock
in the winter, man my 40 Timberlands hit the spot
His pops name is Alvin, my sister's name is Kitty
My rap was for fools like some silicon titties
HIYA, I kicked it and there it goes my *?an?* abuse
My style is a child like now it's fatter than Roseanne's

Well check how I'ma wreck it when I'm, droppin, this rhyme
Don't let me have to transform like Op-ti-mus Prime
Cause then I'ma have to flip the script and get dready
Run laps around your *faggot* crew like Mario Andretti
When I expand like spandex, my jam wrecks the Ampex
You better be on the way before I'm doin you and ya man next
