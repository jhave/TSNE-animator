[Intro - Joe Budden - talking]
High on life, ta ha (Joey!)
J. Cardim, what up?
Parks, what up?
Dolla, what up? ... (ta ha)
I think we got one with this one baby
Not really, I hate when niggaz say shit like that (Joey!)
Ta ha, quick question though
Y'all in that mood yet?
Ta ha, naw, naw they ain't hear me
(I said), y'all in that mood yet?

[Verse 1 - Joe Budden]
Check, I broke down a while ago, finally pickin up the pieces
Memoirs on how the undefeated, can feel depleted
I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with
At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited
Half the time I'm arrogant, other times I'm vengeful
At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you
Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful
It's been so many times, I lost track of who to repent to
Half the time I'm in the cut, don't want you to notice me
Roll with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially
Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle
I owe so many payback, I feel like I got a right to
So if you need a case in point, you can refer to Budden
And it'll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
All it did was make me succumb, put ice in me, make me numb
When I revisit the places it takes me from, I'm sprung

[Chorus - Joe Budden]
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Strong enough to catch contact by
You smell it as soon as you get in my ride
(I don't wanna sober up)
See with me the rules never apply
Don't tell me how I should live my life
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Put your seat back, got it if you need that
You should really fuck with me
(I ain't tryin to sober up)
Tell me if you wanna ride or die
La la la la la la la la

[Verse 2 - Joe Budden]
Listen up as a sinner reports, my inner thoughts like an inner war
Headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
Mental's distraught, every word from this sinister boss
Is brought to you by the people like your minister's Porsche
Tight ropin on dental floss, before the haters begin to get lost
Coke and weed got my temperament off
But why would my temper get lost, when as soon as the temperature frost
I'm probably havin intercourse in a resort
Criminal repertoire, pricey condos at a minimal cost
My train of thought ain't as simple as yours
So if our paths happen to incidentally cross
I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws (ta ha)
Until then let's let the bass kick
Take a shot straight, I don't see a need to chase it
Tryin to fight the urge 'til there's somethin to replace it
I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Joe Budden]
Yo, me and the gang would get so blunted
We'd order take out from the Chinese stores
Say make sure you bring change for a hundred, rob him, safety on the metal's off
Figured if we beat the brakes off him, then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off?
Some live and die by the high, I was born by it
Since Pop gave my mom the needle like go on, try it
Got me feeling like ain't a nigga could harm me
So I go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
She was so militant, disciplined, diligent
So I whispered to her "bet you wouldn't mind chillin" and
I got to know her on my sofa
I gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
See she the type you gotta watch when she come around
Really she only get high, so she can come down
Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle
Once you start ahead in life, you'll be on the same level, I bet you

[Chorus]

[Verse 4  Crooked I]
When I was five, this what my father said
"I should have pulled you out and left you on your mama's water bed"
(You ask me, my papa's dead), alcoholic genes from him, since a toddler bottle fed
Put me in your stainless, I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head
(My life was the craziest), surprised I'm even walkin
Can you blame me if I'm (atheist)? But I ain't Stephen Hawkins
I know God is in my (radius), I can see him often
In the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher's talkin (come on)
My people sleep in coffins, I miss 'em, I'm breakin down
In the face of a bad bitch that I'm 'posed to be takin down
(Baby ridin while I'm cryin, I'm dyin inside
'Cause my pain is Poseidon or a giant Leviathan that I'm hidin from the world)
They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
How ironic, same place I vomit when I liquor drink
Apparently I need to get a shrink
How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggaz think?
