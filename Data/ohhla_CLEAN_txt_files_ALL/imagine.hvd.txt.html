(Talking)
It's time it's time uh one two
Ha yall here me? New york city
Is ya with me? Right one one                                                
Check two check me out ha watch it yo
 
Imagine me imagine you
Imagine kids possibly two
Maybe three, imagine you and i loungin in the tropics
Bounded by clever topics but never discussin my profits
Imagine, the tone of my voice making you moist,
How you feel about that,
Aint no doubt about that,
These things could be real things
According to, how you, feel about you and i hear me out now
I ain't your average
But indeed about my cabbages
Let's keep it simple,you with me our what?
I mean is ya feeling me?
Are you hearing me?
Whats the point in talkin if you dont listen
Water,i shine, im glistening
But im missing a lady like you, someone to hold me down
Trust me you ain't had nobody like me,
They can't touch me, you ain't had none of that so imagine that.
         
(chorus)
Something about that thang,
That thang that you do,
Keeps me running back,
Running to you baby i cant imagine                                           
Being without ya cant live without ya baby

Yo shorty you dont want no drama with me
Its heavy and these chicks is steadily fondling me
Diggie shot callin,
And im so tired of ballin                                                     
But i've been doing that these kids is new to that
Come inside my crib all you see is platinum plaques
Keep the gold ones in the back cause i'm ashamed of that
Now i lounge in the sticks dime piece on my hip
And i've been doing that since big stuff in eighty six
Something about you really turned me on and i can't figure you out
Cause everyday im thinking about diggin you out, whats that about?
I got visions of turning you out
Now i ain't like mike im simply just dwight arington myers
Got a grip like pliers keep my name of the wires cause my crew is high flyers
And i got more ice and more cream than bryers you wanna try us?

(chorus)
Something about that thang,
That thang that you do,
Keeps me running back,
Running to you baby i cant imagine
Being without ya cant live without ya baby

Have you ever been treated correctly huh?
You should be glad you connected with d, baby you ready?
Imagine this hennesy, coat back, drop top,
You and me, one on one buckwildin non-stop
Flourish you with jew-ell rings real-ly
If you tell me that you do love me sincerely
Take the american express and go shopping
Put your coochie in gucci cause we ball in the night
Call your girls tell them that your flowing with water
And it's sickening cause this tricking is really out of order                
I'll make you fingers glimmer, ill make your entire attire better
All up in ya liver,make your body quiver
Heav digga damn that, gon be the same nigga you understand that?
My main intent, is to pay your rent
And imma keep you satisfied, until the day i die alright
         
(chorus 2.5x)
Something about that thang,
That thang that you do,
Keeps me running back,
Running to you baby i cant imagine
Being without ya cant live without ya baby</pre>
