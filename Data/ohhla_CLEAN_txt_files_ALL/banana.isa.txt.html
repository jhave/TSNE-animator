[Isaiah Rashad]
Booga Booga Booga booga booga (I kinda gotta sing)
Booga booga {*clears throat*} 

Yo, now ever since I was young, had a gift for the tongue
This shit might open the door (it might open the do')
Fruit Loop for the young, Honeycomb for some
22 put piff in a bowl (put piff in a bowl)
And I was bent into corners, hotboxin' the sauna
I've been focused gettin' closer to ghosts (gettin' closer to ghosts)
And I be sippin' the bit, probably sippin' a bitch
I ain't really into tippin' the hoes
See my brother got weight, my sister at home (yeah yeah)
When I get straight my sister gettin flown (yeah yeah)
Couple nephews, my niggas gettin grown (yeah yeah)
Mikey D stay down, nigga gettin on (yeah yeah)
Can I get a, glass cup and a lil' Henny? (yeah yeah)
I'm, too cold but a little timid (yeah yeah)
I, blow checks save a lil' penny (yeah yeah)
I'm, too young for some big money (ooh)
Come girl get some dick from me (ooh)
My job needs some piss from me (ooh)
Uhh, lil bro can you fuck with me? (yeah yeah)
Came through at the last minute (yeah yeah)
Lil' wastin' my time
Lacin' with perks, perks in a bind
Hazy oh baby I'm better when blind
I don't see nothin' this perfect can fine (yeah yeah)

[Chorus: SZA]
We are the young, and - Xanax
There's nowhere to go to, hide from your lows
Cause we are the young, and - Xanax
There's nowhere to go - stuck on the high, yeah

[Isaiah Rashad]
My son sleep, I'm rollin it up I don't sleep (rollin' it)
I'm runnin' for bucks, don't tweet (runnin for)
You fuckin' with us I won't eat (fuckin' with)
Start stompin' your feet (stompin' it) - I need that
Dependin' on all of you feedback
Come out to my show and come feed that
Can't go back to sellin' that retail
My daddy left me with no details
Came back with a bitch and a stepson
I guess he forgot that he left somethin'
He must have been saving the best burn (yeah yeah)
She screamin' out give me the rest hun (yeah yeah)
Pearl neckless, I empty my left nut (yeah yeah)
Most niggas can't fuck with my worse shit (yeah yeah)
I'm scribin' my livin' with curses (yeah yeah)
Just wait 'til I get this shit perfect (yeah yeah)
You niggas can't fuck with my verses (yeah yeah)
See they really don't think that I'm 'bout this (yeah yeah)
Don't make me come run in your houses (yeah yeah)
We know where your mama your dad lives (yeah yeah)
Ooh baby yes wait just mask us (yeah yeah)
My niggas got triggas and fast lit (yeah yeah)
Don't like how we living it lasts (yeah yeah)
You out of your trigger and backseat (ooh)
Just lookin' at the shooter it's Mike D (ooh)
Your rosary shinin' so nicely (ooh)
We innocent kids if you ask me (ooh)
I rode in the Benz in the backseat (yeah yeah)
Them vices they swarm and attack me (yeah yeah)
Got diamonds and niners upon me (yeah yeah)
That Juvie, that Percy, that Bun B (yeah yeah)
Sound track in the back while we bumpin' (yeah yeah)
