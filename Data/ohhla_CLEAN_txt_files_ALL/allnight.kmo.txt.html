It's about time 
For some action
I'm hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than
A physical attraction
Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good 
Head on her shoulders 
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that I'll go to the butcher store
Cause I'm choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The real magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
So get ready to work
All night long
How many ladies 
Are deep enough
To handle a man 
Like me
I mean mentally
Emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like 'em
Hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like 'em old-fashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women that's a slave to passion
But know when to resist
I like a woman
That's not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever we're good to go
All night long
Scintillating, sultry, stimulating, sexy
Super, subtle, smart, and seductive
Sensitive, serious, succulent, sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of
Mental stimulation
That's causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I can't stand a groupie
But I'll always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause it's cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long
I never like to make the first move
I'ma rapper but I don't rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
I'm too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
Someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if you're for real
And right is how I'll do ya
I'll give you something you can feel
It's like a romance
Right out of a storybook
Without the
Wine and candles
An encounter
You'll never forget
But don't try it
If you can't handle 
All night long
