[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]
Live from Channel 9, 777, straight from heaven
I'm beaming down sick thoughts, to infiltrate the cross
Architecht, post modernes, ill creational
Classic, my style's not old school, it's Jurassic

[Storm Da Ghetto Mutant]
I ravage crews like a typhoon in June
Storming down your coast, deadly female host
Armed with venomous sound bites, building down mics
Casting rays of lights, and the bitches on the rewrite

[Infamous Mr. Savage]
Who be this, dwelling the dephts of the abyss
Infamous retracts, bust backs of lips
Word to my click, we break M.C.'s in any pretense
Dark in the sky, and start my fatality sequence

[Goodfella Mike G.]
G-Fella mafioso, from the Gambino faction
Thrown into the concrete jungle with the action
Eating my linguini, clams of scungilli, don't worry
Mark and Maggot told me just keep it real
From midnight to two, you don't starve, you don't quit
I'm Goodfella Mike G. from the Soul Kid Klik
On 97.7 98.3, KWRNA, what you want from me?</pre>
