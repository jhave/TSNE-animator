[Verse 1]
Uh yea, remember when we first met I told you I wasn't shit
I told you to stay way I told you that you'll regret
But you say you see a different nigga then what they expect
So I showed you how I'm living now you loving me to death
I told you that I was wrong
But I helped you stay strong
Anytime you had a problem couldn't leave you on your own
I guess it's my fault never should've showed you different
When I came to your crib man I should've never kissed you
And not to have you thinking that a nigga losing interest
If a nigga didn't hit it first night, so I did it
You let a nigga hit it then the shit got different
And I'm tell you why just take my just listen
See, taken our time was the part that we was missin'
You was always on my mind even if I didn't hit ya
A little bit of distance got you trippin, now you bitchin
Now you in your dorm room talkin shit to your sister
She probably tellin you its fucked up how I did ya
Told you in the beginning but you never got the picture
But I know that I delivered it right to your door
But you ain't wanna open it cuz you ain't wanna know
Hidin from the truth talkin bout let it flow
And you know I'm in the streets babe you know I'm on the hoes
Shit, but you still hold a nigga close, baby girl still my nigga though

[Chorus]
I know alot of things changed and I know it ain't the same
And you hate to hear my name but, you still my nigga though
I don't say it in vain
I ain't ever gone complain live ya life do ya thing
Man, you still my nigga though
I know it changed and I know it ain't the same and you hate to hear my name
But, you still my nigga though
I don't say it in vain
I ain't ever gone complain live ya life do ya thing
Man, you still my nigga though

[Verse 2]
I ain't seen my nigga Tim in a minute for real
I hit him up he never answer I'm like dog for real?
But I don't blame him he in school with alot on his plate
We always stayed on our grind tryna make us a way
But now I made it feeling gravy, in a bigger estate
I got a big money scheme you ain't with it OK
But if you ever need a thing nigga, don't hesitate
Today or 20 years on down the line, we straight
I said I was missin a women earlier in this tape
And now I'm hearing y'all together I ain't lying its cray
But shit its cool cause I know she got a smile on her face
For remember when I told you about old girl giving me face
So you probably thinking like shit, we ain't cool anyway
Like she really [?] than you, you ain't [?] anyway
Its what I'm telling myself that's my nigga all day
Invite me to the wedding, I'm fuckin who catch the bouquet

[Chorus]</pre>
