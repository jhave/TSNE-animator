[Missy Elliott]
Rich Nice
WOO!  C'mon
SICK!  Uh-huh
YES!  WOO!
HOLLA!

I be thinkin 'bout that big - O
The way you used to rock it to me nice and slow
You used to do it 'til my back felt broke
You used to say give it to me - I'd say no
You used to talk that kinky shit up in my earrrs
And you would buy me pink pretty under-wearrrs
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice
And you would make me feel like makin love twice
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now move it 'round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck
Nine to five, do it live, sho' nuff
I be thinkin 'bout the way you do it good
I like it cause you raised in the hood
Uhh, you put your back into it
I tell you no, change my mind, then I do it
You cute, you fine, you fire
I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
Heather Hunter must of got me inspired
To work for hours, fall asleep, get you tired cause

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinkin 'bout you
Or the way you do what you do
With you I can not lose
I put it down like some brand new shoes
I can't stop thinkin 'bout you
The way you do what you do
With you I can not lose
Now let me put it down

[scratched] I be thinkin 'bout the way you do it good
[scratched] I be thinkin 'bout the way you do it good (YES!!)
[scratched] I be thinkin 'bout the way you do it good

[Missy Elliott]
He wan' take me to a ho-tale, see if it's good
If the nigga sm-ale, when I put it down
He like OH YEAHURR
Taste like apples and a bag of PEARS
Right here, right dere, everywhere
To the bed, to the kitchen, in the wooden chair
He like to hear me moan like MMM-YEAH
Boy's in the zone and I don't care
Sittin on his lap, pullin on my track
He piggidy piggidy piggidy piggy my back
In fact no slack, damn he the mack
He ain't got to work me like dat

[Chorus]

[scratched repeatedly] I'm the boss
[scratched] I'm the boss, do the job, you hired
[scratched] I'm the boss, do the job, you hired

[Missy Elliott]
What I'm sayin, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough
Hey shorty I can't get enough
Can't stop, won't stop - call me Puff
Hold me down to the ground, pick me up
Now move it 'round, break it down, hold up
Scream loud, black and proud, let's fuck
Nine to five, do it live, sho' nuff</pre>
