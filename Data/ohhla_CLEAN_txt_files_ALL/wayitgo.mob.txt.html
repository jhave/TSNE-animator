[Chorus: SOG]
Gangsta and nigga Glock, back in for the '94 [x2]

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Coke and white bitches know how that goes
For the white hoes and the phenerol
Sipping on tuss life moving slow
Look at my dick, thatÄôs hella hoes
Toke on the weed, that's hella dro
Six four, my fo' do'
Head tilt, my waist low
Love my music, she love my flow
Caked up that's lots of dough
More shows, more bank rolls
More ones ass to her pole
Tip her good, drive ass low
Real nigga to the gum sole
You talk shit, get body holes
Toot, toot to the big nose
Snot nose throw it in my cup
Marino, we draped down
Drug hoes, still coked up
Triple beam for the pots and pans
Benz outside, big sedan
Bigger body, be the five fifty
Drop top, no titties
Parking lot pimpin got them hoes with me
Parking lot pimpin got them hoes with me
Tour of town, shut the cities down
Left your hoes, at the shows
Another day of my life, now
Another day of my life, now
Getting money till my time froze
Ice watch no tick-tock
One look, you'll get shots
Make you wet till your blood stops

[Chorus] - 8X

[Verse 2]
Ridin' around in that space ship
.44 pound grip
I-95 bound whip, get the money outta town quick
Flip a pound like a camel bitch
Helicopters for my bricks
In the air, champagne crisp
{?} The bar I'm sipping, bitch
..gun breaks, South flick, fancy clothes, bad bitch
Fuck with me, bands make her dance
That's how fast a car go
Smooth nigga whole figure, run around the mall
Every day I gotta ball, never fall 'till the casket drop
Watch the paint drip, I just took your bitch you all sad and shit
Switch the Caddy up to the big Benz
Spending last years ends

[Chorus] - 8X</pre>
