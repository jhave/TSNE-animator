[Kutt Calhoun-Verse 1]
I ain't gotta fabricate my past, I always done had bitches
You can ask the teachers, principal and his assistant
They know about Melvin Calhoun and they can tell ya
I often had my way when it came to them Isabellas
But this is bout the bitches who wouldn't give me the digits
The time of day not to mention or kindly hate when you spoke to them
You in her vision, you know that you lookin crispy
But all of a sudden she turn her nose up when you be closin in
You know the kind that was prissy and acted rude
Dressin sexy and she was cool cuz her nigga was outta school
Now all I gots to say now is bitch you a fool
You too late up in this for now the bitch heard me on the radio and now she wanna holla Imma
Keep that in mind while you steady standin in line
Waitin for your shirt to get signed and what's goin on through my mind is
She was a dime, but I'm seein now that the time
And the firmness of your behind has depleted, you ain't that fine trick

[Pre-Chorus-Krizz Kaliko]
Now I can say, that the night has turned to day
And yeah you hurt me, but you ain't worthy
You need to get played, cuz I remember way back in the day

[Chorus-Tech N9ne, Krizz kaliko]
Back in the day, she said she didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW
Way back in the day, she said you didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW girl wait a minute

[Kutt Calhoun-Verse 2]
Hey I remember you, used to be the most popular girl
Walkin around in the halls of Central High School
For your sake, let's use cade name Tisha
Always in Nautica shirts and pants and white K-Swiss's or Eastlands
Remeber how I used to be peekin and seekin
At the skippin parties you wouldn't speak it
Gave me your number then I found out you was just teasin
Your befriend was a balla on with the beefin
I wasn't old enough and plus I didn't sell deep in
It's crazy how a chick could cut you low at the knees man
Later caught up with you, that's when I found out that he's been
Labled a snitch and now he sits in the penitentiary and he'll never get out get out
I know it hurts don't it To know you wasted your time
Now you baby mama, hard times, those are the worst moments
You kinda cute, but not fine, told me you notice my shine
Asked me if you could be mine, let me retort on it

[Pre-Chorus-Krizz Kaliko]
Now I can say, that the night has turned to day
And yeah you hurt me, but you ain't worthy
You need to get played, cuz I remember way back in the day

[Chorus-Tech N9ne, Krizz kaliko]
Back in the day, she said she didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW
Way back in the day, she said you didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW girl wait a minute

[Kutt Calhoun-Verse 3]
This last one is sort of a doozy, Lord I miss Susie
Q and all the cream fillin sure to be oozin
She more than a floozy, whore she a beauty star
I tell you imma go and mi amore, straight Spanish
You used to walk around in leather and lace spandex
And any nigga caught in her ground would make panic
A fiesty lil chica with ass and stayed mannish
Would cut a bitch in a blind second she gave damage
She never messed wit a black dude
The very first girl i ever seen wit a back full of tattoos
And mami I'm at you, and she didn't front
She let me get in between them thighs and hips
put her legs all around my head and let me drill it kill it
Now I'm infatuated, was on her everyday
Once I ejaculated, don't wanna ever stray
Niggas was glad to hate it, got props in every way
And I ain't mad she gave it, so I won't ever say

[Chorus-Tech N9ne, Krizz kaliko]
Back in the day, she said she didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW
Way back in the day, she said you didn't wanna NOW
That I'm makin big pay, she smellin my aroma WOW girl wait a minute

[Outro]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
Back in the days when I was young back back back back
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
Back in the days, back in the days</pre>
