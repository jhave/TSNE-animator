And you can tell that maybe time is out of joy my love
So this is maybe just a SOS shrapnel, an echo of dead sentiment
Measurement across the nothing for no one awaits that effort to shrug
Or maybe resident incurable romantic defunct in the face of fact
Blackboard formula waits by the next class
with the outlines still intact, and I see it
And I'm still not sure of the meaning 
But I'll say it, write it down, and read it for you

No protective leathery flesh of emotional chain-mail
(No running shoes) no running, no locking doors, no anger
(No e-mail) no voicemail communicational strangulation 
Or distortion of purity sentiment
No fantasy of reconciliation or delusion of no revenge
(No bullshit) no culture hidden agendas, no preaching
(No pedestal) no standing on the pulpit, no ego, no new speaker freakish lingo 
(Here I go...) 
I haven't loved many people 
I grew up afraid that I was crazy 
And one time when I was deep inside your body you purred
And I was sure that you were gonna have my baby
And you can tell that maybe time is out of joy my love
So this is maybe just a SOS shrapnel, an echo of dead sentiment 
Measurement across the nothing for no one awaits that effort to shrug 
And you can tell that maybe time is out of joy my love 
So this is maybe just a SOS, shrapnel, an echo of dead sentiment 
Measurement across the nothing for no one awaits that effort to shrug 
I used to be in love... 

Everything you said I took it all to heart 
And you spurred a change in me 
Before I could become a new sun I had to fall apart 
And I can see that now 
And I wish you well 
Cause you saw what was good in me 
And I'll be god damned if I didn't see that myself
And everything you are 
I know you got to cry 
Before I could become a man I had to lose my mind had to lose my mind 
And I see that now 
And I wish you well 
Cause I see what's good in you 
And I'll be god damned if you cant see that yourself</pre>
