[Saul Williams]
...Can you feel it? Nothing can save you
I'm tougher than bullets so, baby, pray to your savior
I never been shot, but I bet you I'm braver
I'm taking my spot, NIGGA, I ain't afraid to be me
Sometimes I find it very hard to be..."Who?"
Me (The inevitable rise and liberation of NiggyTardust!)

Yo, the banana peels are carefully placed! 
So keep your shell toes carefully laced! The illest nigga got peppered and maced! 
Now amplify this turn up the bass!

[Saul Williams]
Picture me, lampin' in the company car
Rims like Tibetan prayer wheels
Nigga what, I'm a star
I cruise the block like a feather back and forth 'til I 
land as the song in your ear or the book in your hand.
Now the whole fuckin world 'bout to know who I am
Got your whole system up in my trunk
That 'dog eat dog' make my woofers bark: atomic crunk 
All my trill niggas know who be bringin da funk
Lees and shell toes like it's Black History Month


Yo, the banana peels are carefully placed! 
So keep your shell toes carefully laced! The illest nigga got peppered and maced! 
Now amplify this turn up the bass!

[Saul Williams]
There was one
Bore witness to the rays of the sun
Synthesized in her own image, photo negative, shun
The development of Parliament, the phallic bop gun
Thus, the mother-ship connection spawned the birth of the drum
Ancient drum begat drum
Kingdom go, kingdom come
Ancient sector of the scepter risen up to the Sun 
Hidden hand of man begat patented clone of the drum
Boom bap strapped into a wire, tightly coiled, and re-spun
Trigger sound, trigger gun, drum machine, machine gun, bodies piled
Carefully filed under beats that were once reprogrammed to become: unplugged concert of sun.
Every ray with sample clearance 
Every two begat one
Boom bop hard as a gun.
White cross-trainers, unstrung 
Let these suckas know the cost of making Harriet run
Let the North Star be your guiding post when turned from the sun 
until knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone


Yo, the banana peels are carefully placed! 
So keep your shell toes carefully laced! The illest nigga got peppered and maced! 
Now amplify this turn up the bass!
