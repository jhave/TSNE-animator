Check this here

[Verse 1]
Comin' through, comin' through, like taxi cabs in rush hour
From uptown to the Twin Towers
Makin' a statement, once again, with no replacement
Erick Sermon comin' from the basement
I leave you blown away like Jeff Bridges
Mind boggling, cuttin' through ya brain like a pair of scizzors
When you see me at a show, don't bother grabbin' this microphone
I'm terra-fabulous with out it, holmes
Spritually, I'm like the holy ghost
I bring joy, to the average girl and boy
Def Squad, we got more faith than dick-ruckers
I feel sorry for any crew out there tryin to fuck us
I blind MCs, like Ray Charles while I'm drinking Pepsi
Which will kill(?), so don't test me
The super supreme, mackadose, ya host
Erick Sermon, representin for my coast

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Just because you made a hit record
don't make you a star in one year
let's get things clear

[sampled voice] Free your minds! [4X]

[Verse 2]
I rock the mic, safe and sound, like DJ Quik
In the mix, without packin' a M6
Bein up on the scene, eyes are green, no bullshit
Niggas sayin' they pull shit, but won't pull dick
Fake hardcore MCs with fake hardcore crews one in the same
Practicin' brand new gun names
And new swing, they sound more street
They gain more peeps so they won't let the (?)
Only west coast was kickin' that shootin' cops
Fuck that bitch shit, now we all on they dick
I represent The Bridge is Over, Eric B. for President
Gettin' Raw, Rockin' Bells, and Raising Hell
I ain't knockin' those out there keepin' it real with the steel
Yall know the deal
But if you ain't shot nobody, don't claim to be a John Gotti
Remember the days of La-Di-Da-Di

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I been shootin' nine-mils, 45's since '89, Black
In the big payback (yeah)
I struck crazy jewels
I got robbed one time, yeah you sucka
But now the kid is gone, motha fucka
I had beef with one nigga after me and my group had broke up
At least from jail, and I woke up
So don't think I was a shook one, or scared
I laugh, I wanted to catch a charge for yo' black ass
I coulda commenced to beatin' you down in front of your bitch, but I didn't care
That year, I was a millionaire (yeah)
Don't try to play me, cause I got two million plaques on my walls
And you don't have the balls (yeah)
My squad is Def, and we don't hear nothin'
No time for frontin', tell me when you want somethin'
I jam like NBA, the E-R-I-C-K is the NUH!
Comin' with the HOOH!

[Chorus]

[Talking]
Yeah, just because you made a hit record don't make you stars
Know what I'm sayin? Words up

[beat fades out]</pre>
