[Chorus]
Its not a day in my life that goes by
That I don't get high as the tears fill my eyes
And I scream why, did my sister have to die Lord
Take these evil plots off my mind Lord
Its not a day in my life that goes by
That I don't get high as the tears fill my eyes
And I scream why, did my sister have to die Lord
Take these evil plots off my mind Lord

[Verse]
It's so hard to say goodbye to what we had, I'm still mad
I'm still bitter, no still get rid of
Pain inside me been active two years
It's like it happened yesterday and I'm consumed in tears
I feel ya near
But it's not the same, won't be the same
We can't call each other up for advice or hang
No more, nigga to that left me with some memories
Tangled with the thoughts that he bleeds, dies slowly
For sholy, my needs to see him suffer fucks with my mind
And leaves a cluster of rage and hate inside
Thou shall not kill, an eye for an eye
Turn the other cheek, you reap what you sow, which way should I go
So many times I contemplate on murder
Cause only a monster could of hurt ya, you're a ghetto flower
So every hour, minute, second of the day
I pray that turmoil haunts his whole family, till eternal sleep
From the elderly to the unborn
You cannot know how I feel till you mourn how I've mourned
It's all real, I love hard and hate with a passion
So when they took my best friend, my heart shattered and left me empty
I used to had been in love
And all my niggas trying to figure out why it's so tough for me
To love em' like I'm supposed to
But since you got killed Jill it's hard for me to get close to
Anybody who cares for me, so I been dealing with this pain by my lonely
I strongly despise, motherfuckers trying to speak your mind
Whoever knew you, with pitchfork tongues spreading rumors
This dame ain't bout shit without my sister by my side
My strength, my best friend, my pride makes me wanna ride
Jill I know you got your wings, fixed hair up in Heaven
While Michelle sings "Precious Love", it's so hard for me to let go
Because the hate has stayed in my soul and made me so cold
Even though I know she's resting now
A major part of my life was cut out, pray for me Lord

[Chorus x2]
