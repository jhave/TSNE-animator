[Intro]
I'm tryin to tell you but you won't hear me son
The nigga be right there in front of them buildings
Yeah nigga, yeah (yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah nigga, yeah (yeah)
Yeah nigga, yeah (yeah!)
Yeah yeah yeah nigga, yeah {*growls*}

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I line niggaz, I do my homework
I'll find niggaz, the niggaz that did that
They my niggaz, you bring that bullshit
'round my niggaz, you die, DIE NIGGA DIE!

[50 Cent]
I right 'bout where your man'll stay, my man blew your man away
Did him dirty and ran away, who's the next candidate?
Get hit with the cannon AY! You lil' niggaz wan' play
We can go back and forth in broad day
Let it off, hop in the rental car, pull away smooth
Put that twerk in that work and we at you with the tools
Nigga we ain't sellin packs no more so we ain't on the strip
Got that llama in the 'Llac strapped leanin in the whip

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
First I find your bitch creep, then we found a nail shop
Now would you looky here, we done found your momma's spot
It's so easy, damn I'm greasy
Goons don't use Auto-Tune, that's Yeezy
Yeah, summer now, good time to hunt you down
Keep the pump around, we catch him we gon' slump him now
Timin is everything, I plot it out perfect
Drop a bag off to my nigga just to make it worth it

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Nigga whattup!
These niggaz think I'm playin with 'em, yeah
Niggaz smilin and shit, go 'head nigga!
Keep thinkin I'm careful
I'll shoot the SHIT out of these niggaz man
I let my niggaz go, WATCH! (I line niggaz)
OH MY GOD! Y'all niggaz KNOW ME (I line niggaz)
Y'all wasn't supposed to let me get this money!
Now what? (I line niggaz)</pre>
