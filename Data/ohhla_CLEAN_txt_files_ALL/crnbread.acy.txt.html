[Aceyalone]
Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

Ah man, I'm just a brother whose intentions are good
Oh lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I gotta 10 fifty-fo' under the hood
Several stages of lifespan, damned if I would
be a dope when it's not a laughin matter
Modern contemporary man still hunt and gather data
They want glamour, the priceless prize
Give 'em a torch and they put the fire to your eyes
Give 'em a inch they take a yard and they pull your card
Throw a wrench so far in yours it'll leave a scar
Raise the bar, I pass it with the right scholastics
They made it plastic, that's why they couldn't grasp it
I always knew that you would fail me
Once shame on me twice you shouldn't have to tell me
And I'll be damned if I'll let you get away with that
I just ain't playin that, that's that bullshit!

Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs

Yo - hold your head up, you only got your life left
Make the right step and don't sing the wrong song
Fight somebody your own damn size
You dead wrong, thinkin you won't meet yo' demise
This baby here, gon' grow up to be a king
I don't know how you seein things, but that's a fact
It'll be over my dead body
if I let you put a mother{fuckin} monkey on his back
Shit ain't changed, it's just the choices
The voices in your head sayin do what you don't gotta do
They scared of themselves which means that they scared of me
And them the same, punk-ass fools that shot at you
The lord giveth and he taketh away
God bless that I can live to see another day
And if I had it my way I'd hang you all by the neck
Have some respect, I'll serve and protect

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat

And if my teachers could see you now
They'll take your head, cause you probably wouldn't even bow
You ain't humble, you mumble jumble
Your tower of so-called power'll crumble
You killed my uncle, put a dagger through my brother's heart
I need another start, cause if I knew then
what I know now, it'll be wild
Booyaka! Booyaka! I'll put you in the ground
A peaceful man ain't got no place here
I guess you wanna see 'em all die with the lambs
I face fear everyday 'til the space is clear
Then I fight 'em like a man cause it's what I am
Somebody told me the road to freedom is lonely
but I swear I ain't goin on my own
I'm takin my sisters, my families, my homies
Now I'm about to take this mother(fucker) home

Aiyyo the police short Cornbread in the street
And they just killed Cochise over a beat
Jardine and the kids tryin to make ends me
Half dead and do dirty as some God damn thiefs</pre>
