[Bars &amp; Hooks]
We ain't goin platinum (nope) we ain't goin gold
We goin diamond - ten million sold
We break records (records) and move units, that's how we do it
(Do it do it) Makin millions and billions from movies and music
World tourin, shows, performin
The deals, the budgets, accounts, enormous
We got it (got it) you frontin, you need it, you want it
The Mobb, and Bars, and Hooks, we comin
Delorean, and Mr. Bars, how about that?
We some Queensbridge niggaz that ain't all about rap
We own streets, run websites, log on
to the one and only, InfamousStores.com
We load up the tour buses, to get these checks
We independent, we don't need your respect
We +Infamous Minded+, you've been blinded
It's Bars &amp; Hooks nigga, we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Yeah, what more do y'all want from us?
We spill our hearts out and it still ain't enough
Years we got crumbs, doin the supplyin
We independent now - we.. goin.. diamond!
Yeah, what more could you ask for?
We the team, we deserve everything and more
All the blood and sweat for our dead we stopped cryin
Swallowed it, survived it - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Prodigy]
You might catch me steppin out the Lamborghini
with ashy legs, my chain swingin
I grab my piece, so that shit won't damage the paint
Chest naked holdin a drink
We got these hoes by the brain, we black rap moguls
We the most poppin, we the illest niggaz rhymin
Let's go team for team, you don't want that
We make niggaz quit rap, we so violent
The only thing that calm us down is more dollars
We need NBA cash, the yachts, the labs
The Porsche, Ferrari, the Hummer, you mad?
AK-90, the sigs, the macs
Grenades, silencers, sterlings that blast
To Linden, the sweeper to murder yo' ass
You doubted my niggaz (WORD) now we up
Yeah, you musta been wildin - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus: 2nd half + 1st half reversed]

[Bars &amp; Hooks]
We gon' kill 'em with this here, and ship ten million
This year, look on the charts it's there
at the number one spot, locked of course
by these ghetto street pharmacist entrepeneurs
Who woulda thought?  The car I always wanted get bought
Sittin on ten times twos, rollin by you
It gets bigger, I remember bein broke
So the plan now is to get richer
Ain't gon' be no scufflin my nigga, I ain't gon' fight ya
I'ma pay the piper to snipe ya, it's real like that
Goin diamond make you feel like that
Cause I done been through the bullshit, dealt with the bullshit
Now I'm lampin, mansion, and a few whips
Ain't nothin but a thug thing, this the club theme
Bars &amp; Hooks to H.N.I.C. we climbin
Finally we shinin - we.. goin.. diamond!

[Chorus]

Fuck y'all niggaz man
We goin diamond.. we goin diamond..
Knahmsayin?  Move these units.. do these shows..
and hold this money.. hold the cash
We goin diamond.. goin diamond..
We goin diamond.. diamond diamond diamond
We goin diamond.. we goin diamond..
We goin diamond, we goin diamoind..
We.. goin.. diamond!</pre>
