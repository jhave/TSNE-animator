Gotti gotti we've been dying to get a hold of you for this interview
You have this new album dropping and everyone just wants to know
What's been going on with you where have you been?

[Yo Gotti]
Well I was kicking down on Watkins on some motherfuckin' hustling shit
Catching my cone tryin to get old listen to that triple 6
Mr. Ian looked at me gotti let go take a trip
I know where they got them beeper 3 for we can get em shipped
See baby the ground is mine niggas try to disrespect
Be poochin' and grab the chopper fuck around and left em' wet
Twenty - fours Yokohama we look like some superstars
No more pop off we play we got TV sterna's in the trunk
Rappin' ain't no fucking thang block burna big biggidy bang
Me and my guys be sellin' them pies since 95' we out the frame
Gotti representing the streets so Swizzo let 'em feel the beef
Try to steal my flow but niggas know they ain't real as me
Back when I was whippin' chickens choppin' bricks in momma kitchen
Never knew that rap shit would establish me a mill ticket
Shinin', grindin' , never mindin' niggas winin' bout a bitch
I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit

[skits]

I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit
(Movin' the zone movin' my throne)
(I&amp;E is the label I consider my home)
I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit
(I&amp;E is the label I consider my home)

[Yo Gotti]
I'm from the north cuzz were I was tought cuzz
Was doin' my own thang never had a boss cuzz
So if you didn't know Gotti still C.E.O
It's block burnin' with yo bro but they don't feel me tho
I represent the M Project Pat and Fly and them
And all the pioneers that put it down for Gotti them
They say I'm new school but Gotti old school
Been having birds fuck what cha' heard I'm just a young dude
I'm just the truth and the realest to come up out the town
Keeping' it Memphis delivering the universal sound
It's fucking going down it ain't no fucking round
The king of Memphis you trippin' give me the fucking crown
It's fucking going down it ain't no fucking round
The king of Memphis you trippin' give me the fucking crown

[skits]

(I&amp;E is the label I consider my home)
I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit
I'm combining' every line and perfect timing with this shit
