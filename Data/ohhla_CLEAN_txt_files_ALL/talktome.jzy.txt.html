[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah)
Whassup? (Whassup?)
Yeah (yeah)
It's 103 nigga
It's what you been waitin on
Without further adieux
Let's go

[Young Jeezy]
I'm tired, I feel wired but yet, I'm still inspired
If you find somebody else for the job, tell me I'm fired
Man, really motherfuck what they say, I did my job
Young hood nigga straight off the block, I beat the odds
Now you see a nigga back to the wall, now you excited
Now I'm done, everything for you niggaz but get indicted
Got, niggaz in the Feds wishin I was there with 'em
Death penalty, go throw me in the jail rhythm
Rather die in the hands of the judge than former friends
Man this shit is like an ongoin movie, it never ends
Same niggaz said that they would, love you forever
Niggaz get that forecast and change just like the weather
Got me feelin like a whole brick, cut with some pain
From winter days, yeah they start off sunny and then it rains
And even after all these years it's still stormin
You couldn'ta told 'em it would be like this, you coulda warned 'em
Somebody talk to me!

[Eminem] + (Jeezy)
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringin so loud (somebody talk to me)
Someone has got somethin to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face~! (somebody talk to me)
Ohhhh-oh, ohhhh-oh
Someone's got a problem I wanna know
Keep my name out your motherfuckin mouuuuuth
Somebody talk to me...

[Freddie Gibbs]
Walkin like I fuckin talk it, play it how I say it
And I swear sometimes hear voices talkin to me in my head
Some nights I slept amongst the livin dead to get this bread
It's two ways out this shit, a casket or the fuckin Feds
I rap cause one day I pray this might be my escape
Every day I seal up these baggies, seems like I'm sealin my fate
My momma birthed a young gangsta, jumped off the porch out the gate
But I can't let my momma bury me, that's some shit she can't take
Most niggaz hate when you come up and you doin somethin constructive
Police to the politician, my whole city corrupted
Wanna convict me for a couple transactions that I conducted
And my homeboy just might snitch under pressure so motherfuck him
It's just me and my two nuts and you can bet they gon' hang
And bitch my résumé gon' check out 'til I check out the game
Sometimes that ski mask on my skull it took effect on my brain
And I still live to tell this shit, I'm sick of tellin you mayne
Somebody talk to 'em

[Eminem]
Somebody talk to me
Somebody better explain how my name's endin up in your mouth
Somebody talk to me
You got two seconds to talk, I want some answers right the fuck now
Somebody talk to me
If it's me that you're, talkin about then I, I wanna know-ohh!
Somebody talk to me
We're almost past the point of bein able to talk this shit out
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringin so loud
If someone's got somethin to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face~!</pre>
