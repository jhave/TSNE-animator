[Chorus]
Got my guns and magazines
Indirect but from my beam
Nothing is quite as it seems
Fuck with me and you will see

[Interlude]
Shoot your gun I'll make you a believerrrrr
Now you better pray for something morrrrre

[50 Cent]
I go to war to my house, stuntin niggaz ain't listenin
Get to thumpin and to dumpin at your newborn's christenin
Tell your homie tell his homies he gon' need more homies
Ain't this a bitch, I got that extended clip right on me
And my diamonds on my neck, I dare a nigga to scheme on it
That Ruger on deck, it's hard to miss with the beam on it
I'll give ya ass a permanent nap, sing you a lullaby
I got money to run, so fuck a alibi

[Interlude]

[50 Cent]
Yeah, I believe you when you say you tough nigga
All that means is you fucked nigga
I get the drop I'm on it
Morning noon and night, I spot ya, I got ya
Wake up cuffed to your bed, cops askin who shot ya
As the world turns, {?} we learned that hollow tips burn and I ain't concerned
If I ain't hit then I ain't hit so a nigga don't really give a shit
You know who you're fuckin with, come through dump more than a clip
Niggaz be on some stupid shit, 'til you get hit, ain't that a bitch?

[Kidd Kidd]
Uhh, K-I-double, shotgun barrel double
My homies run a couple and I move 'em on the double
Racks in the duffle, mac with the muzzle
Make me circle you in all black like a tunnel
I only know how to hustle, can't stay out of trouble
I got a big gun, motherfuck a scuffle
"Kidd Kidd, will you ever change?" Fuck no~!
Pimp zone, rider gang, you already fuckin know

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Kidd Kidd]
Man, these niggaz so fake I call 'em knock offs
Like Pringles, I'll pop your top off
You ain't hot dog, you the fuckin Mickie Mouse soft
I'm on fire like Louisiana hot sauce
Brand new J's cost a buck-fifty nigga
You scuff these I'll skull your face buck-fifty nigga
Been fuckin with them pigs, you a guinea nigga
And you always big and you a skinny nigga
I wear my gun like it's trendy nigga
You pussy and ain't shit, kitty litter
Uh, see where all that bitchin get ya?
Right in front of this pistol - huh?!

[Chorus] + [Interlude]</pre>
