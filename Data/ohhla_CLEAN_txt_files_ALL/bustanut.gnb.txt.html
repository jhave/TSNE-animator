Yo, uh, yeah
Bust a nut in me shit

Pull your pants down let me how big is your dick
Gotta be big enough to beat this fat ass with
And before you stick it in better head for the clit (why)
Bang, bang these niggas like it's no next day
Leave their dick so limp
There balls wanna jump inside the pussy and play
Dominatrix with Marie Antoinette
Two nuts is all you got nigga I'm just getting wet

[Pras]
Fuck two nuts, listen here I bust ten
With enough adrenaline
The strength of ten men
When I penetrate
Girlfriend I'll have you wylin 
Dick strong like Long Island
Plus long like Long Island

[Marie Antoinette]
Fuck you so hard your platinum turn plated
Ghetto Superstar is always over-rated
What you want
Suck the cunt
From the back or the front
Your dick ain't good enough 
So I have to smoke a blunt
To puff

(Chorus) x2

[Pras (during Chorus)]
Come on
What you crazy
Yeah
What you wanna do?</pre>
