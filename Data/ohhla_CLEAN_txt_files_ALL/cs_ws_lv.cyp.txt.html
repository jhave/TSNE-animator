[B-Real]
Watch me attack the brain with dope lyrics
The broadcast worldwide don't can't you hear it
Everywhere you look around nothin' but soldiers
Sickside do or die big money holders
I know you, you got a chip on your shoulder
Walk around talkin' like your runnin' shit's over
Never hesitated to the fray take suckers out
Roll 'em up smoke 'em and take those fuckers out
I don't follow I got the hollow point shell
With these swell headed busters yo I ring bells
You don't know me I bring the streets where you livin' at
Killers hustlers and thieves remember that
Makes no difference to me my strategy
Seek the enemy crush 'em into a memory
Say a prayer
Then spit on his grave, crack slayer
Layer the flows the players and hoes
Awaken the pros forsakin' the foes
Rakin' the dough breakin' the shows
For stickin' my nose tu te onas
Don't wanna follow but you wait on us
Break a leg for my weight when you fake on us
'Cause the two faced bitches can't gain my trust

[Chorus : B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
And you can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop

[Sen Dog]
Nothin' you can do when a crew cut you open
Go and take a hit third eye but I be scopin'
I fuck around and say some shit leave ya frozen
Niggaz are scared of shit like they broken
See I go buck wild when I bust a style
You can't fade this man from the tropical isle
So damn versatile I'm mad I never smile
So take this here and stick it in your file
Never been a man or woman to get over
Her she'll be catchin' a bus with that stroller
Him he'll be tastin' my fist when I roll the
Two face sucker down the roll I'm supposed to
Soak what they say that's the wrong way to play
But intallas goin' down know what I sayin'

[Chorus : B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
Huh!

[B-Real]
You can't stop the bum rush crushin' those bitches
I've dropped the death touch put you outta business
Everybody wanna do the shit that we do
We're the live feature you're the preview
See you on the battle ground better bring two
Time for subtraction punk this means you
Give me your bag of weed so I can chill out
If you're blind then you gotta feel what Real's about
Explore whither in to the unknown
Roll deeper in the battle zone find your way home
We hold heat high streets play the monopoly
Watch these soldiers here break you off properly
Heave it your ass off the mic my property
Watch these soldiers here break you off properly


[Chorus : B-Real &amp; Sen Dog]
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
You can't stop and you don't stop
Huh!</pre>
