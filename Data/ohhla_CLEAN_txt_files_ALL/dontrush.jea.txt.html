[Intro]
9th, 9th's got them beats that you just sing to for no
reason
{*laughs*}
Sometimes you got to get to know yourself
You gotta travel a little bit
Look at yourself from another perspective
So I try to do that
Come on

[Verse 1]
Listen, there's nothing like knowin' yourself
Like the way I know that smokin's kind of broken my health
Like the way I know my flow don't make appropriate wealth
I can't change that
But funny I'm sayin' that when it's money I'm aimed at
I give a fuck if you frame that or quote it (shit)
I meant what I said cuz I wrote it, point noted
I know I'm overly sensitive when it comes to, well
Just about everything
And I'm so hardheaded, I don't need your help
Like no advice for these records 'less it's me, myself
Like I don't ever want to breathe if it requires assistance
Just, just shut down my system
I'm a victim of choosin' bad love, bad luck Lucy
Every man touched seems to be a doozy and plus
I'm attached to this looseleaf, stand on my two feet
So it's hard enough to even have to physically move me
Go ahead, try

[Hook]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
Don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light
And they say life needs everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Verse 2]
I gotta be more disciplined
I'm listenin' more to straight logic
Blockin' random shit that's driftin' in
Age is a motherfucker (damn right)
Find myself starin' at the little kids
Thinkin' "I can beat 'em like a stepmother"
Creepin' on a come up at thirty soon
But lookin' twenty ooh
The food catches up to you now plenty
Attendin' christenin's of my best friend's children
And then askin' who's next
And I'm wishin' for six more wishes for Christmas or
Kids on the wish list
Or time machines to be in existence
I'm a team player, not
The dry wit is similar to Arizona weather
Say it, nigga, hot
Patent leather sole, tappin' at my bowl
If the album's not platinum then I'll have to rack a gold
This rappin' ain't for nothin'
Unless I hold plaques so I can sit up on a boat like Colin, roll that
And you know that

[Hook]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
Don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light
And they say life needs everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Verse 3]
See this here is the most serious that I've ever been
The most clear headed
My gear fetish clearly needs an accountant
So if I need I'll smoke 'em all like Dennis Leary in a mountain
Beef's great though, thanks for addin' more insecurities
Just as I was findin' my level of maturity
Just as I was mindin' my business
Tried to murder Jean's confidence
But lucky for me, you're all incompetent
Road block in this, yes
I see him try to put a stop to my obnoxiousness but
I stay long winded like sayin' George Papadopoulous
I know but I write from this heart with this
So I've got some things to work on
My moodiness like masturbation gets its jerk on
My fascination with the fast pace
Money's encapsulated in my mind space like what a thrill
Past dated and I know I'm not in last place
But it's hard to work through it with this masked face
And maskin' tape on all the windows keeps the cold out
And everytime I'm layin' down my back breaks because it's old now
I yell too much, get stressed too quick
But the best thing about it, I can change that shit
And still remain who I came down to Earth to be
It's not Jean Grae, that's just a name, you'll see

[Hook]
I know I'm on the right path
To who I'm gonna be at last
Don't rush me nigga
I know I'm wrong and right
At the same time, both I'm the dark and light
And they say life needs everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
Just don't rush me
Don't rush me

[Outro]
Please don't make me kill you, I don't want to
I don't need to go to jail right now
I got things to do
Can't be locked up man
My momma, my momma
No momma, no, no
Anyway, yo thanks man
Thank you 9th
And we had a beautiful lunch
Don't be afraid to talk in the back
Thanks everybody for coming out tonight
Justus League! What up Flames?
What up though!
Flames, you're dope
You the man Flames
{*laughs*} You the man
We out</pre>
