[Intro]
I'm ridin 'round with that nina
You know we smokin on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?
(Cool)

[Chorus]
36 O's so I'm ridin 'round with that nina (I'm ridin 'round with that Nina)
Ridin with a hoe named Keisha, smokin on Keisha (you know we smokin on Keisha)
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you hoe?" (hey can I meet you hoe?)
She fly high, high in the sky, hoe I can't see you (well I can't see you)
Got a condo on my wrist - girl, I'm cashin out (I'm cashin out)
Got a condo around my neck - girl, I'm cashin out (I'm cashin out)
36 O's so I'm ridin 'round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi can I meet you?"

[Ca$h Out]
I got Versace all on my back, these hoes all on my back
plus these plugs all on my back, cause they know I'm movin that pack
These Louies all in my face, fo'-fifth stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothin, so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm 'bout it, me walkin 'round with no check on me
Psssh - yeah I doubt it~!
Your girl ain't finna leave with me? Psssh - yeah I doubt it~!
And I'm like, what the hell they talkin' bout?
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy you know I'm cashin out (cool)

[Chorus]

[Ca$h Out]
Okay I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they comin by flocks in
Birds comin by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money, I'm poppin
No actin, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't loosing
Don't act like yo' hoe ain't choosin
I'm blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb, ridin round blowin on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms, top flo' suite chillin at The Palms
We want the whole loaf leave y'all the crumbs, 'til then I'm runnin my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti; I'm callin my jet up (cool)

[Chorus]

[Ca$h Out]
Yeah - it's big pimpin over here - CHUUCH
Time to cop the Maybach already had da vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumpin out the kitchen
And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice, just like you playin hockey
And in the booth, I beat the beat up
Call me Rocky, yeah I'm cocky (cool)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'm ridin 'round with that nina
You know we smokin on Keisha
Hey, hey, hey can I meet you hoe?</pre>
