Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hi kids
Welcome to cloud nine
We sure are glad ya stopped by to see us!
We got some special suprises for your red asses today
We got the insane clown posse, in the studio with the kottonmouth kings
Put your thinkin caps on and think for yourself!

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves

[Verse 1 - Daddy X]
This life time here
Shits kinda funny
Seems like everybody's out for the money
Everybodys chasin fake fortune and fame
The worlds gone insane it's like we lost our brain
Got the poparazzi snappin pop culture
We feedin on the copies like a packa vultures
I don't give a fuck about brittany or rehab
She gobble nuts
And look like a skinhead

Lindsay Lohan can swim in the ocean
With two cement shoes and some calamine lotion
Paris Hilton can be worth a billion
I wouldn't fuck that bitch with madonna's 10 children
Baby Surrey or Angie Jolina can drink pipe cleana from Mista Dobaleena
Mista Ddobbaleena Mists Bbobdobbaleena
I gotta big fat spliff with patron ta kill ha

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.

[Verse 2 - Insane Clown Posse]
Ryan seacrest gets a fist through his weak chest
And all the millionaire hot hoes get skeet spits
I gives a fuck whos drunk and fuckin at the grammy's
Loco breakin up or too fuckin skinny
Lil kids walking home mad miles a day
'cause they moms ain't tryin ta fuckin miss judge judy
I WILL STAB YO ASS
I send they ass to alaska
I think for myself like a samauri has ta
Who is who or anybody else to review what anybody else do
And who the fuck is who to tell you
Ask the magic eight ball
Call a psychic hotline
I don't need your opinion on shit 'cause I got mine

Think for yourself original and authentic
With this fresh lifetime we get to ride on this planet
There's two many followers
Dumbasses by the masses
You betta think so hard you fuckin shatta yo glasses

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.

[Verse 3 - D-Loc]
I make my own moves so I set my own pace,
I got my own rules double-dash is the name
I do my own thing like the president does
Sometimes I'm like fuck the world 'cause I don't give a fuck
When I do it let's do it every time we gettin to it yeah yeah we gettin to it
Clownz and the kings we back at it again
You know we dippin again
So go run and tell ya friends

[Johnny Richter]
Go and tell ya friends
Better yet, alert the public
Kottonmouth kings with icp and people lovin it
Think for yaself 'cause I'm thinkin bout me
Havin fun in my life and makin sure my family neva has to worry bout the bullshit at hand
Takin care a everbody livin in my own land
Take a pitcha 'cause it lasts longer face the fame
Id rather do my own thing than play ya sick little game!

[Chorus]
Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.

Think for yourself man don't do like they do, it's a sick world, you just gotta stay true
Stay true and everything'll be cool, you gotta blaze ya own trails and make ya own moves.
