[Film Dialogue]
You think you can do this to me?
You motherfuckas will be playin basketball in Pelican Bay
when I get finished with you... youth program niggas (whoo, whoo)
23-hour lockdown
I'm the man up in this piece
You'll never see the light of-who the fuck do you think you fuckin with?
I'm the police, I run shit here, you just live here
Yeah, that's right, you better walk away
Go and walk away cus I'ma burn this muthafucka down
King Kong aint got shit on me (whoo, whoo.. )

[Roscoe]
From project to the projects
Illegal substance and illegal objects
I neva leave the house with out my Tech
If you aint from the hood then get out my set
We loco, I'ma waste a gizzle aint for livin
Got me facin prison chasin the feelin
I give from the I taste of scrilla, to eighty children in the cold
Before we can arrange a building, then lost in gold
And all the police crooked
To put a slug in me and I took it
A minor, judge say I got no case
He knows my face; he got a grudge from the old days
He won't accept my apology, just don't feel it
My brain on drugs like eggs on a skillet
I come up in the courtroom smellin like killa
It's cool I be freakin

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna know about what happens around here
(In my hood)
You don't wanna see the way we live and die round here
(My hood)
Fo real, you wouldn't last a second around here
(In my hood)
If you aint down then blast your weapon around here
(My hood)

[Film Dialouge]
I'm the police, I run shit here (In my hood)
I'm the man up in this piece (My hood)

[Roscoe]
It's mayhem, in this hood I stayed in
No safety, I keep the K waved in
I'm the guard dog and the house alarm
I leave a heat in the couch to protect my mom
I got a pit bull named Luni, all white
And it aint nobody that he wont bite
I post on the stoop all night
Getting toast of the flow with my troops all night
Layin a foot down I keep hand on the swess tight around the fo pound
I got a bulletproof vest to support now
But some how I don't think it's gonna help when it goes down
Man up, control your smiles and cries
Stand up, and never lay down and die
Cus the cops don't wanna help out
They wanna see "The animals wipe themselves out"

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna know about what happens around here
(In my hood)
You don't wanna see the way we live and die round here
(My hood)
Fo real, you wouldn't last a second around here
(In my hood)
If you aint down then blast your weapon around here
(My hood)

[Roscoe]
Now it aint easy to live on my block
Slugs fly through the sky like bugs
Shells reing from the sky like hell
It's Hell on Earth
For homies to dwell on my turf
The cops don't wanna help out
Unless we sell out, so they stuff us in the YA jailhouse
And good cops get fired and silenced
More crooked cops hired for violence
Assignments to investigate
All profits being made in the Section 8
It's to the point where some brothers go to jail
just to get off the streets and eat
Undercovers try to take me under
But I shake 'em off with my Schwin
I can lose them narks in the projects
They wont know what building I'm in
C'mon

[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna know about what happens around here
(In my hood)
You don't wanna see the way we live and die right here
(My hood)
Fo real, you wouldn't last a second around here
(In my hood)
If you aint down then blast your weapon around here
(My hood)
