Here we do it like 1 and 2 and 3 and to the 4
R and to the O to the C's at the doe
Cruisin make a move get clapped on us
So So def that's wassup
So give me the microphone first
(Why) cuz I know what the hell I'm bout
I'm down in the dirty C/L and out
Thrown my roof in my trunk when I'm bellin out
Get it crunk (Jersey!)
When I'm yellin out
Weavin overseas and plushed out peice
Crushes out the parts, TV's and Cars
I rock blockedindal and black crockadile
I got so much style
Sittin Confy , I know that evry chick wants me
Deep dish, Six body wider than the humbee
Slump Chumps,leave em numbered in the junkee
Chain so chunkie I'm funkee

Chorus:
I don't know about ya ova there but ova here we crunk and we ready
I'm the R.O.C
dippin leanin meanin
T-I-G-ah crushin up the contendah
I'm lil Weezy to the yippy yo yippy 
Hand sdown I don't believe nobody can do nothin wit me
and I don't know about ya'll ova there but ova here we crunk and we ready

Now here's what I'm tryin to do for me
Clap with this little rap killa little hommie
Got all the girls not knowin how to act
I'm so nice here ice so clear
Look at it when I'm up to bat you betta get back
It's all mine you know where I'm from
Eacthaven baby ain't no playin we up in this
For the long run ya'll don't want none
i'm the #1 most wanted on you Christmas list
I'm Bow Wow to the yippy yo yippy 
hands down I don't believ nobody can do nothin wit me
I'm to spiffy
Stay new at the feet
I got all the Suburban nerds and kids from the streets wit me
Crowd around and bare witness
As I do it so real so far I ust gotta be the best
you don't think so, but I know so cuz
Thats the the only way that we know how to get down at the def Oh

Chorus

I went from a deal a doe to the first on the block wit some buck gators
Rock them papers
Need I say more (Yeah)
Well holla at me when you see me on the streets 
Or its the chocolate don
And where I'm from they put diamonds on fingers and watches on arms
If you lookin for that green then
______________ got some, so fresh so clean
ya dont want none,I'm sharp as a tack
And if ya happen to miss me dog
Told ya  be back makin them playa hatas say (AHHHH) and I'm still to close 
for comfort
And I took one nine like Kishawn Johnson
Who the balla now?
I look forward to every quarter
Convertible shift kit
If she look Imma call her ova to the Chevy dipped in Greenery
I'm 38 hotter we bustin out the scenery

Chorus 2x</pre>
