* had help with the German part

[Intro/Chorus: repeat 2X]
I wanted you to know, that I am ready to go
Heartbeat, my heartbeat
I wanted you to know, whenever you are around
Can't speak, I can't speak

[Childish Gambino]
I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff tight
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over
When it's all over, no settling down
My text go to your screen, you know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sittin at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinkin that the song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start callin, you start cryin
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you; the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that "It's not fair"
That's code for "He's not here"
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til it come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we was losing
I'm ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place; cause

[Chorus]

[Olson]
Hab dir ein Schloss gebaut aus Luft
Zwischen Wodkarausch und Clubs
Es ist Schrott gehauen nach so vielen Versprechen
Mit diesen zwei HÃ¤nden
Steh nicht mal auf eigenen Beinen, doch auf den GÃ¤stelisten der Stadt
Habe Tag und Nacht was zu feiern, doch weiÃ beim besten Willen nicht was
Zerspreng die Panzerketten
Bestell die Tanztabletten
Streu so viel Zucker in die Wunden bis das Salz nicht mehr brennt
Hab einen groÃen Palast
Dir so nobel vermacht
Und dann in eisiger Nacht
Aus eigener Kraft in den Boden gestampft
Wache steht's in fremden Betten auf
Such den Weg ins fremde Treppenhaus
Setz ein eklig fremdes LÃ¤cheln auf
Und geh dann mit den ewig selben SÃ¤tzen raus
Du rufst an und ich mach das Handy aus
Und ich weiÃ wie es dich zerreiÃt
Und na klar vermiss ich dein LÃ¤cheln auch
Doch am meisten vermiss ich meins
Damit du weiÃt

[Chorus]

[Childish Gambino]
It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chillin with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
she's not my real girlfriend
Stupid, so dummy
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin
I'm paranoid that these girls want somethin from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out all new condoms
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong; askin him if she wanna play games
with the +Super Smash Bros.+ but none of 'em you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong, but would you have listened to you?
Uh, you were crazy
I got a heart, but the artichoke
is only thing girls want when you in that smokin light

[Chorus]</pre>
