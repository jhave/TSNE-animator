[Intro: 60 Second Assassin]
Girl you know you need to ride for me (you know in life it goes down)
Do or die for me, that's that 60 Second talk (it goes down) real
B.I.G. (it goes down)

[Chorus 2X: 60 Second Assassin]
I want, you to, want me in the way I want you
If you don't, want me, let the doorknob hit you where the good lord split you

[60 Second Assassin]
Love is love, love'll get you when she's at it again
All the chit-chattering friend
May as well got me fried in the end, tried by twelve
And carried by six, get with life on the back end
A free man sometimes feels trapped in
Opposed to getting paid and bringing all that money back in
We decided to get laid now child supports the back end
I'mma defendant, who cares of a 16th amendment
They switched a game on a chicken, when you know
I always wanted you to want me in the way I want you

"Cuz the woman I was with..." - sample

[C-Rayz Walz]
Was not my reliable reflector "She was" a barnyard bird
Flocking to the king for see neck to check up, yessir
These treasures were undiscovered til the jewels dropped
An abused chickenhead in June, soon I felt like the used cock from tube socks
And loose rocks, don't confuse plots
A buckethead get back, I find that out after my Bing rap
A dead flower something you never bring back
A weak reflection of the G. I O.D. to ring that
With a super giving head, very battered bacon
Swallowing my pride, a live prelude to her drinking
Living in a bottle like the line from Nickelback
My shots on the rocks, giving birth to an Apollo, triple that

"Cuz the woman I was with..." - sample

[Bronze Nazareth]
Civil when she model, but she really a silverback
I seen her peel for stacks, built from dreams and dealing million blacks
Building stacks towards endless comas, I've been with honey over
Gripped this bitch by the shoulder, sipping Goose from crack money
Awaits track with the clip fully, loaded, never slip, homey
Definition of sleeping it, never did fit for me
Fiends scurry, tapping windows urgently, she cutting rocks like surgery
I'm busting nuts, burn your everglades while she serve the fiends
Simply devilish and horny
Still I'm blown, exploring your globe, won't love you in the morning
She performing junk exposed, bent on the stripper pole
Sipped the milk and tilt the robes, silks around the things that glow

"Cuz the woman I was with..." - sample

[C-Rayz Walz]
And I did it, you got me
I ain't trying to get you back, slow mo for the bobo
When she broke, pocked the willie lac'
And when we smoked alone, yo, the hoe broke the Philly yac'
Jack Tripper, gave weight to max out, that figures
Was the messenger chef, Malcolm X got a fresh plate
The good times rolling like credits on a sex tape, strolling
On the same page frame, I remain a different book
Saying broken hearts stay dead eyes lead, where it look
Oracle from the judge wise words fed me, slit me, yo
He was it, tricks in the image of the likeness Miss Cleo
And the woman I was with, could never be you
Just another part of me, fooled everything else is see through, mami

"Cuz the woman I was with..." - sample

[60 Second Assassin]
And sees the knowledge of a fool
Is the wisdom of a dead man, church out, take you to school
Why they poison the rules?
But you don't hear me, yo, they wanna steal my crew
In the beginning, they used to call me boo
All I'm hearing through the grapevine is fuck that dude
Damn girl, that was low
What the fuck and who came to visit you, Aunt Flow?
Take that rag off and act like you know
No one's hurt but the babies and more
No one's hurt but the babies, anymore?

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
