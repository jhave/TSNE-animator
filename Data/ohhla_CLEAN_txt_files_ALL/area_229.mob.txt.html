Everybody wanna be country now... Don't get it fucked up nigga
FBI Field Boys Incorporated we started this shit... Fleetwooood!

[Verse 1][Shawn Jay]
I'm well known from the mackin to the rappin to the packages of weight 
Still stackin from the trappin cause I'm platinum wit the yay 
Field Boys be on the corner wit them hundred gram boulders
It's a war against poverty I'm a damn soldier
Pumpin sand gun in hand Shawn the man told ya
I stay on +point+ like that +Uncle Sam poster+
I'm a younger +Sam Sosa+ got +hits galore+ more to come
I +run the underground+ like I'm a damn +gopher+
Stay in the studio I play wit the groupie hoes
Face on my jewelry froze Jacob in Cuban gold
Daytons on hoopties roll draped in the newest clothes
Gucci to Louis my crew be basically (movin O's)
Bump ya gums bout the M-O-B
You get cha choice "I'll see you" or "R.I.P."
I don't care whatcha thank I don't care whatcha say
Leader of the New South (e-e-err) Shawn Jay

[Verse 2][Chevy P aka Smoke]
I'm on the block servin nicks and dimes
Movin more trees and lumberjacks around Christmastime
I got kryp I got light I got that underwater grown dro
Shit mixin pine quarter halves and O's for the low
I bought the coupe supplyin chicks I am the mason layin bricks
Holla at me I got the +keys+ Chevy P +call me the locksmith+
I set the Chevrolet Impellie on Latrell Sprees and Pirellis
Drop the belly chopped the ceiling block 450 cops can't catch me
I... got my eyes on the black Range wit the fat frame
Cause its everythang my classic ain't threw up my 'Lac cane
Some trendsetter... before we got popular
I was rockin rose gold when yall thought that it was copper
I'm the king (what) the general (who) the Dean (okay) the boss (aight)
We the underlords over the whole gotdamn South
And I don't care who you is or what you claim to be
Leader of the New South (era-errr) Chevy P
