One night backstage at Irving Plaza at a Madball show

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
Hey yo Ill Bill, will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba, it's The Green CD
(No doubt kid, what's your name) it's MC Lars
(Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours)
(He played me your joint) what'd you think of it (I think it's bugged out, it's hot)
Thanks, I like your last record a lot
Your lyrics are graphic, much like your brother Necro
Is he psycho? (I don't know, it really depends though)
(He's psychological, half psycho, half logical)
(Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital)
Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are and the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
(I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide)
(When the realness pops off one time for your mind)
(And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot)

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun

[Ill Bill] (MC Lars)
I grew up on heavy metal and hip hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
(Nine Inch Nails, Primus, Weird Al and King Missile)
(Influenced me like a postmodern epistle)
(Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums)
(Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun)
(Who's your favourite rapper?) Rakim, G. Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA
Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day
What type of metal stuff you listen to (old school Slayer CDs)
(Biohazard and Bile were the bands for me)
(The first time that I ever heard Chuck D)
(Was the Anthrax CD, Attack Of The Killer B's, chorus

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church, state fusion tip
(I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with)
(Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit, Lars what you think of it)
Out in Iraq
A lack of dialogue between the people is whack
(In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers)
(These gas prices got my people with seeds having to gank pampers)
The answer is not plutocracy
The answer is not hypocrisy
The answer is true democracy
(The answer is the dialogue constantly)

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun

[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
Hey yo Bill, we should do a track together
(Word, word, let's do that)
Oh wait, we just did</pre>
