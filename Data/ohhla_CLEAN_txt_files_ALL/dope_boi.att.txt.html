(verse 1)
Yea! A-town nigga

or the guccI and louie shawty aint nuthin less
I keep a piece on my side and some beat in my ride
the window up when its hot or when its cold outside
the AC blow snowballs drive a bitch up the wall
with them plush leather guts steady grippin the butt
the paint just drip on the street michael jordan on my feet
with a big booty freak to make the pimpin complete
I go and pick up big floaty he twistin a swisher slowly
bend the corner aint no hatin and all the hoes no me
