[ CHORUS (2X) ]
We been animals for as long as I can remember
All my niggas are pitbulls, bears and gorillas
Hard hitters, bonehard hogs for scrilla
Pimps, players, macks, drug dealers and killers

[ VERSE 1 ]
I been a animal since birth, growled when I crawled
Louisiana black bear, see the retractable claws
Gert Town-born, 9th Ward stepchild
H-Town's adopted baby, all grown, look at me now
Ferocious workin with that cat, I knock it up out the socket
Cock it, then lock it, runnin niggas worse than the Rockets
Court docus, my name on 'em, lawyer in pocket
Dismissal on false charges, I know you heard about it
Grown man business, hustle physical fitness
Holdin mo' medals than a gymnast in these ghetto olympics
I put the game into sealers, manufactured, then sell it
I get the letters, pop pellets, these haters hella jealous
Can't stand to see ( ? )
I do it for the hood, down bitches and real fellas
Bitch niggas talk like they know about us but never met us
So I put my hands around they throat like a turtleneck sweater
We in big Lac deVilles, them fuckers pushin Jettas
With no win at all but still they tryina catch up with us
We movin too fast, burnin gas, smokin on blue grass
Laughin at you fool ass as you come in last
My little homies'll blast, they loyal to a player
Get out of line, your family, your friends gon' see you later
You see, it's real talk, yeah, from a real nigga
Malt-liquor pisser, nationwide permanent fixture

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
We big game with big thangs and big fame
Big names from the streets takin up both lanes
We bring pain to haters, it's a everyday thing
We catchin gorgeous dames, you niggas kissin the flame
Lames burn like oil fields up in the Middle East
We pray for warfare, fuck peace if we can't eat
But still God-fearin, the truth is what you're hearin
Champion all causes for my underprivileged children
Underground dealin, so cold I'm bone-chillin
Ready and willin, a muthafuckin ruthless villain
Down South got me, the Midwest got me
The East Coast got me, the West Coast got me
Big and black with the attitude that's so cocky
The OG's back in position and they cannot stop me
B.I.G. M.I.K.E., yes
N.A.W.L.I.N.S. P.H.A.T.S.

[ CHORUS (2X) ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Like a car with a broken steering column, partner, I'm hot-wired
Come let the Cayenne in my Jambalaya set you on fire
I'm a southern boy, straight out of Louisiana
My brigade is full of killers holdin them loaded hammers
I'm insane and straight bananas but still jiggin with it
Baby, show me your deal-doin, think that I won't hit the ( ? )
I'm highly x-rated, elated when I'm faded
Crossed the finsih line and waited to see if my homies made it
Congratulated all of those who had persevered
All of those who shed blood, dropped sweat and a gang of tears
Yeah, this here is ghetto evangelism
I'm tryina show you the light, endin your self-vandalism
I heard somebody say the south was slow
But I guess we ain't no mo' because we makin all that dough
I squabble harder than a bitch, yeah, Big Mizzle ain't no hoe
I damn sure ain't a snitch, like Mr. Scarface, you know?
