*ABSTRACT RUDE*
We get whylin
When we're freestylin
We bring the action
My rude abstraction
And when a crew stepped up
To test us
They found
We were dangerous
And they come high
Come low
Come fast
Come slow
But got no range like us
If you put Haiku D'Etat
Versus the ra-ra
Them can't hang with us
Because we're dangerous
Rule things worldwide
I'm too rude!!!
Six in the morning
Po-po at they door
But they ain't gone get them
'Cause they got a window
All exits not seized
So they fleed
K-9's sniff through
Find personal seeds
Grows no more
Than a OZ rastas indeed
Snitched on by some neighbor
Smelling the weed
Blown cover on the under
Kinda makes you wonder
How you really know
When they got yo number
Can't even be a roots man
And crop yo green
I plead the 5th, 6th
And prop 215
Them no legalize ganjah
But cigarettes more dangerous
And we can not let babylon continue
To play games with us
It's too many innocent bredren
Locked down in compounds
With chains and cuffs
We stay true
Damage ya'
worldwide from Canada
To banladesh
Because we're dangerous
Rule things
Worldwide
Ya' too rude!!!

*MIKAH 9*
So stop all violence
Break codes of silence
Lick a shot off
For Mikah's honor
Black hound sound
And fire (mari) juana
We haffa non stop
Non stop
Hustling x amount of trouble em
Dangerous
Jah say
Dem people know for
What an expert
Dem come gone
Take for us
The furhman press down
For ganjah
While me bredren
Watered off angel dust
Bad boy stick up
Bank for us
Rule things
Worldwide
Haiku!!!
9 in the morning
3 hours later than previous
These cowards and haters
Are envious
And devious
They got beef with us
But it was brief enough
For we quickly dismiss from duty
All the mischievious
The mothership ain't leaving us
These trees we puff
Stimuate I
Rieation we believe
In love recieve enough
Positive vibrations
To achieve
The trust
And make gees
And stuff
For my people's elevation
We no walk clean
With open sore
Canquerous
We can't spoke
With the devil
In the men
I believe evil
Contagious
For any sound children
Haiku D'etat
killed dem
Spontaneous
We haffa warrin
On the streets
Little boy pack heat
These gangs are tough
And instant dangerous
Rule things
Worldwide
Haiku!!!

*ACEYALONE*
And there is reason
I'm born in babylon
Under the odd star
And where they plot war
But we doo not want war
Unless pushed upon
And then brains will bust
But we do not like that
So we give peace
And love
Like it came to us
And there are those
Who try
But do not use
Thee
EYE
The same as us
Dem are not dangerous
Rule things
Worldwide
Haiku!!!
It's 12 noon
I'm higher
Than a helium balloon
I consume the day
Like the day consume me
Who's gonna do me?
The black and white
Or my look a like
It's looking like
It ain't looking too good
So I looked where I stood
Then I looked up
What a wonderful world
To have at my disposal
And those who know
If you abuse it
Then you lose it
But who's is it to begin with?
We started god-like
Now what's it gonna end with?
And we won't stop there
We have bredren
And sistren
Who came with us
And we travel by foot
Car, bicycle, train
Or plane
Or bus
Abstract Rude
Mikah 9
And Aceyalone
Microphone manglers
And we hail from babylon
Sector west side
Los Angeles
Rule things
Worldwide
Haiku!!!</pre>
