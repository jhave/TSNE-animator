[Chorus]
Im sick of the lies
Im sick of the games
Im sick of the pain
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

Im sick of the flesh
Cant handle the flesh
Live and die in the flesh
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
[2x]

[Jaz]
Who I need as I plead the blood of Christ on my life
So open up your eyes, realize, hear the cries, no demize
Devil, even wickedness dont try lies
My life, here placed in God's hands I stand
Im never gonna trip, dont devil stick, on the jes tip tip, we got the grip grip
So I announce pronounce the Holy Script Script
Check it, in HIM no sin my friend within
From the top drop, dont stop to rock eternity
The trinity, infinity, all I need Romans 8 3 9
Its time to find the line and read
No hieght not depth no light no death
Til my very last breath, God's love still left
I pass that test, give God my best til I find HIS rest
Yes

Aint nobody gonna cry
Aint nobody gonna die
Street of Gold where I reside
HE'LL wipe the tear drops from my eyes
Oh what a day, when Jesus cracks the sky
My eyes will cry no more
All my clothes be layin on the floor yo

[Chorus]

[DG Warrior]
Holy Spirit, come down fill me now, what
Pray everyday, stay strong
My wrong make it right
In my Holy rhymes, give my dad props
My self wanna rise, gotta put it down
Underground, gotta drown gotta clown
Dirty flesh, already test, condemed it
Gonna buck ya down, gonna buck ya down
Break it off somethin proper
Be a devil stomper
Gotta go and follow
When I fall my LORD Jesus Christ
For life is what, when I want to do
Preach teach and raise
Preach praise and raise

Higher Higher Higher
[9x]

[DG Warrior]
Fly to the sky wit your wings spread wide
Were gonna worship God the Most High
Get on the right route, to the J side
That be Jesus, the number one
One begotten son there ever was on a cross
devil got tossed, lost, messin wit the boss
that be sittin on the throne, hittin hard to the devil's dome
Right to the soul, and flow wit the ghost
And the KING OF KINGS, LORD OF LORDS
My savior, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

Gotta put down for my LORD
[4x]

[Chorus]

[Big J]
Im sick of all this flesh
Got me caught up in all this mess
LORD can I handle this test
Servin you the very best
Yes I gots to do whats true
Heaven or Hell what I'm gonna do
I better pick you, without you my life is through
I dont need more of me, I need more you
LORD my flesh is feelin weak
Cause the devil tryin to pin me tempt me
Hit me down, keep me down
I need you round, wont you break him on down
Tired of all this mess I'm in
Tryin to do your will, but I end in sin
Try to do right, but I end in wrong
I need your strengh to keep pressin on
Hello fellow mellow tenth flow let me get my flow, here I go
Wanna praise the Most High, serve you til the day that I die, I cry
Holy is the Lamb, the Great I AM, the Son of Man and I can
Grab your hand, and seek your face in a Holy place and follow your plan

Homies scold me, know me
take me take me, break me brake me, shake me shake me
reach me reach me, teach me teach me, meet me meet me

[Big J]
I cant help myself, Ive done fell myself
I gotta die myself, that means no more self
All I need is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
No one else
