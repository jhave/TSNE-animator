(Chorus)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 1)
Young shawty I'm the pimp, so you know my game cold
Brush all my teeth cause my whole grill gold
Step out my house, pink gators on my toes
Tryna hit tha club before they all close
Hop in the Lac, Fleetwood eight four
Twenty inch G's with tha triple gold spokes
Creep in the door with my pockets on swole
Limp across tha flo like both of my legs broke
Slide to tha bar to get me somn cold
Got a glass of Thunderbird cause I can't stay in mode
Put down my glass and hit tha dance flo
Don't get mad at me boy what you cuffin my hands for
If I want it I'ma get it ya know how my game go
? I'm pullin ya main woe
I'm chargin for this game, I'm givin you lames yos
Gotta line these girls up in a soul train row
I hit tha V.I.P. just to get my mind blown
Do I see Mista G he got that fire dro
All tha hataz in tha club what ya rollin ya eyes fo
Cause ya mad i'm pushin good and pimped out tha side door

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 2)
Now when I hop off in tha Lac, I swerve tha interstate
Just because I'm cheifin dro and i'm smugglin heavy weigh
Keep tha hood bout my G's and break um off a K
And sip on Hennessy till I start to hallucinate
Pull my way down tha block cause its mo money to make
And plus I got some mo cookie dough I need to bake
But you can buy a bag of mine and I betcha you gon' be straight
Cause tha soft ain't got no cut and tha wood ain't got no shape
Cause tha fiends run to me whenever they wanna taste
Cause they say that mine taste like baked potato and steak
Well excuse me if I done took all yo pay
Cause I just set up shop and been workin for one day
You say you wanna rob me, well hell thats a mistake
Cause I got atomic bombs that cause tha Earth to quake
It'll open all tha gates and cause heaven to shake
It not God man its me, cause I destroyed tha place
All because of this devious busta who tried to hate
When all he had to do was ask, instead he tried to take
So to stop all of that and keep my soul safe
I just hop in my Lac and head tha other way

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..

(Verse 3)
It's about 2:45 and we at tha red light
Looked in my mirror, and saw some head lights
Now any other time it would be aight
But tha group done checked around when ya on tha westside
Put my foot to tha flo, doin bout eighty five
Hit Fairview, headed to Riverside
They behind us kinda close, so hell I bust a ride
Ran on tha curb and scrubbed my damn tire
Man can't you mash tha gas and dash up outta sight
What ya talkin bout, I'm doin a bill five
I could pick up mo speed on a ten speed bike
Oh you tryna joke, better hope we dont die
Since we ain't packin gats it seems we gotta fight
When I throw a left, you best to throw a right
Pull up in tha cut so they can pass us by
Get down in yo seat and get off tha brake light
They pulled up in tha back and blocked us from behind
He was laughin so hard it sounded like a crime
He said listen heyah Dirty, why you tryna hide
I was just tryna tell ya Cadillac is tight

(Chorus 2X)
While riding in my Cadillac
What to my surprise..</pre>
