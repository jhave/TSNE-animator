Another day in the ghetto (yeah)
One look outside and I'm already upset yo

It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin to do (nuttin to do)
Uhh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin thing
"Hello hello?  Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis?  "Talisha!"  Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don'tcha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out, it's the same old scene
Dopefiend, crackfiend, eyewitness news team (yeah)
I seen a honey with a butt lookin butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin all thick with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I got to get with

[Chorus: XL]
I like, the way that you look, I was hopin we could
Maybe spend some time, there's so much that we can do
We can party all night, I can tell you're so right (so right)
From the way that you shine (yeah) I just wanna get with you

To all the ladies in the house, oww

She said "I don't care, just don't be actin silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore rap
And it wouldn't take a second 'fore I had her on her back
Twiddlin with the bra strap, threw on my Sillk CD

Lose control on the skins is all I can picture (I like)
