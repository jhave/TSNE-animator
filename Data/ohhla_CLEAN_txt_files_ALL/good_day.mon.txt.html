[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I ainât had to kill nobody
I ainât had to kill nobody
Today was a good day
I ainât had to kill nobody
I ainât had to kill nobody
I ainât had to kill nobody - whoa!

[Tyga]
AUUGH~! T-Raw killa, that nigga caterpillar
One hitter, only hit bad bitches - thatâs thriller (hah)
King Hakim, YM, Last King
Nigga sendin' out shouts, Iâmma need a Jordan ring
"Fuck you mean this is really mean?" Gotti after life
Future lookin' bright, bitches crack tongue on the pipe (hah)
I donât wanna see you twerk, we about that fuck life
Got a Asian ho, pussy go deep, Jerry Rice (ha-HA!)
Iâm a dope nigga, give a D, dope dealer
Donât play with the +Gravedigger+, thatâs RZA (no)
Ask my bitch, she tell you ainât no nigga
like the one I got, dick game gorilla (AUUGH~!)
Bag in my bag like a Philly nigga clip
Came extended grip, armorâs with the Ruger, easy ruthless
Nigga with a attitude, my enemies is 2 shits
Donât give 2 shits but you gon' make a nigga pull it
But shit.. AUUGH~!

[Chorus One: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ainât had to kill nobody
I ainât had to kill nobody
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Today was a good day
Cause I ainât had to kill nobody
No I ainât had to kill nobody
But I shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it

[Lil Wayne]
Duct tape, duct tape
Cover his mouth with duct tape; check a nigga like a motherfuckin update
Where the safe nigga point to it
I catch a case, I wanna know who threw it
And my main bitches speak fluent, I keep the feds busy
I got the bread, never fed pigeons
Even though I get pissed, off I shit on y'all
We gon sip champagne out your skull
I canât stand these niggas, Iâm bout to fall
Got my girl her shoes with the spikes, volleyball
Fuck with Holygrove, itâs gon be a holocaust
Hoes see me shinin, now they actin like a moth
YMCMBizzy, why I'm always busy
I done got too big headed for the crown to fit me
But I got my niggas with me and we got our skateboards
TTYL, thank thank You Lord, amen, cause uh

[Chorus Two: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ainât had to kill nobody
I ainât had to kill nobody
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it
Shoot you in yo memory bank, memorize it, but uh
Today was a good day
I ainât had to kill nobody, uhh

[Meek Mill]
Uhh; My dawg hit me yesterday, got 15 keys (work)
And he gon let em all go for 15 Gâs (work)
She said she want a perc I look at her like bitch please
And I show that ho up it like you ainât tryna flip these
Yea Iâm back nigga, sellin all these bricks
And if my homies sell you one you better tell nobody shit
I tell them Iâm back nigga; rockin all these jewels
and I be ridin through my hood like I ainât got nothing to lose, shit
You thinkin' because I rap I wonât go buy them bricks? (Buy them bricks)
Give em to my dawg and let him do all kind of shit? (All kind of shit)
Like take a point out (point out) then put a point in (point in)
I fuck yo main ho and all my homies joined in, shit
Iâm gettin' money (money) must be the Iluminati (hah)
They think I signed up cause I just bought a new Ferrari (vroom!)
But they said they want my mind, soul and my body (hah)
And I looked at that nigga crazy and then I shot him - BOW~!
