[Kool Keith]
Keith, with Princess
We going into the theatre with a blanket
I'm a tell you

[Kool Keith]
I'm mad super-fly in the bathrub, I'm Real
Princess is sure phasin' two-thousand-one, I'm the future Ron O'Neil
With the Speedos on I heard you was talking about my ass
I'm coming over to your house buttnaked with a condom on, riding in the touch of class
When I get there, stand with lingerie by the door
Let your bra shine, drop your thongs to the floor
We gon' drink some soft wine and watch a x-rated movie that's hardcore
Perform like a man on the set, lights, camera and action
Princess in tight panties wants satisfaction
But licked and all, I like to walk around Mrs. and me and have sex with you in the mall
Hit it from the back while a security guard make a phonecall
I'm nasty bouncing the breasts up and down like basketballs
Using rubbers and latex, jerking off with gloves by Playtex
Baby back for grease, easy sex
Recline, comfortable, move on the couch next
On my chest, forget Superman, my costume shows the S

[Kool Keith] (Princess Superstar)
Baby can you feel my love (feelin' your love, feelin' your love)
I've got my shorts on
And I'm taking them off
Baby can you feel my love (feelin' your love, feelin' your love, I feel the love Keith)
I've got my shorts on (got your shorts on)
And I'm taking them off (take them off)

[Princess Superstar]
Now, when I saw your face I'm a believer
Hey, what you got the keys to my Beamer
A keeper, get the fever, viva, end receiver
Oochie Wally Wally, leave it to my beaver
Take a big sip and inhale, you tip the scale
If this rap game don't work out baby you cut for Chippendales
I got my nails done for this special day, Oil of Olay
Case of Criss in piss in the bidet, I'm miss rappin' Jon Benet
Big hunk blowin' spunk in the back of the top bunk
Slam dunk Daft Punk's voicebox in the water, kerplunk
Get crunk, forget Clyde and Bonnie, Ted Bundy and Peg Bundy Burt &amp; Loni
Nancy and Ronnie, Betty and Barney smokin' marijuana, I'm a little horny
On and on, a common bond, two vagabonds in Vuitton
Eatin' Cinnebons at a mall on Mars where we belong
Arm in arm naked, makin' spawn
At the salad bar, get salad tongs, deliver our new baby born
Wait, something's wrong
I gotta call my mom, tell her Keith's on my song
(Mom: Oh my God, that's great honey, Kool Keith. Wh-what did you say that he sang?)

[Kool Keith] (Princess Superstar)
Baby can you feel my love (feelin' your love, feelin' your love, I feel the love keith)
I've got my shorts on (you got your shorts on)
And I'm taking them off (take them off)
Baby can you feel my love (feelin' your love, feelin' your love, I feel the love keith)
I've got my shorts on (you got your shorts on)
And I'm taking them off (take them off)

[Princess Superstar]
Ultramagnetic, you helped my headache
Like a music paramedic, you mad athletic
There I said it, I'm older now, come and get it
We're like doin' it and doin' it well, so poetic

[Kool Keith]
Like L and Rick Ruben I'm Going Back To Cali
Taking you on the G-string tour mansion and the marble pool in the valley
With celebrities and basketball stars, guys tall as John Sally
Princess drivin' a hummer with Victoria's Secrets through a alley
Lookin' off Mullhollund Drive
Drinking a Diet Pepsi with a Arch Deluxe and some french fries
And an apple pie love, gettin' fat

[Princess Superstar]
Uh, you and me like E.T. and Drew Barrymore
Pick Reese's pieces off your piece, I want to marry more Keith
You'll be coming soon to a theatre near me
Veni, Vidi, Veni, Veni, I came and I saw and I came and I came again that's three

[Kool Keith]
You came straight to the point like a pocket rocket
Our understanding two freaks coming out the closet
I'll put you in a catsuit made of ostrich
You on stage collecting the sex award for the best lover in my flick starring Lou Gosset
I hold you in that part
Baby on your back, let me know when you wanna start, when you wanna start

[Princess Superstar]
I think about you and the things you say when you rhym
Won't beat around the bush so you can beat around mine
I'm a Slinky, coil my butt back and forth down the stair
I'm kinkier than pubic hair

[Kool Keith] (Princess Superstar)
Baby can you feel my love (I feel your love)
I've got my shorts on (you got your shorts on)
And I'm taking them off (please take them off, feelin' the love)
Baby can you feel my love (I'm feelin')
I've got my shorts on
And I'm taking them off (feelin' your love)
Baby can you feel my love
I've got my shorts on
And I'm taking them off</pre>
