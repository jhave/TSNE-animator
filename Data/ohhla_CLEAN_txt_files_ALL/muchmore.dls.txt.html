  "And what we have is much more than they can see"
{*scratched: "ladies and gentlemen" - "here we go again"*}

[DJ Premier]
No doubt, y'all care anymore, about this hip-hop man?
I mean, how far will you punk motherfuckers go
for 15 seconds of fame?  Microwave popcorn-ass niggaz
Yeah, we give you much more, longevity baby
Aiyyo Dave

[Dave]
Yo!  It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all
Usin these minutes like I value the call
Put your money in the bank, and hold rank
over friends who ain't got leadership skills
I got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep
We like the, land and laid, the brand old way
Grand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist
I play the X-Box instead of fuckin with dice
I hate losin to those who walk away with my dough
cause I dozed, Tracy broke me
And now she wanna see the resident provokin me
to pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle
One house, two houses, third house
House rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank
Banner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza
Gamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap
Jump back like James Brown, hey now
When the liquor over we smokin the hay now
Delegatin numero dos, I holla out the sound of los
And keep the Island close to me

[Chorus: Yummy]
Much more is what we got in store
Just believe me
  "And what we have is much more than they can see"
Much more than they can see
is how it'll always be, believe me (gotta believe)
  "And what we have is much more than they can see"

[Posdonus]
I got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills
and still tryin to get himself together from it
Knowin he can't quite run it like me
I'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot
And when you rock, it's just impersonations of me
The rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle
I belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty C my man
My base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic
to belts lettin they mind melt from drinkin the Henny
And them straight and narrow types who be waitin to hear
them drums say the revolution is near - are you listening?
Are your eardrums open for christening?
We God Body MC's with these tools
While some others play God, they just God damn fools with it
I don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged
Get the girls to love it
Still and all five-oh came to my mic check
Tellin me I left lacerations around my mic's neck
Domestically disputed and you just might get
the undisputed underdog servin y'all threat

[Chorus] - 4X w/ ad libs

  "And what we have is much more than they can see"
  "And what we have is much more than they can see.."</pre>
