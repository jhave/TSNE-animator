[Kool Keith]
I'm known to fence ya with my black mask, MC's go to hell 

[Noggin Nodders]
And I'm the obtuse, and acute guy
I'm known as Motion, Noggin Nodder

[Kool Keith]
My flow is so dark, I open coffins like I'm Dracula

[Noggin Nodders]
And I'm that kid who raps about, who what?
That guy, whatever
We pull the drawers off girls who (sly, we fly)
We washin gold and silver (sly, we fly)
We walk in clubs with sneakers (sly, we fly)
We look out windows and stare (sly, we fly)
We fly the planes ourselves (sly, we fly)
And if our records don't sell (sly, we fly)

[Kool Keith]
I put my MASK on, another night for the Phantom
I got the Halloween jack-o-latern
Yo ?, I know some kids funny Silly Putty PlayDoh
They wanna step to farms, and build a hay dough
I drag bodies on down the yellow brick road, like leprechauns
I come in comet killer mode
Yo grab your neck and your mail
with a WIC check, plus I inspect my roots
and walk in naked, with spirits and ouija board
I Shake-n-Bake it naked, like Betty Crocker
I use a black marker, I draw your face in a sketch
like a ARTISTE
Two broken arms from my shoulder have a piece
Yum yum, you know you welcome, come in dumb-dumb
Hey what's that smell down there?  Look in the basement
Two eyes missin, next day, where your face went?
With Dolly Parton music playin in my pickup truck
My gold sandwich, a swigger liquor chewin duck
I got no taste, no salt, I need mayonnaise
I'm lookin at TV, lookin for good love, and some lovin

[Noggin Nodders]
We pull the drawers off girls who (sly, we fly)
We washin gold and silver (sly, we fly)
We walk in clubs with sneakers (sly, we fly)
We look out windows and stare (sly, we fly)
We fly the planes ourselves (sly, we fly)
And if our records don't sell (sly, we fly)

Deckin in chins, to knock a rapper, he's bawlin bro
Off in my Timbs, I makes an exit
As ill I cut the cheese and step from forks
That's when I'm Superdot
I kicks an offer with terms, unpatterened knowledgist
A species unkind when human three minds, one head
That brother took the alley (I followed him) he's dead
He's datin Yakos Alli (she's awful) gives head
Say what?  Your coat is red, he's just a white guy, I know
He likes marijuana, I like, holding his bitch
Make giggles in the sauna, rap when I swerve, ?? bpbpbpbpbpb
Hey bud, I got your phone number I called you hung up
You push * 69, you broke into a cold and hot sweat
That's no address of mine, you reached some mortuary
You're talkin to an empty box, I'm gettin away
I'm gettin away, I'm gettin away

We pull the drawers off girls who (sly, we fly)
We washin gold and silver (sly, we fly)
We walk in clubs with sneakers (sly, we fly)
We look out windows and stare (sly, we fly)
We fly the planes ourselves (sly, we fly)
And if our records don't sell (sly, we fly)

[Kool Keith] + (Noggin Nodders)
I creep in Cutlass, my orange my blue, my black self green
The robot yo six-fo', you buggin lookin mean
(Yeah, we pay no mind to eyeballs, and kids as rivals)
We got our money in stacks, you bet your chicken shirt
With massive ammo, the fools out there don't want no work
(With massive ammo, the fools out there don't want no work)
This ain't no movie, no play, you in a matinee
I'm watchin screens of your dreams, you actin everyday
Playin a part that you actors can't play
Yo he's perpetratin, gettin burnt like slab bacon

[Noggin Nodders]
My days are numbered nitwit, I work in ? spot
My sherm's ill as liquid, I mix it up in big pot
and takes the top off, and adds a drop off
and laughs my ass off, and cakes in my part would rather
I wrap a new bomb, it's serious
I lost my mind, yo help me find it

[Noggin Nodders]
We pull the drawers off girls who (sly, we fly)
We washin gold and silver (sly, we fly)
We walk in clubs with sneakers (sly, we fly)
We look out windows and stare (sly, we fly)
We fly the planes ourselves (sly, we fly)
And if our records don't sell (sly, we fly)

[Kool Keith]
Yeah, changin four years in a flow (that's right)
How many you got? (that's right)
What you think about that girl over there?
What you think about the kid comin up the blonde?
What you think about Keith walkin down the block?
Same girl at my bed
Pringles fun?
Give me a couple bucks
How much we need to take in at the party tonight?</pre>
