I say still I stand, hey shorty here I am
Never have you seen in ya lifetime
A more divine southern rapper with a swag like mine
Facin' all kinda time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pains a small thang to a giant
I was born without a dime
Out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali said even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes, Lyrics so sick wit it
Set the standards in Atlanta how to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood I done did it
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still the city long as TIP livin', Nigga
 
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty
 
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell then
Instead of this new McLaren
God will take you to hell, just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Like a change in direction, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity manage
To conquer, every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing is still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But, one life like punches, block the counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the king lives on pimpin'
 
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty
 
Even the solitude, that still know how to do
I show you how to do, what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm
Make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots cause if I'm out it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga know shit
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from toomp, and make a hook like shorty
Before ya know it I'm back what it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your hearts fill with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'
Easy, let go and let God deal with it, ya dig
 
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty</pre>
