Ahora los ojos
Open your eyes
Open your eyes

[Verse 1]
Its time to get lost in my music you get lost don't confuse it
I was born for this shit so I never had to choose it
I would kill for the chance to get on you get off
I'm not sayin that I'm hard I'm just sayin you soft
The world wanna know my past if I'm real or if I'm not
Did I really play the trap have I ever dealt a rock
Is he really from the block where's the wounds that he got
It take a man to do the shootin anyone can get shot
So fuck the fact I had to grind or the fact that I did time
I should only be defined by the fact that I can rhyme
So I really ain't concerned if I seem street to em
Half the niggaz my niggaz like I don't even speak to em
So I spit that fly shit becuz I'm in it to last
And you ain't got enough style miles to be in my class
So before you cast your ballots on who's the greatest MC
Now that Jordan done retired and LeBron's in the league
You gon have to mention me and believe me it hurts
Its y'all that never paid attention to my previous work
But ain't no need bitchin I done captured your attention
Its a race to the top and I will go the distance
In the south's top label and the worlds our agenda
We give a fuck how we live just as long as you remember
Hear that hunger in my voice and that pain that I carry
But you can't admit you feel me til I'm dead and I'm buried
That's the worst part man cuz believe me I'm a fan
If it only is a demo well we did a million scans</pre>
