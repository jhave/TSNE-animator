[Intro: Wale] {*w/ Saw Dew harmonizing*}
Shout out to Marvin Gaye..
Love you then they hate you then they love you again
Hate you then they love you then they hate you again
Lord...

[Chorus: Sam Dew]
(Keep giving me love) Hold me tight (and then you take it away) let me go
(Keep giving me love) Heal my heart (and then you take it away) hurt my soul
(Keep giving me love) Build me up (and then you take it away) break me down
(Keep giving me love) Make me smile (and then you take it away) make me frown
(Keep giving me love) Give me love (take it away) take it all away again
(Keep giving me love, and then you take it away) Da da da da da-dah, ohh-ohh..
(Keep giving me love) Give me love (and then you take it away) take it all away again 
(Keep giving me love, and then you take it away) Da da da da da-dah..

[Wale]
They'll never ever ever know your soul.. never know your heart...
Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Sheeit, I'm just waitin on somebody to show me...
(I'm just waitin on somebody to show me)

Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studyin' at UDC
Sittin' in taxi cabs, where daddy roamin' the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don't get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top
Work, give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life, this a love hate thing
Whassup, huh, give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life, this a love hate thing, look

[Chorus] - minus fifth and sixth bar lines

[Wale]
Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold
As you reachin' your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Havin' dinner with Leonsis I'm dreamin' to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom flo'
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestin' every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord Father, if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy? We do the same thing for a livin'
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians
Ralph!

[Chorus]
