[Intro: Nas]
Pimp on pimp.....uh remix
A Divine Mill presentation, yeah, just in case
World get ready, Nas, Jaheim, yeah, two thousand two

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo! Pretty as Dawn, the city is mine
Buss it you rap fools clappin like we Diddy and Shyne
Tattoo across the stomach spells Godson
I'm from the jungle like Tarzan hundred spots sparkin
Wan't it with Nas I'm right here, all you talk is paper
I chalk this playa, roght where you standin
This the anthem I had to be on it
Callin Divine Mills office asking Kay Gee where the boss at?
Tell him it's the God on the line
Yo the streets is buzzin with Stillmatic and the artist you signed
Now we workin in the studio late
Layin some vocals to pro to, we ain't never using no napes
Thinkin bout musical great from Marvin to stevie
Wonder ten years where will Nas and Jaheim be?
Just in case I don't make it, my girl better rep me
She know I was a thug when she met me, yo

[Jaheim]
I'm a hustler baby look at me
Got the streets locked baby loot at the grill
See the hate now baby imagine me
Pushin weight now baby gotta skate now baby
And it's all for you, boo I'll ride for you
Cause I wan't the best for you
Took a bullet in the chest for you, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Jaheim]
Just in case, I don't make it back from the block cause it's hot now baby
Just in case, I left the keys to the drop and the cash in the lockbox girl
I wan't to let you know, I'm a be a man I'm a do what I got to do
But just in case, I'm a make it home girl I'll be missing you

[Verse 2: Jaheim]
Now don't cry now lady, cause you the reason why now lady
Gotta hold it down for Ja now baby
But I gotta take this route now lady
And it's all for you, boo I'll ride for you
Cause I wan't the best for you
Take a bullet in the chest for you

[Chorus: Jaheim]
Just in case, I don't make it back from the block cause it's hot now baby
Just in case, I left the keys to the drop and the cash in the lockbox girl
I wan't to let you know, I'm a be a man I'm a do what I got to do
But just in case, I don't make it back I don't make it back, girl I'm gone miss you
Just in case, I don't make it back from the block cause it's hot now baby
Just in case, I left the keys to the drop and the cash in the lockbox girl
I wan't to let you know, I'm a be a man, oooh oooh baby!
But just in case, I don't make it back I don't, I don't just in case

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo I gave away cars and jewelry for less attention
They think they know Nas from QB
I'm sick of dodgin groupies less is more
Few MC's got jealous that's expected God
But a, that's the life that a hustler leads
Plenty ice on my wife stay custom veese
See I rock everything Yankeees, every chain brand new spankin
Jumpin out them jeep Lincolns
Fans in the streets wavin, spectators it's a few hatin
Most just stand in amazement
Whispering the kid is a messenger
Knucklegame like Hurricane was a pimp like Hefner
Till shorty canged my life I changed my cell
Even let her answer when it rings at night
And I'm a gangsta, pop bottles with my team
And my queen, remix Nas and Jaheim

[Chorus: Jaheim]
Just in case, I don't make it back from the block cause it's hot now baby
Just in case, I left the keys to the drop and the cash in the lockbox girl
I wan't to let you know, I'm a be a man I'm a do what I got to do
But just in case, I'm a make it home girl I'll be missing you</pre>
