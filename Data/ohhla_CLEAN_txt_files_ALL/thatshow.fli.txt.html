[Intro]
You never had it like this
Nah nah
You never had it like this
Nah

Nah

[Chorus]
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
That's how we livin livin

Girl I'll do you the way...
You want me to... oh

[Verse 1]
I pull the panties right to the side
Ain't that a problem, I'm takin you down
You gon have to tell your home girls do your hair over
The best is on the west side baby
These niggas over here keep you goin crazy
Yea

[Chorus]
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
That's how we livin livin

[Verse 2]
Walked in the club with er
Gave er straight dick, you in love with er
My home G'd up, had the plug wudup
A7-6-1 sold drugs with
A good girl is what she was
No mollies, no drink and no bud
So I don't really wanna try to learn your own
A lot of things I'm tryna do is just to turn you on
If I can get you to my flat when my foot's on
Take yo clothes off slow, get my groove on
Hit you with that right face
Stick it to you baby in the right place

[Chorus]
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
That's how we livin livin

[Verse 3]
On the rooftop she gon need that
7 was wild, I used to be that
I'm giving her D, she giving feedback
The homies aswell, where the weed at?
And where the home girls? I don't even know
I had two off that kush and muscato
A ratchet or a model, we're drinking out the bottle
A hard act to follow, more booze than Apollo
Yea, I'm Warren G, I'm a monster baby
I ain't seen a piece of ass I can't conquer baby
Poly high on these hoes like a jackrabbit
Snoop &amp; Warren on these hoes, back to back at it

[Chorus]
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
You never had it like a nigga finna give it
You lovin when I'm in it, in it
Glass on full, team got pulled with a club full of women women
That's how we livin livin</pre>
