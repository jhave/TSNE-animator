"Took a Lear jet, don't fear yet"
[LJ] Ahh, seven o'clock in the motherfuckin mornin
"Took a Lear jet, don't fear yet"

"My suitcases is packed, and I'm goin on a trip" -&gt; Derek X

[SX] Yeah I'm up and packed
     And my bags is at the door

     Where we're goin it's kinda cold
     I'ma go and kiss my momma and my Grand Old Earth goodbye
[SX] Cool, I guess we're splittin
     Is there anything I'm forgettin?
     Let me check my room, oh yeah there goes my boom
[LJ] Shit, don't forget that
[SX] Cause when you travel they sell gravel
[LJ] Well I got my own shit - NOW LET'S SPLIT

     Heartland of Georgia, Florida, or Peoria
     Yo I think here and now know downstairs y'knahmsayin?
     We gonna come get you, head on over to the airport
[SX] The airport staff at LaGuardia knows
     that Brand Nubian do daily shows
     Up in the Carolina NORTH, Carolina SOUTH
     I kick the visit, in Richmond, lost in Boston
     Benz in Houston, two hours away from Austin
[LJ] TEXAS, where you don't see no Lexus
     Just low cars that bounce
[SX] And Taco Bells by the ounce
[LJ] Speakin of food, yo Sincere you made it clear
     We need our meals kosher on this flight
     Don't want no swine in my sight
[GS] Aiyyo God, everything's straight
     The kid's sendin a limo, to meet us at the gate
[LJ] Word that's cool, youknowhatI'msayin?
     That motherfucker that time sent a fuckin ham sandwich
[SX] I conditioned my mind to finally come to grips
     With knockin out trips like at six hour clips
     Up in the Cali in the mornin groundstandin
     BAGGAGE CLAIM AND OUR BAGGAGE WE'RE DEMANDIN
[LJ] Now we hit the hotel and unpack the bag
     Feelin like crap, take a nap from the jet lag
     WAKE UP, WAKE UP, WAKE UP
     for the soundcheck.. before we GETS wreck
     Now before the show, we gotta have a buddha fest

     Dreads on stage combine with baldhead kids
     Now I'm the Hey-Baby man who gets his drinks ?
     Major in History (defeatin all the mystery)
     I would think it's plain to see
[LJ] We come in the name of G-O-D, GIRLS
[SX] Form a line at the hotel
[LJ] No this ain't a motel
