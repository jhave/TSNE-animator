Uhh.. uhh.. yep.. yo Mike!

[Mikey Rocks]
What it is yo?
I'm just chillin like a villain, grindin daily
Cause I can't get a nine-to-five
So I rhyme, I rock ya dig
Ya know it's cool, I'll take you to school that's what I do
Yo Chuck...

[Chuck Inglish]
Ah ah I rock
If you don't think so nigga kick rocks
We the time on clocks, the boom on box
You like us homie that's hard washhhh
Boombox on my shoulder
And she, started walking over like yo
Looked me up and down
And if looks could kill then she'd be in jail
Well I hope you got the keys, she got me as well
But I wanna let her out cause she is ill
Umm.. but I get iller
Freeze! Now take my picture

Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)

[repeat]

[Chuck]
I drive a 5.0 GT that is
Drop-top roof with the Dayton's on the wheels
Got bass in the back, back to the front
I can hit a switch and make the trunk lift up

[Mikey]
Let me hop in it - let me lace my kicks
Then flip the Sidekick peep my options (yeah)
Go down the list like "hmmm not that one"
Maybe her tomorrow but that's after
I find out just what she's after
If it's dough then she gotta get gon'
She'll never get a call like broken phones

[Chuck]
And I suppose that she gonna call me
I'll take her and her, I'll take all three
But the truck that I'm in's only got two seats
And I'm in one so you know what that means

[Mikey]
That means it's decision time, hop in the women line
If it's nine, taking 7Up like lemon-lime
To the penthouse, so there's two left for you Chuck
(I ain't got no penthouse) We party on the rooftop
Brand new blazers that came from Malaysia
Grab the turntable and smack the DJ up
If he don't play us, we rockin to the A.M.
So you niggas better wake up

Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
