Ha
In there, but for the grace of God, go I
It's cunning
I wonder what it means?

I rock a jam for love
I quit my band for love
I smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love
Make you cry like a dove, leave you standing alone
In a world so cold, watch the drama unfold
'Cause you sold your soul, now you fearing your death
Sniffin' crystal meth 'til their ain't nothin' left
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted
Your pride won't admit it, so you start to sink lower
Your Caught in a flood, and you tryin' to find Noah
If you hungry and you near me, yo, you gonna get fed
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay yo' head
Come take my bed, I'll sleep on the floor
'Cause these are the times that friends are for

[Chorus]
I see everybody out here doin' for self
And they don't give a damn on the next man
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health
I can't wait 'til you the next man

I get uptight for love
You know I'll fight for love
And I might keep my wifey up all night for love
And when the daylight comes, I be seein' mad bums
With no shoes on their feet plus nothin' to eat
I can't save the whole street, so I feel like I'm beat
And why I play the game when nothin' gonna change?
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend
I'm tryin' to keep my diem, I try to give to the poor
Tryin' to get through this life and get to that door
I'm all up in this mix for these final ticks
Going all the way to seven and it's half past six

[Chorus]

I pray to God for love
I make G hot for love
And I just might blow your freakin' car for love
I make you sing "Hey Love" like my man King Sun
I freak the art of noise over all you toys
Better bring you boys, summon all you crew
No matter what you do, it's coming back on you
Just like a planet orbits, let your spunge absorb it
Logical conclusion is b-boy fusion
And confusion say that he want control
Of your mentality, your body and your soul
So if you lose your hold, come and take my hand
And link up this chain, 'cause money that's the plan
I'm tryin' to get through this maze, not to win this race
We either ridin' on a horse or walkin' on our face
So come take your place on the side of love
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love

[Chorus]</pre>
