Reload, explode, I'm a crack ya fuckin' code
Killer instinct mode so I always stay calico
In the battlezone I hold the phatter chrome
I'm tellin' every MC in the galaxy
That it's on, but I gots love for all the ones who's got love
Packed back, we got slugs,I got slugs for thugs back
For the dope deal
And a motherfuckin' a piece a crack
Fuck a ronin twissin diamonds if you don't know the time
Fuck all of that
Nigga matter fact ball is whack
If you don't know what to do to stack and takes your cash
If you don't know the game cause you's a biatch

Reload, reload, reload, reload

Reloadin' ain't no thang, it's all gon' spin
I'm time in the wind, I don't make friends
Motherfucker what you thought? Red rum is my talk
Wicket shit is what I spit, patin to acid
The fallen angel means I strangle and bang ya
Take ya hat off
Esham's out cold like Adolf
Hitler, slit ya, boy I'm out ta get cha
Ya never shoulda fucked with me
Eternally, imperpituity
I'm out to end your exsistence
I last forever
I will endure whatever, where ever
And reload
I'm perpitatin' while you perptratin' I go on forever
Misload more pebbles you can speak 5 words for thee
Farrel forevermore, forever and a day
Forever and ever in all ages
The nebula is segular
On a cellular, on a regular
Last syllabyl of recorded time
Till death till doomsday Esham
I'm death, Mr. Fortuneteller watch me television peete my capella
Get fucked and get your groove back like Stella
And you ain't even gotta go to Jamaica</pre>
