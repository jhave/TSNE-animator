Tatted up

T.Y.G.A. Basically gotta cremate me 'cause I'm fly 'til I die
If I lie, then I die
With a swagger so loud
Then one guy who says the sky's the limit times 5
I ain't playin' games
I just coach nigga's from the side
I ain't sayin' names
They say the tape was really mine
So gimme' that back
My tight game,language, and all that swag
Thank you!
Your look's, more square then gamecube
Nintendo O, I got a Nintendo flo'
Super overdosed on cheat codes
Now I just superman them hos
And tell them I'm a G
2 of 'em didn't know I'm so bent, like a broken nose
My chest so lit like an optimal
...!
Put it in your ... with no clothes
I'm so blown people leave me alone
Wait, hos can't leave me alone
Cause my salary and everything is bigger then every average house and its capacity
Blunts on tracks, you can capture me
Speakin' like malcom with batteries
Plus I'm

[Chorus]
Tatted like a cholo
Nigga' my neck
Tatted up
Yeah my face
Tatted up
Yeah my chest
Tatted up
Uh uh
Tatted like a cholo
Yeah my neck
Tatted up
That's my face
Tatted up
That's my chest
Tatted up
Uh uh
Tatted like a cholo

All up in my BI, girls be
I ain't T.I., bitch you don't know me
Think they got all of my info
Cause I spit it on instrumentals
I was just playin' witcha mentals
You got feeling, I might feel 'em
From my grill, them might grill 'em
Don't hit on me, might kill ya
And be chillin while you ..
They give me head and say it taste like lemon
Let me head to my ear like killa say
You beef with him till your limb turn the color red
And I be goin', mighty gone
Michael vicks dogs, they eatcha flesh, umm
Don't know what it means
But it sounds good on the song
Ahh fuck it, call it flat
I got a spare one on the back
Fresh outta jessies wit a fresh tat
Cause I'm

[Chorus]
Tatted like a cholo
Nigga' my neck
Tatted up
Yeah my face
Tatted up
Yeah my chest
Tatted up
Uh uh
Tatted like a cholo
Yeah my neck
Tatted up
That's my face
Tatted up
That's my chest
Tatted up
Uh uh
Tatted like a cholo</pre>
