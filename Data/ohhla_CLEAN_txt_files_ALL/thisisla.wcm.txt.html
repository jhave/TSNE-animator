[Chorus]
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")

[W.C.]
This shit don't stop, I'm still stackin' my cash
Out in the backyard with niggaz hidin' crack in they ass
It's gettin' kinda hot but I ain't leavin' the spot
Cause don't nobody give a fuck if I'm eatin' or not, nigga
South Central, the gangbang capital
Where gun fire's rampid, the one-time be gafflin'
Murder is a headline, half an ounce of chronic is a misdemeanor
One gram of hard is fed' time
The name of the game is survival
Keep the thang on me like a preacher do a Bible
Fuck unity, ain't no motherfuckin' one love
Crips killin' Crips nigga, Bloods killin' Bloods
Niggaz tellin', gotta stay outta dodge
On the stand y'all be singin' like Mary J. Blige
But I'ma stay cockin' my pistol
Goin' hard in the paint, niggaz can't stop my dribble

[Chorus]
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")... 
("Gang capital of the nation"), ("South Central, Los Angeles")
("Gang capital of the nation"), ("South Central, Los Angeles")
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")

[W.C.]
Out the belly of CA, hated by the D.A.
Skatin' in a '6-trey drinkin' on E&amp;J
Everything will C okay
As I turn this bottle for my niggaz the old way
South Central L.A. where every day
The LAPD ghetto bird be yellin' freeze on the P.A.
You know they wanna lock us away, they laughin' away
While we killin' each other, the blacks and the eses
Fuck how much money you make, they gon' hate
Ballin' ass nigga, they gon' still treat ya like O.J.
The stereotypes don't go away
(Little nigga nice car, where the kilos lay?)
Po-po wanna send us where the P.O.'s play
Thinkin' we all get our money the Carlito's Way
Charles Manson could kill and live to see another day
But if you're black like Tookie they gon' steal you away

[Chorus]
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")
I was raised in the hood called what the fuck nigga
W.C., ya better duck nigga
Fuck me, you're out of luck nigga
("This is Los Angeles", "This is Los Angeles")</pre>
