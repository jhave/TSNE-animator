I don't dance because that just aint my style.
Portray the prep and act so buck wild.
And when the Eiht bails to these local clubs
my first inspiration is to just get buzzed.
Dress code inforced, just like I said I aint frightened.
The homie dressed up is a brand new shirt and dickies.
So I spot a female up to par, jump out my car
and head straight for the bar.
As I proceed I got a shove in the back. 
Turned around and said "black, you hopping like your on crack"
But he was hopping, and spinning so fast, brother put me in a trance.
mm-mm, I don't dance.

Scratching: (...and I will never dance...) X2

The place is packed. Just like ring around the collar.
Bail up to the door and don't have to pay a dollar.
"Compton's in the house" as everybody screams
as I dust off the sweatshirt and Levi's Jeans.
Cant peep out the scene its a damn disgrace.
Everytime I try a brother slides in my face.
And I aint with breaking my back
Trying to impress a girl who ain't giving up jack.
And I never see you leave with a girl.
All that sweating dried out your curl.
Too much ants in your pants.
I aint hype, thats why I dont dance.

Scratching: [I can make you dance...][I Don't think so]
[I can make you dance...][On the dance floor baby..]
[I dont think so...][I leave that to the brothers with the funny hair]

Now its 3'oclock, am, boy and I was gone.
Grooving to the round the way girls song. It was on.
Downed the last of the Cogniac.
Eiht was ready to attack.
Grabbed the girl I was peeping.
She was 5000 baby, I said "baby, aint no sleeping."
Get my gangsta slide to the middle.
That pumped her up I seen her earings jiggle.
Right then the crowd got crazy.
But the DJ got kinda lazy.
Through on the "Ice Ice Baby"
It just didn't fade me, thats why I dont dance.
