[Xzibit]
Last but not least we off the leash
The Art of War reach for your masterpiece
Feel the release from the phantom bangs you
Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you
Comin at you niggas from a different angle
Arch Angel choke hold and strangled
Kay Slay the game turn the tables
Get cables, I'm Kane you Abel
Start bullshit, conflicts, labels
Man handled, murder, mangled
Life support cut short we hold court
In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep
Fuck piece bare back doggystyle
Cement ya feet and hold ya down
Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown
Last one to laugh its over now

[Hook]
We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan
Break ya bitch and take ya doe
Shake ya Crys and take it whoa
Layin down the whole dance floor
(Break yourself right now)
Open bar free drinks this way
Walkin the West, possin the South
Coke can put these in ya mouth
Hands up jack the whole crowd
(Break yourself right now)

[Xzibit]
Break crash from ya ass so don't rush to bust
Bitches die, cry, and lust for us
Damn it feel good to be platinum plus
Don't fuck wit us cuzz we dangerous
Hold fans like fiends on Angel Dust
Clean get aways I get out the cuffs
Coast like a sailor you fuckin fucks
I done hand it hard to keep in touch
Don't pop the Crys I pop the clutch
Pop one to ya mouth cuzz you talk too much
Way in over ya head you get played
Left holdin the bag like John Forte
Built for this all work no play here to stay
The rest get blown away
Built for this all work no play here to stay
The rest get blown away
C'mon

[Hook]

[Xzibit]
Neva seen heard felt befo
Wanna rumble wit us just start the show
Fill up the chamber let me go
Out of town before the shells hit the floor
Duck tape ski mask professional
Fuck y'all, y'all homosexual
Hangin on my dick like testicle
Pop you disappear, "Where did he go?"
Pop up some where in Mexico
Rotate relate respect the flow
Hospital bed you vegetable
Can't walk can't talk lettin you know
We hit the hardest ask ya ho, at my show
Seen her in the front row
To the back stage in there she blow
There she blew
Then send her back to you (hello)
