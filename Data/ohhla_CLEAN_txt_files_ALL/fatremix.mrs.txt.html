[Chorus] [Queen]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? 
Ah, down beside that red firelight 
Are you gonna let it all hang out? 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 

[Verse One] [Queen]
Hey I was just a skinny lad 
Never knew no good from bad 
But I knew life before I left my nursery - huh 
Left alone with big fat Fanny 
She was such a naughty nanny 
Woman you made a bad boy out of me 
Hey hey! 
I've been singing with my band 
Across the water across the land 
I seen every blue eyed floozy on the way, uh
But their beauty and their style 
Went kind of smooth after a while 
Take me to them dirty ladies every time 

[Chorus]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? 
Ah, down beside that red firelight 
Are you gonna let it all hang out? 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 

[Verse Two] [MURS] 
Now I'm missin' collared greens, fat bottoms in their jeans
From early in their thirties until their late teens
Makin' dreams come true
Run 'em all throughout the crew
Late night on a tour bus, you know how we do
We only take the thick ones, no anorexic sick ones
MURS under pressure
Tryin' to bust a quick one
Might forget her name when I'm caught up in a rush
Next town, new girl +Another One Bites The Dust+

[Chorus] [Queen]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? 
Ah, down beside that red firelight 
Are you gonna let it all hang out? 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 

[Scratched]
Get on your bikes and ride 
Fat bottomed girls 
Rockin'
I want to ride
On the wheels of steel

[Chorus] [Queen]
Are you gonna take me home tonight? 
Ah, down beside that red firelight 
Are you gonna let it all hang out? 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round 
Fat bottomed girls 
You make the rockin' world go round</pre>
