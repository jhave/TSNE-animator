[Chorus: female] + (Bow Wow)
I know you wanna see me shake, my thang
But boy I -  don't think you know what to do with this thang
So what'cha gon' do
(Give it to you girl, give it give it to you girl) Uh-huh
(Give it to you girl, give it give it to you girl) Uh-huh
(Give it to you girl, give it give it to you girl) Uh-huh
(Give it to you girl, give it give it to you girl)

[Bow Wow]
Well lil' mama throw it at me then, I guarantee
I'ma catch that thang like Chad Johnson, girl
Might as well call your man tell 'em you gon be late
You and Bow got plans; I ain't tryna wife 'em
I take take 'em to the Trump Hotel an one-night 'em
Girl, you know how I do. I'ma P-I-Imp girl
Better know that I far from a simp girl, I rock your world girl
Got mo' game than the NBA
And all the baddest girls shorty wanna come this way
I'm addictive, somethin like fiends to dope
I give it to 'em one time, they come back fa mo'
When it's time to get down, I'm known as the best
I'ma playboy baby somethin like Hugh Hef'
But uhh, recognize game, game recognize real
I'm sayin, baby is you ready for me? C'mon

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow]
Damn shorty, how you get that to fit in them jeans
Body lookin so good and you walk so mean
I know exactly what to do with it
Just give it to the dog girl I'll act a fool wit it, I know what you need
You need a dude like me to come over girl
And give you what'cha need, satisfaction guaranteed (that's right)
And ye ain't messin wit a lame, I ain't like these other {niggaz}
tryin to holla at you, girl I ain't the same (nahhh)
And I don't get sprung easy
It's gon' take more than just ya goodies and weave to get Weezy (HA~!)
I got the whip outside, now jump in
I got my home boys you can bring yo' friends
I got the Benz on dubs, relationships - nahhh
Sorry girl this ain't "Flavor of Love"
But uhh, recognize game, game recognize real
I'm sayin, baby is you ready for me? C'mon

[Chorus]

[Bow Wow - repeat 4X]
Bring it up fast, drop it down slow now

[girl - repeat 4X]
Give it to me boy, put it on me right now (uh-huh)
