[Dr. Dre]
You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again
It's like clock again, the hood rock again
You should pop it in,ain't take it out
That shit play on, you can't make it out
The world ain't set for what I'm about to do
Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two
I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop
Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops

[Snoop Dogg]
We can shoot, we can scrap
We can rap, we can act
We can mack these bitches, whatever you want
Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front

[Dr. Dre]
How it be on the West, forever the hunt

[Snoop Dogg]
But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye)
Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die)
Waitin' on school by (By by)
Have you on the news by (By)

[Dr. Dre]
Y'all know how the story goes
We give a fuck about award shows

[Snoop Dogg]
Same shit about hoes

[Dr. Dre]
Real niggas own platinum balls
I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls
I think y'all just tryin' to insight us
Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz
All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride
That's when my shit flies

[Snoop Dogg]
And here's where the pimp lies

[Dr. Dre]
I spit game at the globe
First week deuce five

[Hook: Kokane]
I'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
All you high paid niggas stay fly
I'ma slide left, fly right on by
I'ma do it on the boulevard
Fast bitches, fast cars and stars
Stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar
Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah

[Dr. Dre with Snoop rapping along]
It's funny how the game goes
New face but they look like the same hoes
I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre
Stay focused, bang I done hit a day

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi

[Dr. Dre]
Fuck y'all, wanna slice and it's all mine

[Snoop Dogg]
My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'

[Dr. Dre]
You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho'
I can see you walkin' under the Earth

[Snoop Dogg]
My gun burst em'

[Dr. Dre]
And I still got my first mail
Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt

[Snoop Dogg]
Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest
G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South
Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

[Dr. Dre]
A word from me, exclusive as a surgery
But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'
My fingerprints all over the top ten

[Snoop Dogg]
Like that

[Dr. Dre]
Whole staff'll come through and spin
Either on the film or the two-inch wheel
Behind the wheel of a sixty-four
I can't stop till I done fifty totes

[Snoop Dogg]
Y'all motherfuckers know me
I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe

[Hook]

[Kokane x4]
Rock on, rock on keep movin' on
Groovin' on and hold ya on
