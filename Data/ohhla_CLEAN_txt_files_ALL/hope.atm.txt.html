Somebody's amp is buzzing
Somebody's amp is buzzing
Somebody's amp is... fix the fucking amp!

I hope it's not too late when you get the news
I hope your coffee's great and you had breakfast too
I hope it's the type of day you would say was
perfect in every way you could crave of
I hope all your brats behave
and that you had a good shower, shat and shave
I hope your lady cooperates, plays nice
I hope you already got laid today twice
I hope that your teeth don't hurt
and it's the first morning of a whole week off work
I hope that your back feels fine and your car starts first try
Search a blue sky and watch the birds fly
Hope its everything you could ask for, plus more
Maybe even catch a little nap on the front porch
I hope you got the world under foot
and you're on page one of your new favorite book
I hope you took a little time to reflect
Hope you get to look, see the signs that connect
I hope there's no depression or panic attacks when
you finally decide to get a life and quit rapping

I'm only serious, I hope you're hearing this
in land at the end of the line, just like period!
I hope you can let the star go
I wish you a good day, I hope it's tomorrow

You suck, you suck dude</pre>
