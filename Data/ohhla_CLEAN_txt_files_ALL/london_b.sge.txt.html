[Sage Francis]
Ohhhh! (Ohhh!)
La la la, la-London {*2X*}
London Bridge is, is falling
London Bridge is falling
And the Tower of Pisa is leaning
The Statue of Liberty is green with envy
Penny for your thoughts, penny for your lows
The clothes and dress codes
Tradition of false things
London Bridge is falling
India's got salt on its coast
There's a tea party in Boston
London Bridge is..

Made of wood and clay, that wouldn't stay
No matter how hard the people prayed the materials just washed away
They could have used rocks, rocks don't bend or bow
But quite frankly they had too many enemies to stone
in the Empire (the Empire) State
The Empire State is Building
The Taj is on fire; these horus cats make a killing
Heathens bow down to the sirens
An emergency for bread and cheese (rioters shut up and freeze)
Uhh, the Earth shall inherit the meek
When Canada puts up a fence cause their medicine's so cheap
America's asleep (yeah I'm snoring)
And London Bridge is... and London Bridge is falling

I got the best seat in the house
They hired me as a watchman - London Bridge is falling
India's got salt on its coast
There's a tea party in boston, London Bridge is..

Made of stainless steel and wrought iron
That wall in China ain't so great, I built a bridge over a hymen
It goes up to the sky and Mother Mary is cryin
My fair lady, don't cry, it's gonna be alright!
Cus I'm alive - I'm alive and kickin
Tea party in Boston (tea party in Boston~!!)
The London Bridge is falling (the London Bridge is falling)
The London Bridge is falling! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
