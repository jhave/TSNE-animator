Intro:

Yeah, what's happenin?
This one is dedicated to my niggaz
All my niggaz, out there, Gz Up, Hoes Down
Yeah

Verse One:

Ladies and gents, playas and pimps listen
Snoop Doggy doggs on the mic pay attention
1, 2, or what shall I do ?, I'm slippin on my
Khaki suit (which one?) the blue one, gun by
My side, as I mob to the beach, on a mission
and I'm fishin
for my DJ Warren G, now I look for the bud's sack
and see where my loves at, on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by G's
Saggin like a motherfucker khakis to they knees
Bitch please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg not your average motherfucker see
Some of you don't know about the G thang baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the beat, and ya move to the sound
I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz Up, Hoes Down

Chorus:

Well, all the real Gz please stand up and
let all be accounted for, and if you don't give a fuck
about a bitch, then you're rolling with the row

Verse Two:

Back with the 1,2,3, and to the Fo'
It's the S-N-O and to the O... P
Why am I so fly? (I don't know, but) Why am I so high?
It's the indo, i don't fuck with the pocus, everbody knows this
Fuckin with the Chronic, 'cuz the Chronic gives me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these
Follow me, as i take ya rollin' with the Real OG's
East Side, is the motherfuckin place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, and 20 grand, and
Some of you don't know about the G thang baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the G-Funk, and move to the sound
I'm gonna hit ya with the Pound, Gz Up, Hoes Down

Chorus

Outro:

Hell yeah, YaknowhatI'msayin?
This is stricly for the Gz, yeah
Fuck that bitch
Niggaz alwayz be handcuffin that hoe
when a nigga like me steps in the place
I don't want that hoe, I don't love that hoe
I'm caught up with my greens: collard greens, indo, and the cash flow
YaknowhatI'msayin?
Peace...
Gz up, Hoes Down</pre>
