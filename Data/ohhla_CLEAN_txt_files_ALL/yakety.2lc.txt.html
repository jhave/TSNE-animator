(Mixx scratches "Yakety Yak")

Brother Marquis:
When you're told to do something by your mom and dad
Don't frown in their face or get mad
Because as long as you're livin' under their roof
You better mind your mouth, or get Dad's boot
It's the simples thing that they ask of you
Like mow the lawn and take the trash out too
But it always never seems to get done, so ...

Luke:
Take out the papers and the trash
Or you don't get no spendin' cash
You better wax that kitchen flo'
Or you ain't rock 'n rollin' no mo'!
Yakety Yak!  (Don't talk back!)
Ha haaa!

Fresh Kid Ice:
Don't touch that phone when it rings
You're under restriction 'till your room is cleaned
It'll take away your spending cash
You better have it cleaned, quick and fast
Dust the furniture, have the floor waxed
It gotta be spotless from front to back
You might as well get off your butt and ...

Mr. Mixx:
Just finish cleanin' up your room
Let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight
Or you don't go out Friday night
Yakety Yak!  (Don't talk back!)
Don't you roll yo' eyes at me, boy!

Brother Marquis:
This house is dirty, it's a total mess
No need to be rude, so don't get dressed
There's a lot of things that have to be done
If you don't, then you have no fun
Now pack the basket with those dirty clothes
And go to the laundromat before it closes
There's no need to pout or frown around, so ...

Luke:
You just put on your coat and hat
And walk yourself to the laundry-mat
And when you're finished doing that
Bring in the dog and put out the cat
Yakety Yak!  (Don't talk back!)

(Mixx scratches "Take out the papers and the trash" and "Breakdown!")

Fresh Kid Ice:
Behind your dad's back, you roll your eyes
Always plottin' and schemin' and plannin' lies
But you're always doin' things to make him mad
Instead of doin' right for good old dad
So tell your friend you're not hangin' out
Just do as I say, 'cause I'm the man of the house
You better act like you got some sense and ...

Mr. Mixx:
Don't you give me no dirty looks
Your father's stiff, he knows what cooks
Just tell your hoodlum friend outside
You ain't got time to take a ride
Yakety Yak!  (Don't talk back!)
What you say to me boy?</pre>
