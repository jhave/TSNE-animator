[Birdman]
So light it up and pass the thang to me
I'm fresh off patrol I could smoke a whole P
Can smell it in my clothes you can smell it in my seats
that's how a nigga rolls i was raised in them streets
i'm rolling up a sweet, I'm fillin' it with keef
I'm too high to talk bitch, keep it real brief
IF it ain't about money, you don't even gotta speak
I smoke it in a paper, Weezy smoke it in a leaf
And nigga I'mma Stunna, I got runnas
And we keep them shotguns like hunters
We smoke thunder, it put me under
I'm talkin' bout straight purple kush that thundas
See I be fuckin' with them trees, cuz I'm straight out tha jungle
Keep about five pounds and we ain't even tryin' to hustle
Ya'll already know how that go

[Lil Wayne]
I get my kush from California, get my dro from Arizona
I can get it cross the boarder, I got a Ryda name Winona
And I be calmer than a somma, inside of the phantom
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I still stay high and I still got my diploma
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma
And I smoke that kill, ya'll blowin' on begonias
And I keep a fill of that grass like a farmer
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town
That's right the present town, bitches tear the fences down
Like prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day
You wit me now? Too high you can't set me down

[Daz]
We got that AK47 white right on set painted
And named it orange purple kush that million dollar top brand

[Kurupt]
I got that white ivory ice tee, docters requestin' dope weed
Blazin' up so much bomb, I got a bad bitch on my side

[Daz]
See see we just smokin' we just smokin'
We just tryin' to fire up
If you got the bomb bomb nigga come and light it up

[Kurupt]
Yeah blaze up ain't nothin like ridin' by, drivin' high
Me and all the homies smokin', dumpin' if you chokin' smokin

[Daz]
Smoke slow when they hit you cuz you might pass out

[Kurupt]
Look over at the bitches, snatch a blunt up out a mouth bitch

[Daz]
Switch it to another scene, that has you smokin' endo green

[Kurupt]
Some homies be on that lean, mix it with that endo weed

[Daz]
Because we fucked up we fucked up, you know that we fucked up

[Kurupt]
I like to smoke and drink, with that nympho plated thang

[Daz]
Because we fucked up, we fucked up, you know that we fucked up</pre>
