[Ludacris]
(Aowwww!) Luda!
I done killed so many niggaz in the booth I sell rappers on eBay (hey!)
Cause every one of my verses been instant like replays (hey!)
Speakers get blown like candles on yo' B-day (hey!)
Cause Luda's catalog got mo' records than the DJ (woo!)
The bank yells "MAYDAY" cause every day's a payday
I put it on tape and then I'll sell it like Ray J
But not out the sto' (nope) straight to the buyer
Cause I slung 'em out my trunk like the D.C. sniper
And six albums later you'll deposit every word
'Til your memory bank gives me the credit I deserve
Top 5, damn right! But really it just hit me
that three of yo' top 5's too scared to FUCK with me (woo!)
So how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents? (yeah)
How can you see the future if you livin for the moment? (yeah)
Hip-Hop couldn't die, I never offer my condolence
But I'll offer y'all a day of atonement - cause

[Chorus One: Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}
I'm a lyricist to the death, so I got what you need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dyin breed
And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd"  Rakim*}
Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Lil Wayne]
I got it baby!
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea I wear red like roses
Go against me and you'll be dead like roses
Spittin at your head full of bread like toasters
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin, yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Little Carter, or Little Cardiac
Precious like an artifact, valuable like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack, throwback like a Starter hat
Now how did he thought of that? I mean how did he think of that?
I mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back
I mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine
For the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!

[Chorus Two: Lil Wayne, Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}
[W] I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what you need
[W] Weezy F, the last of a dyin breed
[W] And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd"  Rakim*}
[L] Say it with me {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
[L] Say it with me! {*"MC means move the crowd" - Rakim*}
{*scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"*}

[Ludacris]
(Aowwwww!) They say O'Reilly don't like him (nope)
Oprah won't invite him (nope)
The president denounced him (yeah) no one will announce him (no!)
Controversial lyrics like I'm cryin for help
I'm very talented, but I should be ashamed of myself (woo!)
But this is my art (art) this is my music (hey!)
I'm speakin from the heart, hit record and I'll lose it!
Bite my tongue for no one, I'll put you on blast (blast)
So all the news channels, y'all could kiss my ass!
And if I dish it I could take it, fix it if you break it
Could hit rock bottom and I'm STILL gon' make it (why?)
Cause I'm a born hustler, natural survivor
Seed of a gangsta, I put that on my father
YouTube or Google me, turn it up and play it (hey!)
Cause many people think it, I just had the balls to say it (what?)
And risk losin everything, I stand for the weak
Plus I live for my freedom of speech - cause
