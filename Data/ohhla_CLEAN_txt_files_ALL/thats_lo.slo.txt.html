[Intro]
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"

[Chorus]
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Everywhere I be and everywhere I go: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Pull up to my hood, show love to my folks: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo."

[Verse 1:]
Every summer, I make nice cream 
I'm in the hood, buyin' children ice cream
The streets love me and the kids too
Showin' much love: that's what the kid do
Hood barbeque, turn them in too
It was looking rough, but guess who came through?
May I add too?  
They came through for me
And made it possible, so I can do for me
I love my nigga B., show me that recipe
I make a lot of money, but it's just chicken fee
And I can do for she 
And I can do for he 
Now everybody know it, so sing along with me

[Chorus]
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Everywhere I be and everywhere I go: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Pull up to my hood, show love to my folks: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo."

[Verse 2]
When I was just a kid, I used to move with dad
Brand new Micheal Jordan's, Chicago Starter cap
And I know how it is, so now I'm givin' back
And all 'em think I'm this
And all 'em think I'm that
I don't think it's wrong
You might not think it's right
But I was in the hood, gettin' off the white
I was livin' life: fast not slow
And these are the tales from Shawty Lo

[Chorus]
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Everywhere I be and everywhere I go: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Pull up to my hood, show love to my folks: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo."

[Verse 3:]
Some say it's love, but it's really not
I come from the gutter, and I'm really hot
Bowen Home spot, it put me on top
And I'm doin' good, with the little I got
I would never stop doin' what I do
I do it for my people; what about you?
You can catch Lo poppin' at the store:
Signin' autographs, snappin' pictures with my folks

[Chorus]
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Everywhere I be and everywhere I go: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Pull up to my hood, show love to my folks: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo!"
Who that man from Bankhead?
You already know: 
"That's Shawty Lo, that's Shawty Lo."</pre>
