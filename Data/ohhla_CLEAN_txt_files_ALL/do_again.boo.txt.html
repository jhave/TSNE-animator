Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Lil Boosie bad ass and I wanna know if you a do it again baby girl, you know what I'm talkin bout
if you a press rewind if I ain't have shit, make a nigga wonder sometime fa real
(ohhh oooohh do it againnnn, do it againnn)

[Verse 1]
Now if I ain't have shit would she still love, a nigga hair all nappy underarms musty
if I wasn't boosie bad ass would she still fuck me
tell the truth would me n you ever had an discussion
would you do it again, get away from all your friends
would you still be happy if I ain't have no bens sometimes I ask myself
would she forgive me for them other kids I had on her long night on the corner all the nights
I jumped on her, chill mama but mama just a little girl
I'm 17 she 15 we having a little girl, she keep it guttah gotta give her dat
she say she tired but if she tired tell me why she ain't leave yet
never had a job over a week I really spoiled her when we go eat she beyonce and I'm sean carter
if I worked at burger king and approached you smelling like onion rings would she do half the things she done to me

[Chorus]
If I could'ntgive you the finer thangs
the money and the whips and the diamond rings
Would you do it again
I wanna know, I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
And if I didn't have my baller status
And if you didn't have the 7 ?
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know
Would you do it again
I wanna know I wanna know

[Verse 2]
If she brought me home to her mama
she disagree with her decision
would you wild out if she threatened to put her child out
would she still go get them birds for me slang that syrup for me be at court extra early for me
(sometimes I ask myself) put her on her first plane
told her do her thang took her to emmitt 5 g's on a pinky ring
if I wasn't boosie boo would she ride for me
would she had layed down took that pain and have that child for me
she kept it real from the start she ease my brain, was it the chain
was it the game, was it the name
she stayed faithful that's why I love her through thick n thin
made visits n commisary when I hit that pin
I had my homework she had her homework
she went from drawers to thong work I'm a fool with it
if I worked at mickey d's and hooked you up with a #3 would you be nice and give your number to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
With all the money I got and all the whips that I buy
if I ain't have nothing would you still be by my side
if I ain't have this status no purple just reggie
if I ain't have no daddy I'd be diggin ?
I'll still be selling off the store no fresh golds no fresh clothes no bad hoes
sad hoes girl would you still be my hoe
no fendi no prada no gucci can't buy that would you still lay under me at night time in the projects
no diamond chains from emmit a honda no bentley
would you still go low if I ain't have this image no sean john cologne no deodorant my odor strong
would I fuck these red bones if I ain't have my bread long
rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck me
no showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me
just rewind my lifetime you prolly wouldn't have fuck'd me
no showers on my grind you prolly wouldn't have suck'd me

[Chorus]</pre>
