And now, the night time...

[Cee-Lo]
Late in the evening
there is the thieving and the trickin and the trappin
and they ain't actin
We make it happen
We'll get the guns on anyones and get to clappin'
Even for rappin'
Does it surprise ya?
We'll readjust and reconcile and recognize up
-that I'm a writer
Oh yes I write up
Now open wide and let me put the night inside ya

This is music usually confused with major motion picture
No one is stricter about it being status for scripture
No put on your gut is goin', you're wearin' what don't fit ya
You better run little one, cause the rhythm's gonna getcha
And when it hits ya, it usually hits somebody with ya
Make 'em risk a total eclipse of sun to get richer
Baby, a little time and something fine that'll fix ya
With shield love you forgot to remember to miss the - (??)
The nightlife  the dark side of the city
Gon' be on 24 inches, and be defenseless
The nightlife  the dark side of my heart
Where no one really knows you, and no one supposed you
The nightlife  the dark side of my soul
Where if somebody crossed you, kill 'em up off you!
The nightlife  the dark side of the moon
Where the sun is scared to come
 (give me some) ha!

(chorus)
Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

OOOoohhh...wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go, wanna know, wanna go, wanna go
Give me the night!
The night is gonna getcha
 ahh it's gonna getcha
 The night is gonna getcha
 ahhh its gonna getcha
Give me the night!
The night is gonna getcha
 ahh it's gonna getcha
 The night is gonna getcha
 ahhh its gonna getcha
Give me the night!
The night is gonna getcha
ahhh it's gonna getcha
The night is gonna getcha
Hey its gonna getcha
Give me the night!
The night is gonna getcha
ahhh it's gonna getcha

[Chazzie]
I'll be your lady
Farewell the friend
I'll be honest
And I'll pretend
I'll act like I love ya aaauhhaaaaohoh
I'll act like I love ya aaauhhaaaaohohhhhh!

(give me some now)

Take me where the darkness is still beautiful!

[Cee-Lo]
I've been runnin' since rock box
I've cocked locks and locked blocks and rocked rocks
and dropped tops
The obviously odd, five foot six inch guard
In the flesh
 I've been the best
I'll get in your chest and in the mess
 In your vest and out your back without even getting out the 'llac
 I lied about how I really handled that situation about the AK
I'll hit back
If your lead was the only collateral you got I'll get back
Now get flat
Say a prayer cause shorty want this shit back
Sit back, this chit-chat is pitch black
But you can still see what I'm sayin'
And heavy is how I weigh in
Niggaz love singin' sad songs about how bad they want to stay in
Either hold out on basketball playin or make use of some yay' then

Whooooowhooo
Lord shooo feel good to me
I promise, I promise
Not to ever, ever leave this night life alone
This me
me too (yup)
This me
and me three
