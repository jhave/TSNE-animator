[Chorus]
Can You Hear Me Now? Good

[V1 - Tone]
Yo, it's Sunday afternoon, and I've been hibernating thoroughly
Lying beside my girl who's been trying to wake me urgently
With a stern sermon about wasting my day
Knowing that if I don't force me outta bed with a crowbar I'll lazily stay
I wake up.kinda sorta.today's when the guys come over
To write, so I head out to get some pizza and buy us soda
Wireless phone to my ear, giving session a buzz
"Yo, Sesh, it's Tone, you want anything? I'm buying us grub"

[Session]
What?! you lyin in blood? (Tone) "yeah, and call Pack to wake him up"
(Session) Yo, you breakin up! STAN! They tryin to take his stuff!
(Stan) Word? then I got bones to crack, (Session) Lets split up
you bring Tone intact. I'ma get up, on the phone wit Pack
*Dialing* (Pack voicemail) "Its Pack, leave a message"
(Session) "I cant believe this, pick up!, its me, its Session!
Tone got robbed and we tryin to reach you man
hit me back on the hip or speak to Stan!"

[Pack]
Tones got cracked ribs from gettin beat by Stan???
I knew one day, these egos would get outta hand
Looks like me and sesh are the only ones with level heads
Fuck it lemme call Stan and see if we can settle this [*dialing sound in background*]
(Stans FRANTIC VOICE) "hello?!!?" (Pack) Stan, you alright? What's up with you and Tone?"
(Stan *pissed*) "Yo, pack you mumblin again!? Son, you need to get a better phone"
(Pack) Yeah, I know you hate Tone, Session left me a message explainin'
(Stan MORE FRANTIC) "WHAT! session got hit by a train???????"
(*Stan hangs up)

Jesus H Christ man I was just with'em
(crying) I figured he'd OD...who would think a train kill'em
What a horrible way to go! Just think
He just moved away from home. Rest in peace
Yo, I've gotta save Tone we ain't loosing him too
(Gets angry) I'm puting foot in somebody ass until they shit shoe
For trying to stick crew [*phone rings] Hello! (Tone) "Ayo, Stan, it's Tone"
(Stan) Since when do muggers stop to let you use the phone!!!

[Chorus]

[V2]
"(Stan and tone are still talking)"
(Tone) Muggers? Stan...What the fuck you yappin about?
I'm buying food, for when you, sesh &amp; pack are back at the house
You're spazzing out, I'm laughing now, didn't expect what you said
Especially that. (Stan) "Well, Aight, Cool...but session is dead"
(Tone) True...You want the freshest bread? White or wheat?
(Stan) "Why you speaking 'bout bread? I said that Session Died! Deceased!"
(Tone) Well, I must be a monkey's uncle, fuck recording...I'm just beat
(Stan) "Huh? Tone, you're whylin, b" (Tone) "Aight, I'll see ya by the beach"
(Stan) "Hello?" (Tone) Hello? Ahh fuck it...phone dropped, I'll try to reach
Session to tell him where to find the jeep, so we can ride to the scene
[*Ring] (Session) "Yeah, whuttup?" (Tone) Ayo, Sesh, what time should we meet?
(Session) "Tone, you're still alive! I figured by now, you'd died in the street!"
Yo, Stan is looking for you man, you told me your were getting jacked!"
(Tone) Jacked? Nah, man, I'm headed to the beach to rest &amp; relax

(Session) You're headed for Pack's? he needs to start picking his phone up!
(Tone) "No, man, no weed to spark, and I'm not getting coronas"
(Session) "Word? Somebody hot?! Sweating to bone us? Who are these groupie hoes?
(Tone) "Yeah, yeah, there's no more studio."
(Session) Oh, hell no!..I will not blow no bootyhole
I don't care if they're porno movie pros..What did you agree for?!?!
(Tone) "Man, you're breaking up, Meet me by the seashore" [*click]
(Session) Oh, shit...Stan's gotta hear this! Tone's talkin bout 'He-whores'?!?!

[Chorus]

[V3 - Session calls Stan phone rings and he picks up]
(SubStantial) Hello? (Session) "Wuttup, dog!"
(Stan in shock) I must be fucking dreaming
(Session) First, Tone with the He-whores...now you're sucking semen?
T.M.I. homo (SubStantial) I thought you died mofo
Well, That's what Pack told me but I'm glad you're back homie
So you talked to tone too... when we spoke he was bugging
By the way that shit earlier it was nothing
(Session) "Hold on, son, I just caught what you said... you thought I wasdead?!
(SubStantial) Yo, You're really about to grow dreads &amp; copping a lex...Sweet!!!
(Session) "HUH !?! Did you'd just say beach???"
(SubStantial) Almost forgot...that's where we're supposed to meet
(Session) "Yo that sounds a lot better than the meat fest at Tone's
Yo, that type of shit made me head home" (SubStantial)Yeah forget that
So let me hit Pack (Session) "Son you shouldn't sniff crack!? "
(SubStantial) Well, If not me, who? Son, see ya round 2! (Stan hangs up)
