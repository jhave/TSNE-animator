Yeah... hahahaha
Bars of Death, Vinyl Thug Music, all that good shit..
Bring in the drums!
We got comin to the ring tonight (bring him out son)
The undisputed heavyweight champ (bring him out son!)
Twenty-five and oh, 25 by knockout motherfucker
It's my boy Esoteric, say somethin

[Esoteric]
For my soldier to spit the sick, the lunatic
Military drum, bust through lungs, that sound like guns
I roll up, on dirt balls like a dustpan
Have 'em hiding in their own city like that Cubs fan
It's true, Shay changed, the man is berzerk
Make like Pedro and throw your manager in the dirt
Yo the fire never died, it just burned inside me
Saw "Kill Bill," now I'm filming "Kill Bill O'Reilly"
F'real, I feel, I deserve a badge of honor
For rippin asses block to block like Cappadonna
My flow be like water dog, inflating the pockets
And like sick fans, stores ain't afraid to stock it/stalk it
I'm still hungry, plus original
The only bars that I bite are made of chocolate
Es-trogen make y'all extra femme
Spittin two hot lines but the rest is phlegm
7L, E-S, got that special blend
Rock buttons up, not from Express for Men
Put the mic down - that's what we recommend
Design the rhyme with the mind/mine y'all blessed with gems

[Chorus]
Aiyyo break 'em (bust 'em) kill 'em (crush 'em)
Y'all ain't built for this rap shit (fuck 'em)
Y'all get killed for that madness (true)
The time is now, the boondocks comin through

[Esoteric]
Cats say they bust clips in the whip when they floss
Only time they blast heat's when they hit the defrost
Facin Es, you know that make no sense
Like the Celts tradings Antoine for Raef LaFrentz
I spit an avalanche of images, river of blood
Women in tubs, sippin bub, peep a sinister mug
They selling 12 step therapies, under the assumption
My function's to operate on fear and consumption
But, I get daps when I spit my rap
With more Pats on my back than New England sacks
You say you "Die Hard" just like that famous actor
But couldn't do it if you overdosed on Viagra
You're no factor, you work for free and fail
While I'm paid to be outstanding like police on detail
Think about it while the competition plummet
I kill for the sport like hunting on a full stomach

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh shit!  He's done ladies and gentlemen
First round, knockout, knock out motherfuckers flat on the floor
Didn't I tell you?  This shit is crazy son, crazy son!
Esoteric, 7L, Bars of Death
This shit is a wrap money, it's a wrap!!</pre>
