[Intro: Jay-Z]
Blue-print.. trois
Geah, geah...

[Jay-Z]
What we talkin' 'bout? Real shit or we talkin' 'bout rhymes?
You talkin' 'bout millions or you talkin' 'bout mine?
What we talkin' 'bout? Cause I ain't got time
We what people be talking 'bout all the time
What we talkin' 'bout fiction or we talkin' 'bout fact?
You talking 'bout fiction? Hold up, pardon my back
I'm talking 'bout life... and all I hear is
"Ohh yeah, he keeps talkin' 'bout crack!"
I ain't talkin' 'bout profit, I'm talkin' 'bout pain
I'm talkin' 'bout despair, I'm talkin' 'bout shame
I ain't talkin' 'bout gossip, I ain't talkin' 'bout Game
I ain't talkin' bout Jimmy, I ain't talkin' 'bout Dame
I'm talkin' 'bout real shit them people playin'
What is you talkin' 'bout? I don't know what y'all sayin'
People keep talkin' 'bout "Hov take it back"
I'm doin' better than before, why would I do that?
Ain't nothing cool about carrying a strap
'Bout worryin' your moms and buryin' your best cat
Talkin' 'bout revenge while you carryin' his casket
All teary-eyed, 'bout to take it to a mattress
I'm talkin' 'bout music, I ain't talkin' 'bout rap
You talkin' 'bout who's hot - I ain't talkin' 'bout that
The conversation is changed, let's yap about that
I don't run rap no more, I run the map

[Chorus: Luke Steele]
They, talk, we, live, we, see, what - they, say, they, say, they, say
They, talk, we, did, who, cares, what, - they, say, they, say, they, say?

[Jay-Z]
Seein' what y'all be talkin' 'bout, hehe... geah
Still they can't focus on them, they be talkin' 'bout me
Talkin' 'bout what I wear, talkin' 'bout where I be, yeah
Check out my hair; these ain't curls, these is peas
Peasey Head still get paid, I'm combin' through G's
Please, we ain't focused on naps
Cause I don't run rap no more, I run the map
A small part of the reason the President is black
I told him I got him when he hit me on the jack
Talkin' 'bout progress, I ain't lookin' back
You know I run track - try not to get lapped
People keep talkin' 'bout Hov left 'em flat
Try to re-write history, let's talk about facts
Dame made millions, even Jaz made some scraps
He could've made more but he ain't sign his contract
As far as street guys, we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes, I don't owe nobody jack
Grown men, want me to sit 'em on my lap
But I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black
I repeat, you can't sit on my lap
I don't have a beard now get off my sack - scream at me!

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Blue-print, 3...
And now that that's that, let's talk about the future
We have just seen the +dream+ as predicted by Martin Luther
Now you could, choose to, sit in front of your computer
Posin' with guns, shootin' YouTube up
Or you could come with me to the White House - get your suit up
You stuck on bein' hardcore, I chuck the deuce up
Peace out Medusa; welcome to the Blue-ah-
print-ah, tre-piece, Jay-Z your tutor
Tooter of my own horn - beep beep moo-ya
Ras clot when rude boy come through with the roof-ah
... So I could see the sky
Cause everybody talkin', Hov I think we know why

[Chorus]

[Auto-tuned woman]
They sayyyy-ayyyyy...
They sayyyy-ayyyyy...</pre>
