[U-God]
I don't know where to begin, or where to start
All I know is I broke my mother heart
It started way back with a little weed
Then it grew into acid, coke and speed
I became that monster with a need to feed
Was it greed? No, I just needed to freeze
Then I dibbled in this, then I dabbled in that
Then the next thing you know, I was exposed to crack
And I guess curiosity killed the cat
And the way that it look, ain't no turning back
And I used to have the hook up, g'sll splurge
Now, I just cook up to feed my herbs
Now, people just look up, like he's the third
Cuz he walk around town like he's a bird
Instead of money it was drugs that he prefered
Say no to the substance, heed my words

[Chorus 2X: U-God]
I don't love the drugs, drugs love me
It's the coke, and the weed, and the ecstasy
It's a terrible disease, that go down down deep
And all day long it be calling me

[U-God]
My father, he had dope fiend arms
Lord, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus for moms
Damn, I did her wrong, not a pot to piss in
And the, TV's missing, couldn't stop the addiction
Damn, that cause friction, I broke the trust
Huh, how could I tell her that I smoked it up
And I smoked the red dust, to fight the demons
And I need a head rush, cuz tonight I'm fiending
Not for the nicotine, the pipe I'm screaming
And the monkey on my back, can't fight the feeling
And I did a robbery, I broke the clip
And I caught a lottery ticket and smoked the dip
Life fucked up, nigga, I choked my bitch
Police tried to cuff me and I broke the stick
I'm as low as I can get, low as I can get, nigga
Low, low, need another hit, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[U-God]
I love getting high, throwing dick to dames
Lived life to the fullest like my name Rick James
I don't know what's more addictive, the chicks, the fame
Damn, I done shamed my family name
One foot in the rain, one foot in the flame
Ugh, rich or poor, whatever you call it
I'm a cigarette smoker, two sips from alcoholic
Got to change my ways, flush drugs down the toilet

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
