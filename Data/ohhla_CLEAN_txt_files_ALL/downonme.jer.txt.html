[Intro: 50 Cent] (Jeremih)
She want it I can tell she want it
Want me to push up on it 'fore she know when Im all on it
We get the party goin liquor flowin this is fire
50 and Jeremih number one theres nothin higher
(Wont you go and) Get it, get it, work it, work it (I see you baby)
Work it work it, down, down (Just put it down on me)
Get it, get it, work it, work it (Put it down on)
Break it, break it, down

[Verse One: Jeremih]
Ok she headed to the dancefloor and she slowly start to poppin it
Somethin like my wrist piece everybody got to watchin it
Girl you got that secret treasure I'm 'gon put a lock on it
Dont care what they say I would be stupid to be not on it 
Ms. Vicky, heard you go that sticky
Let's go and take nine shots well just call it 50
And Im gonna licky licky licky 'til her hicky 
Have-have-have her river runnin keep you gunnin 'til you empty
(BANG BANG BANG BANG!!!)
Oh you look so sweet 
What you work at Bally's? Look at your physique
Girl you are a beauty well-well  I am a beast
They must have been trippin to have let me off a leash

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I love the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime why you lookin lonely
Go buy another round then its all on me
As long as Im around put it down on me
Just put it down on me put it down on me
Down-down on me put it down on me
Dont throw it off the mound show me how It's 'gon be
Girl all I really want is you down on me, put it down on me

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
System's thumpin party jumpin shorty shes a perfect ten
She rock her hips then roll her hips, then drop it down like its nothin
She shaped just like an hour glass, see how fast an hour passed
Time flies when Im on that ass but I wont put our shit on blast
Work it like a pro-pro-pro sit and watch it go-go-go
Do her thing all on the flo' she bounce it fast and shake it slow
So sexual incredible she beautiful she edible
I got her I wont let her go I ain't seen nothing better yo
Look at how she twirk it, the way she work it
Make me wanna hit it hit it heaven when Im in it in it
If  I do not fit, Im gonna make it
Girl you can take it, dont stop get it get it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I love the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime why you lookin lonely
Go buy another round then its all on me
As long as Im around put it down on me
Just put it down on me put it down on me
Down-down on me put it down on me
Dont throw it off the mound show me how It's 'gon be
Girl all I really want is you down on me, put it down on me

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Say you independent (HEY) Get it from your momma (HEY)
Tell me if you with it (WHAT)  Do you really wanna (WANNA)
Baby when you see me (YEAH) You know I be on it (YEAH)
Can you keep it up and (Up and) put it down up on me
Say you independent, get it from your momma 
Tell me if you with it, do you really wanna
Baby when you see me, you know I be on it
Can you keep it up and, put it down up on me
Down with that booty on me (On me)
Shorty you a dime why you lookin on me
Oh baby we can gooooooo!!!!! looooowwwwwwww!!!!
Looooowwwwwwww!!!! Yeah!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I love the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime why you lookin lonely
Go buy another round then its all on me
As long as Im around put it down on me
Just put it down on me put it down on me
Down-down on me put it down on me
Dont throw it off the mound show me how It's 'gon be
Girl all I really want is you down on me, put it down on me</pre>
