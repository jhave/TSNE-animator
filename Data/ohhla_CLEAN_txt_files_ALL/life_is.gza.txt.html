[RZA]
I got scientist killas that'll jam your cell phone
Send a text message, kill you off with a ringtone
High pitched noise, on your brain, it's heavy
Autopsy report, that he jumped off a train
It started when the dearly departed, tried to escape max'
Then cut into the general's income like state tax
One call, to seal the deal with feel
Doctor on the payroll, cost a quarter mill

[GZA]
The mailman's late with the check
I'm in the flood with a bunch of bills that's about up to my neck
Plus my rent's not paid and the light's about to go off
Car got stolen by a thief who likes to show off
I can't even get a job, giving out flyers
I'm a handyman with a pair of broke pliers
The fridge is theirs, Mother Hubbard's cupboard
I'm so down and out, I can only go upward

[RZA]
I form rhymes in alphabet soups
From the rhythm of the spoon, I transform the loop
From the steam of the bowl, I'm making special effects
Add a dash of spice, only God can detect
Had a word, to make a bear return to his cub
A word that make a girl come home from the club
A word that make a heven return back to God
And the word that help Dorothy get home from Oz
Thirty frames per second, these films we be perfecting
Scenes of light put through all projection
Electricity, perfectivity
Audio and visually, physically and mentally

[GZA]
I got a smile that'll make the mirror crack
And I seem to stay under clouds that's pitch black
So when it rains, it pours, and when it pours, I'm soaked
I contracted lung cancer from third hand smoke
And uh, I'm like the frog that's dying to be a prince
The boy who cried wolf and no one was convinced
The man who hit lotto and lost his ticket
In a rainstorm, and struck by lightning trying to get it

[Chorus: Irfane Khan-Acito]
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
Play it all back, play it all back

[GZA]
Lights, camera, action, let the tape roll
Some scripts get ripped, canned or even sold
Directors vision, producers decision
And raised the budget, because the chase had collisions
Stunt double risks his life just for the thrill
DP checks the gate before the scene gets sealed
Gaffer slapped with a slate for being late
Craft service got nervous and dropped a hundred plates
Leading actor banging an extra in the trailer
Screaming, hitting high notes like Mahalia
Box office hit and a Blockbuster smash
Two hundred mil' budget and still recouped the cash

[Chorus]</pre>
