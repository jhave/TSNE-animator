Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Honk yo horn as she's walking by right now
Yea

[Verse 1]
I need some of that, so fresh out the pack
I'll pop yo cherry like a bottle, take a swing at that
Instagram my man, le the clown picture now
When he texts 911 don't hit him back
She's getting her box packed, she's not calling black
Like how you worry, you call that
Rock my T shirt, doggy style for dessert
L Cool TSA, rubbing on your skirt
Herm that Berkin, I'm your job  baby go to work
Poppin a old school tape with Red Alert
Let me do what I do, be a trooper, let it hurt
When you say that I'm the best, remember I said it first

[Chorus]
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Thought she bonking, now you in my apartment
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again

[Verse 2]
Baby your man's through, he don't understand you
Treat you like a dirty van dude, that he ran through
Never ever romantic, no incense or candles
Basically you're too much for him to handle
That's when I came through, baby my aim's too
Make you feel like every dream you ever had came true
Sometimes you know that sometimes you're an angel
Hand up and down, making sounds with your paingrells
You know my style, hitting from all angles
Staring at your arches while your flip flop stable
Nagging me, reminding me to remain true
I ain't going outside, I gotta stay in you

[Chorus]
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Thought she bonking, now you in my apartment
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again

[Verse 3]
Every time you ask me to get nasty
Chanel's my standard, no bitch you'll never outlast me
Free to be a bad girl even though you classy
Get behind closed doors, sweaty, be trashy
Scream all night til yo wind pipes rasby
You need a leading man, I'm a movie, cast me
Your ex gives me dirty looks when he pass me
See, that's what happens when you swagging on that

[Chorus]
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Thought she bonking, now you in my apartment
There's nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Nothing like the new love
Say hello to night stand, I'm a see you again

Ain't nothing like a new love
Ain't nothing like a new love
There's nothing like the new love</pre>
