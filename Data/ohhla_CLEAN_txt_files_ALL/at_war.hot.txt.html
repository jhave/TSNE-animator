Guerilla.....what!!!..what!!!....untamed guerilla

(Juvenile)
Everyday I hear somebody bustin' choppers
They be makin' it hot, they be killin' my block
They be havin' them whole people scared up
They be havin' them lil' children scared duckin'
But they don't give a fuck
They wanna see whats up
Niggas done play wit' his people Now they gone bust'em up
Some of them snortin' dope, some of them bag that kill
Some of them jus bout that foolishness some of them play it evil
I remember the club, they got banged up
Nigga was in the middle of it wit' his brains bust
And his partner saw, all of them niggas face
And now they wanna turn the tomorrow into a murder case
Nigga get out of jail, he still be up in beef
Gotta get some money, gotta get him a piece
Gotta get him a low so he can beef up
Catch a nigga down bad and woedy gettin' stuck

(Chorus)

(B.G.)

Dem boys at war...I say dem boys at war
I say dem niggas from uptown, dem boys at war

(Lil' Wayne)

(B.G.)
Now it was drama going on in my neck of the woods
Beef kickin' through out the hood niggas up to no good
Look here..They stappin' up, click clackin' up...loading dem thangs
Niaggas are taggin', they backin' up, they let'em hang
My niggas walkin' up, pullin' up, fuck a drive by
Cuz the nigga on the passenger side automatically die
Capable to slide, wit' a U-P-T
You out of bound, you ain't from uptown, cross Martin Luther King
Its pistol play on up and up
Niggas being big mouthed so they gettin tossed up
You better be about yo business cuz its going down
Niggas gettin' out, two weeks later they body found
I can't be fuckin' with them niggas drawin' beef to me
Have me in shoot outs that don't concern the B.G.
I play it like the next nigga fuck he play it raw
But I gotta watch my fuckin' ass cuz dem boys at war
Dem boys at war

(Chorus)

Man..dem boys at war...I say dem boys at war
I say dem niggas from uptown, dem boys at war
I say dem boys at war...I say dem boys at war
I say dem niggas from downtown, dem boys at war
yeah dem boys at war...oh dem boys at war
I say dem Hot Boy niggas will take yo boys to war

(Turk)
Camoflaugin' undisguise on the hit
Hummer's we drivin' and in it yo boy told us we ain't playin' wit
Nothin' but head busta...thats who I roll wit'
Hangin' from coppers wit' choppers givin' a fuck..we hit
Bitch...dem boys at war in the nolia
Niggas be shell shocked Knockin' heads of a shoulders
Spittin(?) mac 10, grenedes blowin shit up
Troopers be on roofs wit' scopes shootin shit up
Head shots what they givin' no surrenderin' you never die
Spin in da bed, in the rover wit' the six tires
Cuttin' throats leave'em hangin' like ropes
Dead bodies is what you find, niggas be dying slow
Killa's gone ride wit' lows
My nigga L be teamed up
S-K's fifty shots and choppers
Nigga its nothing descent in this battle donkey
Untamed guerillas and bout leaving you funky

(chorus)
