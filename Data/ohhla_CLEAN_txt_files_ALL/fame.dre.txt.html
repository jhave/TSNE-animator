Song:   Fame 
Typed by: OHHLA.com

Fame, I'm the man that takes things over 
Fame makes me loose, hard to swallow 
Fame puts me there where things are hollow 
Fame 

Fame 
It's not your brain, it's just the flame 
The bitch is gonna get your ends 
SLAIN! 

(You know I need the money, I will get the money 
Cos I need the cash, hey c'mon gotta get it) 
(You know I need the money, I will get the money 
Cos I need the cash, hey c'mon gotta get it) 

Chorus: RC 

Fame, what you like is in the limo 
Fame, take it now there's no tomorrow 
Fame, what you need you'll have to borrow 
Fame 

Fame 
Nine is fine, it plays for time 
I'ma lemme hit you from be-hind 
Fame, Fame 

Fame 
A bullet for me, I bust it for you 
I love it when you grab my gun 
Fame 
Fame, what's your name? What's your name? What's your name? 
Say my name? Say my name? Say my name? 

[King Tee] 

The world's famous, rugged with the superstar persona 
Rough designer, the chubby alcoholic rhymer 
Big timer, I'm known in places I haven't even been 
Executed styles behind men 
Oh God, I preach that old Hudd City gospel 
My look's hostile, hittin Remy from the bottle 
The fame is like I'm possessed wit game 
And everywhere I go, hos screamin my name 
But I'm rollin, not that my bald head's swollen 
I'm towin, ya fixed up, they'd rather see ya broken 
I'm scopin often where the spotlights shine 
Me and my crew drinkin tryin ta have a good time 
But folks watchin, wearin khakis or Versace 
They try to mack me, caught up in the papparazzi 
I'ma look what the hogg had become 
A top notch nigga with the fame game 

Outro: RC 

Is it any wonder, I'll reject ya first 
Fame Fame Fame Fame 
Is it any wonder, your heart's too cold to fool 
Fame Fame Fame Fame </pre>
