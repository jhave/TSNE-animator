Stepped of the bus handcuff and shackles
Hella tight on my ankles cuz the cops an asshole
Left Tracy headed to new Folsom "Penaten"
82 point strong but left with 4 to the millenium
Can't have fucc visits no more
Southerners is still trippin so we still at war
I heard niggas wanna see me dead
I heard they waitin on me
With bonecrushers hatin on me
And I'm on my only
The Northern Cali Crip carved your shadow
Seems like I'm on my own when it's time to battle
Niggas have to tell the cops everything they know
It ain't the way it used to be homie that's for sure
My nigga Ernest Powell told me how it used to be
Nowadays snitches run the penitentiary
Real niggas got it bad if they ache to beef
Can't get a job so you be stuck in the cell watchin T.V.
I hit the yard wit a mean mug
I ain't the biggest nigga but I gives mean fucc
You talk shit to my low cuz you on swoll
Bring your knife to the yard nigga
We goin to the hole
  
You better bring your knife to the yard
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard
I gives a fucc if you swoll
We goin to the hole
  
Now I'm in the hole
I think I'm goin crazy
Paranoid thinkin everybody tryin to play me
Fade me
Feelin like I'm stuck in a maze
Cuz I ain't seen the sun in 66 days
Hairs in braids stickin up like Coolio
No deodorant No toothpaste cuz you a ho
Put me in the cross so I had to blast ya
You probably gonna snitch on me I wouldn't put it paste ya
Niggas would rather snitch than retaliate
Ain't given a fucc about the shoe
Cuz I ain't got no date
And were they wrong I wish I was awol
Instead of sittin in the cell starin at a fuccin wall
If you ever done time you know just what I'm feelin
Layin on your bunk countin the cracks in the ceilin
Thinkin bout all the shit you did in the past
When I get out the hole I'm get your snitchin ass mothafucca
  
You better bring your knife to the yard
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard
I gives a fucc if you swoll
We goin to the hole
You better bring your knife to the yard
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard
I gives a fucc if you swoll
We goin to the hole
  
Niggas say what they gonna do when they see me
But when they see me but when they be askin for autographs
that's on the GB
In the pen steady thuggin
Like flesh &amp; bone
Pull out a Kisu
Hit 'em in the neck then I'm gone
In the pen you meet all sorts of kind a niggas
With different attitudes everybody think they bigga
Then the next man
But this savage can't be goin out like the average
So back up off the X man
Bustin down with the machine
It's Africans and Northerners and cops paccin mini 14s
Can't stop, won't stop the emotion
Gotta stand strong it be on in new Folsom
Step out the cell peep the yard feel the tension
Shit be goin on that a nigga can't mention
Keep my bacc against the wall
Watchin the drama as it unfolds
It's riot time
We goin to the hole
  
You better bring your knife to the yard
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard
Cuz the Northern Cali Car be pullin ho calls
You better bring your knife to the yard
Cuz you be mean muggin niggas like you hella hard
Now you gotta bring your knife to the yard
Igives a fucc if you swoll
We goin to the hole...nigga</pre>
