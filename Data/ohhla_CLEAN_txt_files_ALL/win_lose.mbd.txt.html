"Here I go again, whether I, win or looooose" -&gt; Jean Plum
             "... whether I, win or looooose"
{*variations of this sample repeat throughout the song*}

[Havoc]
Another day another dollar it's about gettin money
Then you can give me a holla, my nose runny
I've been out in the cold, hustlin for so long
my hands numb, but bet I feel that paper in my palm

[Prodigy]
It's like ahh shit it's on, time to go shoppin
For cars not fashion, my whips be the bomb
My clothes, be the same shit that we had on
And fuck lookin cute, save that for the broad

[Havoc]
It's the H-A-V-O, C-dump-and-reload
Knock knock, answer that, I'm blastin through the peephole
Body charges, pay lawyers so we beat those
But get locked and I'm sluttin lady C.O.'s

[Prodigy]
And we the only niggaz you know, that fuck they P.O.'s
They push our files to the top, you still on parole
We got, money to roll, no time for penitentiaries
Too much dollars to fold, it's bulgin out our jeans

[Chorus]
"Here I go again, whether I, win or looooose"
[H] But losin ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world
"Here I go again, here I come, win or looooose"
[H] But losin ain't a option girl
My destination is top of the world, top of the world

[Havoc]
Y'all like bitches - the chit-chatterin
Stay not likin a nigga but givin dap to him
Hav' don't change for no chick, and they adapt to him
Never get cool with you niggaz, I end up clappin 'em

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo - federal note fetish, you fuck with my niggaz
Franklin and Grant, get yo' ass blammed with the quickness
Y'all niggaz is finished
You overdosin the world with that cute shit
It's time for this realness

[Havoc]
And here I go again, lettin the mac blow
Slugs bubble up in your stomach like lactose
I'ma date shorty, put it up in her backbone
For real, put it on her like a track I rapped on, f'real

[Prodigy]
Know what?  We outlive labels, and distributors
We run laps around e'ry artist on your payroll
Then hop up in a Range Rov', jet black
with the black rims, killin yo' bitch in her a-hole; uh-oh!

[Chorus]
