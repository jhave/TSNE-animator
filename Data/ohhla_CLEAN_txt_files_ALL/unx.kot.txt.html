D - L O C
D is for the dank I bring
Dash is for the hash being passed
L is for my love, everlast
O is for the outdoor organic
C the confidence in me
Period to let you know that I'm serious
Do you think that you can dig this? YUP!
It's Unexplanetory in another category
I'm down with my girl Ami but that's another story
I rock hemp knot jewelry
If you bet put your money on me
Get ready victory
????????????

Daddy says triple X rated, crash course set
I wanna be sedated, I stay faded
Lay the track up pop a light the king klick sprayed it
Used, bought, and got it and took it home and played it
Say it's unexplainable to us it's outdated
Why I own it I create it trademarked and weighed it
Your left scratchin' your nuts and I still can't explain it
You know I got those hidden indoor plants clonin'
Restricted area no residential zone in
The warehouse district equipped with federal loanin'
FBA got played like six in the morning
DA slippin', ATF snoring
I check my wise before I make a sound
These walls have ears they're spies are all around
Suburban Noize transports pure dope sounds
The feds came through, thought we was moving pounds
Found a bong two pipes and ?? half an ounce
Now bounce!!

Now I be the one stoned off the cloned alien
And you be the one smokin' cest with Les and them
And they be the people gettin' twisted on the rise
And we be the cats supplyin' all the highs
Cuz I like to sit back and vibe, you know the type
Look at the ladies to make me say my my
Catch my eye then I cry I'm that type of guy
My boy Pakelika got that finger that vibrates
Vanac breaks ?? tastes great
No butane wood so for blunts and paps
Pure THC blowin' far and near
You need to break off that joint from behind your ear
Slap it on the stone, let's get stoned
Light up that torch grab some knifes it's on
I see smooth rips we named the smoke shank
And I end it on the beat break

D-Loc says you got to have hope
People say he's kind of dope
D-Loc fishes in his boat
Out smoke him, not really, nope
Peeps promote me coast to coast
Eat bacon eggs and love french toast
Peeps give me good indo
Don't you ever take me for a joke

Now Johnny Richter's gonna take you on lyrical flight
An bring you down to Orange County on a typical night
We'll drink some brews and grab our skates and hit the quarter pipe
I seen the cops goin' left you know I made a right
I pulled the blunt out the tray to get me on my way
A little herb in the lungs and I'm A-OK
Got the krypt get a rip if it's brick get away
We rollin' deep in the bus puffin' skunk by the eighths
