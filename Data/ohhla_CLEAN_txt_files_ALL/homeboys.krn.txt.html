[K-Rino]
Is you my homeboy? Or is you bumping your gums
Would you stay down till we come up or sellout over crumbs?
When it's time to go to war and y'all about to get jumped
Would you stand there wit him, toe to toe, or run like a punk?
If your partner went to jail and had to do about eight
Would you carry the weight and make sure that his family was straight?
If y'all came up on a lick so cool, the Feds couldn't stop it
Would you fake him out or keep it real and split up the profit?
If I make a move and win, would you study my lesson
Or would you start stressing', throwing salt and cursing my blessin'?
You could chunk ya partner one grand, you might give him two
But when you get down and he come up, would he do it for you?
If you meet a fine woman but she likin' ya friend
Are you the type to playa hate or would ya put ya boy in?
If you buddy's girlfriend was trying to give you some play
Would you pass up on that chance or would you smash that day?

[Chorus]
Are you my homeboy? Or is you out to get me?
Yea you talk that hot shit but is you really down wit me
Smilin' in my face walkin' round big chested
All that hard talk soundin' real good till you're tested

[Hook]
Yeah you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really trying to scheme
Some keep it real, some playas straight bumpin'
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something'

[K-Rino]
If I was out there pullin' moves gettin' way out of line
Would you check your boy and get him straight and let me run blind?
Keep in mind conditions cause folks to change over time
What you lookin' for might be somethin' you don't wanna find
You can always aim a couple that was real from the start
But after while start developing some plex in they heart
If it was somethin real throwed off concernin' your friend
Would you sit him down and let him know or just hold it in?
Envy coming from within, that's how it all begins
On the cool you lovin' when I lose and hatin' when I win
I'm knowin' only a few gonna respect this shit
But I spit it 'cause I mentally detect this shit
I dissect fakers who front and try to check my shit
Analyze the situation and perfect my shit
If I got a new car would you smile when you inspect my shit
Or in your mind would you be hoping that I wreck my shit?

[Chorus]
Are you my homeboy? Or is you out to get me?
Yea you talk that hot shit but is you really down wit me
Smilin' in my face walkin' round big chested
All that hard talk soundin' real good till you're tested

[Hook]
Yeah you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really trying to scheme
Some keep it real, some playas straight bumpin'
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something'

[K-Rino]
Never selling your boys out and coming thru in the clutch
Split what you got with your partner even when it ain't that much
Caught up in some deep heat but still you don't dessert them
Telling him something real even when the truth gonna hurt 'em
Quick to help a friend without capping about what you gave
Keeping everything in the family and take his secrets to the grave
No roof over his head you let him chill out at your place
Never say nothing behind his back you won't say to his face
Giving up the game now it's passed along to you
Reading all the snakes, haters, and cakes up out the crew
The police looking for him and you hide 'em in the cut
Cuz real partners never let no drama split 'em up for real

Yea
K-rino keeping it real. We all we got you know what I'm saying?
Us and god so we gotta stick together out here; ain't no love
So we gotta love each other you feel me?

[Chorus]
Are you my homeboy? Or is you out to get me?
Yea you talk that hot shit but is you really down wit me
Smilin' in my face walkin' round big chested
All that hard talk soundin' real good till you're tested

[Hook]
Yeah you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really trying to scheme
Some keep it real, some playas straight bumpin'
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something'</pre>
