[Chorus]
Let me call shortie up
If tonight's the, night then let me know
Hit me up as soon as possible
Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
(AZ) Keep doing this, man
We could do that little bit ya like
You know the one that keeps us up all night
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) Amusing me, huh? Okay

Look, I just landed, your request is granted
I'm in some 2-seater, pumping the best of Janet
Be through in a minute or two, I'm wit the fellas
Bullshiting, trying to finish my brew
But I'm here, it's nice weather, short-sleeve
Ice weather, had on the matins but the nikes was better
Hope you relax and tonight's whatever
Fatal attraction,the life of pleasure
Got bottles of the L-I-Q, champagne a little 'gnac
You can tell I knew, talk to me
The house or the 'telly suite, I need to know
The perception on my celly's weak, batteries low

[Chorus]

If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Hello? Yo
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) Damn
Got it on right here for you baby take it from me
(AZ) Keep on doing this shit, wordup
We could do that little bit ya like
(AZ) Gotta give all this up, man
You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) Crazy
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me

Listen, I need a diva that could roll cheeba
Blow in and out of town on her own leisure
Love shopping, kalhua's when she club hopping
Pretty toes, love the pose when the thug's watching
Play fair, hair done, face clear,
Type of chick any playa wanna take care, she that nice
The truth is that I've been trapped twice
Told her my life, need a wife for me to act right
Or could it be, just me on a hoe spree
Nowadays, live alone and I'm lonely, spreading my wings
A player in prokeds and some jeans, a pioneer
And gettin' slow head is my thing
I'm in the mix, wit the lies come along wit the tricks
Improvise, pretty thighs come along wit the hips
I can't knock it, try it but I can't stop it
It's in my blood, like the same way I love chocolate
And all I hear is

[Chorus]

If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Whoa
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) It's on now
Got it on right here for you baby, take it from me
(AZ) Gotta get away man, gotta leave this alone man
We could do that little bit ya like
(AZ) Can't keep living like this
You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) Just one shortie, one, one
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) That's all I need one, wordup

I'm in my prime wit a lot on my plate, the party life
Clear my mind when I'm out of the states
Feeling relieved, revived when I'm feeling the breeze
I'm at my best when I'm chilling and I'm feeling at ease
Ladies respect
It's hard when I'm backwards balling, playing the field
And a whole lotta ass be calling, nothing is real
Is it wrong 'cuz I'm doing my thing?, pimping if, either or
But I do what you dream
Follow the leader, I've seen what I needed to see
Leave it to me, and believe I'm not easy to g
Don't even try it, so ladies, all together, let's sing it
I know your needs and your wants
And if you want me to bring it, I gotta hear it

[Chorus]

If tonight's the, night then let me know
(AZ) Okay
Hit me up as soon as possible
(AZ) I'ma figure this all out
Got it on for you right here baby, take it from me
(AZ) I don't if I'm getting used
We could do that little bit ya like,
(AZ) Or if I'm using them, I'ma figure this all out though
You know the one that keeps us up all night
(AZ) I'm getting ready to go thru though
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me
(AZ) Try that, you'll find out where you at

(AZ) 
Hold up
Yo dun lemme use your cell for a minute, men, my
Mine's dead man
Getting ready to break out, yeah, try that
I'll see y'all tomorrow, man, wordup
Eyo, save some of that too for tomorrow
We outa here, man, we going to Vegas
Our year, tomorrow

Chorus

If tonight's the, night then let me know
Hit me up as soon as possible
Got it on for you right here baby, take it from me
We could do that little bit ya like
You know the one that keeps us up all night
I'm a little uptight baby, baby take it from me</pre>
