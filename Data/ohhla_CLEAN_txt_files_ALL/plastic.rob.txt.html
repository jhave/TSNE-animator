Yo, Rob Swift, shootin the gift
On the two turntables makin you uplift
Into a burst of enjoyment, his work or employment
is cuttin it up, and completely destroyin it
His hands scratchin faster than your eyes can see
Both sides is he, and even on the SP
He's a hip-hop phenomenon, word is bond
The DJ here to rock it today, and beyond

"His name is.."		"Rob Swift"
	"that is his name" -&gt; Run-D.M.C.
"His name is.."		"Rob Swift"
	"there is the movement of his hands" -&gt; Run-D.M.C.
"His name is.."		"Rob Swift"

[Large Professor]
Don't you know
He's the DJ professional, rockin the show..
