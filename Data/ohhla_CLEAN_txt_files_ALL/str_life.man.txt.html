Yo, sometimes you have to just be a man and apologize to your 
woman, ya star 

The amount of ting whe you put her through 
Rock this! 

When a girl cry cause of you 
Not one ting you can say or do 
Make any man go change his mind 
No matter what you wanna do 
First you find it hard to speak (true) 
Girl straight out make a brother weak 
Killing me softly every time 
And all that I can be 

[Chorus] 
On the street just ballin 
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin 
Brothers keep rollin 
Livin nothing but a street life (street life) 
[Repeat] 

For all the troubles I brought ya 
For all the time that you cried 
Baby for that I apologize (apologize) 
For all the time that I've hurt ya 
For bringing tears to your eye 
Baby for that I apologize (apologize) 
Well I can see it in your eyes 
No telling you no lies 
Girl I did you wrong 
You'll never find another guy 
So this is what we got to do 
Make a family cause it's true 
Girl you are a part of me 
My heart belongs to you 
Cause I can see it in your eyes 
No telling you no lies 
Girl I did you wrong 
You'll never find another guy 
This is what we got to do 
Make a family cause it's true 
Girl you are a part of me 
My heart belongs to you now 

[Chorus] 
On the street just ballin 
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin 
Brothers keep rollin 
Livin nothing but a street life (street life) 
[Repeat] 

Do you understand the feeling when I'm feeling 
When I tell you how I'm feeling 
When I'm feeling that way 
Can't get over how you make everything better girl 
When you are around me you bring joy to my day 
Don't know what I will do without you in my life 
I don't give a damn about what people wanna say 
All I'm saying that (what) 
This is where I'm at (at) 
And I'd do anything to make you stay 

[Chorus] 
On the street just ballin 
Girls have been callin 
Drop top fallin 
Brothers keep rollin 
Livin nothing but a street life (street life) 
[Repeat]</pre>
