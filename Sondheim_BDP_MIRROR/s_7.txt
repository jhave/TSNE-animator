The Internet, The MOO


(from Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach)

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams, 
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.
