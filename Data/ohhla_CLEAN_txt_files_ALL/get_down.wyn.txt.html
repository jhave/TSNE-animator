(Baby and Lil Wayne talking)
Weezy
What up pop. What up pop
Fuck what they heard it's what they need to know nigga
(They sayin C.A.R.T.E.R. yep!)
Ya feel me. Hey nigga we done built this shit from the ground up now homie
Believe that daddy. It ain't no lookin back from here. We too strong

(chorus)
And thats the only way we get down (We get down)
Cause thats the only way we was taught (We was taught)
And everything we got we bought (We bought)
And real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark yea)
And thats the only way we get down (We get down)
And thats the only way we was taught (We was taught)
And everything we got we bought (We bought)
And real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark fuck a law Oh!)
Cause thats the only way we get down

(verse)
I down down a brother we ain't cut from the same cloth you Downy soft
Bullets separate ya body compound a busta
I'ma find ya if ya hidin I'm a bounty hunter
In ya home puttin dick all down ya woman
You come home we in the bedroom countin money
I bring her home and I fuck her on a thousand hundreds
Then I shoot the nasty bitch in the mouth for nothin
I say Birdman Birdman whats good today
We ain't never let them niggaz take our food away
And we recognize real and got a rude awakenin
And woke up together and our life was better
I'm the Cash Money son I never like fa cheddar
Not a rat though hat low Nike is leather
Lil maw twist to get my life together
Ya bitch meet me at the bar and we night together Cut!

(chorus)

(verse)
Throw my weight like Sherman Klump
I gotta hold up my estate like Donald Trump
And I aim kinda straight when it's time to pump
I bring the pump when it's time to punk
Wrapped around my waist like a cumber bun
Dont make a nigga pump (clap clap) you up!
I come in that new thing she threw up
Now yo' bitch ass gotta clean yo' shoe up
I'm rich as fuck and I never blew up
Buisness mug gotta get my loot up
Bet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her
Bet ya ditch get dug you ever step up
One by one I push 'em down fat bullet fat head make a pussy sound
Hard head soft ass make a gushy ground I'm straight from a crooked town
Like that bitch!

(chourus)

(verse)
I give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game
I dead any mane if he said any thing but it's cool as long as nigga paid when he came
And I'm a fool wit the flame and the caine
Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yea
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain
On the chest where the four made a mess yes
I'm still here in the flesh 21 year old legend I'ma live way after my death
I sacrifice whateva thats left
I give ya'll the last of my breath like..(exhales)
Write it down take a picture record a copy
Press pause only way you stop me fucker
I'ma get mine and make you not me
Spit wine at ya face if you watch me Bitch!

(chorus)

And thats the only way we gettin down nigga Cash Money CMB man
You already know we here neva left fuck 'em
See me if you got a problem boy
Im at home all day man. Its not a game
Stunna, whats really good wit 'em we ain't neva let 'em take our food away
Fresh you nasty on this on dawg. Ugh
This one, this is the Carter Beotch!</pre>
