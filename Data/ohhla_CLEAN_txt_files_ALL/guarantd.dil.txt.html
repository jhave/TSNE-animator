"Ah HEY, all--"
"Attention, ladies and gentlemen" *cut and scratched*

[Evidence] (Iriscience)
Expand and Dilate, so by the end of the night
When we put down the mic
Thinkin D-Dilated Peoples brings heat
That's guaranteed heat for sure, a pure mix-ture
Some try to do the same but they style ain't pure
(A carbon copy) That's right Rak it comes out so sloppy
(Plus for from crisp) So I leave you wit this

[Evidence]
Yo to me it don't matter how dope you write or look
MC's without a voice should write a book
You heard me properly, claimin that shit you didn't, oh really?
My crew's more dedicated than Rocky training in Philly
Put your gloves on, about to get more than can withstand
The comp they left baffled coffee shops in Amsterdam
I never got redemption from an honorable mention
So my lyrics hug the beat wit the tightest suspension (watch out)
Don't fear on turns, of course floor the corners
Yo, that's my drive, got tracks like beehives
You can't pass my gate, a great mistake, you paid the cost
You bigger than me? You screaming "Shorty No Mas"
Yo, some think I'm clever
Others think I'm the one who makes too many references to weather/whether...
Or not I'm feelin this beyond words explain
Yo you set up a battle outdoors and pray for rain

"Attention ladies and gentlemen" *cut and scratched*

When we put down the mic
Thinkin D-Dilated Peoples brings heat
That's guaranteed heat for sure, a pure mix-ture
Some try to do the same but they style ain't pure
A carbon copy (That's right Ev, it comes out so sloppy)
Plus far from crisp (So I leave you wit this)

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo you speak like who you hang wit
And piece like who you paint wit
Everything is merging, no matter who you bank wit
Imagery battle hymns, political poetry
Platform show, by now maybe you know
Who don't scheme, but knows more lines than coke fiends
Closing dark plates, it's hot and smoking
Sneaky green slow flow, thought provoking
Leaves mics, turntables and stages broken
Dilated y'all, Irisciece y'all wide awake
Babu revolve while Rakka rocks the break
Revolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn
Next time other neighborhoods are liable to burn
Toys meet the same fate steppin in range
Ain't your folks hollering at you 'bout playin wit flame?
Can't be contained, front row's insane
Alchemist load the track, Irisci bullet train

"Attention ladies and gentlemen"

That's guaranteed heat for sure, a pure mix-ture
Some try to do the same but they style ain't pure
(A carbon copy) That's right Rak it comes out so sloppy
Plus far from crisp (Babs leave em wit this)

*DJ Babu scratching*

"Can we do it again" 2x
"My goodness" "Ladies and gentlemen"
"Babu's on one's and two's"
"HEY"</pre>
