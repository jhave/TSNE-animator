[Sess]
Oh my God..
What's going on?
Oh no...

Oh why, did I try, to take that whole quarter-pound of philablue psilocybin?
Now, I've been trippin' for about ninety-six hours
I devoured the whole bag 
and I feel I'm about to gag
And to the porcelain goddess
Honestly, my eyes are swollen red
I took four gallons of OJ to the head
Now I'm more than half dead
More like ho dead, undead walkin zombie banshee
Antsy from all these vital ticks and twitches
Wishes of new visuals
An individual light streams to stop they crews
And all these creams and blues
and mabs, guavas, lime greens
I've seen less strange things in a scream kaleidoscope
I've tried to cope with the trips, but it just makes it worse
Cause if ya try to concentrate you envision yourself up in a hearse
Or even worse, insects crawling in swarms it's a riot
The ceilings melting at the Hyatt
Why don't you try it...
Why don't you try it...

[Slug]
I took the advice gobbled heads and stems
Swallowed vitamin-C grapefruit liquid just to cleans
My phlegm it's been half an hour since I ate 'em
I still can't lose the aftertaste from the bloomers
Tell me why did I take 'em
My man told me I would dig 'em
Asked me to roll with em I did 'em
Now I'm a victim
Stomach getting sick from the tightness
It's like a vice grips, aaaahhh, why do you like this?
Somebody turn on the lightswitch, aaaahhh
How'd you talk slug into fucking with this drug
Shit's stuck between my teeth
And I'm breakin nuts anticipating the buzz
And then the hot flash hit like the sun
Honestly, I wanted to be done
My man promised me it would be fun
Did I eat too many? Did I jump in too fast?
How long's this shit last?
Everyone take off ya mask, I lost my grasp
I don't mean to eat and run on the 16th pound
But fuck that, I'm outta here
Barefoot, January, Lake street, eastbound
...Why don't you try it?

Using our 21th century, uh, concepts
we would say he'd either was demented or schizophrenic.
Uh, he has clearly the symptoms of a delirious state.
There's a great disturbance of affects including fear and rage.
He has intimate periods of being incoherent and irrational and he hallucinates, uh,
he has loosen intervals.
...He misidentifies people around him,
he even has moments of being uncertain about himself.
As his characteristic of delirium, uh..
It's associated with fever
he lapses, then, into a deep sleep which he recovers with a 
apparent return of irrational faculties.
