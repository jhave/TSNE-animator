[Chorus]
(Def Squad) (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

[Erick Sermon]
Who the fuck, am I, fuel to the fire
You washed up niggaz should be thrown in the dryer
And in due time I'll pull your cover
And then you'll suffer, you foul motherfucker
You baldheaded sucker, your body full of blubber
You only got here 'cause moms popped the rubber
I got your number, and I don't care who you get
My click is sick, y'all can all lay under
And nigga you old, I don't wanna go
to a all-time low with your kids screamin' (NO!)
You a liar, you're stingy and phony too
That's why your people in your own hood hate you
And niggaz try to comb out my wig
I split 'em wide, it's all outdoors like zig-zag-zig
To whom it may be concernin', the crew is Def Squad
and I'm the Green Eyed Bandit, Erick Sermon

[Chorus]
You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

[Keith Murray]
And I just love when a nigga try to pop that shit
I dare a nigga ever try to challenge my intelligence
Your flow is irrelevant, I'm fresh, that's evident
My 360's sick, I call 'em Seabiscuit's
Check his vocabulary, listen to his flow
He sayin' things that I said seven years ago
And it ain't about how many niggaz you got
It's about who drove first and who get popped
I'm a chip off the old block, hip off the old hop
Clip out the gold glock, pimp out the whole spot
Sell out the whole stock - stop sleepin' on me
motherfuckers, wake up, last stop
And I don't play games, y'all dudes is Tetris
I'll kill MC's over Instant Message
I got it, I'll front it, you want it, come and get it
You know I don't care, I'm with it, 'cause I live it

[Chorus]
You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (Gilla House)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body

[Redman]
Yo, I'll rock backyard to backyard
A fat broad to the snack bar
I'll shut down another rap star
My arm like Terry Bradshaw
Out in Cali they jungle talk like Madagascar
Redman raw, still here nigga
more Fresh than the Prince in Bel-Air nigga
like O.D.B. I take welfare nigga
Rob the mailman, shit, hell yeah nigga
The strong move silent, laws to adopt to
But in Brick City, the silent get shot too
You gonna stop who? It's Redman
I plan to stick around like a Spiderman costume
L.O.D., somebody woke the ape up
So I'ma ride for 2 Tek and A-Plus
Def Squad niggaz whoop yo' ass
Fuck a punchline, my shit is hook and jab
Bitch!

[Chorus]
You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (L.O.D.)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (Gilla House)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body
You know what it is (Def Squad)
You know what it is (hoody-hoo!)
Yo, you ain't nobody, body, body</pre>
