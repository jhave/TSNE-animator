[Black Rob]
Yo, yo
Nobody knew where he came from, or got his name from
All we know is he killed Keith with the same gun
He used on Terrell, Tone from outta jail 
Now he we livin and makin a lotta mil
Watch that cat, send thugs to stop that cat
But niggas like him always got the gat
Gotta take 'em off, gotta play them all real soon
Call them hoes we hit in Cancoon, get them a room
At the Radison over Madison
I'm imaginin somewhere down the line Im'a have to use my gat again
I'm alright with stayin up all night
And puffin dark chocolate trees til the dark turns light
That nigga seen us, you actin like there's no beef between us
Act like, he ain't got cream swayin the dope fiends around the co'na
You ?fucked my man? he got me on'na
Whole 'notha level, money grippa's a gonna'

Chorus [Black Rob &amp; Cee-Lo]

Aiyyo, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us
Actin like they wanna do som'thin to us
Cee-Lo, Black Rob just can't be touched
I'll negotiate the matter in gats he trust
In the club one night, war spittin at us
In the corner sippin drinks on some real hush hush
Yeah, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us
Aiyyo, I seen how them niggas be lookin' at us

[Black Rob]
Made them hoes approach duke on some "How ya doin shit"
Small talk made 'em walk out, thinkin with his *Silence* (Sho' man)
Just like I thought, he about to get caught
They goin all out in the backseat suckin 'em off
Cee-Lo, stay close dogg, we ain't tryin to lose 'em (Alright)
Only thing on my dome is what I'm gon' do to 'em
He killed Keith, I knew that playa since he was small
When he used to ball, and mess with Polly down the hall
Now he ghost, and this crab niggas to blame
Gotta ?fuck him? with his name, Im'a put in his brain
But slow down, he's pullin over, park right behind that Nova
If duke wake up, put 36 in his Rover, cut the motor
He tryin to draw attention to us
This ain't the time baby boy, this is about to blow up
Syncronize ya Rol' up, we got one minute to rock it
Murder's a hard job, but somebodies gotta stop it

Chours

[Cee-Lo]
Just off the plane on a New York vacation 'ang
Come on, lets get gone, nigga its on a gang
Swervin in the rain, and workin the woodgrain
We did about two ?????next lane?
Now feel the pain 
And if its affectin you it involves me in it
And its all great 'cause I get on a niggas ass in a minute
We've established innocence, this Benz ain't rigged
Its easy, accelerate and make those twenties rotate
Even the corner cowboy ??? hennesy straight
Satisfaction, in the midst of all the interaction
I sense tension, here 
and some nigga over there's givin us his undivided attention
Aiyyo Rob yo, is that this nigga (Who?)
Is that this nigga that been 'round here fuckin with'choo?
Want you want me to do?
Who you want me to run over, and run through?
With my gun drew, and unleash my wrath upon you
We can battle, but nigga, but pay for the bad news is true
This nigga done did somethin that he can't undo
And anybody who came here with him deserves one too
Is it true fuckin up my good clothes on you, scandalous hoes
I suppose these bullet holes make ya widow keep the casket closed
How you kids gonna get gay back to you, thats how it goes
Cee-Lo, Black Rob, Goodie Mob, Bad Boy, down south
Up top it gon' stop
