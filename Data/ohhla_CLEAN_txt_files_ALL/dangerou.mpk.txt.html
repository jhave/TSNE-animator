[M. Pokora]
She's got an appetite that won't stop (Yeah!)
The way that she's dancing should be against the law (Yeah!)
She likes to show off party
Her body act like the life for a party
And make it hard for you to keep her
And it's just a matter of time (Yeah!)
For it starts to play with your mind (Come On)
She's supersonic and her eyes are so hypnotic
I used to think that she was innocent, girl.

[M. Pokora]
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous

[M. Pokora]
She'll do anything for a good time (Yeah Oh!)
She'll break your back it sounds like last time (Yeah Oh!)
She's so exotic and it's so amazing
She's the perfect girl for any occasion
And it's just a matter of time (Yeah!)
For she starts to play with your mind (Come On)
That girl is evil and her love should be illegal
You'll get to close her fear all ... wanna be her

[M. Pokora]
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous

[Sebastian]
(Oh here she comes)
Acting all sophisticated
So new like you can't upgrade it
Can't hate it
And and and and
(Oh here she comes)
With the diamonds all in her ear lobe
Bluetooth all in her hear hole
Check how the story unfolds
You in VIP and she's scheming up a plot
You pushing up them bottles and she pushin up her top
She gives you little stares as you rubbin thru her hair then
She shake her derriere
And and and and (Come On)
You just thinking the draws might drop
Well I'm just thinkin' she's counting out your knot
You feeling on your shirt pockets like you've been shot but
You really been got
Let's rock

[M. Pokora]
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous
She's got the passion
That girl is dangerous
Better be careful
That girl is dangerous
Beautiful Hard way
That girl is dangerous
She's dangerous, dangerous</pre>
