[Chorus]
"Hardcore.. to make the brothers act fools" {*4X*}

[Parrish Smith]
When I turn the party out, all hands is in the air
Some say it's chill, New York throw chairs
It's the punk funk sound to make a sane man flip
Girls rush the stage, faggots cold dip
low, to avoid the caps and blows
By the gangbangers, at the b-boy shows
where the cops, try to control the crowd
But they can't, system's cranked, "So Wat Cha Sayin"'s pumpin loud
Blows are thrown, heads are flown like Pan-Am
Brothers lickin off like the Son of Sam and
The bass, continues to thump
Some brothers hit the parkin lot, to go pop trunks
Hoes are slapped, jewels are snatched
Brothers are caught in the crossfire without no caps
And on my way out, I heard a sucker scream and shout
{AHHH! NIGGAZ!} "Niggaz," yeah cold turn the party out

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
Rap combat is where it's at and I attack
any crab MC, that's down with the wack
And I wreck, and if I can I snap a neck
Throw a knockout blow, and look for a tech
I'm terror, new edition to rap era
I can't be beat, I'm too sweet plus clever
I'm smart, yes, I'm a so called genius
I'm equipped with the thinkin cap they call keenness
And yo, with that, I can break fool
Especially when the posse is thick and got tools
Makes me feel good cause they got steel
No blasters or cap guns son, the real deal
K-A, microphone wrecker E-D
The O, the U, the B, the L to the E
Rockin on, word is bond, so abandon ship
My name is Erick Sermon now watch out when I flip
I'm far from a chump, I'm hardcore like Brooklyn
Mess with me, and get your manhood took-en

[Chorus]

[Redman]
I got it goin on, since I'm up next to flex
You bet I drop heavy so girls grab your Kotex
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit
And my lip gets to the point, to rip some mo' fly shit
Redman ready to rock rough rhymes
Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack pistol posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman ,who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (YO YO YO!)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea
Cut like Chuckie, plus style is cock-D
Superman Lover, cool from the new school
Hold your breath, while I walk holdin my jewels

[Chorus] - ad lib scratches to fade</pre>
