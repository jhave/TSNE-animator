Chorus: repeat 4X

I represent the hardcore (rough rugged and raw)
The PMD the mic's my only friend

Verse One:

I grab a chorus like my nigga DJ Scratch is on the cut
Hit Squad on live, PMD's like what (what?)
I'm too tough, gettin snuffed all in the cut
  Aiyyo it's diggedy Das whassup higgedy here to fuck it up
  Nuttin move but the green my team be on the shine
  Shiggedy shine like a light, Hit Squad we keep it tight
  I light an L I ring your bells so go tell cuz it's the ill figure
Timberland boots, Rolex, with a Benz
  Diggy Das EFX snap necks with PMD
Bringin the raw so you can see a b-boy is what I be
See I just can't resist this, cause Business is Business
So money mind your business, and shorty keep your distance
I did this once before, hardcore, forever in it
Tryin to win it, thank God for hip-hop, yo Scratch spin it

Chorus 1/2

Verse Two:

Yippie-yi-yay, yippy-yo, it's the, slow-flow mechanic
Mass confusion is crusin just start to panic
and you don't stop, got the Hit Squad backin me
  Aiyyo we riggeddy rock your set
  and I bet you never ever tackle me
  What happened P?
You know what happened B I'm on mission and
lost my other half but I still got my Fisherman
hat, it ain't over til the fat chickenhead catch
wreck
  Aiyyo yo it's diggedy Das EFX
  The sewer rap so iggedy act like you know though
And me the Mic Doc (c'mon) the micraphone's my only
friend, can't even trust nobody
  It goes liggedy-la-di-da-di
  Higgedy hit you with the shotty
So to whom it may concern, from yours truly, no other
My style's butter, that's word to mother, underground gutter
B-boy brother, no singin chords, just rugged
Low budget, thought you was that nigga but you wasn't
  Riggedy rough rugged and raw, straight from the floor
  Fearless like the Four, Zsa Zsa like Gabor
  Babe-Pah, we zonin up the hydro Squad by my side so
All my real heads keep it live represent

Chorus
