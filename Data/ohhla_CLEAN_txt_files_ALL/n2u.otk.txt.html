[Verse One: Big Boi]
Back when I was a freshman
I learned a valuable lesson
A hoe gon be a hoe and
it don't matter about you stressin'
the only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
and only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
evidence and DNA drop down, stainin her dress
she's making a great big one ??? can I get something off your chest?
and that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with john
don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one(one on one)
(uhh)one on one

[Chorus: Khujo Goodie]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
school days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise,
shoulda coulda and wit a uhhh
and that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with john
don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one(one on one)
(uhh)one on one

[Chorus: Khujo Goodie]
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you

[Khujo Goodie &amp; Big Boi]
Ain't talking about commitment, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
Ain't talking about no wedding ring, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
I hope you ain't a gold-diggin biatch, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop
But you a fine lil' sexy thang, shoobie-doobie-doop-doop-dee-doop (uhh)

[OutKast &amp; Khujo Goodie] [2x]
I, I don't want no girlfiend
I just wanna get into (just wanna get into you)

[Chorus] [2x]

[Big Boi]
girl, bye
i.e., get the hell on, I'm through, make me a sandwich, I love you
only at this moment, maybe not tomorrow
kisses, toodles
ah, lil' me</pre>
