Haaa, uuuuggggghhhh 
this is for all the G's ou there 
we bout it, bout it 
and g-ettes, i ain't forget about y'all, uuuugggghhhh 
gold look like this here 

today I have a half an ounce 
tomorrow I'll have a key 
and if you tryin' to get some ice cream 
won't you call me, or won't you beep me 

Looked out the window 
it must be the giggidy first of the month 
cause everybody in the ghetto is smilin' and dressed up 
Little kids havin' fun in my neighborhood 
And fiends walkin' up, talkin' bout its all good 
See I'm a G, ????? I got that 2 for 3 
And y'all a know that I slang, that I-C-E 
And everybody in the ghetto use nicknames 
Like V-90, Master P, Boz, and Big Man 
My little homies posted up 
some hang, hang, and some slangin' 
Others gang bangin' 
I'm tryin' to make it out the hood with this gangsta rap 
And stay TRU to the game, and put the town on the map 
But haters hate me and niggas try to talk shit 
Cause I done made, a dollar out of 15 cents 
On the curb, posted up with them bouldas 
And servin' fiends, A-1 yola 
And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal 
Cause in the ghetto, you got money, you might get killed 
And stayin' TRU to the game, is a part of life 
And if you don't player, you might lose your life 

-chorus- 
Tru 2 da game, Tru 2 da game 
Ain't nothin' changed but my bank account 
I'm still the same 

[Silkk the Shocker] 
Tryin' to have things major, they can't fade me 
cash the chips like casino 
Today I'm a keep it real, and chill, and get blitzed like Marino 
My girl be fussin', she be tussin', constantly buggin' 
Askin' me why I be hustlin' 
I got money to make, so motherfuck it 
I'm a keep it real, if it kills me 
Y'all gonna feel me before I'm done 
Ball till I have it all, I want the whole while 
if not, I don't want none 
Why I hang with the same ol' niggas 
That's what they ask me 
I be like, I'm the same ol' nigga 
But 'stead, right now, I gets my sacks free 
I gots to stay TRU fool, about my motherfuckin' mail 
I'll be a rich ass nigga, y'all gonna be visitin' me in the jail 
I gots to ball, can't fall, gotta have things major 
If you don't believe me, next year round this time 
its Silkk up on his pager (then ask me) 

-chorus- 

[Big Ed] 
Bustas can't see me, they blind 
I claim TRU, I thought you knew 
My foes catch elbows, cause I'm on em like a tattoo 
Man I'm layin' low like the eyes of a danked out china man 
Stayin' gangstafied 
While I'm tryin' to make a million 
But politicians run for office 
They rather me bust a cap in a rat, cause they both gonna try and stop
this 
Gangsta rap is what they call it 
But I gots to come with the realness 
So all my folks can feel this 

-chorus- 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Now I lay me down to sleep 
I pray the Lord that my momma will never weep 
and let her live in peace and stop spendin' a hundred G's up in her sleep 
When will it stop 
I guess when they leave me lyin' on the block 
With tears on my glock 
A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 
I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 
As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 
I know its a shame, things'll never change 
I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 
I'm TRU 2 Da Game 

-chorus- 

[Master P] 
still the same 
Master P, the whole TRU click (y'all gonna feel this) 
TRU to the gizame (tru to da hood) 
money can't change you, it just can make you 
(never forget where i came from) 
No Limit Records, Down South Hustlers (independent black owned) 
and the West Coast Bad Boyz 
and I told y'all, I can drop something anytime I want to 
Y'all done realized by now, the haters done fell off 
Cause they ain't TRU 2 da game 
I could never forget where I came from 
I'm from the ghetto 
But I won't ever change 
Cause I'm TRU 2 da game, believe that 
Keepin' it real, keepin' it real 
Never sell out, can never sell out 
TRU 2 Da Gizame </pre>
