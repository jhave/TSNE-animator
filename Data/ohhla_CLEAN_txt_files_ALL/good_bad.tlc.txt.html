Sunny days
Birds singin' sweet soundin' songs of love
(That's so pretty girl)
As we walk hand in hand
Just kickin' up sand
As the ocean laps at our feet
I'm in your arms
And all of your charms are for me
(It's not for me)
Ha ha ha, jam, check it

1 - 	I need a crump, tight nigga, make seven figures
	Laced with the platinum not the silver shit, nigga
	Exhale cigar, ten inch or bigger
	A "know how to lick it and stick it", whut whut

[T-Boz]
Now don't get me wrong cause I'm not a hoe
But I know what I got you can't handle though
(Cuz what?)
Cause only real niggas (What?)
You don't know
So what you gon' do?
What you gonna do? (wha wha wha)

2 - 	Nigga, you must be crazy
	What you gonna do with a bitch like me
	I'm so good at being bad
	I'm the bitch you never had
	I epitomize the word sexy

	Nigga, you must be crazy
	What you gonna do with a bitch like me
	You're not so tight
	Make you cum all night
	And you can't handle me, baby

[T-Boz]
I love to love ya baby
I love to love ya baby
I yeah, love to love ya baby
Ooooh, love to love ya baby

[T-Boz]
Sorry I turned you out (You out)
I guess I didn't know
That a man could be so soft
Well I guess I have to give you back
The flowers, the candy (What?)
The diamonds (Oh no, not the diamonds)
Oh, hell no, wait a minute...
I'mma keep that (Better keep that girl)
Hope you don't mind
I'm not the mushy kind
(The mushy kind)
(Never been, never will)
Check it

Repeat 1

[T-Boz]
Now don't get me wrong cause I'm not a hoe
But I know what I got you can't handle though
Cause only real niggas (What?)
You don't know, so what you gon' do?
What you gonna do? (wha wha wha)

Repeat 2

[T-Boz]
I love to love ya baby
I love to love ya baby
I yeah, love to love ya baby
Ooooh, love to love ya baby

[T-Boz]
When I'm all alone, I touch myself
And I always dreamed about someone else
Who was so much more than
La, la, la, la, la
A good man is so hard to find

Well actually, a hard man is so good to find
Yo, yeah baby!

[Left Eye]
Uh, I understand you want a tour of what's inside
Bring my safety guide before I take you on this drive
Straight into the center, you enter my dimension
The question is protection, selected in my section
I'm on a quest 
I will not rest 'till I bring you breakfast naked
I'll take you with the batteries and bake it
Cause I gotta get mine and you gotta get yours
But never end it by send it in and shut the door
You must be crazy to think that you can hang with me
I try to escape the imprisonment of the defiance in me
The epitome of your every dream it seems to 'fein
For intangible fantasy, you know what I mean

Repeat 2

Repeat 2

[Boz]
I love to love ya baby
I love to love ya baby
I yeah, love to love ya baby
Ooooh, love to love ya baby

[T-Boz]
Hah hah hah hah hah hah

Watch out there now
You can't handle...
Huh huh
So what'cha gon' do?
What you gonna do with a bitch
A bitch like me nigga, huh
A bitch like me nigga, what?
A bitch like me
A bitch like moi?</pre>
