* Faith No More's Mike Patton wailing *
Ugh, turn me up
  
Now I gotta murder to murder to get away
The eyes can appeal now the fool's gotta pay
And if they ain't paid then they pay it with their life
To watch another man try to hold on to a life
Cos I keep lookin and huntin just like a lion
Let these suckers know that his manhood be dyin
I show no remorse to the source of a taddle
and if they ain't telled then they hope I never battle
Aah keep it comin and comin across the table
And if I miss I never miss to bring the danger
I drink a bit more and then I'm lookin over my shoulder
And I make it seal for sealed, don't make the boulders
But I never rest in rest so never cease
I'll do a motherfucker when he's resting in peace
Cos what they saw they never seen or even heard of
And if they live it's just another body murdered
Another body murdered!
  
* screams *
* Mike Patton wailing *
On the hand, I want it
* blood curdling screams *
  
I'll make ya deal for deals that make a kill
And anyone lookin on'll get that ass killed
I'm living like a criminal and criminal I be
And I'm respected in the hood like a G
But if they think about snitching then they're gone
I'm takin off their heads with the motherfucking chrome
I gotta pay the paid to play to get through
And I ain't through til I'm dumpin on the moon
I see the fool, runnin and runnin but where they goin?
Had the whip in my murder now they knowin
Would they blast or blast or let me pass?
I had to think fast or I was goin in a flash
If I went to sing it longer that'll be my ass
Searchin for these fools while I'm steppin across the grass
Cos they can't hide in hide and that's real
And would you just, whip me wit your eyes gotcha killed
Another body murdered!...
Bang your head to this (Turn me up)
Another body murdered!
  
* Mike Patton wailing *
Aah, Faith No More
I had to get it together to watch a body get murdered, uhh
Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E.
I had to get it together to watch a body get murdered
Bang your head, come on
Bang your head
Bang your head
Bang, your, head, to, this
* blood curdling screams *
  
I see a fool wanna try and test the fool
I get the file that the fool will have to lose
Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. that'll keep it low
Heard a brother that was shout' when my motherfuckin Uzo
Heads are peeled when my head up
Ran and plough some mo' gangsta lives, and then I get up
All these busters on my trail
Wanna get where I'm at but they fail cos they can't bail
I keep bailin
I be slangin my shit ever since they had me jailed in
I need it all about severed top
It's all about bringin down the Earth, observin mine
Another prayers are blasted
You wanna play it by the ring let the Ganxta blast it
All these fools throwin up their sides
They try to test mine, they never get to know why
Now how long, can you last?
When a Ganxta like the Ridd keep smokin that aaaaaaaaaazzzzzz!
Bang your head to this (huh)
  
* Mike Patton wailing *
Turn me up
I had to get it together to watch a body get murdered, huh
* blood curdling screams *
Faith No More
