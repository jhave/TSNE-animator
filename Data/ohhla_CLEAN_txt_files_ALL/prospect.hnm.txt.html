[Mr. Eon]
Mr. E is a top prospect, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Come a little tighter, pull the all-nighter... --The High and The Mighty--
Taste this delicious, mystic malicious
Ridiculousness, I tease like my snippets
I strip this down to the core and explore
Many more want what I have in store
For you, in this era, this mic's still a terror
My scripts consist of printed parchness
I gave the apple to Eve and she ate it
Built the pyramids and the Sphinx, and now you fuckin hate it
Co-create the reborn, keep this mic torn
My defense is tight like Jason Sehorn
On these corn on the cobs, lop for pop, now they popcorn
Plus I got a bucket of em, so stick it to em
Bring ruckus to em, slip the ducats to em
Still they gettin ruined when I bring my touch to em
Can't feel my shit no matter what I say
Though they ass out at Fappy's on the bagel buffet, with no delay
Evidence is a top prospect, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Where the light intense, dope rhymes dispense... --Here go the Evidence--

[Evidence]
--You now tuned into Evidence!--
For more than funs and guns, I'm stressed on gettin sex
Yo I take it as it comes, on most occasions
I like my heart, chimes, and organ
But this is for your heartbeats twelve in the morning
Never tense, I rock the flossy, fly shit from Tchaikovsky
Don't drink so I get bent when I sip Bacardi
Spark this party, no question
Never caught wearin Guess, and
Seldom lose when I got my chips on the table
Go against the Oz, and face the Wizard
So play that evil shit then come short, get the blizzard
Why is it you be buildin worlds that's fake and useless?
Heads pretend they hard, yo their favorite movie's Lukas
Now you're focused like he caught locusts
This style's covered like Rakim's, "I Ain't No Joke," this
flow is out of control like rap in fact
Man I told 'em in the front, in the middle, in the back, it's like that

[Mr. Eon]
Defari is a top prospect, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Give em all high-fives, you don't qualify "Here come's the city brother" -- 
Defari
--DEFARI--

[Defari]
Yo, pass that gallon I'm hear to score again like Marcus Allen
From L.A. this MC stallion
Only a few I know got the bomb chronic like Ev'
Yo, fuck the nonsense, our Likwid eastern conference
And now we do it Coast to Coast like the Liks --The magnificent--
Defari, Eon, and Evidence
The present tense is dope rhymes to the infinite power
Wack MC's fight in the yard, I kill the god that towers
And shoot at will shoot to kill with lyrical skills
Like the Beatnuts, pop the trunk and watch this bitches head for the hills
But in my trunk there's straight bumps like that
And just a licensed NBA Spalding notebook, that looks phat
With phat rhymes and there's pages and pages
This shit's outrageous, independence connect, drop this ??
For wages, blow both indoor and outdoor stages
All ages feel Herut like the flu, this kid's contagious

[Mr. Eon]
We are three top prospects, mic checks get rep, east-west connect
Come to the team with tight defense, Defari, Eon, and Evidence</pre>
