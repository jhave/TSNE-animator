[Ced Gee]
I am dominating, biochemical source
To effect scientific, beats and attitudes
Through my hemispheres, packs and galaxies
Beyond and out of range, far is sent to me
Cause to the left I am blinkin, mega and hype
While absorbing predators, as a scientist
Skilled with medical degrees I combinate
Years on Ampex, experience Ced
Indeed, bioforce parallel MPC
was in-gen-ulity, and ability
I'm the wizard Ced Gee, I'm a scientist!

[Ced Gee]
To DELIVER, such a powerful mic
I'll excite, and I'll also ignite
the crowd to respond to my total formulation
Particular words, designated for a path
that you can sell, a new format combined
And I won't rhyme, but instead I'll refine
the proper use of speech, as I teach
Things physical, change must be rearranged
Passing data of a mode, choosing a code
Kick back the time, then I'll explode
into ATOMS, and the mixture I'll build
Just hammering a mouse, a third, would be evil
to the science, formed expressed by Ced Gee
I'm a scientist!

[Ced Gee]
NOW I'm pickin up speed at a maximum pace
And all nucleus attached, must metriculate
With me the scientist, the man to compel
Against competitors, equal to excel
To a nuclear wave, events and above
all meters, contain precise, the same extended
Opposite to illusion is BASS
There be no confusion
To set my megameters, laboratory stories
I'm gain more glories in all, sorts of categories
To be raised up, a bit
Ced Gee, as an Ultramagnetic, SCIENTIST!
