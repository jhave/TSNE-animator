[Guru]
Yo my girl's heated
cause I told her I was busy workin and I couldn't talk
I told her I'd call her back later and she still got mad
That was all I said, word up

Why she buggin if I promised that I'd call her back
Of course I'm honest plus I'm keepin things all intact
I be stressed out baby, sometimes on my grind
And on my mind, is a paperchase with minimal time
She should know how it goes - I'm, still into her
I got feelings for her, I been caring for her
But really though; I mean she ought to know the deally-yo
Especially if I'm in a meeting or out shooting a video
I love her yo, but I'm just doin my job
Ain't no need for confusion what I'm doin is hard
I'm the type of man, with a serious type of plan
I'm calmer no drama, no need for gettin hyper
and upset with me, because I'm busy a lot
And if I could you know I would, bring her with me a lot
Ain't nuttin wrong word is bond, it's all in her head
I was handling some business, and that's all I said

[Chorus: Macy Gray]
All, I, said.. I'll call you later
Sometimes, I forget
I love you baby don't be.. so upset
I'll call you later is all, I said..

[Guru]
I'm confessin no question yeah I chill with my boys
Still she gotta keep it real, either build or destroy
This is deep right here, she completes my square
Without a doubt, if she needs, I'ma be right there
This world is crazy, she's supposed to help me stay sane
Supposed to help with the pain, supposed to help me maintain
And quote this, I'm focused on the dreams we share
I got her all up in my mix, so it means I care
This job of mine goes on and on, twenty-four hours a day
And with trust we can win, in a powerful way
When I get home, I'm gonna love her down
I'll be like Teddy, get some hot oils, and rub her down
I know she's bored, feels ignored, all by herself alone
and she hates it, when I turn off my cell phone
But it's alright don't wanna fight, it's all in her head
I was takin care of business, and that's all I said

[Chorus]

[unknown singer]
Baby when you're speakin like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you
Baby when you're speakin like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you

[Macy] I think we are ready
[Guru] We're ready as we'll ever be, girl your love is heavenly
[Macy] What we gonna do now
[Guru] We gon' do what we gotta do, I wanna see a lot of you
[Macy] Just you keep it steady
[Guru] I'm steady and secure you couldn't ask for more
[Macy] C'mon let's work it out (aight)
[Macy] Just don't hurt me now (nah baby)

[Chorus] + variations

[unknown singer]
Baby when you're speakin like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you
Baby when you're speakin like that, it makes me ooh
So watch as you hold on to my spine; I'll crush you

[Macy] 
I love you, babyyyy
All, I, said.. all I said.. I forget
I love you baby don't be (so mad) so upset</pre>
