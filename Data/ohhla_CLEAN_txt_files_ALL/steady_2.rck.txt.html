[Peter Gunz]
I started with, 'The New York niggaz got crazy game'
And drove the whole motherfucking world insane
I been rolling with my man P.R. since the C.L. 
This is my favorite rap producer nigga on the DL 
From mount vern to bx flossin in the G.S. 
Switchin lanes tossin made game to your bitch 
Playing the averix? and the Pepe's
No shirt on your girl sweat me and I'ma hit it if she let me
I got my man Pete on the co and that's my dark side 
For y'all niggaz that don't know the red bone player
Niggas in the Bronx call me mayor 
Maybe because they know I never pay her 
Look in your girl phone book it leaves you speechless 
Open my number - instead of Peter reads Peaches
Can't be reached beacause I'm reachless none'll lease this 
A fact that I'm black and breechless money peep this 
Ya see even on my block I got to watch my back 
Because certain sheisty motherfuckers know I'm rolling with Shaq 
And plus I am tall and slim with the joker grin 
I bet ya girl knows nigga who the fuck I am

One two rock the house 
Come on help me turn it out
I'm getting down for mine so get down for yours 
Sending this one out rock steady no doubt

Repeat

[Lord Tariq]
Yo fuck whut them niggaz said there ain't no end to my road 
Of yellow bricks being sold to keep me out of the cold
And it's a pity my lingo causes quakes in New York City
Many cases got acquitted cause my lawyer's far from shitty
Henney rock sippin city block rippin through your vest 
Guess who bring your best crew and your techs too 
Cause i gets much liver Lord Tariq
I'm one of the fiercest 85ers kicks no jiver 
Because I am a survivor and my rhymes are legal tender 
Giving your bitch ass something to remember
So do not return to sender as you enter the Lord's house of prayer 
Bow down and say it M.B.P. because I'm your Money Boss Player
I got mad bonanza money marks franc and yen 
Enough power to take your crew of soldiers flunk 'em in the end
Who you is and where you been nigga frontin on the run 
But it's done I call you son cause you act like one ... Whut

Chorus 2x

[Pete Rock]
Aye yo world premier uptown in riot gear
Hall of fame plus all-star game rap career 
Got the golden gloves all my niggaz show love 
It's Pete Rock y'all same as it ever was 
In the Basement treats and prolific beats 
Hardcore for the streets take no defeats 
My state of the art I demonsrate with heart 
Super rap heroes and legendary parks 
We battle for a name graffiti tag the "a" train 
Rock steady blood flows deep in the veins 
So inject the dope inhale the smoke 
Fine tune ya scope for the great black hope 
Is back on the scene with the ill team 
Open your eyes for hip hop's visine ... Clear va vision

Chorus 2x
