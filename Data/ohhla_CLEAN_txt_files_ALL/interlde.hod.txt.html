Hey! Yes, hey!
Yup - yeah, whassup? Hey! Hey!
Yeah, yup, Hodgy Beats
Umm, yeah B, let's go
Ohh...

You make me feel like the sky so blue
Your eyes so blue, your thighs so beaut'
Your ego is equal to whatever I'm doin
So when I go, then she go, oops I mean we go
Louis Vuitton bags, flesh flannel plaid
Diamonds in my baby ears thanks to her dad
Niggaz say she high maintenance but them niggaz can't manage
When they gotta pay for somethin they start speakin that Spanish
When I take her out to eat I start speakin spinach
Cause I ain't come here to lose girl I came here to win it
I'm not another fish that just came here to swim in
I start with the words cause - that's just the beginning
You haters fall back or get your skull cracked
It's a game of tug of war and I'll make you fall back
Now back to you baby, I must ask one thing
Uhhhhh - will you take this ring?

Yup, yeah, hey~! Hey
Yup... Hodgy Beats
