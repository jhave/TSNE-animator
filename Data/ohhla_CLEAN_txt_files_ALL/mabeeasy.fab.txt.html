[Verse 1]
Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickerin'
Playa like me? every season these chicks have been
Talkin' how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey I need freezers to sitck 'em in
I be's in the keys wit a click of friends
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin
I dont care if a skeezer is thick or thin
It's gon' look like she havin' a seizure I stick it in
Skeos say "can I get the keys to ya six again?"
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kickin' in
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy 
Who spend a G on gucci T's, five for sweats
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's
You thinkin (?) i'm talkin' pivate jets, uh

[Chorus]
I need the cash in my palm, the ice in my charm - ma' be easy
(Watch it, please)
Wanna lean to the side while I cruise in your ride - ma' be easy
(Put down that cheese)
Gotta have a broad wantin' and let me hold somethin' - ma' be easy
(You get nothin' from me)
You get NOTHIN!

[Verse 2]
So the kid never stresses a female
And if you ask where I live they gon' give you
addresses to e-mail
All that cops can suggest is that he sell
How I'm gon' push it unless it's a v-12
From S's to CL's, I request is (?)
In the head rests his t.v's dwell
They heard how many albums I presses for retail
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills 
Gettin Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal
Still dames have been givin me slow neck
And I don't even know what they real names have been
I feel ashamed to spend, 'cause when it comes to knockin' 'em down
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ma you musta had too many weed totes
'Cause I ain't givin' you any C-notes 
I'm all about floatin' on them new skinny speed boats
Hundred and somthin wit two skinny deep throats
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes
No more shoppin' sprees I'm rough wit the ends
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins
I deal wit nothin but tens
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends
Chickens get keys, scuffin the Benz
Cause they wanna lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link longview
(One try) I ain't tryin to put clinks on you
Hope trickin ain'n one of the things you think John do
Cause thats the way you end up wit a drink on you mami

[Chorus]</pre>
