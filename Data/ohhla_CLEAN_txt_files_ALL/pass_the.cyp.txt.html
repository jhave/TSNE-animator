Do you want to get high? 
(YEAH ! ....) 
(Put it in the air...) 

Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Then put in the air 
if you wanna get high 

Spark it up in a circle 
With the kush weed that would hurt you 
If you got the purple we can blaze it 
Either way, The high you scerch? 
You shoulda bought 
Then you know the rules 
before you hit it once 
When you catch my blunt 
you know which way to pass it 
when it comes 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Don't ever pass it on the right 
never ash it on my Nike 
If you sprinkle hash in it 
Just don't let it out your sight 
'Cause if you take it outta sight
Well ya just beggin' for a fight 
Aight! 
Give me a lighter
So why you can't decide 
to ignite it? 
Puff Puff Pass homie! 
Don't just stand and try to hide it 
I smoke a bowl or a spliff 
and uplift my sprits 
then I take a bong hit 
Hit it fuckin' hard 
and clear it 
Hit it with the left hand, 
pass to the next man 
Still the fool is blessed, 
and his weed is from the west 
and you'll never get it done 
your bitin'
you can bet it on your life 
It's 4/20 every night 
Who wanna get high? 
Do you want to get high? (YEAH !....) 

Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
And then put it in the air 
If you wanna get high 

I'm Green Evidence 
On the podium, stands the minister 
I see weed from Cypress trees 
I just finished up 
I'm center stage high, 
Civic center stage dive 
Even summer,winter, spring, 
and fall, ain't the same 
My heads in the clouds 
of smoke then I choke and laugh, 
then toke on the left hand side 
No joke work 
can touch these Los Angeles souls 
We twist herbs up 
The word's a dangerous flow 
(Go!) 
(Only on the left hand...) 
When I smoke 
I'm tilted to the side like a kick stand 
Roll up a rock 
and call me a middle man 
I'm sinkin' a riddle 
like it was quicksand 
One *snort* clear out your nasal passage 
wit the medicine of dristan 
Voila, my mind at ease... 
The Police car (Whoop-Whoop) wanna come find my trees 
Hashish from Iraq 
will make my eyes chinese 
Tearing up the studio 
just tryin' to find my keys (la, la, la, la, la...) 
It's like that ya'll 

Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side (la, la, la, la, la...) 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Only on the left hand side 
Pass the joint on the left hand side 
Then put it in the air 
If you wanna get high 
Do you want to get high? (YEAH !....)</pre>
