[Rock]
Yo, son, let these niggas know, the ruler's back, nigga, stop stop lying
With goons and lots of iron, I pop, shots flying
Anybody try and dying violent, Riker's Island style
Tyrants like sirens crying, and hide, off with your highness
Me, I'm such a don, I'm Don Rocko
Ain't gotta lift a finger, they say you the God, watch holmes
Have niggas at the dinner table with dibs
Playing with your kids and they'll straight San Andreas your crib
It's heinous, it is, it's music to my ears, max blaming
Monster mentality, ya'll niggas got meerkat manners
If you can't for that stand up, and fear gats, man up
All my rapper niggas, yeah yeah, I can't stand up
Fuck outta here, you so sub par, you sub leasing
Subway sandwich eating, sucker type, sucking your teeth
I substitute the subliminal shots
With some shit that sound like a sub woofer when it go RAH RAH!

[Chorus: Rock]
Yeah, tell them niggas that's that dirt right there
Tell 'em watch yourself, you could get hurt right here
All they gotta do is say the word like yeah
Middle fingers in the air, like yeah
Tell 'em niggas that's that dirt right there
But tell them watch yourself, you could get murked right here
It's funny, we so violent but your birds right here
We like yeah, middle fingers in the air, like

[Sean Price]
Yo, right now, I'm in the I don't give a fuck mood
Fuck you, courtesy of Ravishing Ruck Rude
Any nigga I fought, owed me money
Said some wild shit about me, bout to hold these dummies
Word to my mother, thug a thug nigga the fuck out
Smack taste out your face, this is what Ruck bout
Fuck is you bout pa, better be out, pa
Nigga thought about it, left like southpaw
Pay attention to my sobriety
One drink and I'm thinking like Menace II Society
Have niggas pray that nigga, a-racks nigga
Getaway clean Al Green eight-track nigga
So so flows and bozo hoes
I kill 'em all for free like a promo show
My flow is so cold, ho blow ya nose
Soul in the hole, you bowling, catch a hole in your sole, bong!

[Chorus]

[Sean Price]
Yo, I'm the illest nigga that you heard thus far
Worldwide coverage like Russ Pa
Two man wrecking machine, wreck your regime
Grab the, sket from my jean, duke can wet up your team
Listen, I'm the best at it, take a rest, faggot
In the twelve step program, you a meth addict
I be the new chief of the 'Ville
With a gun that'll blow stew beef out your grill, P.

[Rock]
Nigga, I chase niggas down with the pound, click and blaow rounds
You chasing niggas going BOW-CHICKA-WOW-WOW
Homo ass niggas, Omar minus the tough shit
Just a snitchin', and suckin' dick and dick in the butt shit
Ill, I ain't the nigga you owing dope, pay him his ones
I'm Count Rockula, take it in blood
Nigga I'm so dirty, huh, rest in peace to Ol' Dirty
Niggas can't cheat me, but your hoe can jerk me
