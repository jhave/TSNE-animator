[Mystikal talking]
Nigga you think you know me
Think you know me nigga
Nigga you don't know me
Nigga you don't know 
You don't know nothing bout me
You gon' find what you wasn't looking for

Chorus
Watch me or throw it off I ain't right
Bitch I do something same rap game
Murder I just might bring it on cause it's gon' be some shit tonight x1

[Kane &amp; Abel]
I heard you niggas wanna start some shit
44 caliber hollow tips in the glock 30 clip
Got them rocks in my pocket rocks on my wrist
Ninety eight six hundred Benz copped from working the night shift
Trying to make a million fo' 22 what I'm trying to do
Little eager too to do what the fuck I gotta do
Flip optimal like an ass crack
Nigga puff puff pas that nigga pass the weed I pass back
Click clack we come strapped
It's fo' sho' nigga lay low tonight
Cause maybe you could just might hit the flow tonight
I did it I said it y'all niggas is hoes
Paramedics trying to save you cutting open your clothes
Nigga you don't wanna go head to head with me
I got some niggas that will paint yo head red with me
Toe to toe with me go to war with me
You could lose yo whole family trying to roll with me

Chorus x1

[Soulja Slim]
Now I know you don't want none of them boys from uptown
Come downtown to yo area until Vietnam
A hard head make a soft ass I thought a nigga told you
Slim speaking on behalf of that wild magnolia
My people gave me the low while I was doing time upstate
Told me a nigga from downtown caught a little uptown fame
That he ain't seen no real nigga yet
But I bet he don't want no drama
Laying with my people and don't give a fuck that somebody shot his shhh
I only fuck bomb killers dope dealers and real niggas
Ill niggas and trill niggas get it how they live niggas
And they thought they roam uptown for the doo doo brown
Better get face down on the ground when a nigga tie yo legs down
See that's the heart of New Orleans
Ask another nigga from another city about his 3rd 
I bet they tell you that the water quick reserve
Leaving and stanking on the curve that's what they heard
They got a hell of a nerve to mail mack in the Calliope  
All the way to the 10th left turn 13th 
the third time you in the city of how to grow

Chorus x2

[Mystikal]
Bitch I'll do you something
You thinkin if I cut you in yo motherfucking head it ain't gon' do shit
Bitch this ain't no bluffing
Thinkin all these niggas and these weapons ain't bout no busting
Time to get wit cha we coming to get cha
If I hit you where yo dick at it's gon' come out where you shit at
My murder weapon knows best
If you ain't got no vest it's gon' get protest
We making noise all day
I'm trying to tell em' but these bitches got to learn the hard way
Pistol play warned from the hallway
AK spray now yo ass all taint
Bitch I'll do you something

[Silkk The Shocker]
And I gotta do em' something too
They fucked up and fucked around with the wrong ass crew
Now I'm gon' come up from short in a house full of loaded tanks
Cup of canned soda for a picnic cup of canned soda for dank
See we no limit niggas so drama we bout that there
You doubt that there
That's why when I'm hanging out it's gon' be out right there
That's where niggas think our slugs at
Trying to hang where I slang my drugs at
Fuck it all the niggas that make mill stay real 
And how y'all fucking love that
See I'm a gangsta and plus a nigga cold wit it
Ain't scared of no nigga
You left some pots and some boards and them drama boys said go get em'
Step out the project post talking bout wooh nigga
I got a little of few dollars I'm trying to get a little bit mo' nigga
If it's gold fo' sho' nigga
Cook I stay high like a rocket can't stop it until I get away from yo 
Pocket like a gold digger
Ain't nothing but a five o four nigga
When they enter putting bodies in bags and tagging cold niggas
Better get yo mind right cause bitch this some real life 
Man tell these niggas

[Mystikal]
Watch me or throw it off I ain't right
