[Missy]
Yo yo yo yo
Wah wah wah
Yea yo yo
Wah wah wah wah 
Wah wah wah wah (uh huh)
Yo yo 
Wah wah wah 

[Kelly - Verse One]
I trusted her, my home girl from school (yea yea)
Introduced her to my man, they became cool (uh)
She told me that, that he loved me so (wah wah wah wah)
I shoulda known she liked him all along (yo)
They were

[CHORUS]
Talking on the phone (talking on the phone)
Gotta get your own (you gotta get your own man)
Leave my man alone (and leave my man alone)
Callin' him on the phone 

[Kelly - Verse Two]
Don't hate a girl, cuz they too slick
They smile in my face, all on my man's (ohh...ficky ficky)
You don't know what, what I've been through
I get it first, then I do it
You

[Repeat CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
Daaaa, da da (yo yo yo)
Daaaa, da da
Da da, da da (yo yo yo)
Daaaa, da da
Daaaa, da da (yo yo yo)
Daaaa, da da (yo yo yo yo)
Da da, da da (ficky ficky)

[Missy]
Ficky ficky ficky
S-U-P-A Fly, I'm cute
I, keep yall bitches, chicken like soup
What yall wan' do, I'm not that chick to talk shit
Nor I'm that chick to fuck wit'
Did you hear this?
Did you get this?
Watch Missy flip like an acrobatic
My automatic
Tongue tactic
Flows like this
Be the muthafuckin' shit
(shit echoes)

[Alien voice]
What I need right now
Is for yall
You and Kelly
I need for yall to
To come meet me in space
Now could yall sing that for me again
That first verse

[Kelly]
I trusted her, my home girl from school (yea yea)
Introduced her to my man, they became cool (uh)
She told me that, that he loved me so (wah wah wah wah)
I shoulda known she liked him all along (yo)
They were

[Repeat CHORUS]

[Alien voice]
How do yall like space? (wah wah wah wah)
Can you dig it?
Now if you like space for all my martian people out there
I need all yall to put yalls hand up
If you can feel me
So I need Kelly to sing the second verse for me

[Kelly]
Don't hate a girl, cuz they too slick
They smile in my face, all on my man's (ohh...ficky ficky)
You don't know what, what I've been through
I get it first, then I do it (what she doin' girl)
You

Talking on the phone (say what)
Ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you feel it)
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (say what, yea)
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-talking on the phone (yea, say what, yo yo yo yo yo)
Talking on the phone (I'm feeling quite good right now)
Talking on the phone (but it's time for me to take my spaceship to another
level)
Talking on the phone (cuz right now I dont think the world is ready for
Timbaland)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I'm on that next level, can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you dig it)
Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I don't think so)
