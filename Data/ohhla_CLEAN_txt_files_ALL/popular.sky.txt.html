[Intro - Skyzoo - talking]
(Come on, come on)
Uh, yeah (S-K-Y-Z-O-O)
Uh, yeah (S-K-Y-Z-O-O)
This the album I'm talkin about right here Nottz (S-K-Y-Z-O-O)
I can't be stopped with a knock like this family (come on, come on)
Hey, now how popular are you?
(Huh), now how popular are you, now?
(Let me show 'em how popular I am)
Now how popular are you, now?
(Let me stretch out on it a little bit, yo)
Now, now how popular are you, huh?

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
My popularity level's through the roof homie
And I ain't braggin, I'm just expressin the truth homie
And I could back it, if you lookin for some proof homie
Like what it do homie, now what it do homie (come on, come on)
Fresh up out the hallway, I deserve a strong J
I made it thus far, not a scratch on me
They say I'm somethin true, I say I'm somethin true
And when they get it, they tag along as somethin new (come on, come on)
Ever since the two door, I've been on my move on
Name got legs, yeah my popular done grew some
Ain't a soul better than, flower with the letterin
Know as one fly, yeah I ride where the propellers is (come on, come on)
Pen game proper, my pen game proper
I push it where they need it, if you need it, come and holla
First time's free, no boggers on the two
I'm right with the elite, now how popular are you, huh? (come on, come on)

[Chorus - Skyzoo] - w/ ad libs
My popularity is sky high (sky high)
The most popular of all when I ride by (ride by)
The most popular of all when I ride by (ride by)
I mean it's sky high (hey), I mean it's sky high (hey)
And hey, hey, now how popular are you?
Now, now, now how popular are you?
Now, now, now how popular are you?
Now, now, now how popular are you, huh? (come on, come on)

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
My popularity level's through the roof baby
And I ain't braggin, I'm just expressin the truth baby
And I'm exactly where it is that you should move baby
Like what it do baby, now what it do baby (come on, come on)
Fresh out the box, I'm like Kane with a fitted
The best on a knock and I ain't change nothin with it (nah, nah)
As far as the following, I don't need it, tell 'em that they could keep it
I'm one of one and I ain't the type for all the repeatin (come on, come on)
I took the line they was bitchin 'bout, showed 'em all the ins and outs
Tightrope walked it, I treat it likes it's in a drought
Baby girl listen (listen), you dealin with a difference (difference)
I told you on the move when I moved in the beginning (come on, come on)
I put the words on your lips and you could speak 'em again
I throw words off the hips like Akeelah and them
I'm from the 718 and if everyone's great
Then that means I'm right in line for whoever wanna wait, you get it? 
(come on, come on)

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs

[Break - Skyzoo] - 2X
The most popular to land on the scene
And the land from the G is so mean
If you know me, you know I get it, ah, ah, I get it
And can't nobody get it like me, ah, ah, yeah (come on, come on)

[Chorus]

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Yeah (popular are you, now, now?), uh huh
How popular are you baby?
(Popular are you, now, now?)
I mean my popularity's straight
(Popular are you, now, now?)
Uh huh and they call me S-K-Y-Z-O-O
(Popular are you, now, now?)
S-K-Y-Z-O-O
(Popular are you, now, now?)
Nottz raw on the boards
(Popular are you, now, now?)
A Dog
(Popular are you? Come on, come on)</pre>
