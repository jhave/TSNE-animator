Typed by: JuwenLong@aol.com

Baby, bounce to my rhythm, I be radiatin' static
With toys in my attic, styles automatic 
I love'em Asiatic, Japanese and Puerto Rican 
Every time I start speakin', I wind up freakin' 
Some little fleusy naked in my jacuzzi
If ya think I'm not choosy than the joke's on you
You want the 411, baby here's my style 
I like'em young but I'm no freakin' pedophile
I'm known to set it wild, young girls get creamy 
Swing'em through the morn and the Ev will get steamy
You can't see me, I play the set low 
Scrapin' on the bottom, smokin' L's if I got'em 
And I ain't too proud to beg for your leg 
Let me push up in the thighs, I'll fertilize your egg 
Let me make your nature rise along with your blood pressure
Strip you down bare, lay your things on the dresser 
While the children of the lesser, go out and play the hard rock role 
Girl, I stay rock hard 

Chorus 2X:
So if I get mine, you'll get yours 
And we can take it to the wild side behind closed doors 
Rip off your stockings and drop your drawers 
We can take it to the wild side behind closed doors

Ah baby, can't you feel it, deep down inside ya 
I can't hide the fact I wanna ride ya
Body up and down and then back and forth 
Kind of like Aaliyah, girl, I wanna see ya
Oh, you look good, honey bun, I can't fake it 
And word is bond I just got to get you naked 
And once you're naked I'm a lick your skin 
Then touch you in spots that ain't nobody else been
I'll kiss you down there when you're bare 
And I swear that I'll do it right 
I'll make it last all night 
But don't put up a fight 
'Cause I ain't Macho Man Randy
I'm not a Savage, I just want some candy 
And it's, fine and dandy if you need some time 
But let me know whatcha think and, sugar, ease my mind 
Let me know where I stand, come take my hand 
Give me a hug, then lay me down on the rug
