[Verse 1: Chris Webby]
Got the sun in the sky, roll my windows down
Bass turned up, that shit surround sound
I'm a dog, rollin' with a fox-like hound
And another blunt wrap, wheels spinnin' on the ground
Cruisin', I don't give a fuck where I'm headed
Gas tank full to the brim, unleaded
Fast lane flow so these cops can't catch it
Was that my exit? Nah, fuck it, forget it
I-95, no traffic dude
With my pedal to the floor, too fast for you
Break down lane, straight passin' you
I got a need for speed, it's what I have to do
Every street ahead of me is paved in gold
EZ pass and I'm out, never paid a toll
Sun roof down with an eighth to blow
Not givin' one fuck which way I go

[Chorus]
Anyone could see the road that they walked on
Is paved in gold
And it's always summer
They'll never get cold
They'll never get hungry
They'll never get old and gray
You can see their shadows
Wandering off somewhere
They won't make it home
But they really don't care
They wanted the highway
They're happier there today
Today

[Verse 2: Chris Webby]
On a road, this is how I live my life
No turn signal, swerve to the right
Where I'm headed, never gotta windshield wipe
Not a cloud in the sky cause the weather's too nice
The sun does nothin' but shine
Ain't nobody got a watch, no need for time
I got my seat reclined, and I never see a reason why
You go back to anything you leave behind
Lightin' up a cigarette, ash out the window
Shades on my face with my fitted hat, brim low
On my way to a place I've never been, yo
Stompin' on the pedal with my size 10 Timbos
Speed hittin' over a buck
No flashin' lights I just can't be touched
Trust, I'mma be livin' it up
Destination unknown not givin' a fuck

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know, I know
I'mma be travelin' straight on this road of gold
Never knowin' where the fuck I'm gonna go, but yo
I know that I'mma find my way

[Verse 3: Chris Webby]
No complainin', better stop that bitchin'
Get on the road, and drive and start livin'
Tomorrow ain't promisin', enjoy what you're given
Reach for the stars, enough you can't miss 'em
Follow my lead as I rip those beats
And you'll get where you're goin' when you hit those streets
Livin' life like Gran Turismo 3
I'm just gettin' where I feel I gotta be
Ha !

[Chorus]</pre>
