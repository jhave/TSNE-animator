Yo Nod
What's up B-lo?
Hey man, niggaz tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
and Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the Snypaz?
Man I'm talkin about us and every muh-fuckin body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up comin to you
Snypaz and Do or Die, Rap-A-Lot mafia
From the Chi, here it go like this

[Verse 1]
I went from zip locks and bakin soda
To smokin herb, cookin 'ola
Never lookin overnight success
Cause I want a Rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scence like po-po's
In the four door Chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop Snypaz snap a lot
Puttin down with Rap-A-Lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to Chi

Ain't no success even if you cryin for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dyin for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm takin it
See niggas fakin it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't makin it

Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalkin from the end of my (?) gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the Snypaz (?) knew ya
Stressed out, had me feelin left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since (....?....) to non-believers, overnight

[Chorus:] X 2
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight

[Verse 2]
Livin it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See (?) got a death wish
But Do or Die and Snypaz, represent Chi-Town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doin this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box 
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells gon drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from Rap-A-Lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, Do or Die, pick a piece Snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart
Beuregard this industry from backyards to owin Lexus cars
So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight

[Rock Roc]
I got an american dream of gettin out the ghetto
Runnin out they mails
About the loved ones that said they love me, but didn't care
Do Roc scare? With the fuckin niggas who groundin me
It's Roc on the block, 45 glock cocked
Finna pop these niggas and they drop
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)

A to the muthafuckin K
Runnin through the gateway bustin at the niggas back
Uh, Ooo wee, whip a, nigga, wit his, own gat
Oh snap, you in the business, dump him in the tar
Point blank range, nigga I'm game, do anything
(..?..) , (..?..), hangin out the window
Me and my comrades take a nigga out his shoes
Rule number one, don't get it confused
I'm talkin bout that one three, s-h-o-t
Nine millimeter kill 'em off of me
Make 'em freeze
Kill for my nigga that'll kill for me
Infa, red, lights and bombs leave a bitch, a nigga his arms
Stay alarmed, Vietnam, when I closed caskets
Pimp, lyrical tactics, shit look hectic
When I bomb a bad bitch
1997 niggas, and you can't do it overnight
