Uh-huh, that's right, The Carter 3, come on
Yeah, yeah, walk with me, come go with me
Yeah, it's Lil Weezy baby, hehe
And I'm just lighting up my

La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, yea, yea)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, 1-7, Cash Money, Young Money)

Born in New Orleans, rasied in New Orleans
I will forever remain faithful New Orleans
I thank you New Orleans, thank you Hollygrove
That's been my hood since a snotty nose
I come thru the hood suicidal doors
I used to come thru the hood on the handlebars
Gat in my drawers, money in my pocket
Crack in my jaws, I hope it don't disolve
And you know I'm ducking 5-0 and my moms
Youngin' quick to go off like car alarms
Now the youngin' keep his mind on the parmagean
Them other niggas ain't eating like a Ramadan
Spit the shit that make you feel it in ya chromosomes
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on
Young Carter part 3, I'm the corner store
Eagle Street, keep it going till homies home
And I'm just lighting up my..

La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, yea, yea)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, come on, I'm just lighting up my)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, yea, yea)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (can I kick it?)

Can I kick my story to ya'll? My glory in God
My faith and my flow, I pray that I go where no other rapper has
And when ya rapping as, vivid as I
Ya limit is the sky, so I
Study B.I., I bang Tupac
I hum Aaliya, and Soldier Slim was a leader
Who am I not to follow greatness?
And give these emcees hell like they all athiest
Tell them hating niggas one like they in The Matrix
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets
I'mma keep the paper running like a pair of aces
Used to sport the Gucci bucks, nigga no laces
Stripe polo, five pocket Girbaud
Momma got her tube tied, I'm rocking dolo
I used to have the Starter jacket with the logo
And a hat, myself I had the N.O., that's the Saints nigga

La, la la la la la la, la la la la (yea, yea)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (and I'm just lighting up my)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (you know, you know)
La, la la la la la la, la la la la (Weezy, baby, yea)

It's, Lil Wayne, I'mma shine in the rain
Now nothing gets clear without me signing my name
I'm just, headlining the game, won't quit until I'm
A-roding the game, they riding the bench
They not in the game, I misplaced the key to the lock and chain
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry
It's, "Murder She Wrote" like Angela Lansberry
I remember being small mayne
New toys when my momma win the card game
Got my gifts before Christmas, didn't have to wait for em
I had a 10-speed, a scooter and a skateboard
Haha, then we moved to the suburbs
Me and lil Toya Johnson was lovebirds
Oh man, and I swear I feel born again
I'm in the building like the audience, just lighting up my
