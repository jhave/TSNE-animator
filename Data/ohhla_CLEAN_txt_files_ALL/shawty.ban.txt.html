[Lil Wayne]
And he cain't do this, and he don't do that, that, that
(David David David David Banner Banner)

[Chorus 2X: Lil Wayne]
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
And he cain't do this, and he don't do that
And he cain't do this, and he don't do that

[David Banner]
Shawty say you don't beat it up no mo'
You don't come grab her hair and throw that ass on the flo'
You don't spend no time, you don't stimulate her mind
You don't take her out to eat, and you never treat her kind (kind)
Man... and I ain't even touch her
But another nigga will come through and gon' fuck her (fuck her)
You need to get your mind right
Man go and raise your kids, put a man in they life
Uhh, or I'ma put it in your wife
Man I'm tryin tell you what the broad said last night
"He don't stick it, he don't lick it lick it
He don't take me out to the movies and buy the likkle tickets"

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
I walked in the spot, gal asked me my name
I looked back at her and I said T-Pain
I +Bought Her a Drank+, she said she was a +Stripper+
I'm makin movie money like Will so I tipped her
Now she grabbin on my zipper, you know what happen next
She say you don't listen to her life filled with stress
Word to the wise, go and keep it trill
You know your old lady, she gon' get it how she lives

[Chorus]

[David Banner] + (Lil Wayne)
Now this is for my ladies lookin good in the club
If that nigga ain't shit, girl go and throw it up
(And he cain't do this, and he don't do that)
There's some niggaz like me waitin for ya in the back
Now this is for my ladies lookin good in the club
If that nigga ain't shit, girl go and throw it up
(And he cain't do this, and he don't do that)
There's some niggaz like me waitin for ya in the back

[Chorus]  repeat 1.5X

[Lil Wayne]
Shawty say... {*echoes*}
And he cain't do this, and he don't do that, do that, do that...
