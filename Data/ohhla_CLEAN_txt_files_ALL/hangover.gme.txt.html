Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
Ya'll know what it is.its the purple tape
Shout out to my nigga Raekwon
For puttin out that official shit
And this right here..
Its the hangover [x3] yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
All purple like the wavens hit you with mixtapes till your fuckin' chest cave in
My flow a nightmare, Wes Craven get it? the West craving
My style. I know its been awhile
Nah nigga its been a day since I hit you with that purple tape!
Niggas know my style, movin them tracks out
And "The R.E.D. Album" gunna be worth the wait
Nah, nigga the earth gonn shake
And Rihanna gonn be hopping outta birthday cakes
I'mma trim &amp; top it till these little niggas stop it
Nigga I'm clocking let your G-shock clock it
Just got a Mazzi, took it to the shop, dropped it!
Slide through the hood, three boss side pocket
With my side chick and her hair flip like the old sidekick
The world bumping my shit!

Ohh they think I will make it up here, right [x2]

[Verse 2]
Niggaz like "Game, you did this yesterday?" that's right
Matter of fact, to be exact I did it last night. And I can prove it to ya
The Heat lost to the Nics in Madison Square, nigga I'm like Google to ya
Watch how I do it to ya, I'm the King started my own gang
Shit I'm like Harry Hoover to ya
Nah, matter of fact, Freddie Krueger to ya
This ain't a dream, I'll really put the rougar to ya
Scared how that new shit drop, set up shop
R.E.D. Album gonna drop, them niggas gonn call cotch
Niggas gonna call cops Chuck Taylor in the building
Can't see the goons, they blend in, like chameleons!
Rolling Stones said I'm brilliant hottest mixtape since Wayne dropped No Ceilings
Now I ride round the hood with no ceilings
Everybody in the movies clappin' for the villian!</pre>
