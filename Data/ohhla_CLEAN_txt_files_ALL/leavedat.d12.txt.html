[Chorus - Eminem]
Y'all better leave dat boy alone, cause if they don't
Y'all know he gon' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't durr get dat dere boy goin
I said leave dat boy alone, cause y'all don't know him
Dat dere boy he out cold
And dat dere boy he been known
To stir some shit up when he in that zone

[Bridge - Eminem]
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Cause you don't want to get dat boy goin
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Better leave dat boy alone
Cause you don't want to get dat boy goin

[Verse 1 - Swift]
It's my attitude that's makin me bust shit, I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wastin they time tryin to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Returnin bows 'fore you be lookin at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they hunted and they sad
Got 'em mad cause they shittin through their stomach in a bag
We comin too strong so it's irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancin
Comin near us is the worst mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle, I'm pullin you in
I gaurantee that the world will never see you again

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Kon Artis]
Honest to God I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain somethin to ya, a real street nigga
Ain't tryin to get in the streets, he's tryin to get out, feel me
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some gun hoe punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life for a cause
Y'all niggas dyin over pride just to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I dont play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's wrong that you hoes thinkin you can't really get sleep
Cause you laid a nigga down without any meat
My conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vein
I'm a mayne I do my biddin and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Ave forever

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Kuniva]
Now people know I live triflin I express it through writin
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fightin
And I just bought me a gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast people think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted new {???}
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you wilin
Cause as soon as you drivin I'm a spit a few five ones
And I love to kunive son, and you let the live run
I know how to hide guns, skinny or wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You lookin for hoes, and up in here you goin find none
You niggas done tryed once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stuck till your eyes shut
No time for the wild ones, I'm writin these five words
"Fuck you dick ridin' niggas" count it, it's five words

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
