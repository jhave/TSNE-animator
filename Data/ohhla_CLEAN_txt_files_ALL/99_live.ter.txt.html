Prospecto
Follow me here now

[ CHORUS ]
	Throw your hands up
	My live niggas in the cut, put your triggers up
	If you got love say, "Nigga, nigga what"
	(Nigga what) Like you don't give a fuck
	Bitches playin niggas just to get a buck
	Get a buck (Yeah, we hit em up)			(2x)

[ VERSE 1: Prospect ]
Yo, it's the P-r-o-s-p-e-c-t
I'm a thug you can't ph.d. me
Catch me in the back of the club switchin it up
Type of nigga to get drunk and piss in your cup
Listen up to what it is, know a lotta mamis lovin the triz
And some, they tryin to pull it off right in front of the kids
Before I think about coming to cribs
I be lugging my glitz so big, on the waist it be rubbing my ribs
It's very dangerous fuckin with this
I been doublin chips holdin my own with the chrome double-grips
Up in the mix, caught a couple of vics
When I used to fight, but I ain't been scufflin since
This is as tough as it gets, never leave nothin with prints
Or you get blast and you're chopped up and stuffed in the fridge
They not playin me, I perfected this game from A to Z
The ones I don't know will need ropes to hands and knees

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 2: Prospect ]
This shit'll never stop, as long as I live, I'ma forever rock
And stop niggas right where they standin when the baretta pop
My moms said I better not, but knew I had to
I said, "I'm bustin mines, and ain't nobody movin at you"
She laughed too, like I was jokin, when I'm chrome-totin
I have a nigga in his home hopin I don't blow his dome open
I stay stoned, smokin while I'm on the low, I'm copin
A cool guy, but at times you catch me Tone-Locin
Been through a lotta shit, but never had a bone broken
It's tragic how I rap shit with my own potion
&gt;From here to Hoboken I was hoppin trains with no token
Now I'm on stage, they say I'm show-boatin
My flow potent, cause it's mixed in raw
Spell it backwards, it's 'war'
The gat spits, you backflip through the door
I kill em all, Terror Squadian style
I only get down with the crown, only partyin wild
Ya heard

[ CHORUS ]

Now everybody from B-K, throw em up
Now everybody from New Jerz, throw em up
Now everybody from Q-B, throw em up
Now everybody from the B-X, throw em up
Now everybody from Staten Island, throw em up
To all my partners from Westside, throw em up
Now everybody from the East Coast, throw em up
If you Dirty like the South, throw em up
You better throw em up

My man Big Pun, hit em up
My man Joey Crack, hit em up
The whole Terror Squad hit em up
The Thoroughbreds, we hit em up
Prospect
'99
It's almost over, baby
Right
