[Intro - Skyzoo - talking] (*sample plays in background*)
Yo ma
You got Statik Selektah, Joell Ortiz, Talib Kweli
And I'm S-K-Y-Z-O-O
And we lookin for some Brooklyn chicks
I mean, let me tell you what one is like

[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
Huh, she's from the borough like me, so she rep the borough like me (uh)
And she somethin thorough like Lee (yeah)
And she type bred, white Air's, white T
Bright hair, tight weave (woo)
Like yeah, I be, with it in the worst way (yeah)
Kind of strung, but I hide it when I work game (yeah)
I know what she about, I knew her all along
Hood chick, good chick, 'til you rub her wrong
Louie shades and some '94 retros
Hova in the iPod, bumpin +So Ghetto+
Scrap? Would never, Fall back? Never
She watched "The Wire" with me, I'm attached forever
And the '718' tatted on her lower back
Is the cherry on top, when I'm throwin into that
And if she open her jaw, roll up a blizz (*hissing*)
And we gone, you know who she is
Bred ma

Statik Selektah
Uh

[Verse 2 - Joell Ortiz]
Now a, when we done we hop in the shower
Sprinkles come out, wrinkle for kickin it like an hour (that's right)
If I argue, she beside me riffin
A great night's a new bootleg and Chinese chicken (come on)
Wears her scarf to the store with pajamas and slippers
Shakin every bit of everything, her momma could give her (ow)
But when we at them red carpet affairs, aw man
My baby break necks like The Honky Tonk Man (woo!)
This is part of God's plan, I see heaven in her eyes
She seen hell inside of mine, when Joell ain't have a dime
Stash packs in her bra, when her baby had to grind
Wanted the Lex, but settled for the navy Avalon
That's my nigga (my nigga) and she don't know how to swim
But if I'm drownin she'll lose her shoes and hop in the river
Other ladies? Naw, they not in the picture
Well I'm lyin, but look when I'm done wildin, watch the rock I'm a give her

[Chorus]

[Talib Kweli - talking behind Chorus]

And you, and you, and you, and you
Uh, I see you walkin down the street pretty fast 
Like you, and you, and you, yeah

From Robin to Chyna, Teresa to Tracy (haha)
From Lisi, Emanny, Cynthia, Cita and Stacy (she had a fat ass)
Word, I love a hood chick, to me that's a good chick (hey)
You know the one's who was used to oil to cook with (hey)
She get you hooked with the sex, 'til you look sick
Scratches on your back, leave the welts like a good whip (wapsst)
I love the earrings, door knockers on the eighties, yeah
Sway back strut, cause she such a fuckin lady, yeah
Thick lipped, glossed with the slick backed baby hair
Eighty pairs of shoes, man she stay with the latest gear (so fresh)
