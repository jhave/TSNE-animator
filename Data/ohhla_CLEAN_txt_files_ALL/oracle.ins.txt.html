"Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen" - Eric B. &amp; Rakim 'Follow The Leader'

[Verse One]
Solar galactic thought waves control magic
Spoken word, sporadic, swerve, rhythm mathematics
Asthmatic verses, a haphazard 
Here's a punchline, I bust like an old prophylactic
Sew ropes added into dope graphics
Specifically for you to grab whenever you find yourself in traffic
And you try to escape
Take a look at my sound
Follow me into my mind, c'mon I'll show you around
First you have to get trained to enter my left brain
And exit the physical plain, let me explain
Your innovative boundaries block steps into the brain
At any given moment these directions will change

[Scratches]
"Keep it movin'"

[Verse Two]
Enter my rhyme, you'll enter rhymes for days
Scribbled illusion spell confusion as you step into the maze
Guessin' the trues away, goin' crazy
There's a brainstorm, it's rainin', now the horizon turns hazy
As I start to think
Your right brain starts to shrink
My pen's out of ink
Look down, you're startin' to sink
A lot of things can happen here that are impossible to think
Cause I don't have creative obstacles, my eyes then blink
Out of the blue there's a change over
Now you're in a Range Rover
You already forgot what I told ya
Coastin' the turnpike, change into a roller coaster
Outside, now you're flyin' on an Insight poster
Travelin' on a journey to...you don't know where
Feelin' your spirit let go, but then the floors disappear
You fell into a black hole, doors started to appear
But only one was unlocked
You open it up to stairs
For some reason you feelin like you was already there
Abstract ways of thinkin' make the vision seem clear
And then you realize that you don't have to breath air
And you can freeze frame so you're no longer scared
Learning to levitate 
As you begin to adapt 
The possibilities are endless, you don't wanna go back
If you're lost tryin' to find a way and I arrive late
Just broaden your horizon to return to my mind state
