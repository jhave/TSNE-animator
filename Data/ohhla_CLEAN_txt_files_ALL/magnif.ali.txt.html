[Intro]
I. Am the magnificent. Check it out

[Verse One]
The magnificent, born gloriousness
South paw raw, ghetto lawlessness
I ain't never hypothetical or "for instance"
What I'm givin' you is livin' proof that God exists
Santa Claus killer, all of y'all get gifts
Get crossed off my list when the sawed off kicks
Ain't no more bitch shit
Pawns get flipped quick
On some Fresh game of chess on the park benches
I kindly invite y'all to mind y'all business
Before I close down the castle and the draw bridge lift
I clown and kick to get a spot like this
My pocket knife twist through your heart like this
Vocals blastin'
The soul impassioned
Clothes won't be clashin'
I'm so old fashion
Cold blooded assassin
Microphone graspin'
Dealin' with your rappers in an orderly fashion
They lean back baskin' in the gleam of the Brother
I'm Superfly T-N-T motherfucker
Who God bless, let no man curse
Your new-new shit ain't fuckin' with my old ass verse
I flash on your foolish like a Kodak burst
And paint a picture with your weaknesses I know that hurts
Don't you know the prophet feed the poor man first?
Need to fix your own plate daddy, your hands work
The higher the monkey climbs the more he show his asshole
One for the freestyle, two for the cash flow

I am the magnificent

[Chorus: x2]
We sent to get down
The magnificent
Knees bend and heads bow
The magnificent
We step through your town
The magnificent
Please bet that my style is magnificent
