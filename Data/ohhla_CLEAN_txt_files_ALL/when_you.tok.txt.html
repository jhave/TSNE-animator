[Craigy T]
One set a Footprints ina di sand
And you a grumble and a so
You tink it shoulda be two
Memba one ting mi yute
A fadda God a wi plan
So when you see one set a footprints a God a carry you

[Flexx]
Hurry up and come back was the last thing she said to her son
The day his life was taken
She didn't know he wouldn't come back
He died from the bullet of a gun
And now her little boy is gone

[Alex]
She said, help me
Lord help me
And she looked up to the sky
And she heard a voice reply-y-y

[Tok]
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you

[Flexx]
Another baby left homeless
Abondoned when he was two
So the streets that cares and the shopping mall was the family he knew
It's not easy being homeless
Sometimes you have do what you have to do
And he didnt have a mom or dad to help him get through

[Alex]
He said, help me
Father help me
And he looked up to the sky
And he heard a voice reply-y-y

[Tok - chorus]
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you

[Bay C]
Based on a true story
uh-huh
keep your head up

It was early Sunday morning me get up a watch di news
Den mi hear seh a last night a seaview dem kill a yute
Den mama tell me seh har church sista Jackie-lynn
Just lose her bredda over seaview gardens
When she tell me jah jah know it mash mi up nah tell nuh lie
But you know seh man a tuggy so yuh nah guh see me cry
Everyday day and everynight she still a ask the fadda why
Her brother had to die
She hear a voice reply

[Tok - chorus x2]
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you
When you cry, I cry, I cry along with you
When you smile, I smile, I smile along with you

[Craigy T]
The lord replied when you see only one set of footprints
that I carried you</pre>
