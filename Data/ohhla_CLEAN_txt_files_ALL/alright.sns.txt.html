Let's go, let's go

Southstar (Smilez)
Uh-huh (Come on)
Haha it's alright
Ya know another one
And guess what? It's alright (For sho')
Come on bounce with us it's alright
Southstar, Mr. Smilez come on
Yeah Uh-uh

(Southstar)
What you thought huh, we gonna quit
Hell nah stay comin' with more shit (Yeah)
Southstar spit only rawness (Uh-huh)
You say I'm not the best, but I'm flawness
Ever seen the six sittin' on Jordan's (Twenty-three's)
If not then proceed with caution
Out flawston (Uh-huh) without Boston (Uh-huh)
And all these lame dudes we 'bout to toss them (Hah)
Kick'em to the curve, say word (Word)
What? we ain't hot? that's observed
We make the play's burn (Uh) throw'em in the yurn (Uh)
Flesh to ashes just for talkin' out of turn
When they gonna learn top notch (One)
Glenn Levert only top scotch (Uh-huh)
Roll lexus only top watch
Day like little kids playing hopscotch (What)

Chorus: Southstar (Smilez)
You can twerk's out, you can get crunk
Anyway you want, it's alright
you can dug out, play the joint loud
Get buckwild, it's alright
We can boose up get blazed up
In the car what, it's alright (For Sho)
You don't got to if you don't want to (Smilez)
But if you want to, it's alright

(Smilez)
Yo, you feelin' lucky then try touch me
Smilez hot turn your ice to sushi
Don't talk money come on sunny
I got whips in different colors like Telletubies
And your swil seedin' got your girl creepin'
I'm'a take her to the moon like Jackie Gleason
Any dude sayin' they open like me
It's on a cold table gettin' surgery
We doin' it again haters still pissed
Still mad over "Who Wants This"
Deal with it Smilez always real with it (Uh-huh)
HDT be clear when I spit it
How you want it? East or West Coast style
Or Dirty South slowin' it down
Or thuggin' it out bustin' a pound (Uh)
Smilez goes both ways, pick your rail (Uh)

Smilez says Chorus

(Southstar)
Still wanna play? I don't think so
I got no draws, only K.O's
Only homeruns, I never miss three's
What I'm sayin' is ya can't fuck with me (Hell no)
This won't take long it's a quick 'bout
Game over c'mon scream my name out (Southstar)
Raise my arm up call me the champ
You thought you was the man now you's a loyal fan

(Smilez)
Yo, get your dring on, get your smoke on
Pop pills till' you fall out on the floor
I know your love strong, but he doing you wrong
Let that man next door hit it to the song
Smilez official, (Uh-huh) quick to hit you (Word)
If ya'll spit bullets I spit missles
You know I stay pissy, off that 50-50
And don't deal with chicks that give lawitski (Yeah)

Smilez and Southstar says Chorus 2x

For sho
It's alright</pre>
