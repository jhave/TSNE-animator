[Chorus: Fergie]
Boy I think about it every night, and day
I'm addicted, want to jump inside your love
I wouldn't want to have it any other, way
I'm addicted, and I just can't get enough

[will.i.am]
I just can't get enough {*4X*}
Honey got her sexy on steamin
She give the hotness a new meanin
Perfection, mami you gleamin
Inception, you got a brother dreamin, dreamin
Damn baby I'm fiendin
I'm tryin to holla at you I'm screamin
Let me love you down this evenin

[Fergie]
Lovie lovie yeah you know you are my demon

[will.i.am]
Girl work it for my team an'
I could be the King, you could be the Queen an'
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin

[Fergie]
I love you long time so you know the meanin

[will.i.am]
Oh baby I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feelin high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Chorus]

[will.i.am]
I just can't get enough {*4X*}
Honey got me runnin like I'm Flo Jo
Signed her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin for her love, I confess I'm..
Somethin 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin down yo
My heart's pumpin out louder than electro
She got me feelin like {MR. ROBOTO}

Oh baby I can't come down, so please come help me out
You got me feelin high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

[Chorus]

"This, has been a switchup"

[will.i.am]
Switchup! {*2X*}
I, just, can't (switchup)
Locked, sunk in your bed-rock
Heart, pumpin your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your head-lock (switchup)
Can't-can't stop-stop won't-won't quit-quit
Makin me f-f-f-f-f-fiend, give it to me
I want it all-all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecsta (switchup)
Addicted, I can't get, away from, you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (switchup)
I want your lovin right next to me
And I can't, erase you out of my memory
-ory
I, just, can't, (switchup)</pre>
