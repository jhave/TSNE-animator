Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse One]
Eski boy, Roll deep!
I was lookin' for the green light
Who's gonna take me home, yeah she might
The nights so young and I wanna have fun
So I'm gonna keep goin till the party's done
You know I love women, but which ones gonna control me?
'Cuz I wanna be your one and only
You know I love women, but which ones gonna control me
'Cuz I wanna be your one and only

[Verse Two]
I follow the green cross code, then I cross the road
I follow the signs then I fall on my nose
Seek out my princess, speak on the phone
Eventually I'm a cheat with a stone
No regular seats, I get the phone out
His and her match, we're goin' all out
Your crown and my crown, we're gonna ball out
Take my time, I won't stall out

[Chorus]
Stop!
Take a look, left and right
Is it clear for me to go?
Let me know, is it me that you've been waitin' for..

Put your hands up (put your hands up), take it to the floor (take it to the floor)
You already give me the green light baby (I'm giving you the green light)
Put your glass up (put your glass up), pour a little more (pour a little more)
You already give me the green light (I'm givin' you the green light)

[Verse Three]
That time when I saw ya I thought, wow, so
Check out the skirt on that, now straight to the bar - tequila, lemon, salt
I give her the all clear, letting her know green light, letting her go
Dropped her from a mile away, thought to myself, why not give it a go..?

[Verse Four]
I like what I see, face all lit up like a Christmas tree
It's amazing the way she goes, heaven knows what cloud she fell from
Skirts a bit high above the knee, but I know that twinkle in her eye's for me
I said just show me a signal - she flashed red, amber, green

[Chorus]
Stop!
Take a look, left and right
Is it clear for me to go?
Let me know, is it me that you've been waitin' for..

Put your hands up (put your hands up), take it to the floor (take it to the floor)
You already give me the green light baby (I'm giving you the green light)
Put your glass up (put your glass up), pour a little more (pour a little more)
You already give me the green light (I'm givin' you the green light)

Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (put your hands up)
Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (take it to the floor)
Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (put your glass up)

Don't wanna see red now, flash your green lights tonight

[Verse Five]
All it takes is a week, one smile and a drink
I say a couple words, and she might be a link
I like the fact that she aint wearin' a ring, and she ain't lookin' at him
We're the perfect match, what a good catch
She's 10 out of 10, I've gotta keep that
She's so far gone, the green lights on - I aint gonna turn back
It's a rap

[Chorus]
Stop!
Take a look, left and right
Is it clear for me too go? (for me to go)
Let me know (let me know), is it me that you've been waitin' for..

Put your hands up, take it to the floor
You already give me the green light baby
Put your glass up (roll deep), pour a little more
You already give me the green light (I'm giving you the green light)

Put your hands up (put your hands up), take it to the floor (take it to the floor)
You already give me the green light baby (I'm giving you the green light)
Put your glass up (put your glass up), pour a little more (pour a little more)
You already give me the green light (I'm givin' you the green light)

Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (put your hands up)
Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (take it to the floor)
Stop, pop, don't drop
Pour me a little (put your glass up)

Don't wanna see red now, flash your green lights tonight</pre>
