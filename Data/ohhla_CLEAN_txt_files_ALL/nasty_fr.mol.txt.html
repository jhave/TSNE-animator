"I do some nasty shit" - Eddie Murphy
"Nasty"

[Intro] [Juice Talking]
Uh. Big Juice. 2 double zero uno. "Nasty". PNS. Molemen in the house. 
"Nasty". My nigga Memo in the house. Uh "Nasty". 

[Verse One]
Ayo, this is how the shit run
The job I'ma get done
My sick tongue, spit one
Leave your whole shit numb
Bass go inside, coincidin' with the kick drum
Competition, just one
Victim, I lick one
Shot
The outcome, I murder for my income
Never to be outdone, the scale of one to ten son
Shit, I got good ones to great ones and then some
Cities, I ain't never been the type to represent one
I recite the poem cause I light your zone
And my home is where I roam on the microphone
Whenever the mic is on, I'm like Capone
I murder minus the syphilis
Rewind it when I kick this
Big Juice got flow as God is my witness
I scoop hot hoes and I'ma die with the slickness
When the spot blow, J slide with the sickness
Top flow
But I'm still down to ride with the quickness

[Scratch Chorus]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty" 
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Two]
Molemen in the house
I'm well known for the free but my pen is just as deadly
I can come up off my dome if they behead me
Rappers need to slow down, I put the flow down
In your town I rule like I'm Judge Joe Brown
When it's all said and done, Big Juice will go down
As a vicious body puncher that ends it in fo' rounds
I'm one plane trip away from ruinin' your program
Compose for the hood like Rembrandt and Shopan
Men can't throw hands against me that's useless
I leave cats senseless, tryin' to call truces
But once they all defenseless, it ain't no excuses
I'm happy to commence if death is what he chooses
Anything J.U. touch, J.U. bruises
Winners don't pop the damn corks with the losers
I'm action
Either I can make 'em obey
Or like subtraction, the coroner can take 'em away

[Scratch Chorus]
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"
Nasty nigga
Named Juice
Nasty nigga
"Nasty" 
Nasty nigga
"Nasty"

[Verse Three]
I'm one step ahead of these niggas, I stay up
Most MC's hate every mic that J touch
To find me you gotta look way way up
Cause most nigga rap but they never say much
Like Nextel phones I can break y'all up
I roll with the heat that'll make y'all duck
I only squeeze once and I ate y'all up
My lyrics just fuckin' devastate, y'all suck
When my tec spray
Don't have your neck in my way
I'll have your broad readin' about your ass the very next day
Juice is bad to the bone like a fuckin' X-Ray
And I don't even spit unless I collect pay
I'm a flame in the game, can't wait to burn
But like gettin' a county check, I had to wait my turn
I must break you
So what's next for all y'all to follow?
These motherfuckers coughin' up blood like Apollo
