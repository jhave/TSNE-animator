Song:   Keep Floatin'
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go
So we riding, we smoke til we can't anymore
And keep floatin'

Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done, why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hey, then you can pass that
The kid who rock a snap back
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
How we get by, that's how we living in this day and age
I bring colour to this World that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectating til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an allstar, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini speeding, you a golf cart
California dream, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems
These the thoughts weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees
The whole entire crowd could see
Living in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Than light another, this for those who hold it down for me
Passing around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hating, I ain't talking to y'all

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And you can pass, we be floating along
So much smoke we got words high we wrote in the song
Girl I try to come to make you smile
I'm gone so will you wait a while
As soon as I come home we can smoke and then we stay a while
Some people hate my style
Some people love it though
And all these kids that wanna clone they ain't coming close
Politicing joints we countin' none of your votes
I'm getting everybody high so you can puff on ya roach
Shawty used to all these playa's, tell her fuck with a coach
I just want you to come over, roll me something to smoke
Hey my mind be cooking rhymes up
Living til my times up, hate me then they love me
Tell them try to make they minds up
Barbers in, they line me up, ID was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
Smoking weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hating
I ain't talking to y'all

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]</pre>
