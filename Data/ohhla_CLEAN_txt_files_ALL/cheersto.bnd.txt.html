And good evening (Yeah, good evening!)

Aka Mr. Central Pay Icon (I don't know about all that)
Aka America's Perfect Gentleman, the talented Mr. Bentley (Bentley!)
Cheers to me, the honorary seventh member of the band (Alright, hey hey hey)
And we're here to talk to you all about hard work (Hard Work!)
A lot of people want to be a part of the music business, (yeah I know I need some cash!)
But we're here to tell you it takes a lot of hard work (yeah yeah, you gotta work hard)
The first thing you have to do is get yourself a mentor, (Uh-huh, uh-huh!)
Hope he has more hustle than Russell and Lyor (Russell or Lyor, Hey!)

You've seen the boy dance, there's more in store (More in store!)
Never seen a record label platinum plaques this consistent (Consistent!)
You know the president, now meet his assistant (Now meet his assistant!)
Switch titles, just as persistent
You got a demo, but my number ain't listed (It ain't listed, you can't find me)
You better catch me when you see me in the streets, folks (Streets, folks)
You know me when you see me, see me with my Tie-Bow
Bow-Tie, and don't touch it, I ain't lying folks
Oh, there goes Bentley going to Maybach for a transport
Oh, there goes Bentley, he ain't driving, he's in the back folks
(Yo where my glasses nigga, I told you he bought thirty spokes!)
We gonna show you how to do this son!
Chopper City, and Freddy Pee
You know I'm shouting out to VP HP,
Dylan the Dillenger (Stevie J and Dot track!)
