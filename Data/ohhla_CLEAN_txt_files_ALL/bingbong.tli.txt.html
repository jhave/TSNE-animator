[The Lonely Island]
You, might, like, our penises

Hey girl, from over here your butt looks soft
Maybe if I could touch it, I could tell if it's soft
Tell me if it's soft, cause I'd really like to touch it
And then I'll show you my penis (you guys)
And then I'll show you my penis (you guys)
And then I'll show you my penis (you guys)
You, might, like, my penis

Hey pretty girl, did you go to college?
Did you get your B.A., with all that knowledge?
I like your boobies, in your shirt
Please let me show you my penis (mmmm)
Please let me show you my penis (aoww)
Please let me show you my penis (mmmm)
You, might, like, my penis

(OHH!) Look at our penises
(OHH!) Look at our penises
(UHH!) Look at our penises
(UHH!) You, will, like, our penises

I, will, look, at your vagina</pre>
