Song:   White Privilege
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Now nod your head and wake up

I see so many people lost who really try to pretend
But am I just another white boy who has caught on to the trend
When I take a step to the mic is hiphop closer to the end?
'Cause when I go to shows the majority have white skin
They marketed the windmill, the air flair and head spin
And white rappers albums really get the most spins
The face of hip hop has changed a lot since Eminem
And if he's taking away black artists' profits I look just like him
Claimed a culture that wasn't mine, the way of the american
Hip hop is gentrified and where will all the people live
It's like the central district, beacon hill to the south end
Being pushed farther away because of what white people did, now
Where's my place in a music that's been taken by my race
Cultural appropriated by the white face
And we don't want to admit that this is existing
So scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege
Cause it's human nature to want to be part of something different
Especially when your ancestors are European Christians
And most whites don't want to acknowledge this is occurring
Cause we got the best deal, the music without the burden
Of being black in a system that really wants you to rock
Cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hiphop
And we hate the mainstream cause we're the ones that took it
Now we listen to Aesop Rock and wear t-shirts that say Brooklyn
But it's not about black and white right
I mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like
But when you don't give them props isn't that selfish?
That's like saying rock was actually started by Elvis
So where does this leave me?
I feel like I pay dues but I'll always be a white MC
I give everything I have when I write a rhyme
But that doesn't change the fact that this culture's not mine
But I'm gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
I said I'm gonna be me so please be who you are
But we still owe 'em 40 acres now we've stolen their 16 bars
Hiphop started off in a block that I've never been to
To counter act a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hiphop started off in a block that I've never been to
To counter act a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true
Now I don't rap about guns so they label me conscious
But I don't rap about guns cause I wasn't forced into the projects
See I was put in the position where I could chose my options
Blessed with the privilege that my parent's could send me to college
Now who's going to shows the kids on the block starving
Or the white people with dough that can relate to my content?
Marketed the music now adapted to the lifestyle
What happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now
Where's my place in the music that's been taken by the media
With white corperations controlling what their feeding ya
I brought up aesop rock but I'm not even dissing dude
We love hiphop and what do you think caucasians are listening to
And I speak freely when I write this
If a black emcee examined race there goes half their fan base, white kids
And this is so true. and we didn't even have to fight the system
We just went and picked up the microphone too
And we got good at it so we should be rapping
But only supporting them is like burning Jimmy and buying Clapton
Now Clapton's incredible. but no Jimmy no foundation
So here comes history and the cultural appropriation
White kids with do rags trying to practice their accents
From the suburbs to the upperclass mastering a language
But hiphop is not just memorizing words
It's rooted in authenticity something you literally can't learn
But I'm gonna be me so please be who you are
This is something that's effortless and shouldn't be hard
I said I'm gonna be me so please be who you are
But as I'm blessed with the privilege, they're still left with the scars

Hiphop started off in a block that I've never been to
To counter act a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, nope
Hiphop started off in a block that I've never been to
To counter act a struggle that I've never even been through
If I think I understand just because I flow too
That means I'm not keeping it true, I'm not keeping it true</pre>
