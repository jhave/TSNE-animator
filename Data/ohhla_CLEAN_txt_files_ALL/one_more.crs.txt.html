It was Friday night and I was feelin aight (yup)
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights
Mixin Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinkin and drivin
No police lights (lights) no police sirens
I'm headed to the club, lookin for a freak (freak)
To spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks (cheeks)
Pull up to the spot 26's like BAM!
Eyes on me like, "Bitch do you SEE 'EM?"
Strolled through the front do' headed to the VIP (VIP)
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (sips)
Scopin out the room, and what do I SEE?
A nice round butt, and a pair of double D's!
So I crept up like, "Shorty what's happenin
You killin that dress and I love it with a passion"
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite
But I was like hmmmm

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Yeah yeah
If I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
Is that what you wanna do, shorty?
If I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
You too, ooh ooh ooooh

[Ludacris]
Woke up the next mornin and all I can remember
Was takin shots and tippin the bartender
Surrendered to the woman end up bringin me home
Cause she started lookin better every shot of Patron, yup!
I jumped up with a devilish grin
Cause tonight, damn right I might do it again
So I called up the homies (whattup) let's ride
We can hit the sports bar over on the Southside (aight)
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (yup)
Went up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes
So I, slowly walked up and said hi
My name's Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy
One said "I know who you are, I'm your number one fan
And right now it's too bad I got a man"
And I said I understand (I understand)
But where the hell is he at 
cause in a minute if he don't show up then mannnnn

[Chorus]

[Ludacris] Uh-huh huh, ay Pain holla at 'em right quick man

[T-Pain] + (Ludacris)
Yeah, you gon' get in trouble with yo' man girl
(Don't get in trouble girl)
Talkin 'bout how you're my biggest fan girl (I know it, I know it!)
Now I don't wanna do (please) what you're gon' make me do
(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
But I, if I have more drink

[Ludacris]
One mo' drink I'ma get ya home then I'll split ya
Grab the camera phone and take a bunch of drunk pictures
Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurrin my speech slowin up the flow
Hikin up ya skirt, climbin up ya shirt
It's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt
So guess what baby girl!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris  over Chorus]
Just one mo'
That's all it's gon' take, hey!
Ha ha, who else T-Pain?

[Outro: Ludacris]
Ha ha ha, you hear what I'm sayin?
People too picky these days, damnit
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminatin
This has been a Luda Service Announcement
Deuces, ha ha ha ha</pre>
