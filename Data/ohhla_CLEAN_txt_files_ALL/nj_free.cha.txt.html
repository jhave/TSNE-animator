[O.G. Ron C - talking]
It's coming
I brought some of my homies in right now
[Call Me New Jersey] (Oh it's on now)
Uh let em' know

[Chamillionaire]
-Uh
Call me new jersey cuz I'm always in a new jersey
Type to go trade a foreign when the rims get to dirty
My drop is a damn dancer, topless like a lap dancer
Own the city and I care, so they call me "Care-Manter"
Is that ya last answer enn nigga dead wrong
I might snap like a fat women's leg in a red thong
Hold up, I'm off the hanger, spokes twistin' up off the swangers
Call me Cedric, cuz when I pop trunk I'm the entertainer
Bootleggers in awful danger, mean no disrespect
But is this my check, go hit the deck when I get my tech
Hold up, I'm off the wall, maybe come floss for y'all
