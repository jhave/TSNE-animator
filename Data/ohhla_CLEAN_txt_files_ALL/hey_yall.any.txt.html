[Intro]  Indian Chant:

Hey Y'all

[Verse 1]
Hey Y'all come over here check this out
And give me a minute of your time but don't doubt
Anything that I tell y'all listen closely
It's something ghostly, my ancestors told me
We be back before we walked the earth
It was so much cleaner cause it wasn't disturbed
But there was still hatred and struggling for our color
Cause if you had nothing you were bound to smother
And hey y'all yo a helping hand should be a must
It was written in the manuscript "in the book you trust"
Unless it's all just a way to get us arguing
Believing what you feel even if it's a life of sin

[Chorus] x2

Hey Y'all (Everybody got to watch their backs, be alone, and watch your backs)
Hey Y'all (Everybody walking they're own paths but in the end you can't go back)

[Verse 2]
Ever since there's been a jail cell murder's been committed
Thou shalt not kill then who's the one sinning
At the end of all of this will they be judged?
And punished for the life they took with no grudge
Nowadays things sure ain't changed
There's a whole lot of snakes allowed to fry your brains
Its the label we're just burning away
Let them build their own prisons where their ass can stay
It's a wonder why we let things happen
I ain't special but I enjoy taking it to another level
Bad choices leads to a terrible afterlife
So just learn your wrongs and rights

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3]
Hey Y'all I don't mean to get you thinking about
Things that's going to get you down and out
There's just things that I had to get off my chest
Cause I'm just trying to relax and just do my best
I don't want to take a situation and turn it upside down
I just feel this world fucking around
I mean...who am I to judge?
It's just I was raised to be strong enough
Hey Y'all do you understand what I'm saying
Hey Y'all my ancestors got me down on my knees praying
Hey Y'all they keep telling me to spread the word (to spread the word)
Hey Y'all cause when they come their going to test what you have learned

[Chorus] until end</pre>
