Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus:]
We poppin' rubber bands
spendin' money by the grand
what you make up in a week
nigga I got it in my pants! (Wiz- SO WE!) Poppin' rubber bands
spendin' money by grand
what you make up in a week
nigga I got it in my pants [x2]

You that time is money so a young nigga clock it!
I'm ballin' in the game while them other just watchin'
You makin' in a week I got stuffed up in my pocket! The money ain't a thang
gettin' money's not an option

I need a rubber band can't fit this money in a wallet!
My bank account is makin' ya'll sick to ya stomach
gettin' rich and I love it
my piff got a budget and your bitch probly thinkin' about the prints
she ain't frontin'!

Homie you ain't seen nothin'! I'm blowin' on the overdose
Thirty five large and that's just for doin' a show with you
Talkin' how I live it now I'm gettin' it how I'm suppose to do
Shinin' like I know the do
grinden I could show you dudes!

Hit the mall up dawg spendin' money by the grand!
Blow a couple stacks and pop another rubber band! Make it hard to understand
I ain't spend it like that
Niggas know me I'm the man and we gettin' it right back! So we!

[Chorus:]
We poppin' rubber bands
spending money by the grand
what you make up in a week
nigga I got it in my pants (Wiz- SO WE!) [x4]

No I ain't gon' stunt! (Stunt) Hold on what they want! (Want)
What you make off in a week
I just roll up in a blunt! (Blunt) I got rumble in my trunk! (Trunk)
Money on my mind (Mind) Hennessy in my cup! (Cup)
Switch up fold up that pine! (Pine)

Hoes be nothin' but dimes! (Yeahh!) Opens up in they mind
I never spoke for you dudes! Told you I would get mine! (Gettin'!)
Chavold fo' them shows (Gettin'!) Guavo fo' them O's!
What you makin' in a year I spend more shoppin' for my clothes!

I'm ballin' like a pro! Your doe is kinda minor
My money on the road lookin' something like a tire and they lovin' my atire!
I'm lean in them verse
but I switch to Micheal Veres and my vision got clearer! (Clearer)
It's all about the paper man the paper need mirrors
Could never give a fuck about a hater
can't fear em'
(Nahh) It's been so conversation
you ain't cakin' can't hear em' (NO!)
I'm post in the Burgh get money to the ceilin' So we!

[Chorus:]
We poppin rubber bands
spendin' money by the grand
what you make up in a week
nigga I got it in my pants (Wiz- SO WE!) [x4]</pre>
