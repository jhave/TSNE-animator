No ego trippin', just growin' old 
All up when I'm feelin' cold 
'Cause pain up on my soul seems to be all I feel 
Watchin' my family fall apart, was all I never wanted to see 
'Cause I got love for one another 
I'd kill for my only brother, even though he might be wrong 
At times I'm gon' do what I got to do to come through every scary moment 
Just brought us closer which kept us down 
Remember them days when southwest Atlanta wasn't even 'round 
So out the reds to wet it 
And say they actin' brains, relaxin' 
And steady stackin' and pistol packin' 
And trackin' is tired 
I set it off! 

I don't be sittin' in a trap slangin' lil' peewees 
Tell Mike, "Damn I'm 'bout to mess up my re-up money" 
See, I used to wear my shoes until I couldn't no more 
Now I hit the store, when the lace get old 
I wear Calhoun jeans 'cause I don't like Calvin 
I relate to my folks 
To make you think this 'bout my third album 
This supposed to be the times when the moon and the sky turn purple 
So watch this full circle 
Black wire touch red 
Red wire touch black 
Me and Big Slate got this drop wit some gator backs 
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how much I make 
He get the rims, I get the system and we leave him the tapes 
Ya know what I'm sayin' 
Who gives a damn about catchin' a charge 
It's been a while since I seen my boys 

One time for my potnas who got out today 
Back on the grind, did that time, got that hide-away 
Okay (that's right) 
I just got to say 
Two times for the crook who just got away 

It done got so quiet now, I can here a rat piss 
On cotton, one apple sport the whole 
Barrel rotten 
What it mean when you see the sun and the moon shinin'
At the same time 
This God's way, you dug your own grave 
The righteous path was laid 
But you chose to go astray 
Ay, out the war shit 
Wakin' up in a cold sweat 
Through the same ol' skit 
Genocide 
&gt;From the inside, look a pit 
You lie, never killed nobody 
Let's take it to the ol' school 
No you can't 
Hands shakin' like a dog shittin' fish hooks 
Don't stare 
Can't help the crooked look 
It came with the face 
I used to steal from my folks 
But now I'm straight 
Went through the neighborhood rat's pockets books 
Ooh 
You missin' somethin' of value 
We have you, got you 
Jumpin', dumb bitch, you gets nothin' 

Nobody knows the trouble I have seen 
My homeboy MD write me from the ? 
24-7, hell or Heaven, it ain't no tellin' 
Will it be mo' sunshine for the due time felon 
They gave him 10, do 3, self year, probation 
Law leaders not, unto no temptation 
Yall know how it be 
You make a monkey move, lay yourself on the street 
You'll understand me 
They don't care nuttin' 'bout you 
In that cold cell 
Can't do nuttin' but take what them folk give me 
I'm dead serious 
Them folk givin' away time 
Just to show us the good Lord keep lettin' the sun shine

One time for them niggas who got out today 
And my folks on stokes
?? just westward on Olympian Way 
Uh-huh
And I just got to say 
Two times for the crook who just got away 

"Uh-huh.. Believe that.."
"Uh-huh.. Believe that.."</pre>
