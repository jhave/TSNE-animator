(Verse 1):
You hear me talking you know I'm from the O-A-K
I tell it like it is and that's the only way
I'm the M the A the C the K I write my rhymes everyday
Now all you one-rap rappers what are you doin'
I got so many raps so just go right thru 'em
My name is Short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic I do it all the time
Now could you be like me I hate to say it
It's like comparin' Mickey D's and Quick Ways
You only got 3 stores I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl
But I'm such a dog I never call tha freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things
The candy paints, got her sprung on my diamond rings
She could live like a queen if she was Miss Too $hort
Have 2 babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nathin from me
I ain't fakin' it, freak, I'm just makin' the beat
So don't dance, ride the strip
All day long playin' Too $hort hits
Pop in the tape and start ridin'
Silly young freak who started sidin' 
In the Oaktown

(Chorus):
Oaktown , Oaktown
Oak-Oak-Oak-Oaktown
In the Oaktown
Oaktown , Oak-Oak-Oak-Oaktown
Oaktown
Oak-Oak-Oak-Oaktown
Oaktown , Oak-Oak-Oaktown
Oak-Oak-Oak-Oaktown
Oaktown

(Verse 2):
See I'm a true MC, I'm not a MC fool
I'm just rich and famous and way too cool
I get paid to rhyme and I do mean G'z
You don't like my raps don't buy 'em please
I give you no refund cause my bass is phat
Make it hit so hard just like a punch in the back
It's that dopefiend beat got my rap on your plate
Tryin' to bite my style and make a demo tape
Now could you be like me or someone else
Bass hittin' hard like the Freaky Tales
Oaktown style it goes just like this
If you never heard me rap don't trip
Cause I hit the scene with my homie Too Clean
We slap hands like a tag team
Some people say they don't like Cali raps
People like that must be smokin' that crack
I rhyme good it's been 10 long years
Gettin' sick of all that stuff I always hear
Too $hort can't rap, he's from the Westcoast
Between me and you patna I sell the most
So let's take it to the stage and don't get scared
Cause me and Too Clean, we come well prepared
They call me Playboy Short, and the girls I play
Every single day
In the Oaktown

(Chorus): till the end</pre>
