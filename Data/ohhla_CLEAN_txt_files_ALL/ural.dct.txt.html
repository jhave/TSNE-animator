This world's a tortured place to be
So many things to torment me
And as I stumble down this road it takes a toll
These days and nights I turn to You
No human hand can pull me through
No cosmic force or magic brew will ever do

But I can see it coming
You're not so far away
'Cause I can feel your power
Surging through the whole of me

[Chorus 1]
God is there and He is watching
He tells me all is well (it's supernatural)
God is there, there's no denying
He's supernatural (it's supernatural)
Supernatural

Beyond this physical terrain
There's an invisible domain
Where angels battle over souls in vast array
But down on earth is where I am
No wings to fly, no place to stand
Here on my knees I am a stranger in this land

I need an intervention
A touch of providence
It goes beyond religion
To my very circumstance

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
God is there and He is watching
The signs are everywhere (the signs are everywhere)
God is there, there's no denying
It's supernatural (it's supernatural)
Supernatural

[Bridge]
In six days, the universe was made
Supernatural
And from the dead a man was raised
Supernatural
They say He walked across the waves
Supernatural
And I'll believe it to my grave

But I can see you coming
You're not so far away
'Cause I can feel your power
Surging through the whole of me

[Yeah, yeah, yeah]
[God is supernatural]
[Yeah, yeah, yeah]

[Chorus]
