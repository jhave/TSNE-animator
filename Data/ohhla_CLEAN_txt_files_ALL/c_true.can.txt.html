Yo I vaguely remember 1974, when I was born
Soon as the doctor cut my ambilical cord, he put me in my mother's arms
I was cryin when she looked down at me
She was smilin cuz I guess she was happy (Coochie-coochie-coo!)
She absolutely had no idea
I was flowin cuz it wasn't quite clear (You so cute!)
She just kept ticklin me and ignorin me (Weeeee!)

My native home was Jamaica (No problems man)
We moved to the states a few years later
I had trouble fittin in (What did you say?)
Cuz I had a funny speech impediment
People couldn't understand what I mean
Meeda sata greedafa zeen (Sha oh)
I used to wear cross-colored jeans
Rasta belts with the red, gold, and green
My man used to boost travel pocket for me

In '93 I met the Lost Boyz
Without them, I wouldn't even have a voice
I showed the world I was nice with the verbals
That's how I got signed to Universal
I released two albums, in all sold 9 hundred and 99 thousand
Over the years, alotta people tryed to diss me
Cuz I grabbed a piece of hip-hop history
Thank God that the drama didn't destroy me

I took a trip to England with Pac-Man
Five months later we met Stan
He was cool so we let him join the band
And introduced him to the rest of the Horsemans
Then I hooked up with this cat named Lou (Lou-minatti)
And he was cool with C-4 too (plus two)
Now the whole crew's on tour with me

This is a story about beef
Arrogance, lies, and deceit
This is an independent release
And that's why it's totally depended on the streets
I ain't got no record label behind me
Maybe nobody got the balls to sign me
But it's cool cuz soon they'll all be callin me
This is a True Hollywood Story...</pre>
