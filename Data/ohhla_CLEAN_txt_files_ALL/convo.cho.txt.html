Soltair:
Let me take you through the mind of a man drivin mad by the rhymes
In case you misunderstood the first time round Mastermind
The head honchoI'm in the bass claf while you singin' soprano
Mono we MonoLet's take it there this year
No fearSolitair breaks the silence then my words hold clear jack
Some niggaz don't know how to act
So bring it backAnd teach you 'bout this skill called rap
You dead waste LaToo bad we can't see eye to eye
Cause I'm a man and you're a victim of the fashion B.
ISee I handle my B.IYou could see by
The way my shit keeps you open like your daughter outside
Let the rhythm rideYou close the front and we sneakin' in the back
Word upTrackin' dirt up on ya doormat
The format is seems so regularBt you still listening
Trying to find the....

Marvel:

Wha? in my jawTrying to become Linguistic
Refine my EnglishWithin the block stock market
I conduct every biz to the photo finish
Bomb evidence was doneHistory in the hands of it's writers
A sample three of we we like niggaz be the writers
Deranged characters outta rangeGate keeper squeezing my flow
Under my door can tell me bout changeAgainst the grain
Steel I reignMount Olympus,Live niggaz turn bah bah night
By morning they ?...?Throw 'em in the stitchesFor needle
Crave thinks becoming ya weakness
Head throb like a dread lookin' for job
It's them Gods want me on the ?..?

aChoclair:

You either gonna love me or hate meSpin me or tape me
Envy or under-rate meShit's ridiculou
sYou fuss cause we crazyAbout to make a century eventually
Ya fly high schemes will leave you winglessYou hate us
No need to differently a tallFrequentely, Not I know bequently
Much comfortablySit back and hangRide through on black horses
Buck constantly be pullin' rangsWhen I come throughI be stomping
while others tip-toeand hot clothesI'm like a mustang 
before the foreigns took itWack when they first came
Then tryed to come backwith a bunt down spotForget the ?? stains
I'm the house in the gameQuick fingers
I'll take ya pussySwitch ya pussy, pull a black gauge
Never thought of changeI'm referring on a mountain terrain
With four runners who be jumpin'When they hear the name CHIZZAY
Yo for real ahI ride smooth like a flat hillay
From Tee Dot to Yankee Cali to ShankeeLa, tear da roof
Off da hizzayyo for shizzayHow we rol
when you with the Suave Diggy Dog!!Patna!!</pre>
