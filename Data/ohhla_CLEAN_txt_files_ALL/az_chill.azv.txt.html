Aight I'm waitin on you..

[AZ]
AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say?  Why catch feelings
Used to hide the crack in the hotel ceilings
But that was way back when I was wholesale fillers
We made a killing off our little bity buildings
But really them lil' gun silly niggaz still illin
Clip is chillin, chips to the ceiling
Shot in ninety-six June this wound still healing
That's right, this three-wheeling got it good
And if you never had it locked in your own hood you should
Stop frontin, and lookin hard
'Fore the gym star sneeze, leave your face scarred it's
No more bosses, girls think that I'm god I'm a
Young full artist either eat or you starvin
Either beef or you barred, the finger either the yard
I'm sittin peepin my odds before seekin peace in the Mars but
Still do me cause it's easy to do
So the fly CEO, I ain't easy to jew
And that's how it is, you can ask Blitz
Jail, for more than aggravated assault
Wild Style took it to trial said it's all his fault

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say?  Why catch feelings
My cons-tributions to this jam
Is confusing because I am...
... low key and y'all know the deal
And when you real then you real no need to ice grill
YES, I'm nice still, YES, my mic skills
is so ill for real give myself slight chills
And I get money, money I got
Big bottles of Belve keep the bloodflow hot
Bone's up in queen, wood in the feds
Wild born and barred niggaz hold your head
Cause I'm still here, hustle with no fear
The muscle is still here that love be still sheer
I dare, a muh'fucker pull my card
I got more than a great big bodyguard
So press up if you wanna get served
I survived in the hood, now I'm all in the burbs
With the bass on thump, suitcase in the trunk
Probably UV with the tooly lettin Akon pump

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say?  Why catch feelings
How long can I lay to touch millions
'fore that AK spray or sprays on civilians
I'm five for five, I'm rated R
I'm gifted, and I'm goin far
Down the ave, to the spot
Four dubs of 'dro that's all I copped
No mo' but chammy that's all I pop
So solo with the fam that we all we got
Hate for what, I live that life
I done drove every car, I did that ice
Done touched a few broads, some hid they wife
I was too large to dodge, had to deal my life
I kept it fair, I played the game
Now it's time for the whole world to know my name

AZ's chillin, Brooklyn's chillin
What mo' can I say?  Why catch feelings
Just do the dance that's easy to do
Lean back or that two-step, what's easy for you
This jam is on and on and on
Guaranteed airplay 'til your breath is gone!

I get the money so I don't care, I do-I don't care, I do-I don't care
New York get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care
Cali get that money so I don't care, I do-I don't care, I don't care
Miami get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care
Detroit get that money so I don't care, I don't care, I do-I don't care
Chi-Town get that money so I don't care, I don't care, I do-I don't care
Atlanta get that money so I don't care, get the-get the money so I don't care</pre>
