[Intro: DJ Premier scratchin]
H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-Here-Here
H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-Here-Here
H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-Here
Here we go again YEAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! ("Tef)

[Verse One: Tef]
Look! What I wouldn't do to trade this life of mine, as a predicate
Plagued by this life of crime tryin to get cheddar quick
Stay up nights, slicin dimes, ices whatever shit!!!
I'm like this can't be the nicest that life could ever get
That's why we head to the strip, eyes on a better whip
Then slide in somethin inside with a nice set of hips
Lil' ice to front, blew up mine better let her rip
I'm grindin on the frontline tryin to get us rich
Niggas ain't tryin to get them benefits
I'm tryin to get rich, be cozy keep three trophies like Emmitt Smith
Flood the game on some business shit
Keep the change don't spend the shit, claim my own syndicate
We all played in them small filthy tenaments
The law say we all guilty 'til proven innocent
Ain't no sense in pretendin, we live in this shit
Built in this shit, get it right we got a lifetime membership

[Chorus: Tef]
It's a lifetime membership, y'all tryin to get in the mix
Y'all couldn't remember this? It's a lifetime membership
It's no love from the judge or the thugs
Nigga this shit is thick, It's a lifetime membership
And once you drafted you gotta live the script
'Cause you can't be a bitch, It's a lifetime membership
It's only one or two places you placed in
When a nigga slips, It's a lifetime membership

[Verse Two: Saigon]
Fear no man, hear no command
Love is somethin I only show fam, fam know the program
Focusin on the blow plan, plan why do my dope span?
Whether I gotta coast Nostrand in a broke van with toast in both hands
I snuffed Conan, 'cause man unlike last year
I'm tryin to get cash without havin to smash the cashier
I looked in your rap sheet their ain't no facts in that
Every rap that I ever spat is fuckin action packed
Nigga Saigon!!!! Just go to the store and ask for that
I'm bangin from in the slums to out in the houses in Hackensack
Metaphorically, niggas ain't got enough gaul to go to war with me
Orally I do niggas soimethin horribly
Yardfather wrecks it expect it It's somethin of ethic
Flex get hit tek's spit, when they exit
Tef will hit you up with the fifth, you little bitch
I got a lifetime membership, finish this shit!!!

[Chorus: Tef]
It's a lifetime membership, y'all tryin to get in the mix
Y'all couldn't remember this? It's a lifetime membership
It's no love from the judge or the thugs
Nigga this shit is thick, It's a lifetime membership
And once you drafted you gotta live the script
'Cause you can't be a bitch, It's a lifetime membership
It's only one or two places you placed in
When a nigga slips.....

[Verse Three: Papoose]
It's a lifetime membership, if you the tip to ride with a snitch
Birds of a feather flock together die with 'em bitch
Walk through the night time with the fifth
The leather parked by ankle I wear the right type of Timberland's
Niggas is blowin trial to lifetime sentences
Hard to beat a case with light nine witnesses
Life of crime nemesis, tight rhyme enthuses
Stare at the white lines and write fine penmanship
I got the brain power of like five lyricist
I black out like I incite blind images
Talkin all that hype rhyme wickedness
I put my foot in yo' ass, you'll see Nike's signs when you shit
You a pussy, behind your hype lies a clitoris
With tight darts of syphillis these pythons is venomous
This is a new beginnin, my time Genesis
Knowledge is infinite so my lifetime limitless

[Outro: Tef]
It's a lifetime membership!!!!</pre>
