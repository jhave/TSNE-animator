Sometimes I think about dyin
	Yeahhh-haaa
Unfortunately, I'm seein a lot of death in my life
	Oahhhooooh

I seen a lot of family members die
	If, I, should, diiiiie tonight
When I think about dyin, I think about
	Won't it be, alllll, before my time?
a sense of release
Just released from all the pressures
	I know dyin, sugar yeah
and all the negativity
	cause, I know you
I also think about, finally, gettin a chance to see
all the loves ones again
	If, I, should, diiiiie tonight
that left before me
That'll be kinda fly
	Won't, it be, alllll, before my ti-me
Walk through the gates, see my grandmother
See BIG, see God, heh

	Because I know you, know youuuu
I never been afraid to die
	If I should, diiiiie tonight
But I know I don't wanna die
Not just yet anyway
