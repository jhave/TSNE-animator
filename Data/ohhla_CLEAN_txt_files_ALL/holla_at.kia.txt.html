[Intro]
I gotta be honest though and tell the truth
That why I talk on my records, that be why I talk on my records
Be like cause I got somethin to say
And on this song right here I got somethin to say
about them real women out there, y'knahmsayin?
(C'MON!) Ya heard me?

[Chorus: Kia Shine + 'Kane']
Holla at me any time you need me
When you hear this song bump on the radio
I, know you be happy cause we made it past it
If you need somethin just ask daddy, c'mon
When sunshine turns to rain
You stuck with me through all the pain - that's why I love you
Trust me, you ain't got to want for nothin
If you ever need meeeeee - just holla at ya kinfolk

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, look
Kinfolk she came down South with me, suffered through the drought with me
Lived out of car, still didn't have no doubt in me
She went without with me, lost e'rythang she had (that she did)
To get me back on my feet she borrowed from her mom and dad
She wore the same clothes, even rocked the same shoes (same shoes)
She sold her earrings mayne to get ya boy back in the booth
She sold my mixtapes to help me get our shit straight
My gal trill and for me she'll do whatever it takes
She took a charge for me when I got caught with a gun and 'dro
At TSU homecomin at the mass co (cash real)
She on the grind with Shine, tryin to come up on these figures
I'ma keep it trill mayne, she realer than most of y'all niggaz~!
Taught her stay down (down) and you'll come up (up)
That's how we live everyday where I'm from bruh
And mayne it's what she did (did) she know who she is (she know)
Anything I got I'ma give her, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Kinfolk, kinfolk!
See you my inspiration; on top of that my motivation
I know you got my back, regardless of the situation
Girls don't even know you hate you, I know they get so aggravatin
Yet you got so much patience dealin with me and this dream I'm chasin
I'm constantly on the road (road) I'm constantly on the move (move)
You calmly handle the duties, things you thought you'd never do (do)
Like livin out hotels (#tels) and messin up your credit (credit)
It woulda broke a weaker gal but you ain't let it (ain't let it)
Get the best of ya (nah) that's why I mess wit'chu
Went through God's test wit'chu, why I'm so blessed wit'chu
I must confess to you when I say that you the trillest (trillest)
Compared to any other gal yeah you the realest (the realest)
And mayne you got to feel it, just like my heart's feelin
Through this track when I be talkin 'bout this hard livin
It's like you was my witness (witness) now you is my Mrs.
Anything you want you can get it, holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

[Kia Shine]
Ay, you know I ain't one of these dudes
who too hard to say how he feel, y'knahmsayin~?
It don't cost nuttin to keep it trill
You stay down there with me, you gon' get what's due to you
Whatever you need daddy got you
Holla at ya kinfolk

[Chorus]

Just holla at ya kinfolk</pre>
