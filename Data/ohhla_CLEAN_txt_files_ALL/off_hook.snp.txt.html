[Charlie Wilson]
I stepped in the joint, it's Friday night
2 or 3 niggas down shootin' dice
It's off the hook, it's off the hook, ooh
4 or 5 cuties walkin' in the door
Come shakin' ass all across the floor
It's off the hook, it's off the hook, nah, nah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Sing the song, it's off the hook

[Hook]
Nah-nah, nah, nah, nah

[Charlie Wilson]
Lil' blue funkin' ridin' hood

Bumpin' bumpin' wall to wall

[Hook]
It's off the hook, the hook

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Who' that peepin' in my window
Oh it's the lil' homie with the indo
What chu' outdoor for come indoor
Everybody groovin' everybody movin'
Ain't nothin' but a what up, ain't nobody cut up
So I'ma blaze this bud up before somebody nut up
It look good, good is what it look like
We got the phone and the party off the hook tonight

[Charlie Wilson]
Lil' blue funkin' ridin' hood
From the first verse ya know ya no good
It's off the hook, she's off the hook

I guess ya know that no girl took me there, your the first
She's off the hook, she's off the hook

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Jack and Jill ran up the hill to tell Snoop the big dog have a big ball
And he invited the tightest MC's
From the East and the West and the best dressed ladies
Got in for free, oh it's all on me
It ain't where ya from it's about where ya be
Feel good and good is what it feel like
We got the phone and the party off the hook tonight

[Val Young]
1- A little bit of this, a little bit of that
  You ain't seen nothing yet
  Come on in, we're gonna have a good time
  A little bit of this, a little bit of that
  You ain't seen nothing yet
  Come on in, we're gonna have a good time

[1 repeated x2 with Hook in background]

[James E. DeBarge}
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
You ain't seen nothing yet
Come on in, we're gonna have a good time
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
You ain't seen nothing yet
Come on in, we're gonna have a good time

[Hook repeated with ad-libs from All]
