[Intro - Camu Tao - talking]
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), what up?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), what up?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), let's go?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready)
Yo, yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), what up?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), what up?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), let's go?
Yo, yo (y'all ain't ready), yo, yo

[Verse 1 - Mr. Lif]
I step up in the place with that look on my face
Aww shit, Lif is here and ready to rip
He got the mic on his hip in the holster
Told ya, true motherfuckin rap soldier
Party people in the place, I like to get to know ya
First push up your hands if you's a weed smoker
Get them cigarettes out of the place
I can't stand people blowin smoke all up in my face
And now you, tell the party people who you are (wooo!)
(Dude, my name is Chuck and I like to party HARD!) (yeah bro, party man!)
This guy's one drink away from a spill
(Hey yo, this brother needs some water), play it cool son, chill
Ladies lookin so delicious, I'm vicious
with this mic in my hand, I can grant wishes
Which is your desire, want to hear the hot fire?
I'm not Dylan, this here my song
First of all strike a B-boy stance
And if it's rough enough, maybe then we can advance
Hey yo Fakts, put the needle on the record with poison
All my peoples in the place just make some noise

[Chorus - Camu Tao] - w/ ad libs
Ok, how many people wanna party with me? (what up?)
Yeah, you in the building, you chillin, you illin with me (What up?)
No go to get your tickets, so then get in with me (let's go)
We keep it bangin, I'm sayin, just dance to the beat (let's go)

Ok, how many people wanna party with me? (what up?)
Yeah, you in the building, you chillin, you illin with me (What up?)
No go to get your tickets, so then get in with me (let's go)
We keep it bangin, I'm sayin, just dance to the beat (dance to the beat)

"yo, yo" - repeated in the background throughout the Chorus

[Verse 2 - Guru]
Now why they wanna get me started?
Been doin this since Biz said to "get retarded"
My reputation alone, can get me charted
Now Free Agent makin noise, so they stress me harder
Last year a lot of chicks walked right past me
Quick to hate on a player, tryin to typecast me
Now it's like 'hey, I saw your new video'
And I'm like 'yeah, I'm just passin through,' silly ho
Can't believe I got folks so besides themselves
What? Nobody supposed to eat besides themselves
Hope they keep some heat besides themselves
Or keep someone to hold them down, besides themselves
I MC, why you others just rap
And I don't have to kick imaginary shit, just facts
So knuckle up, cause you could lose it all
I'm like a number one contender, refuse to fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Akrobatik]
In my stance, I'm +Definitively Jux+ to pose
I'm blessed, promoters hittin with me bucks for flows
We the pros, can't nobody oppose the Black Dialogue
Coverin with my shine, like it's L.A. by the smog
MC's I laugh at all
Cause y'all some disappointments (uh), like U.S.A. Basketball
This beat will make me "Zone Out" (zone out) like Salaam Remi
Fuck a VMA, y'all niggaz should win Emmy's
Better acting skills than Demi
Pretty for the camera, but when it's rhyme time, you ain't ready
I steady keep 'em comin to the shows in bunches
Hunnies love the belly, so I don't do crunches (*laughing*)
And even if you got a six pack
When it's time to bring the chicks back, I bet the one you wanted digs Ak
But let me switch back to humble 
And politic with y'all, cause I see the heads are ready to rumble
So pick up your hands with a clenched fist (word)
Wipe your face from the sweat that your body is drenched with
Real go getters, make noise like it's a riot (what?)
Everybody else just keep the fuck quiet, like

[Chorus]

[Outro - Camu Tao - talking]
Let's go! (*echo*)
What up? (*echo*)
What up? (*echo*)
Let's go! (*echo*)
What up? (*echo*)</pre>
