[Kevin Rudolf - Verse 1ne]
I see your dir-ty face, high behind your collar
What is done, in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray, to God, to justify the way you
live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you taaaaake yooooour time
And you dooooo yoooour crime
Well you maaaaade yoooour bed
I'm in miiiiiiiiiiine...

[Chours]
Because when I, arrive, I-I bring the fire
Make you come, alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock!

[Kevin Rudolf - Verse 2wo]
Now the son's, disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed, his name, turned and chased the dollar
But it broke, his heart, so he stuck his middle finger
TO THE WORLD, TO THE WORLD, TO THE WORLD!
And you taaaaake yooooour time
And you staaaand iiiiin line
Well you'll geeeeet whaaaaaat's yours
I got miiiiiiiiiiine...

[Chorus]


[Lil Wayne - Rap Verse]
Yeaaaa-AAAAH!
+Wayne's World+, +Planet Rock+
Panties drop, and the tops
And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop
I sing about angels like Angel-a
(ROCK!) - And Pai-mela
(ROCK!) - And Sam-antha
(ROCK!) - And A-manda
And T-amara - ménage a moi
I'm, in here like, "Bitch, wassup"
Me-chanic me, I can fix you up
I can dick you up, I can dick you down
Shawty we can go wherever just pick a town (whoo!)
And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Baby like sex that's on the ground
...Weezy

[Chorus 2X]

Just let it rock (rock!), let it rock (rock!), let it rock 
LET IT ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCK!!!
LET IT ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOCK!!!

[Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot sum'hin, I'm sum'hin
Fluent in rock, rubbin, rap runnin
miles like it's tryna get a flat stomach
Like Wayne, the personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I'll bang ya
Period - like the remainder

[Kevin Rudolf]
AND I WISH I COULD BE, AS COOOOOOL AS YOOOOOU
AND I WISH I COULD SAY, THE THIIIIIINGS YOOOOOU DO
BUT I CAN'T AND I WON'T LIVE A LIE
NO, NOT THIS TIME</pre>
