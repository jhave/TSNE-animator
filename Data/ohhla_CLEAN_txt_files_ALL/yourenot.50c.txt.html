[Young Buck] (chorus)
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no)
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no)
You not ready for me nigga you not ready for me
(no)
It's G-Unit and we bout to get this fuckin' hoe

[50 Cent]
Yea nigga I'm the first one up
I heard you been talking mad shit
why don't you just step the fuck up
Get in my face and see whats happens
I'll take you out you wont know what happened like poof its magic
yea I pull magic tricks I'm like B rabbit
I beat the hell out of all you faggots
I do it big just like a real savage
Game wanna mess wit us we'll do it back
Fuck all this 'get rid of beef' y'all heard that
You wanna know whats happens when you mess wit G-Unit
You get dropped,shot and punched in yo shit bitch

(chorus)

[Lloyd Banks]
Uhh Yea
Sit down 50 man let me get on this nigga
he talkin' like he a G
But he don't wanna see me in the streets
Niggas get capped up, smacked up and killed
I like to do it gangsta style yea I do it for real
I'll be yo dentist get yo chest filled Wit bullets
Yea yo plan failed to ruin the G-units name
Lets do it like Trina and stop playin' games
I'm a spit heat flashes make you look like a lame
And when I head in the club hoe's give me they name
I'll do it like li'l' flip and say
You a lame so yo dame must be playin mind games
If you think you mess wit G-unit
Think about we go in the streets and handle our business

(chorus)

[Tony Yayo]
I'm back on that gangsta shit
When I'm in the streets y'all know who I'm wit
G-unit we kill niggas that talk shit
The Game has gotten so selfish
We the one's who put him on the map
Take this track rewind it like Boom Boom Clap
And you'll find out who's goin' get ya
we always goin' be on 106 &amp; Park like yo twin Big Tigger
I hope you figured out why we made this song
Cuz you really don't want to fuck wit us we King Kong
