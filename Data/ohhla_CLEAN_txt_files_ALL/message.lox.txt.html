[Styles P]
Street life my niggaz
Shit's a motherfucker you know?
I try to tell these shorties somethin
They look at me like, "What the fuck?
Nigga you worse than me"
Nigga, don't listen to the message
Listen to the message

A message to my son, it's times in my life
where I stood around to fight when it was better off to run
A message to my daughter, daddy ain't make you
But sometimes in life blood ain't thicker than water
A message to my wife, I gotta say I love you
And thank you for makin shit better in my life
A message to my moms, don't worry about your kids
Cause love is always love when we in God's arms
A message to my pops, my head's on my shoulders
And I'm takin care of family and never will it stop
A message to my sister, your big brother got you
But never in life let a coward nigga twist you
A message to my niggaz, when it comes to the hood
Who the fuck in the world could do it better than my niggaz
A message to my group, we got it we made it
Cause nobody in the world sound better in the booth

[Chorus]
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - I'm gone right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - it's on right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message - I'm gone right now
{*BEEP~!*} If I don't pick up just leave me a message
I don't pick up, just leave me a message

[Styles P]
A message to the jail, I don't really write
Cause it's hard for me to say keep your head up through the mail
A message to the poor, stressin the life
What we don't get now we get in the second life
A message to the kids, stick to your school
Cause if you fuck with the streets that's jail or a bid
A message to the wild, you should calm down
Cause everybody rattin and you probably blow trial
A message to the ladies, depend on yourself
So if daddy walk out you take care of the baby
A message to the rich, you should spread love
'Fore niggaz like me go ahead and spread clips
A message to the hood, shit is bad now
But we gon' be aight, cause it's soon to be good
A message to the world, I don't give a FUCK
P smoke 'til he he and he drink 'til he earl

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
Many ways they can send you a message, like a word from the wise
Or a 45 that send you to heaven
Some'll throw you a look, others a book
Like the king gettin killed by the rook, straight-forward
Some'll grab they soul when they feel like the Lord's callin
Some see it before it come
My nigga, one is all and all is one
I wanna see us all rich before all this done
But it's really God call cause we all his sons
Some I'ma play my role, hope God save my soul
Let me slide for them sins I owe
Pain and more pain's the only change I know
Brain stay in the frame, I'm in the game I blow
Either my watch broke or my lame-ass slow
But I'ma count my blessings 'til I get to the essence
It's all good just send me a message, what?

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
A message to the jail
A message to the poor
A message to the kids
A message to the wild
A message to the ladies
A message to the rich... {*fades*}</pre>
