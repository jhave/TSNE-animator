Ladies and gentleman
(Ladies and gentleman)
One-two, one-two
E-V-E, party time

1 - All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
     All my West Coast niggaz get all the chips
     All my Down South niggaz get all the chips
     All my Ruff Ryder niggaz get all the chips
     Let's go, let's go, let's go
     Let's go, let's go, let's go
     Let's go, let's go, let's go
     Let's go, let's go, let's go
     Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Yo, yo whatcha need from a bad bitch, that bitch
(Ladies) Don't fuck around if you strapless
Real thug hide his money in his mattress
See him in the club with his team never stackless
Want what we got, shorty got me hot
Might have something to do with the drop top
Big thang, big man
Spotted, your number, your name, got it
Freaks out, baby mother sneaking out
(Big boys in the back pull your g's out)
Thorough chick tell a nigga pile it on
Bitches what they call us?
(Brick house stallions)
Now we feelin' it, drinks all in me
Lady but a thug, double shot of Henney
Nigga look good, nigga got it all
Can help but to speak (Damn daddy how ya doing?)
Babygirl grew up, mommy ain't around
Searchin' for a thug in the club to hold me down, ughh
Find the one that's running it all
Top dog, his game sunning em all, huh
Whiling out, people piling in
(Oh shit, watch out)
Damn not again
Another nigga knocked out, that's how it go
Move to the other side, another drink (let's go)

Repeat 1

Yo, yo, yo
Ladies are you feeling it
(Hell yeah)
Niggas are you feeling it
(Hell yeah)
What we gonna do with this shit
(Tear it up)
What you got beef with a bitch
(Play it up)
Shit, drunker than a mother fucker
Another round from the bar for my dog nigga
Here now (all night long)
Dance floor shoutin'
(That's my song!)
DJ mix it up, who got heat?
(Swizz Beats nigga what?)
Almost seeing double
Bet you be in trouble if he pull me
I got no time to cuddle
Fuck it let me have another drink
Damn how you get to the bar?
Let me think
Line for the bathroom, I ain't waiting in it
To the front chicks hatin'
(Uh-uh I know she didn't)
Shit yes I did, moving right along
Gotta get back before they play the last song
(Last call for alcohol)
Damn I knew it
Thirty minutes till it's over, better do it
One more drink, one more dance
Papi staring at me in the corner you got one more chance
Gotta eat, head to the diner
Thinkin' you gonna see me next week
(Try and find her)

Repeat 1 (2x)

All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my West Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my West Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my Down South niggaz get all the chips
All my Ruff Ryder niggaz get all the chips
All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my West Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my Down South niggaz get all the chips
All my East Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my West Coast niggaz get all the chips
All my Down South niggaz get all the chips
All my Ruff Ryder niggaz get all the chips
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
