Typed by: chanedogg@hotmail.com

[Chocs] Like...
[Jully] Turn it on, light it up, we gon set this.. on fire
[Chocs] Yeea, yeea, ha ha
[Chocs] We in the plane, floatin through the cloud, right
[Jully] Turn it on, light it up
[Chocs] From the inside turn down the lights right
[Jully] ..on fire
[Jully] Hit the trees, or hook the breeze, get your second plate for free

[Choclair]
Sit back, relax, inhale the 'dro watch clouds take shape
Then exhale slow.. you know!
Now you in the right mode, to float and fly
Hop in the ride, '81 Mustang, the T ditto side
The ride don't matter, flatter who?
It's all about we and the crew
And at 2 o' clock the girls'll pass through
That Suave Dawg game, and it's more than a few
The G-shorts and the tank tops'll do
With they hands on they boo - you know how we do
You know how these Canadians do
West Indian's, Asian, Latino's do
Holla at the birdy that be smilin at you
Even though your with the misses, she thinks your delicious
It's something that this blue sky does
Green grass, enough Bud, it's summer-time love

[Chorus 2x: Jully Black]
Turn it on, turn it on, light it up
We gon set this.. on fire
Hit the trees, or hook the breeze
Get your second plate for free

[Choclair]
Excuse me miss, don't mean to be rude but...
Damn, you looking good like food
Pumpin it so high feel like a candle
Your a coming to ride, this is what we gon do
Skip off your drawer, swim by Jamal's
And later on maybe you can work your drawers
I know sometimes I might get a little raw, but
Your candy eyes is I, candy an I, a
Can't even lie, I, let's see your thigh
I've been sizing you girl for quite some time
Don't got a lot of money so riches I can't buy
But ah, get with this vibe we can soar real high (high)
In the Century Sam, give a damn if they don't understand
Bald, heavy head high is the scribe
Look like we walk like we on high rise
At least in the minds, so we walk as such, yeah

[Chorus]

[Choclair]
Funk you up, we get down
You funking with the Suave Dawg chap, with ill dawg sounds
Funk you up, we get down
And when you mind right, you'll see
It's just family, clubs you don't need
So chill from the scene
About every hour puff the Al Green
Hop in the car, drive the 3-D
Blow down the windows, raise the P-B's
Parents, they roll up, don't understand we
I neck-snappin, hard, they can't catch the beat
It's just a Suave Dawg steeze
Not even thinking twice
Just feeling nice, riiight

[Chorus]

[Outro: Choclair]
If you chilling in the mind - light it up
If you all up in the back - light it up
Pockets on stand - light it up
Your pockets just flat - light it up
If you came to get down - light it up
If you make a loud sound - light it up
T dot get down - light it up</pre>
