[Intro]
Fireworks...
I want every Annie in this bitch

[Chorus: TeeFLii]
Swingin' you hair, got a nigga all on you
We can do whatever right here
Cause all I know is Annie you're a baddie
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, yeah
You can get it, you can get it
Yep girl, Annie girl
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, yeah
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it Annie girl

[Verse 1: TeeFLii]
Annie I'm feeling the same way you feeling
You know your body wanna go ahead and do it
See, women lie, men lie, numbers don't
I fuck your body every way
I be turning hood niggas all on to you
Girl, tonight I'm a be the one you ride

[Bridge: TeeFLii]
You showing me that you with it
You let me see you get with it
Annie girl you ain't playing, up in this club

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: TeeFLii]
Girl you got a nigga mind racing out of control
Tonight we can be trading places
Annie girl let me know
Tryna get you in my bed, yeah yeah
Your eyes rolling to the back of your head

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil C]
Damn, face, Cassie
Bad bitch and she do tricks, classic
In a one piece catsuit, Halle
That's why I love summertime out in Cali
Yeah, certified baddies, knock 'em all down, domino rally
Hit a West Coast nigga with the addie
Cause I'm tryna put the mayonnaise on your patty
Cause' you can get it
And that's word to the motherfuckin' crown on a fitted
Cause' Annie if you with' it you can have this
cowboy runnin through your hole like [?] ho

[Chorus]</pre>
