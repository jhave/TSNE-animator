[C-Murder]
This song right here don't pertain to my most loved.  P, Silkk, my cousin
Jimmy, my closest family.  This is a question to all my closest homies that I
die for cause I love y'all

A body can't live without a soul up in it
When you dead aint no second chance, but alive aint no limit
So you bein TRU to yourself
Well then die for something, then somebody else
I'm surrounded by more thugs then my eyes can see
But I still ask the question how many y'all would bleed for me
I'm C-Murder, but that don't mean shit to a bullet
I make moves with Silkk, cause I know he gonna pull it
I ask P the true meaning of being a brother
He said just some niggas that would die for each other
And can't be seperated by money and bitches
When apart we poor, but together we richer
Life is complicated like a game of chess
Anticipating check mate is like waiting for death
If I'm gonna die give the king his life
That's why I ask my soldiers would you ever think twice

Chorus
If I ask the question would you all be true
Would you ride for me like I'm a ride for you
And when times get hard and my life's at stake
Would you hesitate to eliminate x2

I got a question for Boz, would you ride for me?
To them Deli boys nigga would you die for me?
To my homies Kane and Abel would you kill for me?
If a motherfucker wasn't being real to me
And Fiend and Mac, I know you ready to roll
Cause the three of us done been through some shit before
Mia X, I know you always got my back
The Gambino's stay strapped, and me and Prime Suspect
Been shedding tears on the block forever
Just like Big Ed been TRU forever
Mystikal, nigga, would you pop that fool
But not before Serv-On gonna hit that fool
And then he gonna have you looking silly for sure
While V and ???? been watching the door
No Limit stay TRU cause we thugs forever
Would you hesitate, nigga, would you hesitate?  NEVER!

Chorus x4</pre>
