{*Intro: beat starts and Detective speaks*)

[Detective]
Point her out to me
Oh that's her
Not bad! 
Not bad at all
Let me talk to this bitch
Hello

[Girl]
I have drinked enough booze to tell me I could use a big stiff dick right now

[Detective]  
God damn baby you just met me let's get to know each other more

[Girl]
What difference doe's it make either you want to fuck or not

[First verse]
Eh, these Ho's be crazy
That's why I ride away to the hide away bumpin' Isaac Hayes
Seat back reclinin' in the 'Lac
My mind on my scratch
The beat gatt right on my lap imbibed n' no trap
I'm cold in fact, I hold the gat
Ain't never told the rat where the dossier at
I kept my composure
I popped the clover hopped in the rover
n' drove like a soldier on four king cobra's
Seen her house n' pulled over
Motorol'ed her like "come out side"
Fuck where we about to go let's ride
This ain't no punk bitch
When I met her she had on that louie sweater n' them tailored made manolo's
A nigga knew he did her 'cause I'm in ta' dat
I'm like (" wus doe's blonic's ?")?
Fired up the chronic
Sipped the tonic
Happy Hanukkah!"
She knew what I wanted when I was on to her
She hoppin' in the range now
So I can feel my bond with her
N' we ain't even got to leave the car
Got the T.V.'s the camera's n' the V.C.R
'Bout to make her a star!
Y'all know the deal
When your fuckin' freak ho's in your automobile

[First Chorus]
Come on let's fog up these window's
Turn the bump n' blaze a little endo
I wanna fuck but I don't wanna spend dough
You know the deal! 
Baby
Let me fuck in the automobile

[Second verse]
Eh,I love L.A. Ho's
I met this broad named Jodie
She used to drink forties with a little bit a stollies
Picked her up
Ran up in the broad in the rent a car
Soon as I was finished dropped her off on Laseanaka
Rollin' in a ol' skool on goe's
Ho's jockin'
Cause they ain't knowin' this shit's stolen
Pull it ta' tha liquor store
Actin' like I need something
Turned out
Left the car runnin' n' the beat bumpin'
I catch Ho's like I'm riding a stretch Roll's
Dipped in my best clothes
Sippin' on X.O
But no!
It's white tee shirt n' Jabo's
Or the creased Levi's, the five-o-five's
Hat pulled down over my eyes
You know the size of runnin' your chop's
Don't broadcast or televise
To none of them dude's!
Fuck her hard to chill
Just keep bumpin' bad broad's in your automobile

[Second Chorus]
 Come on let's fog up these window's
Turn up the bump n' blaze a little endo
I wanna fuck but I don't wanna spend dough
What's the deal? 
Baby!
Let me fuck in my automobile
Come on let's fog up these window's
Turn up the bump n' blaze a little endo
I wanna fuck but I don't wanna spend dough
What's the deal?
Baby!
Let me hit it in my autobile

[Third verse]
You can catch me slumped low in a 'vette
With a Ho n' mowet
She throwin' a fit 'cause I ain't stoppin' or going ta' get
Ridin' high in the 'burb n' never touchin' the curb
Trying ta' roll a dutch n' I swerve n' cut in your lane
Getting brain in the rain
We starin' in the Lebaron
But the bitch jus' looked n' laughed
She ain't carin'
Like this one little freak that I bumped at Roscoe's
Fucked her shotgun had that ass on the console
(Break down?) to a bus
The shit stay real
When your fuckin' wit them bitch's in your automobile
I pulled up in a seven douce cutty with knock
Ten gee sound system
 Everything else stock!
Baby girl in the passenger seat keep axin' ta' eat
I kept mean muggin' n' blastin' tha beat
Probably shoot her through the drive-thru"
You know the deal!
When your fuckin' mad bitch's in your automobile
Final chorus
Come on let's fog up these window's
Turn up the bump n' blaze little endo
I wanna fuck but I don't wanna spend dough
You know the deal!
Baby
Let me fuck in my automobile
Come on let's fog up this window's
Turn up the bump n' blaze a little endo
I wanna fuck but I don't wanna spend dough
You know the deal!
 Baby
Let me hit it in my automobile
It go!</pre>
