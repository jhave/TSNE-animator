[Chorus]
Scrathes - Aint the devil happy, haha
But now I can tell the depths of hell for evils ive done
Aint the devil happy, haha
But now I can tell the depths of hell, the depths of hell
Aint the devil happy, haha
But now I can tell the depths of hell for evils ive done
Aint the devil happy, haha
But now I can tell the depths of hell, the depths of hell

[Verse 1]
Yeah. I got story to tell this cat named Jamell
Got the 22 shells with perells (Pirellis) on his wheels
He was one of youngest on the block one of the livest
Never the type hide his burner when he hear the sirens
He was runnin' the city, runnin' with the grittiest, grimiest niggas
Hustlin all night up with insomnia
Watching the fiends glock in his jeans
And he visualized the life of Tupac in his dreams
Swimming in papes swimming in cake buckin' at jake
Beating a case then he fleeing the place
You the deal; money - power - respect
Dreams of a privat jet coke connect
Hoding techs he be set, but
As of know dude stuck on the cement
With bucket full of gin and a couple of his men
And still his mom dukes had to struggle for the rent
So the man walked around with a bundle in his hand
Trying to make shit right packing it up (2-5)
with the right amount of cut he better make shit right
Cuz it aint no refunds in the street, just guns in the street
And twelve year old niggas runnin' with heat
Aint the devil happy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
2 years later Jamell now holding his daughter
Facing alot of problems cuz his whole baby mama
And his life is gettin' colder and harder
But he was older and smarter
At least he of the block now though
But this young gun spitter met a young dumb sister
It was love a first sight soon as the nigga toungekissed her
Now he was trapped its foul but now its rap
And he was dumb enough to have a seed with her
She aint have no ambition in life no guidance
No vision in life just strippin' at night
In the crib she was christian and nice
But like to be on the block where niggas bustin like Israelites
Jamell was mistaken I don't know what he thinkin'
When he found the ho she was drunk and half naked
With a bunch of hoodrat birds that that pass they shit
Off to any dude like they body aint sacred
Now he's startin' to reminisce he can't take it
Put the burner to his dome and his hearts racin'
No he's faced with a decision and gotta make it
Does he hate his life so much that he would take (Blaow)

[Chorus]</pre>
