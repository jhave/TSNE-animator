[Krayzie Bone]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
But muthafucka makin' as I ain't the one
For a punk muthafucka with a badge and a gun
To be beaten on, and thrown in jail
But we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with a nigga cause a nigga turned major
And got a little bit of money and a pager
Searchin my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every thug nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see, me in the pen
Than me blowin' endo, rollin' in my Benz-o
I send the police to the grave
And when I'm finished
They will bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still gettin' swoll off bread and water
I don't know if their're fags or what
Search a nigga down, and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
Cause they'll slam you down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
But Krayzie Bone will swarm
On any muthafucka in a blue uniform
Just cause I'm from, the C-L-E
Them punk muthafuckas be afraid of me
Uh, a young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' around my way
Yo bitch I got somethin to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Bizzy Bone]
Fuck the police and Bone said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, and is with whenever I'm steppin'
Then the muthafuckin' weapon is kept in
a stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Bone was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
And plus it gives 'em a hint, not to step in my path
The police, I'm sayin': "Fuck you punk!"
Readin' my rights and shit - it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so we can see what's up
and we'll go at it punk and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Bone's gon' blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
And I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me
And any asshole, that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a helluva scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The muthafuckin' killer that's mad
With potential, to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Dig in the clip, yo, and this is the sound
BOOM BOOM - yeah, somethin like that
But it all depends on the size of the strap
Takin' out a police, will make my day
And a nigga like Bone don't give a fuck to say

Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...

[Layzie Bone]
I'm tired of this muthafuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my thug while I be thuggin' in the shack and
Shinin' them lights in my face and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much, but
I kick ass nigga or maybe cause I blast
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an A.K.
Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
Cause my identity along with my group cause it's violence
It's the Bone with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a thugster nigga
But still I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A nigga in a uniform waitin' to get shot by me
Or one of my niggas
And with a gat it don't matter if you're smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, I'm from the old school fool)
And as you all know Layzie Bone came to rule
Whenever I'm rollin' keep 'em lookin' in your mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb muthafucka with a gun
And when I'm rollin' off the 8, you'll be the one
That I take out, and then I get away
And while I'm drivin' off laughin' this is what I'll say
Believe that
 
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police, fuck the police, fuck 'em!!!
(surprise)
Fuck the police!!!
(You muthafuckin' right)...</pre>
