Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?

Missy, bring it in

[Missy]
Why you played on me?
Wasn't I good enough for you?
(Wasn't I good enough)
All those other girls you've been with
Can't do like I do (Do, do)
Gave you all my dough
When you needed it all the time
And if you planning on leavin' me again
Then give me a sign

(Say what, say what)

        [702]
1 - 	Beep me 911
	Or call me on my cell phone
	I'll call you back
	To see what you gon' tell me
	You don't wanna date
	No if's ands or waits
	It's over babe

	Beep me 911
	Or call me on my cell phone
	I'll call you back
	To see what you gon' tell me
	You don't wanna date
	No if's ands or waits
	It's over babe

[Missy]
Why you cheatin' on me?
Can you tell me what I've done
I thought you was the one
But you just a hit and run 
Gave up clubs and parties
I put them aside
(I stopped going to all the parties)
Left me in the dark with no kind of sign
(Why don't you give me a sign)

Repeat 1

All my friends say
I can do better than you
(Say what, say what)
Maybe they was right
Cuz I feel like a fool
(Fool, fool)
But I can't let you go
Until you take some time
To tell me why you left me without
A God damn sign
(Say what, say what)

Repeat 1


[Timbaland]
Magoo, Magoo

[Magoo]
Type of nigga' made built to last
Look homegirl I pump like gas wind
Get ya friend and ya girl and them
My sex drive workout like a gym can
Was the girl that I used to hit
You the girl that I got to quit
See the kitty cat
Gotta gold it like a light
In the night you the freak I'm out wit
Don't bite
No diggity, who took you out
No doubt when I first got down
Made the bro' shout
Look out, make it live
Dip and dive, stayin' alive
Shoot me sugar, there it is
Now we talkin' square biz
I'm leaving you without a reas(on)
What I steal, but a kiss
What you think, I'm hen pecked?
Girl, get yo mind checked
Take the time, recollect
I just gave you disrespect

[Timberland]
Ahh Like that? Like that?
Beep me 911 baby
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Say what? Say what?
Misdemeanor, 702
What cha'all gonna do fellas?
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 911</pre>
