Hmm hmm hmm yeah
You make me do yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
I never can erase
The love that you have placed inside
No girl, I can't deny
I just never felt that I
Would ever be the one to find
A special lady that'll make me do for love

[Chorus]
You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me wanting you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh no man can recognize
The love that's in the sky
I just had to let you rain all over me
Then one day it dawned on me
I had changed completely
I don't know just how it happened
But I love the way you make me do for love

[Chorus]
You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me missing you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
No I never thought I'd find
What love made of me
Come on the road with me baby
I open my eyes, so lovely
I love the way you make me do for love

[Chorus]
You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me thinking of you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh

You got me talking baby
You got me spending baby
You got me tripping
You got me hooked on...

[Chorus]
You make me do for love
What I would not do
Cause every day my love
You got me missing you
You make me do for love
What I'd never do
And what we do for love
That all depends on you
Ooh ooh
