Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	Everything over?
		Sounds can't be the end yet
Nah nah nah we can't go that route
	Uh-ahh
		That's what I'm sayin though!
*applause*
Yeah, everyone gather round, gather round
Now I'm gon' start it off first (why don't you start it off first)
And you gonna follow me, it goes like this

I'm lookin at this girl who's been livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl tryin to be fly
But behind the scenes she breaks down and cries
See she breaks down and cries caise she's livin a lie
But I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)
I'm lookin at this girl she's always high
Cause she likes to get by by stayin high
She's always high cause she always cry
cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die)

Yeah, yeah you got it, here we go (check it out)

I'm lookin at this girl wit her bloodshot eyes
You could really tell now by the size of her eyes
She got bloodshot eyes, cause she's always high
Cause she always cry, cause she's livin a lie
But I don't really know why she's livin this lie (here we go, one more time)
(Perhaps she'll die)

(Yeah, yeah) Last time, last time

I'm lookin at this girl tryin to hide her face
Cause she thinks she looks bad and her life is a waste
See her face she hides cause of her bloodshot eyes
Cause she always high cause she always crys
Cause she's livin a lie...
And I don't know why she's livin a lie
(Perhaps she'll die) Rrrrrrrahhh!

You don't really need-a, lyrical teacha
When I reach you through the particles and ways of the speaker
What I got to say is positive and negative
You draw whatever energy you need to live, give and take
Build and destroy, life and death
Inhale, exhale, of breath
The point is yes, everything in life is a choice
East and West, wack rapeprs or DJ KRS-One
Dunn I come like the ancients with a drum
Come along you can hum along or run along
Sing a song if you wanna sing a song
This meta-lyrical poet will surely put it on
I don't wear or count of frauds
but I can prophesize by lookin in your eyes
if you're right or wrong, it could be all
It's always the little things that control the big things
Undirected mind waves will bring a string 
of unexpected anything until you cipher
Whether niggative or negative you don't need either
You need to direct your thinkin through your speakin
Prevent the negative from leakin out into the atmosphere
Do I make myself clear?  Achieve a major goal this year
But don't ever step here

	Expertism, is lyr, lyr, lyr, lyricism
	My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
	My ex, my ex, my expertism
	Is lyr, is lyr, is lyr, lyr-i-cism
	My flow, my flow, my flow'll take you over
	My, my flow'll take you over
	My, my flow'll take you over, like
	My, my flow'll take you over, like...
