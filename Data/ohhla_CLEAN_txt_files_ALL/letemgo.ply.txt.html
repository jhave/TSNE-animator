(Come on)

[Verse 1]
Well heres a lil' story that we like to tell
About two bad brothas that you know so well
With a pimp gain shoe game know we up on that
Latin chicks, white chicks and you know we love them black (woo!)
Night(?) man, nightmare I can hit it right (I can hit it right)
Black rims 23s shorty we can take a ride (take a ride)
We get it crunk from wall to wall (wall to wall)
If your man is actin' up shorty gimme a call

[Bridge]
Come with me (You can come with me)
To my lavish suite (Come lay with a G)
And lay close with me (It's between you and me)
He ain't folkz with me (He ain't folkz wit me)

[Hook]
Let's goooo (Take a ride with me)
Lets goooo (He ain't a baller like me)
Let him goooo (Uh Skillz)
(Shotcalla like me, he ain't rollin' like a G, I'ma P.I.M.P baby!)

[Verse 2]
I'm not a playa I just crush a lot (crush a lot)
I keep them chicks impressed by the whips I got
You seem to bitch a lot cause your man ain't never there
So if you're tryna get away I can meet you there
And baby girl if we kick it you gon love that (love that)
If you a freak lemme know cause I can love that (love that)
You like the fact that I be rhymin' on tracks
And the ice on the wrist will keep 'em blinded till the fact
(Cause) I've always said what he can't see won't hurt
I'm on the side I can see it so it's gon work
I'm not the type to be hatin' but you need to let him (goooo)
Let's go!

[Bridge]
Come with me (You can come with me)
To my lavish suite (Come lay with a G)
And lay close with me (It's between you and me)
He ain't folkz with me (He ain't folkz wit me)

[Hook]
Let's goooo (take a ride with me)
Let him goooo (he ain't a baller like me)
Let him goooo (uh skillz)
(Shotcalla like me, he ain't rollin' like a G, I'ma P.I.M.P baby!)

[Verse 3]
Look I'ma balla, shotcalla
20 inch blades on a drop-top impala
Tryna get paid gotta stay on my grind
But it's girls I could self that stay on my mind (Chea)
You need to listen when I tell you to let him go
I'm on a mission to get ya without trippin' up
You already know what we about in the South
Take the pimpin' to the window watch 'em all ball out (Lets go!)

Said shorty's like wall to wall
Said shorty's like wall to wall (Eastside)
Said it's playas like wall to wall
Said it's playas like wall to wall (Westside)
Said the parties like wall to wall
Said the parties like wall to wall (Southside)
Said we ballin from wall to wall
Said we ballin from wall to wall (Northside)

[Bridge]
Come with me (You can come with me)
To my lavish suite (Come lay with a G) (Whoa) (Whoa)
And lay close with me (It's between you and me)
He ain't folkz with me (He ain't folkz wit me)

[Hook]
Let's goooo (Take a ride with me)
Let him goooo (He ain't a baller like me)
Let him goooo (Uh Skillz)
