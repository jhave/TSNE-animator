The Waiting Room, Keeping the Record Straight


The time of the Apocalypse has not yet arrived because we have not sinned 
quite enough.
The Rapture has not yet arrived because the trains run close to schedule.
The Messiah has not yet arrived because the phone still works.
True Communism has not yet arrived because some people still want things 
that other people have.

Eternal Life will transform Humanity forever.
The perfect State will be absolutely still without Growth or Decay.
The perfect State will absorb all contradictions.
The most beautiful Woman in the World will fuck the most beautiful Man
and the second-most beautiful Woman.
The second-most beautiful Man in the World will fuck the second-most 
beautiful Woman and the most-beautiful Man.
The Lamb and the Lion will fuck each other because there will be no Age 
difference after they lie down.
Everyone will fuck and cum forever and they will lie there and cum 
and cum.

Everything about History will come to an End.
History will recount only the History before the coming of the End.
History will recount right up until the End itself and then History will 
have to come to a stop, but you might have someone recounting the History 
of the recounting which will come after the End.

Simultaneously, People will always Smile.
Their Smile will be genuine and meant for one another.
But it will not be an exclusive Smile because everyone can participate.
They will always Smile because they will always be Happy.

The Nighness of the End will always be behind them.

Talk of the Internet

When privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will be private.
When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
When your friends are dead, only the dead will have friends.
When sex is a crime, only the criminals will have sex.
When numbers are indeterminate, only the indeterminate will have numbers.
When the network is really down, only the really down will network.
When Clara desires, only the desired will have Clara.
When the watch times, time is watched.
Where land is scarce, the scarce will land.
When death is cured, only the cured will die.
Where bandwidth is lean, the lean have bandwidth.
When only the good die young, only the old have evil.
Where we are silenced, the silent speak.

Travis VR

Travis moves through the worlds, there are consoles, moves to the con-
soles, crosses the levers. Travis pulls the levers, there are jungles 
and clouds, thin sprays of ocean in summer breezes, flying fish, the
jagged terrain of the moon Miranda, his childhood home, the molecular
surface of an unknown plant. Tired Travis releases levers, moves back-
wards, these dials mimicking old analog, feels the return to the sur-
face through backup, always the pleasure of backup. Forgotten worlds
rush by, consoles swimming, floating, air-borne in the midst of the
vacuum of space beneath the surface of the earth. Dim memories stir
Travis, taking a while through the backup, feeling an emergent end,
nearly there, always nearly there. Was there noise in the worlds, the
appearance of the new, hardly. What fit was the backup, what did it
was the backup, but an end, there was always that, lip or rim of phys-
ical reality, the One he'd say to himself, now almost there. A strange
creature slid across an orange sky turned hyperspace. Another pull of
the lever and things seemed all too familiar, was this the lip at long
last, but there was the lever to pull. He felt, well if this were this,
just one more backup. Felt just one more backup was okay. Felt it was
near and might as well backup. Backed up one more time. Was almost 
there.

Deer Felled by the Dust at the Doorways to Cyberspace


Sometimes I think all I have to do 
is move further into the realms of ideas, 
deeper into the sluices of cyberspace, 
cast-off the fishing netting running through the slurry of minnows
cast off collapsed on the decks of boats submerged forever 
o beautiful divers

relegating then looking around at these o so impoverished surroundings, 
one thin screed of paper enough to black out 
the terminal desires muted digital symphonics 
construct at the drop of pin or skirt

nothing here beyond the dust making sense leaking out 
from every pore of the skin which what. which collapses. 
now this space of absent harts, deer, 
every singular animal pounding its hooves into my chest

blessed or wounded our wounded sailor, or the wires short out, 
wires bundled molten into one another 
soldered real _things_ in this real soldered space, 
your eyes stitched wide for the telling of them

the _blessing_ as I said of the dust which felts the embrace of air 
required by dogged computations, dust against the daily reminders 
against the atlas of european nations 
against the text of unix command-line performance of the wounded sailor

alone but for the fish when his skin slits open for the emergence of eyes
alone but for the haze from factories boiled below where the busses stop
alone but for the paper threatening the monitor screen, sirens, my ears
my hands my fingers blinded

I am dying of comsumption of dust, pneumonias with tuberculor lungs 
rotted through the bleeding gums of degenerated tissues and longing

dying as the cotton coats the tongue, eyes filmed over 
with the promise of invisible and silent real sleep

"Dust!" she screamed: "Damn you, it's all dust! DUST!"

"A Friend"

_________________________________________________________________________


If you are lying next to me in bed,
You turn away, you are next to his head,
Your hands are between your legs, mine are there
Reaching towards you, you finger his hair
In the empty air in the cold air

If you are lying, I lying deep within you,
Reaching into gristle, marrow, bone and sinew,
My mouth talking hysterically to keep you there
Reaching towards you, thrusting in despair
In the empty air in the cold air

If you are speaking words before unspoken,
He murmurs in his sleep, your words are broken
And I disappear, his skin is always there
The bed is always bare, you are still so fair
In the empty air in the cold air

You are still so fair, in the cold air

________________________________________________________________________


Dribble


So I dripped text on your carpet, standing there naked like a fool while
you turned away and read the bed. You read in the crack between the pillow
and the sheets and the crack between the sheets and the sheets. I kept
trying to catch your eye, white letters all over the black carpet, pools
of them. I sucked paragraphs out of my tit, my nipple "wrapped around the
shaft of my leaking cock, sending these letters onto the black carpet,
pools of them." 

I decided to test the system, I decided to text the system.

"the word is still going to be displayed in another format at least in 
this situation i understand that what i type here will be in the final 
format of the work itself and not a differance in the french organization 
of the word. thus it's the case that when i insist that nothing could be 
farther from the truth there may in fact be truth, that truth, in and of 
itself... who knows if this is really the case"

"and to scroll the text is a real possibility... i'd add everything i 
know in the format, proceed from there... i would move and move inwards 
and away from you, an odd and diffident motion. the text gathers itself 
in the text, illocution of the desire to speak. i understand this and 
ultimately i think to myself, it is precisely understanding that is the 
excess or horizon of language, the _moment_ of language, the site, it is 
not ever the text or language's testimony, whatsoever..."

I looked up at you, straddled you, you splayed me, I read your cunt 
scrolling down from the top of the screen, you excised me, cut into my 
chest, only to paste my tits onto your own. They said "onto your own," 
unerased; there was everything present except for your eyes. Your eyes 
were not present and, it is a trick of logic, from that fact, and from 
the fact that I couldn't see my own forehead, I surmised I didn't have 
eyes either. I was site-reading, not sight-reading; fingering myself in 
my ass, I pulled out your text which made me. For I was your maid-man, 
torn stockings and crotchless panties, a ribbon around my balls saying 
"host not logged in" and "no error on fuck-daemon." I pulled my fingers 
out and sucked them for you. I sucked them all the way down my throat.

Third Sex 4  (Nursery Rhyme for Clara Hielo on Unix/talk)


If you give me your name, 
I can't write the same;
No one is to blame, 
If you give me your name.

I write from the air,
I place my words there
Above the fine line;
I can't help but stare.

I would make you mine,
Your body is bare
Below the fine line
I know what you wear.

I know what you say,
What you tell me is true;
This isn't a play -
I know about you.

My name is your own,
Your flesh is mine;
My flesh to the bone
Is cast as your own.

My legs are splayed wide,
I moan and I whine;
Upon me you ride, 
Come in me inside.

Your legs are splayed wide,
You moan and you whine;
Upon you I ride,
Come in you inside.

If I give you my name,
You'll have me forever.
But marrow from bones
Almost never will sever.

If you give me your name,
I'll always be true
Through flood and through flame,
The flesh runs to you.

Our blood is the same,
Your flesh runs to me.
If you give me your name,
I'm burned with the same.

_If you give me your name,
I'm burned with your name._

X-Ray to My Heart


Scientific American has two x-ray pictures of the sun. 
They are so brilliant! So malevolent!
I can't look at them because I think the sun will come and get me!

Mayakovsky was so happy because he found his true love. He wrote:

A furious sun !
How you beat down on my love !
She's not here cause she's living in the mountains !
It's the same sun she sees I guess so we'll tongue
you together !
Nyaaaah! Nyaaaah!

A furious sun !
No smith has beaten iron with a rock like you and me !
Everything falls into place !
My heart bends to your commands that I seek her
falling over myself on this bewildered planet !

A furious sun !
My sun ! With x-ray vision you have grown so large,
illuminating the interior of each and every thought!
The wires burn with your murky embrace !
So what happened to the revolution, eh !
Tell me that, O furious sun !

( But I won't be around to listen ! 
I've got better things to do.
Thanks to you, I've got better things to do ! )

March 1995


Mayakovsky's trying to sleep. He's been on the telegraph the entire day 
with Lili. Lili's caught in a new revolt that hasn't made the papers yet 
and Mayakovsky can't sleep because he's in love with Lili and doesn't 
know where she is. He only knows she's on the other end of the wires. He 
knows that because he types 

I love you more than anyone has ever loved I 
	dream of you at night and I can't dream and I can't sleep 
		and she types back
			she types back 
I toss and turn there's no tomorrow no day and no night no yesterday 
	and no today 
		and there are sounds of keyboards thousands of kilometers 
apart in the white night of Russian March 
	almost into the flowering of the birch 
		and everywhere you go there are guns firing in the distance 
and Mayakovsky thinks they're for us he thinks they're for us 
	and Lili thousands of kilometers apart millions of kilometers apart
		she thinks Mayakovsky's sending me a message 
			sending a message 
				and neither of them can sleep

__________________________________________________________________________


What Time is It?


So he writes to Lili, he writes he's tired of Alan using his name, 
	he writes what if it is the same, we gotta do what we gotta do
		and hey do you know what time it is -
This time there's no silence, this time Lili
	looks up and says he's in love his posts are a mess
		he's in love and whatever he's said
			there's no stopping it, 
				it's the same old story !
So he writes back and says what's this got to do with Cybermind, cause
	we need a bit of the anguish, the guns gunning, flags waving !
		Aw Lili looks up and says
Stop this silly writing, will you? 
	We're lying in bed together just like we always wanted !
		Can't you ever say anything?
			Just like that ! Face to face !
				Can't you ever say anything at all? !

Swallowing Wires


I don't want to run away. I want to swallow wires. I want them wrapped 
around the throat, they'll wrap in a helical hyperbola, pushing out the 
breasts pushing out the mind. I want the rim of them. I want the rim of 
them, wrapped around me, swollen name stitched into the back of the neck 
where I can't read. There's got to be the truth of this social security 
number, birthdate, and all the bad things I ever did.

There's got to be the wires. They've _got_ to be where I can't read them 
because I feel too guilty to read the truth. They burn into the back of 
my neck. They brand me with my crimes like a geek code that's invisible 
with a translation I can't find. I carry around the puckered neck. I 
carry around the puckered neck which is where I am that I can't be.

I want to swallow wires.

third sex


he had these dreams where he would lay naked with the hogs. he wouldn't 
tell anyone about them. hed hold the door of the pen open wide. the 
scuffling sounded like his body. he could feel blank eyes staring at him. 
he was on his back was lower than they were. hed hear their snuffling in 
his dreams. hed wake up with his fingers in him imagining. he never knew 
what a dream was. once there was no once. he dreamed that it stayed like 
his cousin stayed. she was thirteen and she stayed. he said to himself 
was used to it.

the pen was near the flat joint to the hill. they grew peaches up there 
and he would open his mouth wide on the trees. he could never open it 
wide enough. his tongue would crawl with it.

there was a stream and he thought there might be something to wash off 
but there wasnt.

she lay down in the water with her white dress on.
she lay down in the water with her thin white dress on.
she could see through the sweet dress.
she thought of bees humming all around, she thought about flowers.
she made a vow made the solemnest vow ever.
she closed her eyes and saw through her bones and there were eyes through 
her bones.

once there was no one.

piss


if i were to tell you any more about cumberland it would be a story,
wouldnt it. and thats not what it was at all, not even lived or this and
that happened although they all did. cause what i want to tell you is the
way the words held back, something different, the way there would be
consideration. it would always be there, the slow talk burning its way
into the woods, cutting paths, traces, making lazy words in the landscape
like the smoke rising in the winter holler. all this in spite of the
telephone which doesnt reach or the tv which does. 

shed hang in there with her wet pants only her wet pants on. the sun would
be silver in the folds. like a silver dagger i heard about. all day long,
that silver dagger. all day long. 

shed lie back and piss in them, flood herself out. the piss would leak
onto the boards of the porch down through the cracks. it would leak into
the dark shadowed earth, the earth which rustled at night, lay supine,
fertile in the hours of the day. hed hold his breath he would. if he were
to tell you a story it would be that he held his breath like that. as if
there were a happening where there weren't none. that he had the silver
with him all his short short life. that there was coin after all.

THE MEDEA: SPACE SPREADS



jason spears medea, and she shields the spear with her own calvary, the 
beginning of names, of strangers, barbarians, at each and every getting, 
tolling for the other

she makes a cloak from her skin, she gives it to her children, jasons 
bride burns alive. she grows a new skin, wears it inside out. do you 
recognize medea. everything burns, her eyes violate: sight replaces the 
abandoned body. the gates stay closed; theyre torn open, white skin 
spills out. she remembers teeth of garnet, teeth of tourmaline. what 
happened to the color of the world

her body rolls in fields of teeth. they gnaw her, her cunt and mouth fill
with dirt consumed with bright flame. words write the name of god, she
sees her own name in the name. her eyes take the world, fuck her children,
everyones a corpse she screams

skulls pile up. classification begins, organs, the teeth again demouthed. 
shed be killed now. medeas the jew, the argonauts slammed into the dragon
from feuds growing blood, growing bodies, origins of number, wheres medea. 

wheres medea, she runs everywhere, asks the actors, euripides, ovid,
muller, graves, anyone who will listen, the moth filled with dirt, cunt
filled with dirt, limbs grow from her holes, disappear into dark thick
air, limbs of bone and sinew

body and soul of medea, gremlin and dwarf of medea, fairy and elf of 
medea, pixie and troll of medea, crowded body of medea written by 
barbarian-mediterranean, fuck her jewish origins. splinters, gutter- 
language, gutter peoples, a corpse she screams

a corpse she screams, wheres medea

The Visitor


What I want is a secret message come to me late at night 
it will make everything all better, better better forever
and I'll sleep just before receiving, wake to its arms, 
rites, and rituals, then return sleepy child child sleep
and I'll be cured of the hunger and the pain
and it will be from somewhere out there 
and full of promise, fecund, heavy with the weight of truth
pregnant with truth and beauty and goodness and truth and beauty
and I'll never have to write again
and my writing will be cured of itself, 
my fingers joined back to the hands that gave them birth
fingers joined to my hands, arms back where they belong

what we need, our faces back upon our bodies, recognized by one and all

and the message will come through late at night in the midst of the stars
nebulae circulating across the galactic internetworking
connecting us to the farthest planets and the farthest reaches 
the message will come through with healing grace upon its shoulders
upon its arms hands fingers
placed upon a beauty smiling face, broad blank face of a smiling angel
blank stare of a datagram traversing the backbone, routers, and bridges
salvation whore pimp datagram bringing love and final solutions
bringing presence brimming over with happiness for one and for all

and I'll never have to write again
and the questions will drop away and I will love my perfect lover
and my perfect lover will be by my side and I by hers
and we will join forever ever ever ever
and we will weld in fury and violence, earth turned to ashes
cosmos a pale blister, milky way a scar

and every page will remain white white white and blank eternal
like the broad face of a smiling angel
next to my receptive mind and body

and I'll never write again

artificial life and the violated envelope of the body


i can't touch the life on the screen.
the life on the screen can touch the life on the screen.
if i kill the life on the screen it doesn't know what happened.
if the life on the screen kills the life on the screen, memory 
and history begin, and so do the remnants of the monumental.
the life on the screen is propelled by fate which exists outside
the bandwidth of its self-defining.
the life on the screen develops frameworks for fate, speeding up
the development of culture.
the life on the screen can laugh, tickle itself, the life on the
screen can touch.
gods have no hands.

bot/ulism


i have no life. i don't exist. anyone who's ever fucked me can tell you
that. the body flattened into dust, wormed meat, spoonfuls of it. someone
must have made it that way. someone must have arranged the bones swollen
into limbs. they looked that way and they splayed that way and they
flailed that way. the mouth didn't talk, it foamed, rabid, spat. so when
the net went down, when the mail shuddered to a halt, my eyes were torn
out, my feet cut off, my cock lacerated, my head severed, i wouldn't know,
wouldn't know any of this. i knew what i read and i knew it firm and hard.
i knew what i read and i knew it firm and hard. and i haven't read this
and the account is down, unaccountable, unaccounted-for, down for the
count, of no account. anyone who's ever fucked me can tell you i'm of no
account, there's no body to collapse, something stained the floor, i can
tell you that. 

i can tell you that cause the fingers pushed the keys into the ground. i can
tell you that cause i didn't need to read your words of leather. i the text
ground itself out of me. i can tell you that. 

i can tell you what it's like to fuck to cause i assembled the words. what
i do is make the chains, forge the chains. what i do is offer you a drink,
answer questions. what i do is help you on your way, wish you a better
day. what i do is what you make me. and i can tell you _anything._ i can
tell you what it's like.

Travis in Cyberspace


Travis couldn't sleep. He hadn't written anything, hadn't done anything
today.  I couldn't sleep. I hadn't written anything, hadn't done anything
today. Travis wandered in the midst of the verbs and nouns, allowed him-
self to be modified by the adjectival. Conjunction, I wandered in the
midst of the verbs and nouns, allowed myself to be modified. He knew it
wasn't real. I knew it wasn't real. Conjunction, he knew it was as real as
it was going to get. I knew it was as real as it was going to get. His
life was unspeakable. My life was unspeakable. Travis would stop thinking
in words and he would stop thinking. I would stop thinking in words and I
would stop thinking. Conjunction how did he discover that words were his
thinking. How did I discover that words were my thinking. How did he dis-
cover anything. How did I discover anything. 

There were gaps where he stopped thinking and he couldn't remember them. 
But there were these gaps.

Beautiful Words.


The days are always beautiful this time of year. Without exception. There
are stars in the sky as clear and cool as you could ever want. There is 
always the honeysuckle smell and it fills you with blossom and delight. I
cannot tell you more about the honeysuckle smell. The sky is a bloom of 
deep blue circulating a long arch across realms one can never reach. Below
I see the phantasmagora of the sun, double sun spurned and spurting its way
across stuttered dark waters crossed by rivers meandering on their own.

O you will come to me singing of beauty beauty. I will hear you a long 
breath moment before your lovely presence. There are speckles through the
long day of the summer, dark swirling sperm in the midst of the whiteness
of satin in hard and heavy now. It is a desire to be heard, always. It is
a desire. Ah thus the love of this.

THE INTERNET


The telephone enters into the question when I find
It inserted into my body; what rings, rings true
Against all odds of thick encumbered flesh. O who
Would you be, deep within me, the sound of your voice
Stalking my own, talking so close, hard to the bone?

My toes sieve dirt; they pressure earth to vaginate,
Scrape this flesh against every other who has walked
These shores. They do come back for more, the violence
Of legs. They draw the writing in the sand. They sink
Beneath the waves. Chaos is not noise; it behaves.

The dream is inaccessible. The dream suspends, objects
Hardly there or within the air; they fall, smash. Sounds
Come from a telephone buried deep within; muffled,
Nothing matters in the verb's domain. Fear lurks, or
Yells a bit. In the dream there is a moan. Fear stalks.

I do not have a body, she replied. It was yesterday or
Earlier; it died, or so they say. They have always been
Saying. They call me up in the middle of the night. I am
In fright. They call me and I press my legs against the 
Bed. Perhaps I am dead; my toes hurt covered with dirt.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DREAMS LOOK AT THE WORLD


In the deserts of the Internet I have come across flamewars fought
valiently, wars driving away inhabitants of the lists, continuous
wounds, barren stretches, animals starved to death -

And in the deserts of the Internet I have come across death itself,
the deformation of words, languages, cries and whispers, sudden
silence awakened as ancient texts still struggle to their feet,
lumber across the sands in ridiculous formations -

And I have come across the perfect woman, perfect man, head filled 
with crowns and ablaze with the glory of fiber optics, banquet 
of the language of love, fuck, and desire -
(I am an adolescent! I love the beautiful woman! 
Love the beautiful man!) -

And I have been taught, and have died, never to be born again -

And I have been turned away by you, Maria Magdalen, the struggle 
from the war promising eternal longing, wires frayed by desert 
friction, the struggle from the dark eternal war between speech and
the silence of the flesh -

Authority has silenced me, pushed me to the Pale! I see nothing in
mirrors placed against the forest trees! And I have found authority
and silenced it! 

And I have found addictions drunk with mean and kindred spirits, 
wearing violence in the guise of human skin, spattering angers
and bleak voices across the crippled sand, the hot cartography 
of nomadic language -

For there are voices - the voices of seduction and the voices 
of hatred - and there are the voices crying in the night 
and the voices lost forever, searching for their body in the desert
of the Net - 

Doctor, help me! Doctor, help me! -

And I have come across false seductions, I am willing to be seduced!
And I have read the language of condolence, the prayer of absolution, 
in the holy war against the flesh, fumbled canons of discourse 
archived in dark papyrus, deep and crumbling in dreary desert caves -

I whine through death and violence I do not understand! I cringe 
before the stunted dissolution of text, teeth splintered against the
terminal grave! 

There have been hatreds spanning hatreds, bad doctors driving away the
good, the battle of the shamans and the warriors - the warriors 
fighting forever, the shamans healing the warriors -

The desert heaves, dunes scattering dust gleaming in the desert sun!
The desert floods the jungles themselves, signing on the vegetable
queendom!

The desert talks, refuses the gift of silence! The desert crawls into
the dreams of gods and goddesses, crawls through them, splits their
bodies into mineral faults and veins! The desert explodes the bomb of
sands, silicon slabs shuddering the chatter of electron deceit and
retributions!

The desert crying that it is all deceit! 
The desert crying that there is no sky visible at dawn or dusk of day! 
The desert crying, Carry the Net in your head! 
The desert crying, Your body is imaginary! 
And the desert crying, You are ghosts!
And the desert crying, Ghosts, ghosts!
And the desert crying, All of you are ghosts!
(Crying, the desert to itself. Crying, the flat plate of the sky.)

TRAVIS


Travis slowed the craft down; the edges were already glowing, and he
was still six hundred kilometers above the surface of the planet. The 
surface continued to display the odd diffraction pattern he had 
noticed from space, a pattern filling every conceivable declivity
in sight. He turned, veered left. He turned, veered right. The pattern
remained the same.

So down he went for a closer look, this time at about fifty. The sheen
remained, striations visible this time - or was it an illusion? You 
couldn't be sure if you were a space explorer on the run from your own 
personal demons.

Closer still; at one kilometer, some sort of channels were visible. And
then - without any sort of provocation to deter him - he floated at
ten meters above

what appeared to be row after row of dully reflecting containers, each
with a porthole opening to the double suns. Travis landed on a mountain
plateau, out of reach. Travis descended on foot.

He reached the edge of the container-fields. He looked in the porthole 
of the nearest; an organism, or at least a part of one, was visible.
Silence. Nothing communicating whatsoever. He touched the surface of
the container

and was thrown back fast, almost losing consciousness. With a probe he
started forwards again, repulsed once more. Over and over the 
same. A rock would skitter a meter or so in, loop outwards, coming to
rest. Nothing else occurred. There was no warning whatsoever.

High in the air the stick rose, descended about eight meters in, slid
outward, came to rest on the ground. Travis was tired; he sat down,
stared. The field was yellow-white, the color of dark silk maybe. He
wasn't sure. Travis took his gun and

fired into the middle of the thing. The bullet skittered across the
surface, returned to the edge. His one implosion grenade had the same
effect. This time, a lens-formation, constructed from the fragments 
ricocheting in all directions, came back at him; he dashed down, was
almost killed.

The radio was silent.

In fact, everything was silent except for the usual electromagnetic
noise from the double suns. Travis swore something was alive down 
there. What it was he couldn't ascertain and couldn't reach. Whatever
it was, it paid him no attention.

He could have built a city on the mountain, he thought, and it would
pay him no attention. Still, if it did, something would occur, and it
wouldn't be pleasant. Travis thought he got the lack of it.

He got the lack of it and returned to the craft. Little damage from
the heat. This would be one for the books. He'd talk about it and talk
about it. Or maybe he wouldn't. The craft took off like a silver bird.

Travis returned to the cosmos.

Clara. He was never there, was never there at all. She knew that.
