[Chorus]
Yellow Heaven
The world is yellow
Freedom, oh yeah
Feel your sorrow

5:35 and I'm living senseless
Just another homie picking on the defenseless
Don't request yet, nothing really to mention
Looking through the mirror and I'm making a censure
Whoa, black people in the mall grease
Came around the corner and she caused me to freeze up
Ease up, watch how the world could tease us, ease us
But only G.O.D can please us
Hey, got my ride and my Momma's too
Show me how to roll without breaking the rules
Paying my dues, MC's dropping out choose
Decides to get with lyrical facts, don't stop
Whoa, black people dying to shop
Everything is fine when you're losing your mind
I'm like a black alley cat, freestyle battle rap
Doesn't get better than that, is that a gat in the back?

[Chorus]

And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the warrior's blood runs red through the hearts of the dead
And the Valkyrie's blood runs red through the halls of the dead
And the life you're been looking for in the world that you live
And the life you're been looking for in the world that you live 

In the name, we were all born in the flame
Not the same, but under the moon on the desert plane
We roam, home, take the ?coast ghost?
I saw with my naked eye, way to close now
I was the son of a man on a mission
Who worked with his hands and brought him the former land
In the inter-land, swinging the mic like an axe
With a fear in the atmosphere, laying down tracks

[Chorus]</pre>
