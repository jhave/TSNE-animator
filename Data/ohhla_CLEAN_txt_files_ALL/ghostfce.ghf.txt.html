[Chorus: female singer (Ghostface Killah)] 
Ghostface... (Yo, yo who's the boss when it comes to these songs?) 
Ghostface... (What ya'll talkin' bout... I can't hear ya'll!) 
Ghostfaaaaaaaace!! (A little louder) 
Ghostface... 

[Ghostface Killah] 
Yo, you can catch me in Z-No's on a Friday night 
Or at the Emmy's, Bentley's, Roll Royce, all white 
Fresh kicks, star studded up 
A ounce of Gertest to hold me til them Theodore and Deini's roll up 
Soak my hands in olive oil, loyal to each, Diamond 
Shoot out the clock while I'm killin' timin' 
Eight-mill just to resign me 
My bitches go crazy and pull they hair out when they can't find me 
It's like, all he say.. Mr., Mr., D.J. 
Bring it back like an instant replay 
Please, get these wack records off of me 
I can't breath, ashtma pump so I could stop the weez 
It's like they love garbage (yeah), for God's sake, I'm the real artist 
Hear they songs, dumb niggas father's 
Under my wing like Sanford and Son 
Weird sons, I'm a big gun, like Big Pun, Big L and Jason 

[Chorus] 

[Ghostface Killah] 
I'm like a green and white kickball, I bounce 
Spin off walls and cars, the Wizard of Clarks, Tony Oz 
In the third grade, I bagged Penny 
Well Butter on your burns, guess Daddy was concerned like many 
Now Daddy's blowin' 'sherm and Remi 
On the road toll up, bust the promoter so I can shit in Denny's 
This is Tone-Tana, spangled banded with four hammers 
Bangles get tangled and they cause manners 
Money, don't stop, get it, get it, I'm not finished with it 
Menaced out, tell your click that Dennis did it 
Rock them boats and I copped them ropes 
Resurging the mics, I deal with only knives and throats 
Hold my tongue around fake niggas 
Look at 'em sideways and pull my trees 
Ask me to hit it, I'm like, Nigga Please, fuck outta here! 
Fuck war with niggas, facin' me, fuckas, step up the gear 

[Hook: Ghostface Killah] 
Ghost dough and spend it though 
Plus got the pen exposed 
Countin' mad money and sheep, god damn 
Take a look at the radio, shit soundin' shady, yo 
Everything I'm hearin' is weak 
We got them long biscuits, long clip shit 
Run for the hills and re-charge your shit 
Come back if you think that you are-are do-do-do-don! 

[Chorus] 

[Outro: woman] 
The dopest, flyest, O.G., pimp, hustler 
Gangsta, playa, hardcore muthafucka living today... </pre>
