[Verse 1]
Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity
I wanna' make sure all's hearin' me
Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud
On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now
Kickin' up lyrics that others wanna' rock to
Rock like me, y'all this you can't do
The v, the a, the n, the i, the lla y'all
It's vanilla

[Chorus]
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up

[Verse 2]
Hold on girl, let your feet move free
cause you move to the groove of vanilla i-c-e
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap
If you a ho, get off my lap
cause ice stands for bein' so cold
That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold
Jerome stands for m.p.a
My personal assistant, every day
I'm not an mc who come here to play
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic
When I see one, I got to have it
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum
What you gonna' do? don't you play dumb
Busy like kizzy, groovin' like rubin
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'
Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin
Simple like simon, with ice rhymin'
Some mc's fakin' it, but I'm the diamond
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call
You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Start skeezin' and move that hip girl
Get in the mood and don't you quit
Smooth as slime, king rhyme
Rock it boy, cause it's a craime
I'll make you scream like you're in between
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king
cause I'm hungry as a dog, i'll eat up
My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt
cause I'm a throne overtaker, not an mc faker
I like my coffee, but I can't stand sanka

[Chorus]</pre>
