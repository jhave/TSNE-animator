[T-Boz]
Not everbody knows just how to do it
Some just learn it on the way
Once you get it right, ain't nothin to it
If you wanna get it right, you gotta learn to pace

1 - 	[TLC]
	Make it smooth, take your time
	Make it groove, in, out, in
	Make it last
	Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss my ---
	Ah, ah, ah

2 - 	[T-Boz and Chilli]
	This is how it works
	Wrap your hands around my body
	This is how it works
	Go due south
	This is how it works
	Melt yourself into my body
	This is how it works
	Kiss my mouth

[T-Boz and Chilli]
Some guys think they know the answers
Everybody knows how to make you scream
If most guys took time out their fantasies
Maybe we could stop our make believe

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Left Eye]
Ready, set, go
You don't have to know
We can take forever, learn together any flow
Touch me slow, watch it grow
Kiss the tip, gently flow, be my ho and take the show
We can watch it in slow-mo, when the sweet and low drips
Don't forget to let me wet my finger tips
Write love letters back and forth across your lips
Spread my hips, count to eighty, eighty ways, eighty trips

Repeat 1 while:

3 - 	[Left Eye]
	One time for you mind
	Two times if ya tense baby, let it unwind
	Three counts, let it bounce
	To the mothafuckin' ounce
	Here we go, now you know 4th down
	Let it flow back around, come on
	Kiss my, kiss my, mm-wah

Repeat 2

[T-Boz] (Chilli)
Is the way it works (yeah, yeah)
Is the way it works
Is the way it works (yeah, yeah)
This is how you melt my body

Repeat 2 while:

[T-Boz] (Chilli)
Is the way it works (yeah, yeah)
Is the way it works
Is the way it works (yeah, yeah)
This is how you melt my body

Repeat 2 and 3 (simultaneously) to fade</pre>
