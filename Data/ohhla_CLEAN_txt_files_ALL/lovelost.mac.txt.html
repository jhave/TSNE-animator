Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Where'd you go, and what'd you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don't you just come on back home?

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm a fucking workaholic, with a passion in my heart
Treating rappin' as an art in which you'd have to be a part of
I just copped a new car to hear it start up
Try to do the right thing then please karma
All I want to know is where the fuck did you have to go
I been waiting on you baby, why don't you leave and come on home
I cant be mad I'm living my dream
(going all around the globe)
Although you said you think you love me
(you need to let me know)
So I been fucking all these hoes
And I been blowing all this cash
'Cause baby this just the beginning
And I'ma make all of it back

[Chorus]
Where'd you go, and what'd you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don't you just come on back home?

[Verse 2]
Hey, its all good everybody tryna eat tonight
Tryna go to sleep having good dreams tonight
So go home, it might get better
All I know it don't last forever
So take it while you got it tryna get a little more
They say I'm getting better than I ever been before
Well that's for sure, tell 'em what I do
Rap keep me fed like a school getting soup
I been out here on the road and now they missin' me at home
All these ex girls that I used to know are hittin up my phone
But I ain't here, I guess you can call back
Sex drugs and rock and roll I think ill take all that

[Chorus]
Where'd you go, and what'd you do
How the hell you make me fall in love with you
And then you leave, and now you're gone
All I got is this damn song
So I can feel but I cant touch
You said my love was a bit too much
Broke my heart cant find no crush
So why don't you just come on back home?</pre>
