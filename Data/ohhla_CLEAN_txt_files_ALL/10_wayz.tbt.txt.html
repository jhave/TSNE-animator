Turn it up

Ten ways to a G
Three situations - pay attention to me

[Fresh]    Yeah, yeah
[children] Ten!
[Fresh]    First, ya gotta go get the chips
           Scope out the section, tell 'em, "Go get the bricks."
[children] Nine!
[Fresh]    Then ya gotta find a place to meet
           You better bring your heat 'cause them villains ain't sweet
[children] Eight!
[Fresh]    Ya better let your chick drop to get 'em
           And follow that broad to make sure them people not with 'em
[children] Seven!
[Fresh]    Don't bring (?) around your house
           Cause you don't want that heat pepper nowhere round your house
[children] Six!
[Fresh]    See how it come back before you start
           And if it come short bring back everything you bought
[children] Five!
[Fresh]    Wait, if lil' daddy on the street
           Cut the cake, hit the hood the next day about eight
[children] Four!
[Fresh]    And if you can't move it all, call your dog
           Jam him up, and tell him, "Fool, me and you about to ball."
[children] Three!
[Fresh]    Split it up - four quarters-a-piece
           And if y'all do that everyday, that's fifty-six-a-week
[children] Two!
[Fresh]    When the money start comin', keep sellin'
           Don't buy nothin' special unless you got good credit
[children] One!
[Fresh]    Make sure you put some money aside
           And in a month call the man and tell him, "Bring a extra five."

Ten ways to a G
Two situations - pay attention to me

[children] Ten!
[Fresh]    Gotta floss everyday of my life
           Forget the price - get the ice, hit the club every night
[children] Nine!
[Fresh]    Buy the ball, let 'em know you a star
           When everybody come outside to see the dubs on your car
[children] Eight!
[Fresh]    They gon' hate - so keep that tool
           Scratch off and holler out the window, "Boy, I'm a fool!"
[children] Seven!
[Fresh]    When ya meet, take a broad to plug
           And make sure that chic was the baddest broad in the club
[children] Six!
[Fresh]    Lay it down when you're comin' around - bumpin' the sound
           Got the truck touchin' the ground
[children] Five!
[Fresh]    2000 Range Rover, you see
           Leather, wood, television all over it, B.
[children] Four!
[Fresh]    Watch bracelet - wodie, shop daily
           Everything them wannabe's got, I played it
[children] Three!
[Fresh]    Two dice on the block - keep it real
           Bet the house that's about two-point-five-mill
[children] Two!
[Fresh]    Keep cheddar - what you got, I can match it
           Ride everything chrome, rock everything platinum
[children] One!
[Fresh]    Keep shinin' 'til it burn me out
           But never ever let the money, baby, turn me out

(Hook2x [children])
Ten ways to a G
One situation - pay attention to me

[children] Ten!
[Fresh]    Tell a broad, "Everything for free.
           You can shop 'til you drop, shorty, all on me."
[children] Nine!
[Fresh]    Number ten ain't nothin' but a lie
           Don't buy the broad nothin', and I'm 'bout to tell you why
[children] Eight!
[Fresh]    Sell the skank a dream bigger than life
           And she gon' stick around for the shoppin' spree, alright
[children] Seven!
[Fresh]    Tell your broad you know me, and we jam tight
           And you like what I like, and you gon' be alright tonight
[children] Six!
[Fresh]    Nine times outta ten I went out with the broad you with
           But that shouldn't stop you from doin' what you do, slick
[children] Five!
[Fresh]    Then turn to her - tell her you love her, and don't laugh
           And if I had a penny, baby, then you got half
[children] Four!
[Fresh]    What's yours is mine, and what's mine is yurn
           And you got it right now - 
           and that'll leave a-thousand dollars to my tax return
[children] Three!
[Fresh]    At this point, if you love me, 
           you'll make my fantasies come true
           And if she say, "What it is?" - 
           To sleep with your sister and you
[children] Two!
[Fresh]    Don't love these (?) - love yourself
           And if you pay attention to this you'll have plenty of wealth
[children] One!
[Fresh]    I'm done, and I ain't got nothin' else to say
           'Cause I can't think of nothin' to rhyme with this shh.. 
           y'all have a nice day

[children]     Ten ways to a G
[Mannie Fresh] Good night, everybody
[children]     Ten ways to a G
[Mannie Fresh] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[children]     Ten ways to a G

[Mannie Fresh]
What?

Now looky here

[children]
Ten ways to a G

[Mannie Fresh {talking}]
I gave you three situations
And ten ways to deal with it
You see what I'm sayin'
If you apply that to your everyday-life
whether you slingin', you dig
Ballin'
Or playin' on broads
You, too, can be scraped
I said scraped - that's right - scraped
See what I'm sayin'
And these (?)
I mean, we gotta get together - marry yourself, man
'cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself
Know what I'm sayin'
Go marry yourself, go on a honeymoon - treat yourself
I mean, 'cause can't nobody cheat on theyself
You gon' be with yourself, but you can't cheat on yourself
You know what I'm sayin'
Man, that's ballerrific
Stuntastic
And I like to say one more time: good night
Mmm-hmm
And tell myself, "Self, I am so enfatuated with you."

[self]
Hey, thank you
I'm enfatuated with you, too

[Mannie Fresh]
Good night, self

[self]
Good night
Good night, Mannie
I love you</pre>
