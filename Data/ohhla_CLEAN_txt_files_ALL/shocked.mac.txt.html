Intro:  Mac(Fiend) 
What's up world
(Whoa nigga) 
Welcome to the battlefield
(Shell Shocked nigga) 
Where all them niggas is Shell Shocked
(9-8) 
Ya heard me
(Shell Shocked nigga) 

Chorus:  Mac
I represent them Shell Shocked niggas
Them on the block with it cocked niggas
Them cell block niggas
Them run up in your hot spot niggas
Them if we doin bad gimme what you got niggas

Verse 1:  Mac
Oh I hit the stage with a vengeance quotin that murder sentence
Make 'em wanna act a fool and get some blood up on they tennis
Nigga, you ain't with me come and get me I'm strapped
We can take it to them streets or we can rap, so what's hap? 
King Solomon's my nigga till they kill us at war
Whoever said they saw it, get them dirty gats to them jaws
The microphone assassin, you heard about me, so nigga don't doubt me
You fuck around and get that can a murda murda out me
I hold a grudge like them bitches hold dicks, infiltrate whole cliques
While I'm stompin in them soldier kicks
Fifty dollars, that's a killin no doubt
Sleepy Eyes, that's my nigga put the gat to they mouth
It's been a long time comin, I keep the shit runnin
Tell them niggas who was holdin that beef, the cooks comin
Tank Dog til they bury me, I cross my heart
Bury me with camo and ammo in case the devil wanna start somethin

Chorus

Verse 2:  Fiend
Well I'm that nigga Sleepy Eyes, all my weapons are camouflaged 
disguised
Born despised, that's when they named me ?Yaffa yaffa five? 
Chemically grown for murda, murda it be my clone
Mister Shell Shock and get it on Jones up in your home
Watch me hit 'em, get 'em, lit 'em, Fiend gon split 'em
Ya ain't know it, I got it bucked on that let's go get 'em
Form my tent gear rhythm, causin ghetto circumcisions
Betta be barred behind prison, than facin this expedition
On a mission with my right hand man Mac, my brother
Use a garbage bag to smother mothers and they lovers
Undercovers fear us, can't watch, we got it on lock
My baby's first words gun glock, cause that nigga's Shell Shocked

Chorus

Verse 3:  Mac
Big Mac, that's my daddy, rotten dirty straight up soldier ya heard me
Ain't no secret one of the realest niggas I creep with
Since I was little taught me what's real
Gave me the skill on how to tote that loaded steel
And I, I kill kill
Deep nine Train gave me his name
Gave me the game, gave me them thangs
Ya fuck with me, he'll give you a bullet in yo brain
Hey man, my nigga Wapp, cut the table, camouflaged my label
Put the nigga gangstafied like we Kane and Abel
Storm that's my thug love til I die
Shell Shocked bout to go in that water with them when it's time to ride
When we unload inside of anger
My soldier rag made me a stranger
Harm them niggas who was about that danger(Shell Shocked) 

Outro:  Mac
And there you have it
Shell Shocked, the first born
73077
If y'all want me niggas, come and get me
I ain't hard to find</pre>
