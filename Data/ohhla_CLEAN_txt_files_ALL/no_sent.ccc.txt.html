[Chorus - 50/50 Lil' Twin]
Color Changin' so cold with this pen and shit
We can do a rap with no sentences
Tell me what hood is up in this bitch
Hold up ya knot, if you grip ya stick
Flash a few rocks, if ya wrist is lit
Drop-drop it like it's hot if you the thickest bitch
Put ya hands high if you feel this shit

[Yung-Ro]
Mean, cocky, do it myself
A asshole stuck up, full of myself
Rappin', cappin', actin' big screens
Movie, lime-light, yung kid big dreams
Hoes, sluts, freaks, fuck em'
Niggaz pay, creep, bust em'
Glocks, SK's, murk whoever
I'ma pimp my hoes will fuck whoever
Dollars, cash, bring it don't talk it
Grindin', master-mindin' I'm bout it
My brain, quick, plus on drugs
Heart, cold, close no love
Dice, shake, bitch, blow
Squat, roll, snap, collect dough
Niggaz, pissed, me, relaxed
Call me cut-throat, stay poppin' where ya at
Bob, weave, duck, swing
