[Intro - Fabolous - talking] (The-Dream)
You already know what it is (ah)
We got another one boy (A-T-L)
Yeah, (just throw it in the bag)
What's up Brooklyn?  What's up son?
(What's up Fabo?)
Aye man, I got that black AmEx with me
A.K.A. that "Throw It In The Bag" card
(Radio Killer), yeah

[Break - The-Dream] - w/ ad libs
Now I know you ain't over there starin at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there starin at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollarin at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollarin at my girl
I keep her in Lou Vuitton, Louie Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

[Chorus - The-Dream] - 2X
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Fabolous talking over the Chorus]
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
Neiman Marcus on me and all that?
Yeah, come on then

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L (L), when I'm in A-T-L (L)
Just ask my baby girl (girl), I treat that lady well (well)
Ain´t nothin +So So+ and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzs, black, white, gray C.L. (L's)
Got niggaz lookin "did we miss a Mercedes sale?" (what?)
Don't wonder what I do (do), just know th
ey pay me well (well)
They keep that Gucci and that Louie on my labi-el's (nice)
That's the way we feel, must be nice man (nice man)
You with the right man, you ain't got a price scan (no)
Or ask how much (much), now what I look like? (look like)
Son I'm from Brooklyn (Brooklyn), what it look like? (look like)
You get it 'cause I got it, I got it so you get it
Do like Luke say and "don't stop, get it, get it" (yes)
Mami do the speedie, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talkin Ruffles

[Chorus] - 4X

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
See I know what I'm a tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag (just throw it in the bag)
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag (just throw it in the bag)
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket (haha)
That Remy Ma got him spittin plenty bars
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentlemen, dozen bottles of that Rose Moe
Oh you got a man, well you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the place aid get you one
Meet me at the register (uh huh), I'm there on the regular (uh huh)
Them niggaz price checkin, you can help them in a second (yes)
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breakin down the20weed
Shorty, throw it in the bag (just throw it in the bag)

[Chorus] - 4X

[Break - Fabolous] - 4X
Everybody do the throw it in the bag (aye!)
Throw it in the bag

[Chorus] - 4X</pre>
