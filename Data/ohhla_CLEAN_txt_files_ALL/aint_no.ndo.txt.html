(Intro)
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Even though I strayed another path, yeah I did it
Thats the way it is, yeah
Brothers and sisters, I guess I'll see you on the other side, in the new world
New World Order, that is
Until then... haha

(Verse 1)
Now when the smoke clears, nothin left but death and destruction
Apocalyptic scriptures hit'cha, when my beat is gushin
Mental concussion, information got me reachin the masses
Just listen, learn, it's my turn; Givin lyrical classes
Picture the sea, limousines full of nothin but killers
Gorilla pimpin, with no feelins, yellin "Fuck the system!"
I breaks my brothers out of hell, jail, cells and shots
Ready now for Aramageddon, firin or not?
Dictators contradict they own lives, hide the truth
How you want? Buck, my troops, cause my records they shoot, quick bitch!
Then witness it, I hope you feel it
Just come on with me
Wanna be it more than this label, just like 2Pac and Biggie
You can paint my lyrical vocals to the piracy boulder
Annihilating you bustas, real niggas stay focused
I'm crucifying you bitches who wanna plot on my riches
Paper chasin, fuck 'em, leave 'em, cause they all suspicious

(Outro)
Ain't no bitch in my blood, nigga nothin but thug
We at the point of no return
Ain't no bitch in my blood, nigga nothin but thug
We at the point of no return
Ain't no bitch in my blood, nigga nothin but thug
We at the point of no return
Ain't no bitch in my blood, nigga nothin but thug
We at the point of no return</pre>
