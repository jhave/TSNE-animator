Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
Devil's Wicked. (Trying to look at me)
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
Keep looking
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
You just might get hurt

(Violent J)
First of all I stab people, like even myself
I wouldn't advise it though doc it fucks up my health
I hang out with bad people we cause mischief and mayhem
People like Shaggy and that E-S-H-A-M
I panic over everything man, my faucets they drip
I headbutted my mom over that shit and swelled up her lip
(Urgh) She hit me with a big wooden spoon
I ran into the bathroom
I took off my panties and sat there and cried and took a dune
Plus I hide in bushes, and I play with my dick
Wait! Did I say I had panties on?
Scratch that shit!
Anyway, them bushes Im jerking my dick off
Yet possums are looking I get off
Tell me how to stop my panic attack!!

(Chorus)
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
Carefull. (Don't get hurt)
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
Look in my mind. (Try not to get hurt)
Look in my mind
Carefull. (Don't get hurt)
Look in my mind. (Panic Attack)
You just might get hurt

(Esham)
They tell me I got a screw loose so I loosened it some more
I popped off all my pills they told I should pop some more

(Violent J)
I painted up my face, I always do I'm a Clown
But I paint it with dog shit when nobody else is around
Wait, no I don't

(Esham)
Got a bad habit, so big it's just like that
Fuck a motherfucking monkey
I got a Gorilla on my back

(Violent J)
I know this aint funny, but Shaggy laughs at me
Everytime I laugh with him, Esham he slaps me

(Esham)
Paranoia, Skitzophrenia
All too familiar
But bitch don't get to close I might kill ya!

(Violent J)
I smoke PCP, ICP, this and that
I never smoked a rock, but I tried smoking but crack
PANIC ATTACK!

(Chorus)

(Esham)
Sit back and let me tell you why I panic
Motherfuckers think I'm Satanic
From all that I just got manic on the whole fucking planet
One two bitch, let me get this mic
Hold up ho
Let me run my flow
Like ya didn't know
I'm from the Mo
Town
Sounds underground
So I can mac a bitch
And pimp the little ho until the cunt makes me rich
Ditch the bitch if she broke
Cuz I ain't no fucking joke
I'm speeding down the highway tokin my smoke smoke smoke
Switching lanes left and right
Cuz I'm high as a kite
Swerving on the freeway through the yellow and white
Got and appetite for some pussy but I wont eat it up
Instead I'll be like Tyson in that bitch beating it up

(Chorus x4)

(Esham whispering)
Don't panic
You just might get hurt
Bitch!</pre>
