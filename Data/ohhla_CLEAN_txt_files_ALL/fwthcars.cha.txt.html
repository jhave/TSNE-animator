[Verse 1 - Chalie Boy]
You bust the windows out my caaaaar
Already told you playin I wasn't wiiiiith
So I'm a come knock on ya nigga's shiiiiit
Can't hit you, so he'll do, come see me biiiiitch
Better get your bitch before she get you scaaaaarred
Best bet's to tell her not to come 'round heeeeere
My gal got a .44 that keep the area cleeeeear
Take heat about her somewhere I'll bury you neeeeear
For bustin windows out my caaaaar
Not trippin on a whip, that shit's expendable
But you gotta understand the principle
Even now I'm tryin to be sensible
Fuck that bitch, you bust the windows out my caaaaar
Ought to come through now and put your shit up in smoke
Something inside your mind is got to be broke
For you to risk everything you got 'cause you're missing a stroke
Gotta go bust windows out my caaaaar
It's ain't my fault that you took it too far
Play by the rules, guess you forgot who you are
Simple role player, you are not the star
Somebody better call the law, awwwww
(Before I call my folks to break you off)

[Break - Chalie Boy]
Niggaz and bitches, that's doin this shit, yeah you stupid
Stop all of that callin and stalkin
You not number one and you knew it
Now you can't give a fuck 'cause you blew it
Should have listened when you told yourself don't do it
Now you're sittin in a cell, face drippin fluid
And that's where you are

[Chorus - Chalie Boy]
(For being stupid, fuckin with caaars), caaaaars
Being stupid, (fuckin with caaars), caaaaars
Being stupid, (fuckin with caaars), caaaaars
Being stupid, (fuckin with caaars), caaaaars
Being stupid, fuckin with caaars
(For being stupid, fuckin with caaars)

[Chamillionaire talking over Chorus]
She got you like that Chalie?
Hold up man, listen up

[Verse 2 - Chamillionaire]
Chalie forgot to tell you after you that she called me
Said she got to Houston, so I met her at Harvey
Well it's a long story but I bet ya she probably
On the way to try to bust a window out an Impalie
She said her ex friend was the way that she found me
When I was with her she was speakin about ya real highly
I was really addicted to the shape of her body
Had her comin out her clothes, steppin out the Cavalli
She raw as a sushi plate without the wasabi
Until she said she rap and Chamill could you sign me?
Had to go our separate ways just like Whitney and Bobby
Accidentally fell asleep and she was layin beside me
Woke up to realize she already was outtie
Then I, put on my shoes and went down to the lobby
Look at what she did to my car G
She busted your windows and now looks like she done got me (*window 
smashes*)

[Outro - Chamillionaire - talking] (*sound of car alarm in the 
background*)
Damn! Not the Benz
Crazy girl, man
Alright ...</pre>
