Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
Yo, you know it's your boy Lil B man
Made the history (New York City...)
You already know what it is
It's Lil B...

[Verse 1]
The hustle game won'?t stop, I'?m on the a block
Shout out to the Brooklyn that'?s with the rock I pass hot
Riding round the drop top in New York
Feeling like?When the nigga hit the hoop core
Underground got too much money
So we hustle everyday so the clouds look sunny
Remember all the times I was bummy not really
But in my mind, I wanted a lot more money
Eyes moving backwards thinking I was right
Had a slow down cause I had to catch up to life
Kept faith in self, my energies are?Cray
Somehow my world was dark but I seen the light
Shit, it?'s that real talk music, that street walker, Lil B black heart music
That Based World Lil Boss rap talks do it
Make a lot of sense, so respect my movement
Lil B!

[Chorus]
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
My arms are the...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
New York City, New York City...
It?'s Lil B...
My arms are the...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...

[Verse 2]
I changed the whole world so respect how I do it
You go right I go left, just respect how I'?m moving
People try to hate and second guess what I?'m doing
Man the numbers don?'t lie ?less you fake your whole movement
And that right there the kind of shit I'?m not doing
When you talk 'bout Lil B then you dissing the whole community
(My arms are the...)
It take years to get the top spot, Time Square, New York
My name'?s there on the block
For the people that listen, don?'t ever stop
Don'?t let them steal anything that you ever got
Until then keep watching cause I'?m on top
I'?m like a brick cause I stay on the block
This' what I mean, I ain't lost my roots
Cause I can still go home any day I want to
Everyday I feel, just respect how I live
The whole world'?s the Brooklyn bridge
Lil B!

[Chorus]
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
New York City...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
New York City...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
I only do it for the people that love me
Cause real talk don'?t nobody care who judge me
I?'m still in the hood giving college
Cause I?'m close to the people, that?'s the world that love me
Shout out to the great bridge and the golden gate
West Coast, East Coast, love, we will never hate
(My arms) Gotta keep it right in your mind
If you make the wrong moves just drop in and die
Need to put down the guns and hear these kids
Show them what they potential is
(My arms are the...)
Until then, I?'m the king making these records
It'?s new life when I'?m moving my sessions
Lil B, I keep moving with the weather
Whether, winter time, summer time it get better
The only time I feel better
When the world feels good, let'?s get it together

[Chorus]
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
My arms are the...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the Brooklyn bridge...
My arms are the...
My arms are the...
New York City...
It's Lil B...
My arms are the...
My arms are the...
It's Lil B!</pre>
