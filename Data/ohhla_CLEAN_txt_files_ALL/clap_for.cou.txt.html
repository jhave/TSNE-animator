[Chorus: Boots Riley]
Now can you clap for the killers?
Give it up for them gangsters
One time for the killers
Double up for them gangsters

[Boots Riley]
Well I wrote this for criminals
But all of y'all should listen at me
Now if you ever catch me snitchin'
Just haul off and slap me
They on the other team
"Lets rumble," is my thoughts exactly
They work for gangsters
And they whacked Fred Hampton Jr.s pappy
Ay playboy, pop 'em with a pistol and get executed
Ay mama, murder 'em with missiles and you get saluted
Go 'head and gank em for a grand, it's DNA computed
But bankers bathe in the Bahamas off of billions looted
Now can you clap? Now can you clap?

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
Now can you clap for them killers?
Give it up for them gangsters
One time for the killers
Double up for them gangsters

[Boots Riley]
Well I wrote this for criminals
But they the ones who wrote the laws
They ain't on TV gettin' arrested
All up in their draws
They stick their hands up politicians
Make 'em move their jaws
And they be starving folks for bread
Until their breath pause
Ay take a memo Moneypenny, say the deed is done
And you can bcc DC and say our leaders won
But first we fax the photograph of the opponents son
Adjust the image, 'cause it's hard to see the gag and gun
Now can you clap? Now can you clap?
Now can you clap? Now can you clap?

[Chorus: Boots Riley]
Now can you clap for them killers?
Give it up for them gangsters
One time for the killers
Double up for them gangsters

[Boots Riley]
Well I wrote this for gangsters
While I sprinted through your backyard
Not for them Coppola criminals, they just act hard
Tony Montana had a stylist and a SAG card
When he reloaded slaves forgot that they had back scars
Ay, M-M-Mister DeNiro what kind of gun is that?
Can you look more like a menace?
Take two, now run it back
Ay s-s-so what Scorsese, got all them money stacks
Long as his lens never looks at the real maniacs

[Chorus 2x: Boots Riley]
Clap for them killers
Give it up for them gangsters
One time for the killers
Double up for them gangsters</pre>
