[Intro]
(Pooh-Man)

Yeah me and the boy JT Tha Bigga Figga
Straight from west block San Quinn prison
serving five year sentence on a robbery case
This is to everybody I love
Everybody I am going to miss

[Verse 1]
(Pooh-Man)

September fifth
9 a.m.
Courtroom Ten
Turned myself in
Sentenced to five years on a robbery case
Can't forget the look on my women and mothers face
Now I am on the great goose west block thang
32 months now I got lay it down
No more riding with my homies getting high
Just reminiscing about the Eastside
Hit the weight pad
Trying to stay in shape
By the time I get out I have songs for 20 tapes
Family visit's I look forward to
And on my back I got a new tattoo
The 4 the 1 the 5 stripped in my stride now I got's to ride
One day soon I will be home
And my kids and there mother won't be alone

[Hook]

Sentenced to five long years
Room's full of tattoo tears
These 20 years on the compound
Never would I thought I would be penitentary bound
(2x)

[Verse 2]
(JT Tha Bigga Figga)

Never say they flow or flooded with game
10 years done past and now them thangs done changed
Remember the ballers
Remember the shot callers
Remember the times your homies
Were riding around in them 7-7-9 Impalas
Your life man it ain't right for me
Can't do a thang
Just stand in the back and give you a beat down
Homies is missing but ain't no need for reminiscing
Celebrating cuz all this time you been waiting
At the under spot now make it clever
Now lets start the nation make it a whole lot better
I am thinking about my grip
I have my twist
My freedom and a extra clip
I choose my freedom because I am on my way home
I get to sleep in my bed and get to see my kid
Grow into his manhood
No more waiting on the block
And playing hind and seek from a gang of cops

[Hook]

Sentenced to five long years
Room's full of tattoo tears
These 20 years on the compound
Never would I thought I would be penitrany bound
(2x)

[Verse 3]
(Pooh-Man)

I got a letter from my house my homie just died
Seems nothing ever changes on the Eastside
Waiting, booking reading, eatin,
Penitentary lifestyle is playing with my head
Wish I never did what I done
But it's already done and I can't run
Missing my family and my freedom
I guess you never really know much you really need em
My girls are growing up to be young women
And I'm regretting everyday that there father is not with em
But everybody makes mistakes
Were only human
But reckless was the lifestyle I was pursuing
Smackin brothers jackin brothers
Now everyday the more miss my mother (I love my mother)
I walk around with my head hanging down
Never would I thought I would be penitentary bound

[Outro]
Sentenced to five long years
Room's full of tattoo tears
These 20 years on the compound
Never would I thought I would be penitentary bound
