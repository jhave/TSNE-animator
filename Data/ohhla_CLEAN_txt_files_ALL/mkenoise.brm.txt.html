We keepin hot for my niggas fresh up off the block
Now all my people bust a shot BLOW, BLOW, BLOW!
Bus a Bus is back all in your face and I'm back to replace

Wild out in the spot, and get to actin like savages

To blow the roof off the building and right before we get to
Wreckin the spot everybody climb up on something and tear the lights
Up off of the ceiling, BO, BO, BO, BO!!

CHORUS 2X

[Verse 3]
How's about to keep it kinda raw and just give it to motherfuckers
And how we smash it and cash it we rip it from motherfuckers
You know we got it, you niggas know we rockin
And get all up in your pocket, YO, YO, YO!!

However you wanna do it grab the gas and the matches and start the fire
Take it up a little higher! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!!
