Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm so ahead of my time
My pops ain't even bust his first nut yet
I'm a-whole-nother subject
Extra-curriculum, passion just to get more
Credit used synthetic, after this call the medic
Got a fetish for anything the color of lettuce
But they cut the horses' wings yeah, a Pegasus
Why you on some new con, new necklace
I transcend nijja a nigga dial right
Okay get your words up, hit Starbucks
Grab a bag of whole bean, whole food deli sandwiches
Blowing OG and I wrote this shit
And it goes like this a penny for your thoughts
But I plan to make millions
Or die cryin' in the end like the villain
Or sipping Teqo in outdoor pavilions
They keep telling me I'm brilliant
And I concur 'cause
My metaphors are better than yours
I broke obituary like brochure
And I'm trying to have mine like novel
Rap Dan Brown fight Angels and Demons
That's why I'm sipping on this bottle
I take your ho to Aeropostale and
She show me her body parts like Hostel...

Uh... nigga... I'm the nicest man... I don't give a fuck

It ain't trickin' if you got it
Yeah right it ain't trickin' if it's Jeep
If I can afford this you will absorb
My semen, dinners makin' copy cat peas
From mean mints, fiends leanin' throwing up
Will he demon? On the grind like strippers on zippers
To y'all young whippersnappers nigga I'm a blizzard
Nigga that's cold, I would do you so bold
If you ever disrespect this talent... uh
What the fuck you poppin' daughter-sect
Nigga I'm the architect
And my notepad's the blue print
Watch how I fuel shit
Getting away, watch these whorehats kill shit

Nigga... nigga... it's Detroit stand up... shit...</pre>
