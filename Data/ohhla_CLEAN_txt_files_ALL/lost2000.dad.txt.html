[Puffy]
Cohiba cigars, spittin' 16 bars,
Spit on a dial, my Chopard
See the reflection of the gods
Spill Louie because, I'm supposed to, none close to
Me flow hotter, see me in any way shape, don't bother - showstopper
As for your hoe, cock the rhymes I wrote, murda like shocka
Deem these bitches, stay on the penis
I went from the Vernon, the curve servin', paper earnin'
Got Arabians smugglin' dope in they turban
Sit with two techs in my duplex, bulletproof vest
In the shoot fest with the law
Got it all, want more, future foreseen
Keep the city how for Louie XIV
Rob, Dep, and Shyne bring Bad Boy more cream
Uncut hits nigga, lyrical morphine
The overboss, fuck the cost, I 'ford it
Next year, number 1 on the Forbe's list
motherfuckas

[Chorus]
The hoes, the clothes, the cars, the loot
Public Enemy Number One
The plaques and the macs, bitch check my movies, uh
Public Enemy Number One
You can say what you want when you talk about me
Public Enemy Number One
You know where I be, it ain't hard to find me
Public Enemy Number One

[Shyne]
Once again it's Shyne and, rhymin'
Remarkable timin'
Tryin' to sit up on the charts with a diamond
Bottom line, ya teams get splashed with macs
17 caps and cats, for runnin' with my image
Y'all finish
Hence the don, doing two-fifteen on a autobon
Louie Vittons, skunk on the back
The flyest, tryin' to tell y'all motherfuckers can't deny us
Fuckin' right, when God made me, He was biased
No lies, yo highness with the most mob ties
In the metropolitan, platinum child from the home of Chris Wallace
So how could I not be hot?
That's like Puff in the summertime without a drop
Uncle Paul, posted up, without a glocks
I chew coals &amp; spit diamonds
Jacob got nothin' on me, top ranks, stop banks

[Chorus]
The hoes, the clothes, the cars, the loot
Public Enemy Number One
The plaques and the macs, bitch check my movies, uh
Public Enemy Number One
You can say what you want when you talk about me
Public Enemy Number One
You know where I be, it ain't hard to find me
Public Enemy Number One

[Shyne]
Rather its all from the guns to the brawl
Coke to the alcohol, this young nigga want it all
Time runnin' out on my front, nigga in pursuit of bigger things
Arm, neck glitterin', shiverin'

[Puffy]
Fuck bein' broke
Give that bitch a girdle tell her, "Transport my coke"
On to Peter Pan, so we can get the two seater
And lay up in the trunk for months
Increase the lease, yeah, I got to eat

[Shyne]
Streets to Greece, stay up in the tape deck on seek, repeat
Motion picture, my movie so sick, 4,5,6, ya die quick
Y'all niggas ride dick, you test me, I wish
I love to drill shit, kill shit, real quick
On some top bill shit, half a mil with

[Puffy]
Soft or hard top, sedan or coupes be trial
Every time, the law got too many loops
Fuck my bitches in groups menaga
Pimpin' ain't easy, but monogamy's harder
Jets we charter, bring the slaughter

[Shyne]
Million dollar bracelets
Your favorite DJ couldn't fade this, come on

[Chorus 2x]
The hoes, the clothes, the cars, the loot
Public Enemy Number One
The plaques and the macs, bitch check my movies, uh
Public Enemy Number One
You can say what you want when you talk about me
Public Enemy Number One
You know where I be, it ain't hard to find me
Public Enemy Number One</pre>
