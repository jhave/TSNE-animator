Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro]
I'm high as shit
I don't wanna smoke no more
Millz no passing no blunts
That ass slum

[Chorus]
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hopin
You know everything is potent
Potent everything
You know my smoke is potent
Plus my clothes is potent
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hoping
'Cause everything is potent
Potent, potent, potent, potent
Potent everything

[Verse 1]
Seat back on that west side and I'm floating
Chris Paul in that 4 door I swerves on him
I'm coasting nigga
My team potent, my bitch potent
And your girl from round the corner
My bitch came from across the ocean
No wallet big stacks, main reason my pants sagging
And all my niggas rotting no band wagging my band clapping
My band snapping on sight, we bring drums to that fight
We bring drums to that fight, my bands snapping on sight
Hater my style potent, my loud potent
I let my glock in harlem and alarm off in Oakland
Them niggas know what I'm about
Got a big blunt hanging from my mouth
And I got a toothbrush at your girlfriends house

[Chorus]
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hopin
You know everything is potent
Potent everything
You know my smoke is potent
Plus my clothes is potent
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hoping
'Cause everything is potent
Potent, potent, potent, potent
Potent everything

[Verse 2]
Most people be crabs
Their skin just be a good shell
Ain't no love in hip hop
But I pray to God that her book sell
'Cause these hoes be actin up
Full of mileage wack as fuck
Mad as fuck, this pretty young ass bitch in my passenger seat
By the way she chew her gum you can tell she a freak
By the fruit she eat you can tell her pussy sweet
Smoke an O by the middle day
I be hella high hoe you can call me triple H
My life potent, my ride potent
Fly niggas we match the coops
Down to the shoes like clothing man
Any beat I casket it
Lame niggas I lens see you
My weed loud is a ratchet bitch

[Chorus]
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hopin
You know everything is potent
Potent everything
You know my smoke is potent
Plus my clothes is potent
I ain't even joking
I fell in love with smoking
There should never be no hoping
'Cause everything is potent
Potent, potent, potent, potent
Potent everything

Roll that, light that, smoke that
Roll that, light that, smoke that
Roll that, light that, smoke that</pre>
