[Verse 1]
Oh girl over there in the blue
I gotta pocket full of tracks so what cha gon' do
Turn around and let me peak
And let's play a little bit of hide and seek
Show me that and I'll give ya this
A twenty dollar bill that's nice and crisp
What cha' gotta do is work
Shake it on down and watch me go bizurk
You know just what I'm talkin' about
Pop that thang, move it in and out
Like that, get on the stage and work that cat
Yo fellas where that booty at

[Chorus x2]
Whoot, there it is (One mo' gen' where that booty at)
