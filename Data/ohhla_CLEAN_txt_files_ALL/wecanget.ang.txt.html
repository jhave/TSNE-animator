[Intro: Angie Martinez] {*N.O.R.E. in background*}
Yea, ok...
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yea, uh, yo, uh

[Angie Martinez]
They call me Diva La Angie
Rippin' the arenas in Miami
Slippers in the sand beach, c'mon dance with me
Or the chulos in white tees (yea)
You ain't peeped the Billboard on Jimmy's 
Then I guess you cannot see 
You wanna party wit me, da-to
Only big dogs invited, no gatos
Quite though, what's with all the questions, whoa
Why you asking? I'm all in wit my friends embarrassing
Be easy, you wanna get up close and personal?
Cop the CD, if not leave me
I'm bout to bag somethin', why you blocking?
Cause your man in Timbs is home watchin'?
I'm a pro, mangu on the stove
Chancletas and a robe, my crew at the show
Big Pun in my heart, esperate how it go? it go
{*Men chanting*}

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.] (2x)
It go esperate, hold on, legs so strong
We can do it, we can do it, we can get it on
You know what's "papichu", and playing "capicu"
And tell them chicks that they can all come around too

[Angie Martinez]
Oh Jay +Mi Amor+
I would love to date you, soon as I come off tour
I like papis from Cuba, Colombia, Bermuda, Peru or Ecuador
We got PR, DR, Mexico, Panama
Guatama' pa's wit flags in their cars
This is for the Jose's, Juan's, Claudio's
Broadway, LES, en el bario
Bronx, Fernando's, only trabajando
On the calle, watchin' for bandos
These - Orlando, Victor's, Tony's
Who pick up and hold me, put away your Rolly
I like 'em low key, oh you blow trees?
I got half an o-z you shoulda' told me
I get the groceries and 'Pac's CD
Now everybody sing my part with me, c'mon

[Chorus]

[Angie Martinez]
Hard level to the quarters at the fight screaming "Ti-to!"
Or at the table all night, Mojito
Whachu know about the Chimmy-Cherry?
And don't forget, I need a cab para tu me le tumbe le 
Come down - BK, uptown - NY to LA
Everything's still "Suavemente"
Para mi jente, after the show
Everybody get your freak on (sawago-sawago)
All my eses, Etey
This is the casa con anamo anamo
You know what's that? Angie the Old G
I can be a girl, and be your "Cold D"
And we can go eat, see, I'm a keeper
All I ask is for me to see you in wife beaters
And in them nice sneakers 
He like me? I don't doubt him
Word? You got feelings for me? then cop two albums!

[Chorus]

[Men Chanting]
Esperate, hold on, legs so strong
We can do it, we can do it, we can get it on!
We can do it, we can do it, we can get it on!
Oohhhh!</pre>
