1 for the money, 2 for the streets
3 for the niggas with the gangsta-ass beats
A .45, cause I'm up to no good
6 plus 4 plus 1 for the hood
Steppin outside in my fresh K Swiss
Khakis on crizzack, t-shirt on thick
Jumped in my ride, and I'm leanin to the side
An hour rollin west on the 105
Got off on Crenshaw, here to conjure the 20th
Bumpin the oldies, lookin for the muthafuckin homies
Cause it's the weekend, ain't no sleepin
Hoodrats and dub sacks is what I'm seekin
Moved out the hood a couple of years ago
But still I can't let it go
Like bomb cock, it's got me comin back for mo'
Nigga, my neighborhood, a/k/a the Asphalt Killing Fields

I can't stay
I just can't stay away

Now as I cruise by the park, niggas hit me up
And since I'm true to mine, nigga, I'm givin it back up
Shit, I gives a fuck, nigga, this is straight
H-double o-d-s-t-a all mutthafuckin dizzay
Hit the curve on the bend
Jack the ass up, hung a left, now I'm cruisin up Wilton
Beatin, bass beatin, speakers screamin
Leanin, steady leanin, peepin the scene, and
Scoop teens in jeans, tip off the hat
Nigga, where's the ho's at, where's the ho's at?
I hear the party's tonight at Terminal Island
But first I'm steppin to Steven's for some chili juice fries, and
Now we on our way to the spot
16 batteries, 4 pumps, you tell me if this shit'll pop
Too old for this - never
Even if my pubic hairs were grey

I can't stay away
I just can't stay away

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
Can't stay away from the hood too long

Pulled at a party, and I'm hittin a switch
Because my shit it hot, hoes all on my dizznick
Jealous niggas callin me out 
Now what's this all about?
Muthafuckas pullin they money out
But they don't wanna see me, nigga, I'm showin off chrome
40 inch a lift, fool, gettin my clown on
One lift, two lift, look, now I'm standin it up
Backin niggas up while I'm hittin the square dumps
Damn, it musta been a full moon
Cause tonight I was actin a muthafuckin fool
Till the party got turned out, and niggas started bustin
So we headed back to the hood, lookin for somethin else to do
But that's when one-time jacked and pulled us over
And took me to jail for a warrant back in October
But the county's so fool, I be out in three days
Right back at it again, I can't stay a...

I can't stay away
I just can't stay away</pre>
