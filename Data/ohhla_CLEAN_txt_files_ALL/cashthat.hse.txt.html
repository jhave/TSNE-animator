What my motherfucking name
Mike Jones (Who), Mike Jones (Who), Mike Jones
My album "Who Is Mike Jones" coming soon, yeah
Here come who, Mike Jones

[Mike Jones]
Hitting the block with rocks in socks, let down my top when the sun is hot
Ice dripping from grill and watch, some complain cause Mike is hot
I'm hopping out so they baller block, pimping hoes in the parking lot
Flip in thongs, with no halter top
They say Mike Jones without the "Who", I blew up fast I thought you knew
Down South we bang Screw, when I'm done with it it'll be a Peru
When I flow you can't deny, I'm cold as fuck and I'm all so fly
Hoes bop when I pass by, cause they know I'm a fly guy
Show my grill and you stuck still, she a han'capping I'm a fuck still
Hop in the Lincoln for buck fills, screens fall down saying "what's the deal"
Coming soon is "Runnin The Game", so y'all can see how I'm running the game
I hit the streets fans run up to me, and tell me that that I'm running thangs
Mike Jones, Slim Thug, Lil Keke we be
Valeting in V.I.P., sipping Henessy with a dime piece
On my side when I ride, I'm on 24's like T.I
Definition of Mike Jones and the Swishahouse, we fly
I talk the talk and walk the walk, princess cuts in my platinum mouth
When "Who is Mike Jones" come, I'ma put a mill in the vault
I talk the talk and walk the walk princess cuts in my platinum mouth
When "Who is Mike Jones" come, I'ma put a mill in the vault

[Hook: Mike Jones &amp; (Paul Wall) - 2x]
Cash flow I flip alot, freak hoes I pimp alot
Playa haters, I ain't tripping about
Cause they ain't got the cash, that I got
(Cash flow I flip alot, freak hoes I pimp alot
Playa haters, I ain't tripping about
Cause they ain't got the cash, that I got)

[Lil' Keke]
Who is Mike Jones, who is Lil' Ke
Ain't no motherfucking where, that you niggaz know me
An underground legend, making plenty of wealth
S.U.C. to the finish, it's the Don himself
Yeah I'm platinum bound, with this platinum sound
Hit the strip on a Sunday, let the top lay down
Spit this gangsta shit, and they love it for real
I sold five hundred thousand, no major deal
That's the truth, nigga
Pull the sound scan, I swear that's the proof nigga
Side ways, got my deuce out the roof nigga
And they loving it G
Certified go-getter, out the 7-1-3
I'm a O.G (O.G.), and I pay what it cost
Me and Slim Thug the Boss, at the Swishahouse
I'm bouncing on 24's, rolling on big thangs
hitting the highway, and I'm still changing lanes

[Hook - 2x]

[Slim Thug]
It's Slim Thugger motherfucker, the big Boss of the North
That been Boss, since I was spitting hits with the House
And I'm sitting on too much mail, to put it for sale
You want my spot oh well, come follow my trail
A trendsetter been having cheddar since uh, forever
(Slim when you gon drop your solo) shit, prolly never
I'd rather spit these hit flows, and get rich off those
(picture this) a underground rapper, with his own clothes
(who knows) I done shows, every week straight since 9-8
Off these other cats tracks, now who else done done dat
And still turned down deals, worth more than a mill
(naw I'm a chill) and I'm still, worth more than a mill for real
I got my money right, Slim set for life
So next time you think you the nicest, think twice
Take my advice (have your shit right), before you contest
Cause when you messing with these three, you fucking with the best nigga
