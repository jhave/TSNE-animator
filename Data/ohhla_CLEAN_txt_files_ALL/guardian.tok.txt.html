[Flexx]
Lord, please, could you save me, and get me from my enemies.
Lord, please, send me someone to guide me through.
Lord, please, could you save me, and get me from my enemies.
Lord, please, send me someone to guide me through.

[Refrain]
Send me a Guardian Angel(angel), give us some strength from above(give us some strength from above)
Send me a Guardian Angel(angel), give us some help from above(give us some help from above)

[Bay-C]
Ohh,'Cause in these times when you're down and broken hearted
and desperate goin' nowhere, nobody cares
you stop to look in the mirror and stare, but nobody's there
Outta my mind can't seem to run from myself I can't think
can't even sleep, can't even eat. I can't do this by myself, I need somebody else

[Refrain]
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some strength from above(give us some strength from above)
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some help from above(give us some help from above)

[Alex]
Ahh, so lovely, a world, it would be if we lived in harmony
loving one another, just as if its family instead of the killing and hate
won't you me send someone 'cause I just can't do it alone

[Craig T]
Well, living on Earth, sometimes it feels like Heaven sometimes its like Hell
some people ask jaffi what Jehovah man kind can find and put on a spell
Really no matter where you go, you could be a rich kid
parra shotta where ya ask... make sure you know no sell

[Refrain:
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some strength from above(give us some strength from above)
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some help from above(give us some help from above)

[Refrain]
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some strength from above(give us some strength from above)
Send me a Guardian Angel(Angel), give us some help from above(give us some help from above)</pre>
