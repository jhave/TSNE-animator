Artist: Talib Kweli &amp; Hi Tek f/ Mos Def
Album:  Train of Thought
Song:   This Means You
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Mos] Sometimes, you gotta be direct with the people, y'know like..
[T.K] Give it to 'em (c'mon)
[Mos] Yo!
[T.K] Give it to 'em
[Mos] GET, UP, NOW!

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, we keep it type raw, and know exactly what we fight for
when the nightfall come, we in the right war
Cats who spill blood for a cause, not just because
Defy the authority and follow God's law
Revolutionary entrepeneurs; who make the fans
clap they hands and stompin the floor not start the applause
(Ahhh ssssh! Yeah!) Thank you very much, without further adieu
Let me introduce the rest of my crew, Mos Def!

[Mos Def]
Yo, I am the world renowned, verb adjective adverb
pronoun preposition suffix prefix
Original or remix, sunburst and eclipse
Me and Kwe' combine like strands on a double-helix
My speech seasoned, with dialect of my region
Booga-nam Brooklyn Bed-Stuy Eastern
Where youth and policemen, they nah reach agreement
Pressure in the mornin, pressure in the evenin

{*scratching* "Mos Def" .. "Kwe'-Kweli" ..
 "Hi Tek on the beat!" .. "brothers and sisters"}

Chorus One: BlackStar (Mos Def + Talib Kweli)

You, need, to, get, up, right, now
and, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you
You, you

[Talib Kweli]
Yeahh, alright yeah, alright yeah, alright yeah
Alright yeah, alright yeah, alright yeah, yeah-ehhhh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo, yo
Things changed since we came out, been some shit in New York
Niggaz stopped gettin jig in New York, bloods and crips in New York
The Y-2-K celebration wasn't big in New York
Babylon live in New York, should I keep a crib in New York
or just V.I., to handle my B.I.
When with my A-Alikes we see with three eyes

[Mos Def]
Yo Kweli I agree I, was thinkin the same thing myself
Smog in the city ain't no good for your health
Things changed in New York, type strange in New York
Forty-Deuce don't look the same in New York
Just politics, tricks and big games in New York
Switched trains a writer can't get fame in New York
Internet and Wall Street got paid in New York
Poor folks and workin class got slayed in New York
Even still, everyday they make weight in New York
Flashlights lookin for a brighter day in New York
In New York they say it's - red hot
Will the temperature ease up?  Black I guess not
It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops
No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box
No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop
Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock
If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop
All mankind time runnin down on one watch, just watch

Chorus Two: BlackStar (Mos Def + Talib Kweli)

If, you, are, just, coming, in, I, will
say it, once, more, so, you, can, hear, cause
You, need, to, get, up, right, now
and, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you
You, you

[Talib Kweli]
Yo, Mos Def and Talib Kweli bring disaster to the industry
We best-sellin authors writin great chapters in history
These cats undercover like gay rappers dealin with mystery
My platinum grey matter spray batter that's specifically
designed to make rappers break faster than eggshells in the mornin
Inhaled the divine in that's laid dormant
Water from the well STAY pourin
I answer back when I hear fate callin
Freedom fighter ready to attack at the crack of a new day dawnin
Way more than necessary skills for the application
My flow is Great like the Lakes and it rocks like Applachains
My facts more than make up for what you lack in imagination
You more confused than Tiger Woods when he made up Cabalaysian
I'm sayin!

[Mos Def]
Break bounds like the jet Concorde
Win awards before I leave for my world award tour
When they scream encore, that's when they want more
Flow steadily, whether I'm on or off shore
High potent, zone coastin, no jokin
Safecracker sniff gon' keep the joint open
Peep the focus, high resolution, high reception
My "Train of Thought" connectin with my bredren from Reflection like

Chorus Three: BlackStar (Mos Def + Talib Kweli)

You, need, to, get, up, right, now
and, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you, again!
You, need, to, get, up, right, now
and, move, with, this, yes, this, means, you, we goin
