Everytime I leave my heart is torn apart
And everytime I see these things you know I wanna start to change
You can feel it like rain coming down from the sky
And mixing with tears falling from out of my eyes
It's no surprise that my life is similar to a rollercoaster
Filled with ups and downs, I won't enjoy it till the ride is over
Probably not but it's okay, forget it, skip it anyway
My feelings are irrelevant to anything we do or say
Now it's not that I don't trust you, and my love is infinite
I tell you every chance I get so you will never forget
So you can miss me with that shit that you be saying in them arguments
Throwing around possessions and destroying our apartment
There's nothing that would happen that we couldn't talk about
But lately we've been riffing instead of tring to talk it out
I said that I would never leave you and I still feel the same
But it's killing me inside to fathom that your feelings have changed

Now you can think me bad for the things I do
But you don't understand, it's not all about you
I sit and think though times of how we came to be
And come to realise, you're nothing like me, now I see

I know I told you when we met that I'm a weirdo
I got a lot of problems trusting other people
I'm filled with evil that leads me into darkness
And when I start this you'll probably say that I'm heartless
And your remark is 'I hate you', hear her car skid
She's standing in the door crying, bitch, that's our kid
Your daddy loves you baby, your mom's a crazy lady
She's saying all of these things in an attempt for you to hate me
I never meant for her to leave us like she did
But really I can't blame her cause I know that I'm a dick
I got some issues that I know I need to deal with
But so do you, don't act like that, at least just keep it real with me
And we can make it feel so surreal like I'm dreaming
But instead you pack your bags, give me the finger and tell me you're leaving
I know these demons are gonna come get me so forget we ever met
I hope you don't mind if blood dripping all over my neck

Now you can think me bad for the things I do
But you don't understand, it's not all about you
I sit and think though times of how we came to be
And come to realise, you're nothing like me, now I see

I never said that I would, I never said that I would
I never said that I would leave you, leave you
I never said that I would, I never said that I would
I never said that I would leave you, leave you</pre>
