You came into my life, I don't have to wonder no more
I can feel it all in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn
I can see I got a good foundation, deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul

Yo, first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island
Born American, ancestry from Ireland
You ain't knowin' me, you better stop smilin'
Ain't nothin' funny once my dummies start whilin'
You talkin' loud now all a sudden it's silent
Your premenitions say it's about to get violent
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win
No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling
Where I come from real men don't catch feelings
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin'
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling
Mass appealin', done it since the 80's
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies
Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies
If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul

Yo I shit on competition, spit on percussion
Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin'
Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin'
The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin'
You can't hold me down, you can't hold my hand
A full grown man with the one God plan

I represent the colors that never run
God bless DMC, God bless Reverend Run
R.I.P. for the JMJ
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play
Do you wanna burn out or just fade away
And I can rock the mic without no delay
With my head to the ground everytime I pray
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away
Cause this type of shit happens everyday

Feel the burn, I can feel it in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul
Feel the burn, it's in my soul
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn

Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul
It's in my soul, soul music
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, soul music
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul
It's deep down in my soul, feel the burn</pre>
