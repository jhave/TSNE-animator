Album:  How to Buzz (Single)
Song:   How to Buzz
Typed by: Infinite Management

Intro (Cristiles):

It seems like everybody is under the impression
that you need a song for the clubs to get your name out
I see it a little differently

Chorus (Cristiles):

'cause I could give a fuck about a song for the clubs
makin' music for the bitches and the thugs
makin' songs 'bout the money and the drugs
fuck that, let me show you how to buzz

Verse 1 (Cristiles):

I'ma gas this, fuck an image fuck that shit
since day one I've been on that rap shit
I've been spittin' my ass off
all it ever took was a beat for me to gas on
but I'm goin' for the cash this year
I gotta get rich, fuck a rap career
what you know about a one bedroom?
with no food in the fridge, I gotta grind 'till I'm doin' it big
'cause I'm tired of this broke shit
and I don't give a shit
what a hater say or think about me what they don't get
shout out to Dope Dev, I'm still grindin' for the team
this is what it sounds like, when you grindin' for the green
you could do it for the fame, you could do it for the pussy
hella years in the game I ain't nothin' like a rookie
and you trippin' if you ain't heard of Cristiles
this ain't a song this is how gettin' rich sound

Chorus (Cristiles):

'cause I could give a fuck about a song for the clubs
makin' music for the bitches and the thugs
makin' songs 'bout the money and the drugs
fuck that, let me show you let me show you how to

'cause I could give a fuck about a song for the clubs
makin' music for the bitches and the thugs
makin' songs 'bout the money and the drugs
fuck that, let me show you how to buzz

Verse 2 (Cristiles):

Look, y'all don't even understand anyway
I'm 5'10 but my pen is a heavyweight
I'm gassin' any beat on any day
'cause cash is all I need in every way
from the Bay to the Valley to La
took a break for a minute now I'm back to the game
now I'm back here to stay, shout out to my enemies
mad that my ass back what they tellin' me
when you somethin' that most people will never be
you see the kind of hate most people will never see
and you meet the girls that would never leave
makin' ex girls feel hella jealousy
I'm me I ain't gotta pretend to be
you should see all the messages they sendin' me
hate was the poison revenge is the remedy
with that said I'm back now and I'll never leave

Chorus (Cristiles):

'cause I could give a fuck about a song for the clubs
makin' music for the bitches and the thugs
makin' songs 'bout the money and the drugs
fuck that, let me show you let me show you how to 

'cause I could give a fuck about a song for the clubs
makin' music for the bitches and the thugs
makin' songs 'bout the money and the drugs
fuck that, let me show you how to buzz

Verse 3 (Cristiles):

It's kickin' in, I'm feelin' the pill now
been through hella shit I will kill now
'cause I guess it's what the streets do
but don't get it twisted I got love for the streets too
most of my patnas were thugs or was drug dealers
y'all yellin' mob but you never was killers
this ain't pretty boy rap this is pain music
my life was a brick wall I had to break through it
fuck a skinny jean trend man I can't do it
and fuck another rap beef, nah I ain't stupid
for the record, I still rock fitteds
snap backs is a fad and I ain't with it
all my fans hella mad when I ain't winnin'
I guess that's why my fans always stay grinnin'
all these memories make it hard to stay sober
so I'm watchin' the thrown until it ain't Hovas</pre>
