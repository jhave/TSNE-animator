For those that said I couldn't do it
I'm here to show improvement!
(x2)

I'm Gandhi with a bulletproof vest (what?)
Malcolm X kickin' a freestyle, whatchu expect?
You ain't expect Martin Luther King with a gat
Leavin a church yelling "Go back!"
????? You know how it go fams
Large wingspan like the son of Rodan
Stuck between Godzilla and Bunzilla (huh?)
Fingerhut and Fingerpaint (what?)
Jabba the Hutt going corrupt
You ain't ready for the twin double cypher uppercuts
Plus, I'm off the bean curd rap
You ain't ready for the hypodermic ginseng mat

(Chorus)
In the club is over the bub
In the car is over the dub
In the street it's beef over the slugs
Watch out for the cheeba, it's under the rug
And it still bug
And I'm still wired
And there's still electrical fire for desire
And there's still truth for the liar
And it's still C-Rayz with my name on the flier

For those that said I couldn't do it
I had to show and prove I was in tune with the music

Jay-Z stole my blueprint for the single
He got a copy from dingo
?????? is killin it
Persephone caught between Mills and Stephanie
And Persephone, either way I'm still tracking Hades
I never been Slim but my attitude stay Shady
And this is beyond the wreckage
You gotta check it
It's more behind the method
There's some blackin out
???? right arm with the ham and that's about
You better watch out:  Overskilled and Underplayed
Chicks I deal with slam like Sonja Blade
Y'all ain't ready for the ill metaphors
Have y'all little niggaz screamin "No, man, no"

(Chorus)

For those that said I couldn't do it
I'm here to show improvement!
(x2)

Beat bangin' ya
This is Castlevania
I rap over your head like drats in Arabia
Get ya mid right (right)
Or your brain left (left)
This is exciting life and plain death
Extravagance, a vocal bonanza
Vocal verbal muderer, beef in the stanza
Mazda 626s and Crucifixes
Rhyme patient ready for religion
Lady on the train lookin at me idle
Judgemental but she still holding a Bible
I burst out into a wild freestyle
Told her to duck and calm down
It's an urgency to kill those that's fake
For I flip and you press the emergency brake
The next stop will come after the door's closin
No leanin on the walls while I'm posin

(Chorus)</pre>
