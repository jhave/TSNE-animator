Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse]
Remember that you told me that you love me
Remember that you told me you were there for me
Remember that you told me you can't do without
Me but it seems like word of mouth
Cause I'm giving everything I got in love
And everything your giving just ain't enough for me
No, no, now I'm to the point where I wish that I

[Chorus]
Boy I wish that I didn't love you
(Didn't love you)
And I wish that I didn't care
(Didn't care at all)
Why is it that I can't think bout nobody but you
If I had one wish left
Oh I would wish your love away
Wish your love away [x2]

[Verse]
Remember that you told me I was pretty
Remember that you told me I was beautiful
Remember that you told me you was ready
And all them other bitches you can do without
And why do I feel you just the same
And boy I'm tired of playing games with you
And I'm to the point where I wish that I

[Chorus]
Boy I wish that I didn't love you
(Didn't love you)
And I wish that I didn't care
(Didn't care at all)
Why is it that I can't think bout nobody but you
If I had one wish left
Oh I would wish your love away

I wish that
There was no more sleepless nights for me
(And I wish that)
You can look inside my heart and see
How I'm feelin baby
Or maybe you just don't give a damn
Could I be foolish to give a damn baby
Cause I'm to the point where I wish

Boy I wish that I didn't love you
(Didn't love you)
And I wish that I didn't care
(Didn't care at all)
Why is it that I can't think bout nobody but you
If I had one wish left
Oh I would wish your love away
I wish that I
Wish your love away

[Outro/Chorus]
Boy I wish that I didn't love you
(Didn't love you)
And I wish that I didn't care
(Didn't care at all)
Why is it that I can't think bout nobody but you
If I had one wish left
Oh I would wish your love away</pre>
