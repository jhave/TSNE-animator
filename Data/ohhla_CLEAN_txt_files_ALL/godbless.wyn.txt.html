[Lil Wayne]
Uhh - my mind's filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops, and rolls
It's judgment day or a fire drill
Yeah! I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin
Yeah; my country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die

[Chorus]
God bless Amerika
Uhh, this ol' Godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Lil Wayne]
Damn - military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shinin
Uhh - I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword, and die by the sword
Heard po-lice was lookin for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought, then I'm guilty of greed
Momma said take what you want  I took heed - yeah
My little breed, yeah

[Lil Wayne]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eatin my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealin to me is under banana trees
Lorrrd, I go so hard
I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged - ain't that a bitch?
I'm just a nut tryin to bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Uhh; same shit, different air freshner
I don't +Playboy+, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I'll be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock, and let it cum to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missin link
Yeah!

[Chorus]
God bless Amerika
This ol' Godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smokin on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Lil Wayne]
And we live by the sword, and die by the sword
Heard po-lice was lookin for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
Uhh - I saw a butterfly in Hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
