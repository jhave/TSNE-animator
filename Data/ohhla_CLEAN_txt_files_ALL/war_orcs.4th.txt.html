WOOOWEEEE!
They want to know what you gonna do next
They in the streets yelling Pyramid you hexed
They want to know what you gonna do next
They in the streets yelling Pyramid you hexed

[VERSE 1]
Mind, officially lost got rhymes
Y'all is pissing me off in my time
Y'all can't build with the Gods
Live in a prism of fog what I'm feeling is odd
Lights, I'm bringing it back
Get hype, when I sing on a track
In my life, we spitting them raps
With my mic music mimicking the night
Medicine I use it help me living in this life
Shiver shimmering the fright politicks ain't gonna hold me down
If you thought so then you don't know me clown
Feet forced to the ground
Speaking often in nouns
In the graveyard coffins astound
Coughing aloud Teardrops mocking the clouds
Fear not (Echo)
'I know exactly what you've been up to' (Female Voice)

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Went to War with Orcs
That was guarding hell
If the rap game is smurfs
Then I'm Gargamel
My whole style's unpredictable and hard to tell
'I know exactly what you've been up to' (Female Voice)

[VERSE 2]
I'm spinning hybrid
Into life kid
What I live I write shit
Still spit preciseness
I'll king your Isis
Sting your spine with
My embedded pen
Seven headed gem
Go and tell a friend
Pyramid's prose is prevalent
Me and these flows is heaven sent
Seeing these hoes is irrelevant
And I'm a prayer mantis
Raps stay semantic
Writing all day in my cave of granite
Why come out when the game is rancid
Stay in my funhouse till my strain's demanded
Boats to the moon
Planes to Atlantis
Joke to the tune
Yet I stay in the planet

[Chorus]</pre>
