[Verse 1]
All my life I've been a victim of this corporation
Devastation across this nation filled with contemplation
And now I'm manic depressed, paranoid, obsessed
Compulsive. I am afraid so I will buy impulsive
A perfect puppet of political propaganda
Prozak is dropping bombs, like the Cuban missile crisis Havana
The satellite systems are tracking the places bar codes
GPS and the radiation from your cell phone
DNA clones, chromosomes, and yet we all condone
Mass production equals depletion of the ozone
Consumerism causing death to organisms
mainly human and animal. The war machine is cannibal!

[Interlude 1]
Everyday when I go to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

[Chorus]
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?

[Verse 2]
Military intelligence, too much combined, it can't make sense
JFK's brains go through the future, present, and past tense
Everyone with an accent be on the FBI's hit list
Homeland security is an excuse to rule with an iron fist
Like Joseph Starlin the economy collapsin but it's fallin
Terrorist threats be called in, United Nations, who's all in?
They are here to seek and destroy nations
Leave the mental scars in braces
For the purpose of self profit and televised standing ovation
The war monster is ovulating, it's time to justify the craving
Society is celebrating, while M16s are penetrating!
The end result of the life concludes that we will all soon die
Radiation of flames, mushroom clouds in the sky

[Interlude 2]
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of consumerism
And to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, under
god
with liberty and justice for all


[Chorus]
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?

[Verse 3]
You wanna fight, bitch? Well, that's just what the fuck we'll do
You like the shit you hearin? Bitch, we'll turn you black and blue
We on that other now, I thought you fuckin knew that
We here to stay, bitch, nah, we ain't comin wack!
We got the power now, our soldiers they be on our side
The tables turned now, bitch you wanna fuckin ride?
Get in my face talkin stupid shit, you must be high
I'm tired of lookin at you. Now I think it's time for you to die

[Chorus]
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?
And now we're runnin' out of time!
We must be out our fucking mind!
This country's built on corporate lies!
How many soldiers have to die, die, die, die, die?</pre>
