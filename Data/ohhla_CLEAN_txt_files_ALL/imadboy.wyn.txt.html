[Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Ok I'm strapped
Get 'Em
Black Hat, Black Shades, Black Diamonds Oh Behave
No he can't with the fuckin seats back
Got the paint job tho
And the fuckin seats cracked

[Chorus]
I'm a d-boy
Bitch I'm a d-boy
Ho I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the rov for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket
I got money in my block
I got the money in the power

I'm a d-boy
Bitch I'm a d-boy
Ho I'm a dopeboy
I got the scope in the rov for them jackboys
I got money in my pocket
I got money in my block
I got the money in the power
I'm Gone

[Lil Wayne]
Thinkin' of a masta plan
I get money but I'm thinkin of a fasta plan
I'm tryin' to cash it in
I got 5 in thet garbage can and the Wrap Saran
I need cash advance
See I know three sold
The other two a jam
I'ma sit on one and whip the other one much as I can
Hot ass fuckin sadan
Windows rolled down no sound
Them bricks got the speakers drowned
I ain't listenin for shit but sirens
I ain't tryin to get to my ships sunk fuck you pirates
I'll touch you cowards
It ain't nuthin to a boss
The niggaz in the hood tryina floss and ya head gotta cost nigga
Take a loss nigga
SS five five all black with the top chopped off dat
Catch me in the spots where the shots pop off at
I ain't tryin to prove nuttin I'm jus tryin to move somen

[Chorus]

[Baby]
See we cookin' up a thousand grams
I'm in the kitchen over the stove with pots and pans
Triple color with the platinum jam
50 birds homeboy in the back of a van
A hundred grand in rubberbands
We got them birds in the coffee cans
We got the whips wit the extra clips
Got bitches outta state niggaz flippin them bricks
Been in the caddy been in the alley
Nigga been on the block
Right in front of mrs gladdies (?)
Nigga know bout hustlin'
Know bout stuntin
Did the curb servin shyned every summer (Biatch)
Been on front, been in the back
Nigga roll wit ducktape and ride wit the mac
We see these haters like fuck them niggaz
We made men millionaire hustlin our nature

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
8 AM open my eyes
Yeah kick my bitch tell her open the blinds
And I'm, over the stove at 9
Yeah I'm cookin breakfast for the block then I let her cook mine
Yeah quick line in the bathroom before we bounce
Not me I mean her she go a day a ounce (damn)
Y'all pray for her
While I'm at the bus station in the Bently sittin' low as I wait for ya
I'm gettin' dough I'm a paper---boy I will take ya
For the right paper--boy I will take her
Shake her--tape her--waist up
Send her to the money she be back before I wake up
Get cha cake up
Y'all niggaz lame ducks
Ya prolly get ya game up when I'm givin the game up
My name wayne what
Hot boy flame up
You niggaz tryin to change up and I'm gettin my change up

[Chorus]</pre>
