[Chorus: B.I.G. sample]
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up
I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, to the game and fuckin blew up

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I grew up a screw up to the best of my knowledge
I continue through out the streets, can't tell you shit about college
I chose my own path on a lonely road - to try an get paid
and pray to God me and my niggas will never have to lay in no grave
I never got to be like Mike, cause I ended up like my brother
livin crazy in these streets, but an angel around my mother
fascinated by the light in the night, and the money, and hoes
the clothes, and all the whips, and the diamonds - while they swangin on 4's
I got my first gun, headed for my first lick
my nigga switched it up and he was headed for his first brick
either way that it went, we both was gon'try an get paid
and wasn't no way in hell they was gon'stick me with minimum age
it ain't take but thirty - seconds to make up my mind
and it took me by the dirt, and that took the side that I had to shine
and I was gon'get it whether it was legal or crime
I had to get a piece even if it lead me to doin some time

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Trae]
Whether they like it or not this rappin done got me settled
every since a youth I hit the gas, with my weight on the pedal
Dinkie told me this gon'be my ticket to leave the hood
and when they see me now these niggas know it's all good
I ain't finna let shit get in my way, it took me a second to get here
I'm the champion of the streets, so it's understood I'm a sit here
Lord knows how many fuck ups, it took for me to get here
it's only room for one, all you extra niggas can't fit here
even if I was a screw up - I turned out bein' a ghetto star
with a teacher's salary invested inside of my ghetto car
I guess it ain't all that bad to be who I am
I'd do it all again just to show these niggas 'bout who I am(nigga)

[Chorus]

[Trae]
Well I guess growin up a screw up, ain't all that bad huh
mothafuckers told a nigga - he wasn't gon'be shit
them hoes still doin the same mothafuckin thing nigga
I'm movin round this bitch, five mothafuckin whips
takin care of my mothafuckin son, my mothafuckin'gang
and everything I represent, yeah if I had to do this shit all over again
I wouldn't change a mothafuckin thing mayne - Trae Tha Truth, yeah</pre>
