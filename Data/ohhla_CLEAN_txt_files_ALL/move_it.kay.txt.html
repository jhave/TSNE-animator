[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says:
"I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?
And we can move it like this"

Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)

[Verse 2:]
And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
"Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia I miss your rose tatoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn alot from Lydia)
I gotta move it like this"

Aaahhhhhhh (hold me, squeeze me)
Aaahhhhhhh
Aaahhhhhhh (hold me, squeeze me)
Aaahhhhhhh

[Verse 3:]
Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says "How far do you want to go?"
He says "How far is to Moreau?"
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things i miss
But start is off with a kiss
And move a little something like this

Aaahhhhhhh
And now ya move it like this
Aaahhhhhhh
Start it off with a kiss 
Then move a little something like this
Aaahhhhhhh
And now ya move it like this
Aaahhhhhhh
Start it off with a kiss, and now ya move it like

(the moral of the story goes like this)

[Verse 3:]
Life brings you surprises (life brings you surprises)
Sometimes problems arise, yea (sometimes problems arise)
Life brings you surprises (life brings you surprises)
Sometimes you don't realize 
Til it's right before your eyes
And you say (aahhh)
I love to love you baby (aahhh)
Can't live without ya baby (aahhhh)
Your life, it drives me crazy
If I only get one wish
Number one on my list
To move a little something like this

Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)
Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)</pre>
