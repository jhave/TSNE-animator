[Moka Only]
I guess the grandular surface, I make my purpose known globally
You purchase this anomolys product
Grass roots, merchant, operate soulfully
Common trades is not that
Watch me wave the wand, I've got a top hat
Pull the magic out of it, pop that pot of rocks out of it
If you are all the salt, I'm the ground temper
If you are all the cult, I'm the leader, hypnotize with minor effort
And made your pressure to pay for pleasure
I find a meadow, relax the mind and measure time in the hour glass
This industry ain't industrious
I dust them off, bust them in action
Hollering in the library, this century's on some hustle shit
Muscular husky work, cardio-vascular passwords
Trust me jerk, us we're parked and ready to swerve
Deserve confetti and took your tape from riperets
Snap a Ritz, rappes, drown them in some soup and split
Found me out the loop, I'm in
Vancou ambassador, upper Eshilon, Arabic to Ecuador
Apitimy, a bigger anatomy, finality
Finiclly earned the salary, big fatalities

[Abstract Rude]
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosen

[Abstract Rude]
We're smoking in here with both engineers in a studio rear
Just open your ear, we're working in here
The type, that Moka says he's growing his hair
Well give him a year, It will damn near look just like us
And this is for my homies in the cypher
Puffing chaza, we can pull all nighters
Park my car in the rear of the club
Get in the show without a ticket stub, I'm getting love
It reads no smoking on the sign
But I ignore it every single time
Though I don't park in handicaps, that's bad karma
Plus more than a little fine
It's warmer in the summer when the sun shines
I'm a bomber with a marker when I don't see the one time
I need a sponser, I want my own clothing line
None of the brand names, give me one of a kind
Stick to the game plan and it's gonna be fine
We smoke basil, oregano kind

[Abstract Rude]
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosen

[Prevail]
We're smoking in here, my vocals are clear
Smoking in the language of a mirror
Hexagonal, pentogonal, we're here today and gone tomorrow
Broken armor, eagle talon, crushing spirals
Chest I scalp and fess the signs of Seth
Everyday, intake of a broken crest
I hope for rest but smoking less, makes it harder to deal with stress
So I take the toke in steps
The social sense is old and deaf
they sold the specs to interenets, avenge the debts, reverse the ocean depths
Ain't nothing but molten left
The cold in my breath that's forty-five millilitres fresh
A murder of rest, pressure in text, in hex the next
The destiny of complex Planet X

Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here, we're smoking in here
It's Ab and Prev and Moka in here, we're open
Rebels who be known for breaking the rules
So go tell everybody the news
We're smoking in here and nobody cares
It's Codename Scorpion in here, we're chosen</pre>
