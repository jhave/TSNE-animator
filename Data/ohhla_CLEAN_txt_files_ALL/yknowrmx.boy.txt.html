[Intro - Background Vocals and Kanye West]
You know, oh you know, I just want you to know
Turn me up, turn me up loud to, loud l-l-l-l-loud, yea, yea!

[Chorus x2]
I just want you to know, I just want you to know
I just want you to know, this boy here finna' blow
Southside up in here, Westside up in here
Eastside up in here, throw your hands in the air

[Kanye West]
Kanye the best in the game, now we got that, that thing clear
Kanye West is the name, Southside up in here
Y'all niggaz stole the soul, y'all niggaz all some clones
Y'all need to change y'all tone, nigga I control the gold
Motherfucker close the do', light the weed and let the douja blow
Why you keep bawlin' though girl, you ain't been around niggaz before?
Why my chain rosey gold, why my wrist below zero
How the hell I know B-Lo, why them girls tell you no means no
No means no just as sure as green means go, green means paper
Dream team, caper we see haters like shorty on the 'Sixth Sense'
Y'all finna' see some dead people, come through ya block and air people
My people ain't scared people, only FIG-I-AIR people

[Chorus x2]

[B-Lo]
This track really hot so I gotta spit fire in here
Vogue and a flo, B-Lo represent west side in here
This thang West C-I, do you wanna smoke one to the dome
Better hit her good, knock on double wood
If it don't affect, then I'm gone
I drop bricks on blocks, I got sick on loc'
Radio keep my slide, fuck it nigga, I'm so high!
I set birds in them, but I'm not a Vir-Gee-In!
Platinum shit, that's my plan, if a nigga really want it then
Cadillac, slam the doors, keep a chick all in 'em oh
My niggaz all from the go, Do Or Die way too cold
Iced out way to cold, my shit way to fro!
But a nigga already kno! But a nigga already know!

[White Boy]
Rap profit, plat gothic, slash convict raps jock it, phat
Pockets mac, hopin' crack, poppin' stacks
Droppin' cakes, stoppin' wakes, knockin' hate
And you fakes, watchin' base, on relate
Gossip fakes and I make, options
In case I catch a case gots to pay, confrentrate
Need ya way, from this place, cause it ain't common
If this ain't the way, Kan-ye, then it's straight
Colleges, in ya veins cause you spit what you came from
Straight knowledge, I was raised in the street
Praised in my heat, holdin' on my Nextel
Hopin' for my next cell, focused on the best cell
Smokin' on a fresh L, posted like FedEx mail

[Chorus 2x]

[Kanye West - Talking]
Yo, by the way
