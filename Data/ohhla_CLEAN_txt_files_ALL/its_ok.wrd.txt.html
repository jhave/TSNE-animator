[Chris Ward]
Ten bricks nigga, in a Benz six nigga
It's your motherfucking nigga, C. Ward
Five years later, and I'm five times greater
It's your motherfucking nigga, C. Ward
What's my motherfucking name, put a bullet in your head
Leave your shirt red, cause pussies get bled
It's the spokesman, from Y.S.P.
I can't lie until I die, it's S.U.C.
I conversate for a thee, do a verse for three
Whenever you fuck with me, it's gon cost you a fee
I rip shows, get rid of those girls you be liking and loving
Cause to me, they just bullshit hoes
Live and direct, from the 7-1-Tre
Where niggaz be holding you down, like everyday
It's the flyest, nigga talking
Someone give me the space, cause I'm the flyest nigga walking
I'm way out, this atmosphere
What is it 0-3 shit, I'll be back next year
With some new sensations, game to give y'all
M.O.B. Style, this is how we live y'all
See it's the, hoe slapper
Pimp, slash flow rapper
Rap rhymes rap flows, rap bricks rap hoes
Pay the price for anyone of the four, and I'll wrap those
Bad hoes I fuck em, after that I duck em
Cigarellos I stuff em, with endo and puff em
Bitches on dick, wanting some'ing for nothing
That might surprise you, but to me it's nothing
I'm irresisitable, attitude is despicable
I pop out on your kids, like peek-a-boo
Huh, it's ghetto pimping on a track
Shit I'm like a gat, some every nigga need in his Lac
Chris Wizzard, watch how you pronounce the shit
G's up hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this uh
G's up hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Hook]
Before you dog you dying, and busting your eye in
Take the stand you lying, it's ok
If you cook it cut it, watch fuck it all your niggaz in public
Them bitches love it, it's ok
If you hard right now, it's the greatest on the buck
Looking for some'ing to fuck, it's ok
If you slide in with her, it's ok
If you slide in with him, it's ok

[Big Pokey]
I'm the nigga, that you 'spose to know
Same nigga that's suppose to touch the rock, when it's fourth and fo'
I'm hot, but my freestyle fo' below
Step on feet, sorry if I broke your toe
My hoes, call me Mr. finesse
I'm a throwback nigga, old school just like Mitchell &amp; Ness
And them scared niggaz, check they chins
Fake left hand shakes, I see through you like a contact lens
Now honor, my words
M.O.B., money over bullshit right now I got a gun and a bird
Mob niggaz, move in herds
You need to stop, I cock a five pound glock that can move your curb
Ain't no nigga, like a Mob Style nigga
Cause a Mob Style nigga, don't quit
Ain't no bitch, like a Mob Style bitch
Cause a Mob Style bitch, rock pits
Does it a day, new Chanelle negaleshe
Buying for real, bout they bread and don't play
I'm a bull like I'm born in May, I rush niggaz
Stay in your place, you bump too much hush nigga
In a trap, open your eyes and see your face
I'm here to stay like a test in your skin, you missed a space
These hoes wanna give me they ass, give me your face
Cannon on my waist, cause these niggaz is hoes
And you move, I walk in I'm taking the show
Whip niggaz with this pen, like I'm taking the sco'
First, I'ma hit em with this
Lean back go and hit em with Chris, it's like I'm losing my fits
M.O.B. you know that we thoed
We bout to reload, unlock and explode
Y.S.P. you know it don't stop
This here for Lil' Pop, we stay on the block nigga
