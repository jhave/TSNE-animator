Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree

Shorty want to take her shopping spree
So she need a nigga on the grind
Shorty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took her
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree

I'm gunned up like you're mine
Ain't nothing about a bitch new purse
In fly bitch OR earth
Five nigga who sell T-shirts
T-shirt that shot for the word
Lean got pants up under that skirt
Walk red box and you feet's got to hurt
Want to go splurge
Want to go Gucci
Want to go poaching
Want to go shopping
Want start over
Want to go brag
Want to go bustling
I'll set you free
Tell me where you with
Tell me for the biz
You got your nigga
And all do win, win, win, win
I stay here leaks again, again, again, again and again
I'm forced off the train
Is that way in
You want to have a mojo
Graf up a ten
You want to have a style
That can't be denied
You look big holster
Drive a fly ride
Want to hit the bank
With a chick that's blank
Want rodeo
T you about to thank
In New York
Fashion Week
Flash champagne
And don't eat a thing

Shorty want to take her shopping spree
So she need a nigga on the grind
Shorty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took her
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree

Put down all of you bide
Presidents you wrist
Gucci, Pucci, Louis
Crisp that little routine
Let's take us trip to flips
Then shot like a birthday hip
You fuck the cake that biz
I'm buy goods every day this shift
Your purse matching you ear grind
Your ear grind matching your shoe
So kneel on, kneel on that
You sick of Jenna too
You ever think I played for the families
I'll be bird con too
Yo nigga grab this 75
You shot to the face
Turn blue
Your Louis V drank champagne
Going to spit you back to Iraq
You keep your little mouth clever
I'm a let you play with this set
This set right here full of Hummers
Them boy damn brought their hundreds
You roll up this
Got a day in
Bought two flat screens for your mama

Shorty want to take her shopping spree
So she need a nigga on the grind
Shorty want to take her shopping spree
Then she want to make that pussy mine
Shopping spree, shopping spree
You never took her
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Shopping spree, shopping spree
Want to go on a
Shopping spree, shopping spree</pre>
