The preacher's son with the rebel music
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now
Rebel music, everywhere put the peace sign up now
Rebel music, hold on, listen

[Wyclef]
Tell the DJ turn the music up
Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs
Me I play the walk, sipping on the Guiness
Cause in reality we are the same and it's
Just society they wanna see me
Flesh on the concrete, sold a perfect story
The mystery is waking up in misery
The music industry brainwash celebrities
Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with the monster
Had no idea that the fish was a piranha
Word from the wise I can see through the fog
Reason why they rob cause they got no job

[Wyclef]
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning
Feel like it's gonna be a good day
No war on the street, no way, today
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight
You shine, I shine and
The whole world looking like a gold mine
You get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times

[Wyclef]
When they see me they ask me
Will there ever be another Fugees
I say I don't know but hope the trio
Don't do like ? ? then ? on Sadaam though
But on CNN they saw the same
Little kids getting shot at close range
To Babylon, we don't want no war
I'm a send a message in a bottle to the White house door
These are the words from the master
So don't you wait till the day after
Until then you can catch me in the sixes
Just pumping Bob Marley rebel music now

[Wyclef]
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning
Feel like it's gonna be a good day
No war on the street, no way, today
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight
You shine, I shine and
The whole world looking like a gold mine
You get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times

[Wyclef]
Children, imagine a world with no racism
No, no homeless in Grand Central Station
Boys and girls going to schools with no tools
Life is so beautiful but until then it will be
Rebel music, rebel music
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now

[Prodigy]
Uh, can these devils fool us son, not nowadays dun
We're a generation of thugs, you can't play with us
We've been lied to, enslaved and beaten up
We're immune to what you call pain, it's nothing
We're not scared of dying or afraid of guns
Born in the USA, nah, can't blame us
Our DNA's foreign to them
We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will
Yo, pass me my rod, it's about to get stupid
These niggaz trying to stop our plans, peace to it
I never meant to cause him pain and he knew it
But he was trying to kill me and he blew it

[Wyclef]
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning
Feel like it's gonna be a good day
No war on the street, no way, today
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight
You shine, I shine and
The whole world looking like a gold mine
You get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times</pre>
