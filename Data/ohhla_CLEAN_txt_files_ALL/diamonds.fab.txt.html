[Chorus: Sample from "Diamonds" by Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Verse One: Fabolous]
I turn my dark secrets, into bright ideas
I used to cry for help, I learned to wipe my tears
I was scared to embrace but now I fight my fears
These hoes say I'm too much it's only right I share
Pressure makes diamonds, I was made to shine
When Life gave me lemons I made lemonade with mine
What's beef? Beef is when you make mistakes
Like less burgers with yo' buddies and mo' steaks with snakes
My story just gets better, when you get to the end
So when I'm at my worst, I know it's not the end
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?

[Chorus: Sample from "Diamonds" by Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
I'm shinnin religiously, Jesus pieces and crosses
I paid for all of my toys I don't owe any Santa Claus's (WORD!)
I never finished school or completed no college courses (NAH!)
Was taught to be a winner but I learned more from my losses 
Losses like, when you go, is yo' friends 'gone miss you?
Was it 'cause you beneficial or you been official?
Condo at the top one floor down from heaven yo!
Hatin is beneath me, I say that's the devil yo!
I'm tryin to keep the faith (Faith!) Hangin there with hope (Hope!)
Until my jeweler bought myself two angels on a rope
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?

[Chorus: Sample from "Diamonds" by Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
Could say I always was the truth but that be lyin a little
You can't spell believe without a lie in the middle
I always say it first, niggas tryin to ditto
But I got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle 
Mind of a general, heart of a soldier
That just mean I call the shots but I ain't afraid to take a shot
Niggas gave it all they got still couldn't take my spot
Don't get yo' shorty got and have to live out take his plot
I ain't give a fuck now I would give whatever
You only live once but legacies live forever
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?

[Chorus: Sample from "Diamonds" by Rihanna]
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond

[Outro: Sample from "Diamonds" by Rihanna]
Shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
