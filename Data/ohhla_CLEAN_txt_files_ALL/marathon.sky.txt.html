[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
He said all I know is mad start
And when the gun go off, he turns black heart
'Cause when the runnin is on, we all track stars
You either runnin along or you a past mark
So either run with it forward or play the past part
There's no rides for the weary or weak
It's so quiet you can hear when you sleep
But so live you can clear in a week
With no ties, no ears to the street
No thrones, no homes, nothin on
Nothin promised outside, so what you hearin is cheap
They say we all in this together
But somethin gotta give or somebody gotta give 'til all of this get better
If all of this is forever and the goal is to change
Then you can't upset if we should go with our aim
And you can't see regrets if you controllin your lane
Put your hand on your heart and you solemnly swear to get it
Driver seat, right side or rear, you with it
'Cause shit is wicked on these mean streets
But where the green be is where we tryin to stand, so we need reach
Dirty 'round here, so we need cleats, lace up now

[Chorus - Skyzoo]
I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Huh, 'cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
'Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
Every step taken is a step gained
Or a step lost, dependin on how your step change
When you step on, there's no returns or step aways
Either step cross or fall out of the step game
Shit is transparent tryin to find where the step's made
If I can't bare it, I'm a die where the step's raised
And I can't hear when they cry, I'm at a step's pace
'Cause for the love of everything that we saw
Everything that we want is everything that keep us sprintin along
And the soles on your kicks turn as thin as the walls
So it's one knee down, both hands on the ground
When the six shot blows, all hands in the crowd
Turn parallel to you but the hands in the crowd
Were really just a mirage, ain't a stander around
Some look for God, some can't find a cloud
So they take it to the store where handlin is allowed
The money starts grownin as quick as the time change
Start countin your steps, the line is five away
Four left so you ease up with it like "I'm straight"
You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words (*echo*)

[Chorus - Skyzoo]
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Huh, 'cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
'Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)

[Break - Skyzoo]
You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words
You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words
Everything that you predicted is gone with the words, huh
