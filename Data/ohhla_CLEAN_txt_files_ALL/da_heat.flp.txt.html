[Rampage]
Yeah, Lieutenant what!
Yeah, motherfucka 
It's Flipmode
Yeah yeah, spliff, check it out, uh

[Rampage]
Ramp, I've been ill since back in the days
Rockin' shell-toed Addidas with rags for my waves
Flipmode be the unit now I'm playin' for the Braves
I'm hardcore nigga that's straight from the gutter 
I used to play scully plus, hot peas and butta
Now I'm the nigga that's runnin' in your baby motha
Burgundy Ac, you can call me Ramp Lova
And now I'm toppin' pokey with my Louisville slugger

[Baby Sham]
My Squad is sick niggas who pop shit get pistol whipped
Get your wig pushed back, I react and snap 
Like Kodak, these cats get the picture
Put on level black suede Timbs and come and get ya
My target is your feature 
we all sport hoods like grim reapers
We shine in the dark blink of an eye the last spark
Get closed up, first thug nigga hold up 
21st side see me rounding it up

Chorus: Busta Rhymes

See when we come through we got nuf shit to flaunt
Got u feelin' it and your cousin even your aunt
violate, we coming like ghost we gonna haunt
Hit you with the heat is that what you really want?
What you really want is that what you really want?
We hit you with the heat is that what you really want?
What you really want is that what you really want?
we hit you with the heat is that what you really want?

[Spliff Star]
Y'all niggas wanna test my squad, I doubt it doubt it
All that murder talk, gun talk, you talk, I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Nigga feel my vibe niggas see my vision 
P-Y-P nigga play your position
I fuck up this game and make the ref' blow the whistle 
My squad be the official, clique in this rap shit
Diss me on the record and watch, you get your ass kicked
Catch me on Church Ave, flickin blunt ashes

[Rah Digga]
Crazy, thinkin I can't rock buttas
Wont take shit without no type floders
Hectic, Rah on the ill dialect shit
Deliveries harder then girls in obstectrics
Ready to stay on 
Smoother then rayon
Takin' out niggas and all they liaisons 
Mu'fuckas, black out season 
Publishing resume steady increasing

Chorus

[Lord Have Mercy]
Shanghai, Shanghai
New sheriff in town
Rock America's crown and hang 'em high
Who bangin' a fist full? 
Brandishing pistols
Pearl handles with the, family initials
Uh-uh, 24 karat gold variuos slow
Uh-uh, planet gets cold, get damaged for dough
Uh-uh!, Savages off balance and blow traveling slow
Uh-uh!, in effect mode, y'all niggas know it

[Busta Rhymes]
Sayonara, send my rivals, slam a guy, 
Be damned if I
Had to tell one, tell a lie, get paralyzed 
Stay payed, rock shit made in ultra suede 
Switch blade yo wack act back to first grade 
Even if y'all never seen us you know y'all need us
Suck my penis from here to muthafucking venus
Think back when you was amazed and had to sit back 
Imagining me ending your world like Deep Impact
Blood clot, watch me come through and bust a gunshot
Yeah people, come inside of your dance and done that

Chorus 2x

[Busta Rhymes]
Fuckin' y'all up
Flipmode forever
Stays focused
Pay Attention
Pay Attention...*fades to phone interlude*</pre>
