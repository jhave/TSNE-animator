[Intro: Ruck]
Yo what up man?
What's the deal Starang Wondah?
Ay, what up Louieville, what up D.O.G.
Yeah man I just ran to Tek-N-Steele
Let's talk about these Ninety Now girls
Man there's a whole lotta stuff goin now
Aiyo girl I can't wait, come over here girl

[Smokelite]
I knew this girl named Ta, she lived in her garage
Had a few friends, so she played a lotta cards
If it wasn't for the money, it wasn't no game
If the same people came, then the game would stay the same
I know this girl named Shelly, met her at the telly
Took to the diner, so she can fill her belly
Slip my hands down her pants, but the shit was kinda smelly
Made a hard dick limp til the shit feel like jelly

[Top Dog Big Kahuna]
I know a girl named Stacy, drove a nigga crazy
Went back to her crib, cuz I thought that she would lace me
Had her mother face me, daddy tried to mace me
Runnin thru the projects, niggas try to chase me
Then came Keema, bagged her in the beemer
At the video shoot, sippin on Zima
Damn you shoulda seen her, I mean you shoulda seen her
Attractin niggas like coke thru the femur

[Starang Wondah]
Yo I met a chick named Millie, I met her uptilly
Know I smoke leaf, but she prefer to smoke Phillies
Started gettin high, touchin, actin silly
Had to tell her call me Will, I hate it when you call me Willie

[Louieville Sluggah]
Now Millie had a cousin, who name was Susan
Talkin too much, I had to tell her "keep it movin"
Susan was sign, but Ville was glad
Because a nigga walked off wit her best friend Pam

[Starang Wondah]
Aiyo Pam was all right, but I liked her cousin Tammy
Met at her at How Can I Be Down In Miami?
Then Tammy came over wit her best friend Penny
Had to introduce the bitch to my nigga named Henny

[Louieville Sluggah]
Now me and Penny girl, met before
Buyin condoms outta the candy store
Need I say more? Bed was a hundred record
Kept bangin this chick til she screamed "My Lord"

[Tek]
I know a C.O. named Nikki, she gave me a hickey
In the other room was her man Pretty Ricky
He's in a black Bentley, wit tints on twenties
Nikki was his favorite, but he had many honies

[Steele]
He had this one Rhoda, she lived in Corona
Met her at the Coliseum, wit her best friend Sonia
She had a fat ass but her breath had aroma
So instead I called Sonia, cuz she wanted me to bone her

[Tek]
I know hold weight bitches, no fake bitches
You better have a check on the first day bitches
That take it up the anal, swallow like Draino
Try anything once, never heard her say no

[Steele]
Like that red bone Star, had a cousin named Shamar
Both freaks wanna S.T. for a managetua
See me in my car with Buck, Tek and Dog
Took her to the hotel, and sexed us all

[Chorus: Tek]
Ain't gotta spit no game, she know we do our thing
See at me club and my nigga Digga reign
She don't like guns, but she lust one
Half of her income, furnished by Swiss funds
Do be looked tight, body be lookin right
Your friends can meet my friends, let's get it on tonight
Always gotta plan, know how to make a grand
She on her own paper chase, she don't need a man

[Ruck]
I know a girl named Wonda, smoked marijuana
Call her Snake-eater, cuz she ate my anaconda
Caught mad drama wit Wonda, wit smokin zhama
In the back of a Honda, wit this chick named Tiwana
This bitch named Sue, she hang out wit a crew
How bad was them bitches rockin shit brand new
I was gassed for the ass and I'm ready to screw
All she did was rub my crotch, till my balls turn blue

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
