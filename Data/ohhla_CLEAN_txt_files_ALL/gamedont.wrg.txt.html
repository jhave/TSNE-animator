I come to find out though, all these years, man
The game wont wait no matter who you are
Where you are or how you are 
The game wont wait
Its a cold thang, its a cold game
You know how it is


(Chorus) x3
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait

[Snoop]
Now all I, see is we
The LBC, 213s
Cheese and please and the reason the season
The click's off the heezy, Mr. Warren G Z 
Gots to make it easy, for Snoop D Z
They come back, and drop raps and make snaps so easy
The most hunted, and most wanted 
With a pocket full of hundreds, you know how we run it
[Warren G]
Snoop D woop pass the M-I-C
Anticipation 213
We contemplate, and regulate
Now we got the game tight, its money to make (money, money, money)
The game wont wait but you can wait for the game
Worldwide tour, with skirts screamin our name
[Snoop]
The hits dont stop because the game wont change
all we goin to do is maintain, maintain
[Nate Dogg]
The hits dont stop because the game dont wait
I got no time for no payin much rate
I gotta go out and buy some brand new clothes
change my socks before they reveal my toes 
The hits dont stop because the game dont wait
And the girls dont stop because the dick is straight
let me teach you what I already know
the hits dont stop so its time I go

(Chorus) x3
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait

[Warren G]
Now its the second time around ain't no phonies any fakes
Let me holla at cha tryin to snake my stakes
you older than me, you say OG, you almost 40
tryin to stay young and sporty
Sport you roll me those and stay in ya place
Before you see all-stars, right up in ya face
[Snoop]
Youngsta never bite the hand thats feeds you
Proceed to get back to your folks, the loccs that need you
We do, we always keep it on the true
213, thats the name of the crew
Its true, that the dirt i did
As a kid got me caught up, but I was brought up
With the M-O if a D-O, so play your info, 
Youngster I been doin this before I hit the radizzo
Snoop D Z is off the heezey
So you can make mine, extra cheesy
The crew's a twist cuz it consists of
3 riders, eastsiders, one love
The hits dont stop because the game won't change
All we ever wanted was a small time rap chain

(Chorus) x3
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait

[Nate Dogg]
The shit keeps movin it'll never stop
Long as we able to make hit roccs
Long as a papa can't stop my flow
The shit don't stop I gotta make my flow
The shit don't stop if you intend to take
The shit don't stop its companies we break
Take all the money and toss them hoes
The shit don't stop thats just how it goes

(Chorus) x3
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait
Game dont wait
Shit dont stop because the game dont wait</pre>
