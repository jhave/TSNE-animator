[Verse 1 - Mic Boyd] (Classified)
What's the deal with the Air Force 1's and the bling that you rock on your chains?
Just because ya see it in a video don't mean you have to act like a skank (what?)
There's a lot of fuckin gangsters hunnie
And the rappers sayin nothin still makin money

[Chorus - Mic Boyd] (Classified)
Dope, crack, knives, gats, old backs and all of that
It's still hip-hop to me (one more time ...)
The bling bling, shiny things, backpacks and all of that
It's still hip-hop to me

[Verse 2 - Mic Boyd] (Classified)
What's a matter with the car I'm drivin, can't ya tell that it's out of style (vroom)
Should I get a set of twenty inch rims just to drive an American mile? (yeah ...)
It doesn't matter if you really like it or not (nah)
As long as you're livin it, it's still considered hip-hop (yeah)

[Chorus - Mic Boyd] (Classified)
Dope, crack, knives, gats, old backs and all of that
It's still hip-hop to me (woo!)
The bling bling, shiny things, backpacks and all of that
It's still hip-hop to me

[Outro - Classified - talking]
Ha, that's fuckin stupid but I liked it</pre>
