Uhh, uhh, uhh
Niggaz gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in they mouth
And then I snuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all thats that left
Niggaz so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath
til I pass, cause they ass, and I smelled em
I S-P-E-L-L-E-D  T-H-E-M, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggaz is about to get hurt, do work
to skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF
Night time is the right time for creepin
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!
SCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
a couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
the-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20 {*sing like Nice and Smooth*}
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat new leather jacket, I bag it, along with
the jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin
Niggaz called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin
shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "The FUCK is you be sniffin?"
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin
Gots to say nuttin, niggaz know they get had

Motherfucker, Funk Flex, volume three, the final chapter
Ruff Ryders, Irv Gotti, Def Jam..
Right here, where my dogs at?
Got them all for you baby I got them all
I gots them all..</pre>
