Typed by: ringmaasta@hotmail.com

Violent J, Violent J, is that you? 
I'm on the microphone, so what'cha wanna do? 
Violent J, Violent J, is that you? 
A wicked, wicked clown painted just for you
I drink Faygo it's only a buck-ten 
I'm a pour it on your tits when we fucking 
Cuz I'm with that kinky shit, hoe
I can see you butt-naked in your window 
Shimmy up the house side dash 
Now I'm gonna press my nuts on the glass 
Let me in, hoe, don't ya know 
I'm Violent J of the ICP, yo I got me a checklins cashing 
If I could spend it with the hoes I'm crashing 
But don't get all geek slut 
Cuz I'm a buy ya some lava to wash your butt 
What's this clown shit about? 
A knife to your neck and your throats hanging out 
With a do-me-ray 
Now it's about time I say

Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you? 
Yeah, let me tell ya what I wanna do 
Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you? Yo, Nate, Yo, Nate Woohoo!!!
Frontin', they frontin', everybody's frontin' 
Violent Violent J is gonna tell ya something 

If ya know a bitch who got grits 
Kid Rock, Kid Rock will probably eat that shit
Boohoo motherfucker what'cha cry for 
I'm that nigga that your bitch would die for 
The whore showed up at my front door 
So I fucked her in the ass and I threw her out the back door 
The bitch thought it was a cake drive 
She said drive me to the city, so I dropped her off at lakeside 
You driving me home, well I meant ta 
But plans have changed so get your ass on the centaur 
Hoe, this ain't no taxi I be mackin' hoes, they don't mack me
Never slacking, hoes I be macking 
Kid Rock, Kid Rock Never slacking, hoes I be macking 

Violent J serving ghetto hard street shit 
The funk, the funk from the old days 
Violent J serving ghetto hard street shit 
The funk from the old days

Well, I'm up for the shot in a minute 
Show me a valley, I might yodek in it 
Like somebody else I know I been to Mount Plen 
as I've been to Romeomeomeo 
Wicked clowns gonna flow for ya son
Three for the treble, eight for the drum 
Five for the homies that I run with
Bitch call your mother cause you're done with 
Toe tip-toe, I snuck in your house 
And fell asleep butt-naked on the front couch 
So, excuse me, pops, I'm napping 
So could ya shut the fuck up with that yapping 
And your wife's all worked up for nothing 
She act like she ain't never seen a wang or something 
Cuz it really don't matter I'm a show my nuts to innocent bystander 
Every fucking day 
Cuz it's about time I say

Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you? 
Yeah, let me tell you what I wanna do 
Kid Rock, Kid Rock, is that you? 
I just said it was motherfucker

Skinny dipping in the pool, you know I drown hoes 
Fuck them doggie style and play that ass like a bongo 
Hit it, hit hi-hit it 
Hitting homerums and never wimp, ho 
Smoke my dick like it's a big spliff 
This ain't a blooper and I'm no joker 
But I can shoot a nut 50 foot like a super soaker 
But I won't pull it out for a cheap joke 
Instead I play John Holmes in a sequel to Deep Throat 
Taste the nut in your mouth, just to school ya 
But ho, don't let the smooth taste fool ya 
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya...</pre>
