Touch one button, the motherfucker poof
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off

[Gorilla Zoe]
Tat 24, suicide do's
Lookin' at my car yeah that's Gorilla Zoe
Sittin' up high, beatin' down low
502's, ready set go
Gorilla 'round my neck, gorilla in the trunk
20 on my wrist, 40 on the dunk
10 on the paint, 12 on the shoes
4 15's make the whole block move
Yeah the paint's candy but it ain't sweet
AR-15's on the passenger seat
100 grand in the trunk, what I made last week
Gettin' money lil shorty Block E-N-T

Grill out pipe, sittin' on fo's
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off
Mink seats bucket, Suede on the roof
Touch one button, the motherfucker poof
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off

[Yung Joc]
When it's cold outside keep the ostrich seats heated
A cutta in the back like a sealy posturepedics
Oh yeah, one thing you gon' have to get
A fitted with the first letter of the alphabet
Get it, ayyy
Her head game right
Got a 442 with the flow master pipes
I draw attention, like I'm Picasso
26, big wheels, damn that's colasso
Fresh button flip screens, I know you see it
Fish bowl high beams, I know you see it
o z on ice cream, I know you see it
When I pull up ya hoe scream, I know you see it

AC full, suicide doors
Grill out pipe, sittin' on fo's
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off
Mink seats bucket, Suede on the roof
Touch one button, the motherfucker poof
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off

[Gorilla Zoe]
I wake up in the mornin' still drunk from last night
The Chevy catch flight like a multi-colored kite
Blow-Pop paint, baby girl have a bite
Say she only like girls, me too, we both dykes
Mink on my back (back) mink on the seats (seats)
Mink on the floor take the shoes off ya feet (feet)
The whip go topless my Chevy's a stripper
Got another just like her I'm in love with sisters
454 all chrome goin A-WAL
Igloo AC, blowin' snowballs
Stop at the light, but my rims don't pause
Bedford on the break I had to take my shoes off

AC full, suicide doors
Grill out pipe, sittin' on fo's
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off
Mink seats bucket, Suede on the roof
Touch one button, the motherfucker poof
Shit so clean nigga take ya shoes off
Take ya shoes off, take ya shoes off</pre>
