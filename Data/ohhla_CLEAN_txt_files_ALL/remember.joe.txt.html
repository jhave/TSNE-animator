[Joe]
Not so long ago, I was not so popular
I couldn't find a girl who was into me
I searched for things to blame, maybe I was strange
But I knew one day it would all change

Now I'm making joints that turn the club up and down
Carousel going round and round
Crazy how they all feel me now
I still remember

I remember them girls that didn't want to talk to me
Now I'm making this money
Now them girls all over me
I remember them girls that wouldn't go out with me
Now I'm a big celebrity
All around the world
With a million girls
At my party

From London to LA
I own a few cafe's
I ain't trying to boast
But I got that dough
I made a video so you could see the life I live
Gotta casa across from Sammy Sosa's crib
Laying out by the pool
Model chicks running around in the nude

Now I'm making joints that turn the club up and down
Carousel going round and round
Crazy how they all feel me now
I still remember

I remember them girls that didn't want to talk to me
Now I'm making this money
Now them girls all over me
I remember them girls that wouldn't go out with me
Now I'm a big celebrity
All around the world
With a million girls
At my party

They say baby you're the man
Can we have a one night stand
Every girl wanna take me home
Most these girls I would have never known
I don't have to try
Before you know it hands is on their thighs
Before we get into some kinky shit here's the million dollar question

[Freeway]
If he wasn't that rap cat
Would you still do that
If he wasn't Freeway would you still wanna leave with him
Roll with him, got a whole lot of soul with him
R-O-C got a whole lot of team with him
Can't be with him
No fake hoes with him
Keep the vest closed just in case the 4-4's with him
Now, Joe with him and they making it pop
Silly broad what you think we forgot
Man I remember back in the days
When he had waves
I had corn braids and no chains
Now ya'll smell me 
Go in any party that I want rocking a skully
Muthafuckas is all frilly
Now she running up to me 
Screaming I can get her on the news
Say my voice get her in the mood
Just get her to the room
I hit her once and I'll leave
Shit leave
