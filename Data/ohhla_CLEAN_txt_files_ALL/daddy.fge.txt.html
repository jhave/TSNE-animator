Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
I'm sure y'all heard about my dad
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
This one goes out for everybody that lost somebody
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Be strong
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy

Now I understand what Scarface meant
When he said I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Never in my deepest thoughts that I would imagine
I would be the one carrying a coffin
Yo I feel like a orphan even though I got a mom
I'm the first born so I gotta play strong
Memories of the past bout when we cried when we laughed
It makes it hard, dad, for me to finish write this paragraph
I remember when we all shoved snow frost bites and all
Temperature forty below 
You used to call me lazy cause I said it was too cold 
But you would go in the crib fix me a fresh cup a cocoa
I can't front
I wish there was a sequel of the sixth sense
So I could see dead people
I'm so hurt, dad
I can't cry no more
But I know that you're knockin on heaven's door
Peace
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Rest in peace, dad
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
All my people live on
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Rest in peace, dad
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy

Look into my eyes
Realize I'm the same man my father was
Y'all can tell by my Pink Cadillac
The way I clean my ride
Old grim tilted to the side
But what I loved most was when the God philosophize
About the philosophies of life in its reality
Keep the right mentality
Don't fall into vanity
Sometime I feel like he standin watchin over me
Whisperin in my ear, baby boy, I'm still here
I heard him said I'm the shadow right beside you
And if you confused, son, I'm there to guide you
And even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil
For the Lord is wit me
But don't forget that your mom's in your hands
You two were so close
That I finally understa nd
And here's a message to your brothers and your sisters
I'ma miss em
No matter what I'ma be wit em
Peace

Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
To my dad, rest in peace
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
I guess I'll see you at the resurrection
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
To all my people that lost somebody
Da--a, daddy, daddy, daddy
Put the lighters in the air
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Oh, daddy
Oh, daddy
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Oh, yeah, yeah
I need you, daddy
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Oh, oh
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy
Daddy
Da, da, da, daddy, daddy, daddy</pre>
