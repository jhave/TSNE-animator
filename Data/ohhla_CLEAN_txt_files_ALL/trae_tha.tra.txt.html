[Intro]
I couldn't help, but notice your pain
(my pain), it runs deep share it with me

[Trae]
Ain't nothing changed, I still sit watching the time go by
I'm on a level of my own, cause motherfuckers too fly
They keep on calling me to stop, but I keep rolling on by
I ain't feeling them niggaz vibes, and I'll be damned if I try
It's like I'm rolling by my lone, without my baby brother so I gotta post up
It's A.B.N. motherfucker, post up to get a close up
I'm leaning on the edge, my baby mama got me stressed
And plexing with me and my money, so I take it as a lesson
So my attitude, the true definition of nigga fuck you
I'm strapped up with fifty, gon make niggaz let me done fuck through
I'm ten seconds from losing my cool, don't get up on me
I been fucked over too much, by some of my use to be homies
I won't let em see me sweat, cause if they do it's gon be hell
I know they praying that they see me fail, wishing I ain't well
Lord knows, I been fighting for all my life
So they know it's war, and I'm gon get em when the time is right

[Hook - 4x]
Ooooh-oooh-oooooh-ooooh
Welcome to, the Trae Tha Truth Show

[Trae]
They try to tell me bout the shit, I'm feeling now-a-days
Being real is all I know, anything else might be enough to get you blazed
So I play my position, and stay the fuck out that fake nigga type of shit
That gangsta false-a-fied, cause they read a fake nigga type of lick
Even these bitches dirty, I learned not to put my trust in em
A name with a lil' light, and these bitches'll let you bust in em
They tried to run me rugged, but homie my stat ain't never slipping
All I know is pain, and my finer show you that I ain't tripping
Yeah bitch I'm heavyweight, and I can't let em weigh me down
Niggaz switching up and left the block, but see I'm still around
If you ain't ready for the ride, then turn the wheel around
Plus I got this clip under my belt, with about 38 rounds
They found my homie dead, murdered in the neighborhood
The love I had for him can't justify, it'll never be good
It hurt so much some of the time, I don't know where to go
But that's another episode, and it's part of the Truth Show
