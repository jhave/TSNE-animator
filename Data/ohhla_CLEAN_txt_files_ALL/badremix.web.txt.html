[Intro]
Come on... I need a bad bitch
Come on... if you a bad bitch
Yeah I want a bad bitch
 
[Verse 1]
The girl be, cookin and cleanin and cleanin and cookin
She be, constantly douchin and cleanin her pussy
And when she, step on the scene e'rybody be lookin
And to, get in them jeans everybody be wishin
But she, only want players who far from rookie
And if you, ain't got the cake you can't play with the nookie
Her titties, sittin pretty and she soft as a cushion
If you, try to holla she might holla she tooken
And she walk like a bad bitch, talk like a bad bitch
And goin get her hair and shit fixed is a habit
And a bad bitch go and buy fits mo' than average
And bad bitches get to take trips wite "The Savage"
Can never tell a bad bitch a freak, she too classy
But shit, I can tell from her lips that's she nasty
Expensive-ass pants is, gripped to them asses
She mean as a pitbull and sweet like candy
 
[Chorus]
Now that's a bad bitch (a bad bitch) {*repeat 4X*}
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch) {*repeat 4X*}

[Trina]
Uhh, you want a bad bitch?  Trina's the baddest
And I'm thick and fine from the cornbread and the cabbage, a savage
I would give you my number so you can have this
But I don't need the stalkin, prank calls or the madness
My ass like WHOA, my goodies incred-ible
I'm in this cheerleader skirt, and these legs flexible
You flippin and pushin and pushin to flip it
You can have an old lady, if I want you I ain't trippin
I got, my own money own cars own house
I can cook a meal same time and turn a nigga out
I'm the, example of what you want up on your team
But these Dior bags and my time gon' cost cream, uhh
Now I ain't gotta meet your momma, gimme dollars
Gimme Gucci, gimme Chanel, pearls and gimme Prada, uhh
A hood chick, I got yo' man, what a tragedy
He give me his paper to his plastic, I'm a bad bitch

[Chorus]

[Webbie]
Now make yourself seen, cause you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch), yeah you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Now show yo' ass off, cause you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Girl you a bad bitch (a bad bitch), yeah you a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
Man I love them bad bitches with them sexy-ass tattops
Them bad bitches with them bad bitches attitudes
She a damn fool, gotta crib she'll let me camp
Make sho' her niggaz stay filled with them food stamps
I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D
E-N-T, do you know what that mean mayne
Own damn house flossed out big screen mayne
I'll bring the whole hundred shit what'chu gon' do for me mayne
Look at her own income, she a beast mayne
Bad bitches handle bid'ness first, then streets mayne
She ain't cryin over no nigga, she ain't weak mayne
The kind of bitch that put a real nigga on his feet mayne

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
