Intro: (*lady singing*)

It's goin down, liqour store
Must go down, goin down

Bouncin to the liquor store
Bout to purchase me a forty-O
Liquorice types, bootleg tape
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT
Bill, blowin me up, Holly go and say the limo pickin me up
Now I got the plans, the freaky fans, finishin up
The wash, the wax, the chrome on my *?doc-top ride?*
Oh you know, we just, hangin
Niggas hit me up, paintin my fingers from all this star bang-in
Men-tal on the ward, give someone a gun
Pull out a philly and he can pack himself
????? ????? and J-Dub shootin dice with the rest of the brothers
But I'm on TV breakin y'all motherfuckers
E'rybody gonna get some of that light
when they mobbin to the liqour store

Chorus:

Everybody's gotta get some light
(Mobbin to the liqour store)
Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run
(Mobbin to the liqour store)

Yeah
But I ain't even there yet
Cos there's still some more spots I'm gonna hit
Like that brick house on the corner, I've been lovin it a long time
????? my son and daughter but the sushi all mine
And I'm almost to her house and thangs
Seen em, chasin em, Lil' Jase servin em *?tump?*
Hey, I know I'm gettin closer
Peepin the homies, y'all sellin dope
And all of my pimp and hustlers
(Are we all closer, yo?) Yeah, waddup?
How bout lettin me hit those skins and then I'm gonna cut
I'm on my way to your mom's store, I gotta show
And me and Miss Sushi, 'ock you out about the dizzough
Sun is beaming, '96 summer
Aiyo Freeze, you got the beamer and my Camo
Aight you motherfuckers, everybody, gonna get some of that light
when they mobbin to the liquor store

Chorus (x2)

In the liquor store
Now I done purchased me a forty-O
Liquorice types, bootleg tapes
Hat off the rack, battery for my DAT
Vigo, fill some more, by the bread rack
My persona out the door, my ????? in Prada wanna grab her a gat
But e'rybody gonna get some of that light
when they look in the liqour store
for the sure dough, double-stitched, sock
For the real neat team, never forgettin its knots
Hops, we be on some ol' hacknin, a whole packet of rubbers
And a video never play me unless it's murder
You got my skrilla, but shit I want all the shit
I don't know about my homies, maybe them fools is been
1-2 all the way out to 10
We had their back, that doesn't mean no loss
Somebody bout to set it off again

Chorus: (x4)

Everybody's gotta get some light
(Mobbin to the liqour store)
Liquor store run, liqour store run, liqour store run
(And I'm about to make a liquor store run)</pre>
