[Hook (4x)]
Swangin lane 2 lane in a dropper
On the count of 3
Southside roll choppers

(Lil' Flex)
Me and James on jane as I swang down Main
Lane 2 lane, music bang, residentials complain
Some say it's a shame I'm grippin' to much grain
Candy stains on both lanes, like a wet airplane
Speed limit 45, what that mean to me?
I'ma skate like Grezky doin' 183
On the strech, hard to catch, I'ma circle da' block
Second time around your corner, I'm recline da' top
Screens drop, trucks pop, do's lock, glock cocked, next stop at IHOP,
We swang drop, bottoms flop
"MAKE IT HOT, MAKE IT HOT," is what da kids be yellin'
Candies reds dey be dredin', pounds of smoke I'm in heaven
I'm supreme, by any means, hovercraft with seven screens
20 inches cutting sharper den the crease in my jeans
Car hoppers, chase choppers, write my name across dey lockers, 
Wood popper, you should ??, I won't stop for these boppers, we roll

[Hook]

(Lil' James)
Lane 2 lane in the dropper, stretch Excursions on choppers
Helicopters with minacas, different boppers who knock us
Truck poppers, top droppers, we TYP
What you see, I see the, 1-2-3 do with me
I creep smoke a tree, TV'S, DVD'S
Burban' swearvin down da' street, Flex fallin in da ???
From 2PSP, fitin' to wreck the industry 
??? to the T, feel me, who I be?, LIL' JAMES!
Grabin' grain, switchin' lanes down Main
People complain cause I swang, with screens fallin' like rain
Slightly cracked trunk open, if I'm choppin' or postin'
Paint soakin down da' beltway as I tossin' and toakin', coastin',
Sippin' potion, ain't no braggin' or boastin'
Dey jokein' while I'm postin' wit' my yacht on da' ocean
If its hoops or coupes, we let the trunk sake loose
Hot juice, show proof, and gently raise da' roof.

[Hook]

(Wood)
Swangin lane 2 lane with my hands against da' grain
Workin' my wood wheel when I swang and bang
CD's change, &amp; DVD, disks keep on spinning
Don't make me crank up 300 horses in my engine
Hit my ignition burning 20 inches dey choppers
Got da harness on top might be tint, it might be drop top
Dress dirty, in da' trucks, gatta call my boys
In da hood doin' 30 or a 108 on da' Autobaun
And I'm the son of a king with a castle and pond
Shinin' like da' sun, every mornin' when you young 
Soon to come, I'ma stunt, and I strain, the game is in me
It's time to play baby, let's put these swangers on da' bently
Niggas chins get checked, ask Flex we got plex
From the count of three, let's take these choppers on the lex
We put blades on trofo-trucks??, cause we off da' chain
Lane 2 lane against da' grain, Wood, Flex, and Lil' James.
