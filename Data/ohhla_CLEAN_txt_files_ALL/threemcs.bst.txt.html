("Hey yo, Adam, what's up?  This is Mix Master Mike calling from
Sacramento.  Um...ah, I've been wanting to hook up with you, maybe on 
some tracks...I've got some shit right here, if you could-
[Scratching]
My turntable's through a wah-wah pedal...
[Scratching continues]
It's called the tweak scratch.")
 
Cause nobody can do it like Mix Master can! 
Come on
I've got the D double O, D double O style
Here we go again because it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice
I want to get next to you like Rose Royce
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cause when it's time to rhyme you know I get noice
Cruising like a fan boat on the glade 
He'll tweak ass your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

Three MCs and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what cha got to say?
("Bug out!" "To!" "The mic" "All the time!")

Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes
Kenny Rogers' "Gambler" is my gambling theme
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know 
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below 
And Norton is chillin with Mario
Well my name is Adrock I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop I'm known to glow 
But don't get mad cause I gots to go

Three MCs and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what cha got to say? 
("Gotta gotta" "Gotta get down!")

Mix Master, cut faster!
Mix Master, cut, cut, cut faster!

All top secret and classified
I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
I never wanna let a bad day slip by
Now, we be getting stupid in your area 
Causing all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry I'll take care of ya
Me and Adam Adam and Mario C
In the studio it's the place to be
To all the party people who are happy and free
With Mix Master Mike we're making history

Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike, what you got to say?
("God damn that DJ made my day!")

(Biz Markie: "You came off with that one, though, oh my goodness!")
