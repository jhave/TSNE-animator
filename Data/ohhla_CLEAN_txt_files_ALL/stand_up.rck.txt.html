[Intro: Pete Rock]
Uh! Come On!

[Verse One: Tek]
Ain't no love loss, when the bullets get tossed
And you know it's all fair in love and war
How your man say he fam when he's fuckin your broad? (How?)
He run around contemplatin knockin you off.
How your connect got papers (How?) All this work fire
4-1-0 like he livin through The Wire
He know the old sayin but you still gotta show 'em 
You only trust a nigga as far as you can throw 'em

[Verse Two: Steele] 
That's why we keep friends close enemies closer
H for holsters for snakes and cobras
Fake smile on they face like they think they know ya
I don't know that brother he the type that snitch on his soldiers
He was down with the whole scene part of the whole thing
When he got caught switched up on the whole team
I don't need friends stick to P-N-C
And B. Rob when we mob see our reality

[Chorus: Black Rob] (Pete Rock)
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (Uh!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye
No matter who you are (What) Or who you were (What)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (Uh!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye
No matter who you are, or who you were (What)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character

[Verse Three: Black Rob]
Man alot of dudes talkin portray that image
Only to get sacked at the line of scrimmage
Always startin somethin that they can't finish
Actin like it's all love like the game of tennis
All the dude's paper work find your name in a minute
You know the type, run around like you straight up menace
That's the reason why I do dirt with no co-d's
So when the people askin questions you don't know me
I mean I seen it comin up, dudes sell they soul
Just to get lesser time and come home parole
You know hoe Feds like to make them threats with no bottle
When you let 'em see you sweat they like hmmm we got him!
The prospect of never seein your family again
Contemplatin will I be live again?
Too late, once your cooperatin with them
Your looked at, differently, through the eyes of men

[Chorus: Black Rob] (Pete Rock)
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (What!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye (Uh!)
No matter who you are, or who you were (Yeah!)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (Uh!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye
No matter who you are, or who you were (What!)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character

[Verse Four: Tek]
I don't say no names, write down no dates or times
Soon as I heara little glitch I switch up my lines
'Cause, I washed my hands with friends
It's just a tight circle that I call my men's
And the bitches on the bullshit lookin for a sport
Move out the old hood to become a new whore (OWWWW!!!!)
Niggas stay blinded by the pussy and the shine
Instead of bein focused and stayin on the grind

[Verse Five: Steele] (Pete Rock)
Man! If loyalty don't kill ya the gun will (Tell 'em!)
Alot of people playin that role and none real (Uh!)
But you can recognize 'em by the look in they grill
You can smell fear on 'em like they lookin to peel
Quick to rell d's on 'em dudes is lookin to squeal (Uh!)
Julian got knocked and he ain't look for a deal
One for the team is how you look at the field (Yeah!)
But shit it ain't hard to find when you lookin to vield

[Chorus: Black Rob] (Pete Rock)
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (Uh!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye 
No matter who you are (Uh!) Or who you were (What!)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character
I'm a stand up guy, when I say put' em up, just put 'em high (High!)
Just say what you say to my face, look me in my eye (Uh!)
No matter who you are, or who you were (What!)
There's always some nigga try assasinate your character (Uh!)</pre>
