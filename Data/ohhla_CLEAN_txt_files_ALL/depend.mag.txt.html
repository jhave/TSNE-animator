[C-Murder]
This for all my real niggas locked up
Payin they dues, doin that time, you know
Don't trip

Chorus: [C-Murder] 

I be's a TRU nigga till I'm dead, depend on me
I won't rest till all my thug niggas is free (x2)

Verse 1: [C-Murder]

I'm in the studio smokin weed with my TRU thugs
Motherfuckers gettin' high pass another (dub??)
A whole room full of gangstas, with TRU tats
Million dollar niggas still wearin', them baseball caps
And never amongst no fake ass motherfuckers
We posse up and jump your ass like a clucker, huh!
Now you can pay a real nigga to be on your team
But TRU niggas don't ride, by any means
I went to jail, my nigga post bail
We saw the (jump out boys, too tall??)
My niggas took the charge
My second Joe's down in CCC
For my birthday, my niggas gathered up by my window G
That's when I knew I had some down ass niggas money
After that I got TRU tattoed on my stomach
My real niggas gon' understand what I mean
You can't live without some TRU niggas on your team

Chorus x 2

Verse 2: [Magic]

Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga
Not a worry on my motherfuckin' mind
I got power, I got riches, I got nothing but bitches
And a cadillac sittin' on shine
Damn it feels good to be the TRU nigga
Every time I put this TRU around my neck (hah-hah)
Every Tom, Dick and Harry wanna watch my back
And treat a nigga with the upmost respect
Damn it feels good to be with TRU records
I ain't gonna lie fifty dollars put me on the map
Now I'm ridin' in limosines doing shows with Fiend
We carry killas by the motherfucking pack (believe that)
Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga
I won't stop until they put me on the wall
See I ain't never had shit so it's my time to shine
And I'm a ball 'till I motherfuckin' fall
Damn it feels good to be a TRU nigga
I spit in the judge fuckin' face
And look at him in his eyes before I passed this note
I betta not leave here with a motherfuckin' case

Chorus x 4

[C-Murder]
You know what I'm sayin, free motherfuckers
Feel good to have a TRU nigga thug watchin your back
C-Murder in this motherfucker with Mr. Magic
