Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

	"There are a few things I wanna explain to you..
	 and I'll try to define, to the best of my ability"

"Mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

	"I'ma tell you one more thing;
	 and won't tell y'all nothin else"

"Mama.."

[Yo-Yo]
Growin up was crazy, in my days we got our ass kicked
Mama didn't play no ? cause talkin back is foul play
She had her own way of gettin across, which was a belt of steel
She'd tell us from the work we could all but kneel
Gettin nasty in front of guests was the way she'd like to do it
She'll say straighten your shit up, or you can stop em from comin
And yo guys knew what time it was, even they was checked
I got a down ass mama ("that's right") mama don't take no mess
Now shit got hectic, cause mama was tipped
She'll tell you in a minute don't let your mouth get yo' ass whipped
Mama did it all by herself, King and Queen of this house
Yellin, "I want my Daddy" would get your ass thrown out
Now when it came to partyin, moms got wild
Don't nuttin get old but clothes, and they come back as styles
("that's right.. that's right") Yo, I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Can you dig it?"

[Yo-Yo]
Beings it was all girls, shit was always missing
from panties to makeup, if it was gone then she was bitchin
She wants to know, "Who's been in the house?" I said no company
Checkin her dresser sayin, "What happened to my money?"
If it was on then it was on, cause money don't walk
Somebody better talk, find the stuff she done lost
I got my butt whooped for everything I did wrong
And it was ON, cause niggaz kept playin on my phone
Don't let moms go to a conference and the teacher confess
Man I'm tell you, mama don't take no mess
Why watch me go down, fight to keep it goin
but really not knowin cause the truth is what they're showin
You don't have a friend, friends come and go is what she'll say
Never tell your deepest secret, you'll get hurt that way
Love is a game, and it's okay if you play
But they're dogs dressed as men, tryin to be your friend
and baby watch out, don't take a step unless you know which way you're goin
Times are gettin lonely but I'll be a honey
I'll never leave ya, believe that love is in the air
No matter what you done, moms'll be there
I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!"

	"Because I'm aware that you have to use what you have
	 to get what you want.  This is the reason I'm asking
	 you to tighten up your shit.  Be proud of your black
	 body and use it.  That's your natural gift, so girls
	 use it.  But you got to get yo' shit together!"

"Mama don't take no mess!"

	"I'm beggin you please do like I told you"

[Yo-Yo]
Moms, didn't play the okey-doke, oke can get choked, huh
Fuck around and get yo' neck broke
Tellin your friends, "Hold up, wait man, moms'll let me go"
Walk in the house and mom straight say NO!
The type of moms to whup you in the store if she hasta
Just to let you know, you're the child, she's the master
Livin it to the fullest, playin 40 like she's 20 y'know
Some old tricks from a young pro
Brought up in a church house, and every Sunday was a must
When moms couldn't make it, we rode the church bus
Don't say you couldn't fade it, cause that was plannin yo' week
No church, no runnin the streets G!  ("That's right")
We didn't neglect our chores, that was number one
For thirty on the dot, we was on the run
She used to pull up at the dance, have the DJ to call us out
After two o'clock, wasn't no hangin out
Sometimes she waited in the batterram or stood at the front do'
People used to ask what she came fo'
Hell wasn't nuttin get close, moms was loc, no joke
("Right on!)" I got a down ass mama

"Mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"	"Mmmm, mmm, mmm"
"Mama.. mama don't take no mess!"

	"Get them drive-by shooters out of my living room
	 and off my couch.  You know we expecting company!"

"Is that it?  I gotta go."
	"HELL NAW THAT AIN'T IT!"</pre>
