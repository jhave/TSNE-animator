Where me and the homeboys ya know? 
We get together you know what I'm sayin? 
We might uh, shoot some pool, play a little dominoes 
Call a few tenders over 

I kick it in the Bay 
You know where I stay 
The V A to the Double L 
The homey flossin in the V-12 
So when you comin' to kick with it 
With the Sick Wid It 
You bring the whole team 
When you hit magazine 
Like the other day a car low from E-P-A 
Came through with some Hennesey and Alize 
I'm on the corner gettin' burnt with the chili mac 
They hit the block in a dark blue ville 'lac 
Wassup wit y'all? 
Nuthin, tryin' to get it jumpin' 
And it's the first can we go to the mall or sumthin'? 
I got to laughin' but now I was pimp the baby(?) 
Lookin' like she want to tongue kiss my Mercedes 
I got a spot where we all can go kick it at 
We got the bomb and y'all got the Cognac 
Don't even trip I got a click and I want you to meet 'em 
Once we make this left we to the Hemp Museum 

Chorus: 
Grab your sex and your beach 
Hit some corners let's get keyed 
The Hemp Museum 
The Hemp Museum 
Got my drank and my blunt 
Check that bullshit don't be no punk 
The Hemp Museum 
The Hemp Museum 

I'm sittin' real low tip toen' the block 
I watch they mouth drop as I hit the lot 
Now peep the plot 
The gates open up slowly got they eyes on it 
Spotizotic 'cuz I spent the M5 on it 
You ladies help y'all self and pour the do it fluid 
While I break down the pound and manicure it 
Al Greens with the Victor Barons got her starin' 
Tryin to get her out here Donna Karan 
Uh...I'm callin all top notches 
Homies with the rolex 
Watches slide through 
Like the thing to do 
We're all players 
No square be allowed in the house of hemp 
We campaigns like the President 
I got four or five dank rooms 
Big screens with playstations 
Wet bar, perculation 
A vacation? 
No, more like the Mardi Gras 
With hurricanes and thangs that you ain't ever saw 

Chorus: 
Grab your sex and your beach 
Hit some corners let's get keyed 
The Hemp Museum 
The Hemp Museum 
Got my drank and my blunt 
Check that bullshit don't be no punk 
The Hemp Museum 
The Hemp Museum 

I'm seeing 'stangs in the game of the young stages 
But I'm a hog like the pig on Momma day 
Proked out today was a good day 
A baby Freaknik jumped off in the bay 
I told baby maybe later on we can chill 
And we can meet at the Denny's up at ???ville 
But as for now your playa patna gettin' hot 
And a quarter mile runners linin' up at the light 
They gettin' tight and I got G's off in the Nova 
A big block and I'm hot 
I'm trynna told ya 
Mini mart turned side show 
Tear 'em off no need for the nitro 
I'm known to give it from the gate like every time 
Make the 6-8 skip and walk the line 
I got a dime in the pink if you down to see it 
And we be posted at the Hemp Museum 

Chorus: 
X2 
Grab your sex and your beach 
Hit some corners let's get keyed 
The Hemp Museum 
The Hemp Museum 
Got my drank and my blunt 
Check that bullshit don't be no punk 
The Hemp Museum
