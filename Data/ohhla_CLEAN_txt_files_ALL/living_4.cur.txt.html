[Curren$y]
Uh, peanut butter leather
Brown liquor, couple sips, keep it together
Weed lit, sunroof lifted slightly
Gently tail the driver with murder gloves in my car cause I'm killing it
Premium preserves in my jar, I be getting it
From where if you ain't a member then you ain't getting in
Smoke to the fact that we be getting it
Higher than the ceilings in the penthouse's we living in
Boy you better get your bitch, over here
Taking pictures of the whips, asking us
What we gon' get into after it's badgering us
Life I chose why your women act like hoes
I know, this just a game I play when I get bored

[Outro]
Living just enough for the
High'd up just enough for the
Living just enough for the
Never gave a, yeah</pre>
