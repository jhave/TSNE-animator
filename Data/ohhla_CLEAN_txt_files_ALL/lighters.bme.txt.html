[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me, livin out our dreams
Where are, right where we should be!
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now, all I wanna see!
Is a sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs
A sky full of lighterrrrrrrrs

[Eminem]
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck - or get struck like lightnin
Fighters keep fightin, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uhh!
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's, nipple is mine, for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin illest in this music
there is, or there ever will be; disagree, feel free
But from now on I'm refusing 
to ever give up, only thing I ever gave up's using
No more excuses, excuse me if my head is too big, for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you +dicks+ tryin to +kid+? Flip "dick", you did opposite
You stayed the same cause "cock" backwards is still "cock" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster
Cause he couldn't cut mustard
Muster up nothin, brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it, wasn't cause he had buzzards
circlin around his head, waitin for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause them bitches wrote him off? Little hussy ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What's it take 
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain't
some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward I wanna just say thanks
cause your hate is what gave me this strength
So let them Bic's raise
Cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8"!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
By the time you hear this I'd probably already be outtie
I advance like goin from totin iron
to goin and buyin four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me "Slow down boy, you goin to blow it!"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him 
the same way that he did Dr. Dre on "The Chronic"
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears - my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march 
right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career is LeBron's jersey in 20 years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up, must come down
You goin down on somethin you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy, now I'm just the cat's meow
Oww, out-class the count
Always down for the catch weight, like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed - y'all remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me?
My car starts itself, parks itself and Auto-Tunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from havin my city locked up to gettin treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggaz that's gossipin like bitches
on the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin out like Wendy Williams starin at a beehive
And how real is that?
I remember signin my first deal, now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass
Without the MTV Awards gag (yeah!)

[Bruno Mars]
You and I, know what it's like
to be kicked down, forced to FIGHT
But tonight, we're alright
So hold up your lights, let it SHIIIIINE
Cause

[Chorus]</pre>
