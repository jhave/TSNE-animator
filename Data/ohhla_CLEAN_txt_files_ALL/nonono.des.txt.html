Intro: Wyclef Jean

This is the remix
The jeep's pump this new remix (uh huh)
This is the remix
Radio's play this remix
This is the remix
The Crups pump this remix
This is the remix
Refugee Camp the remix
Destiny's Child 'bout to set it
This is the remix
The streets pump the remix
This is the remix
Every project, come on, come on
Destiny's Child, hey

Verse One: Destiny's Child

Boy I know you want me
I can see it in your eyes
But you keep on frontin'
Won't you say what's on your mind
Cuz each and every time you need me
You give me signs
But when I ask you what's the deal
You hold it all inside

If you wanna be with me
Ya gotta keep it real
Tell me what's going on
Tell me how you feel
Boy I know you want me
Just as much as I want you
So come and get my love
It's all here for you

Chorus:

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You'll be saying no, no, no, no, no
When it's really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Why you frontin' when you know you really want it)

Verse Two: Destiny's Child

If you keep acting this way
You're gonna lose my love
I ain't got no time to play
You better hurry up
Cuz every time I come around
Crews run around your way
I see ya on the corner
But you don't know what to say

When I walk up to you baby
You seem so shy
What's the problem baby
Never had a girl like I
I can see right through you
And you know you wanna be mine
So get your act together
Cuz you're running out of time

REPEAT CHORUS

(Don't front, you know you really want it)
(Is it alright if I play my guitar right here)

Bridge:

Everytime I see you with your boys
You pretend as if you don't want me
When you get home you call me on the phone
And tell me how much you care

Verse Three: Wyclef Jean

Yo,  close your eyes, shorty
You're guarenteed to be hypnotized
By the remix that Wyclef provide
I don't care about your size
Girl shake your thighs
All I'm trying to do
In the hood is stay alive
Make a little money with Destiny's Child
Thugs hear this song, they dance they go wild
Like Texas, they movin' like
No Limit soldiers
They went from a dream to the
Young supremes, sing it girls

REPEAT CHORUS UNTIL FADE</pre>
