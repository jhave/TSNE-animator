[Verse 1]
Everybody up!
Let me introduce to you
A man that you heard of and you thought you knew
But give me a couple of seconds just to prove to you
You never did, but let me give you a chance to
I used to swear everybody had it in for me
People only wanted to talk to spit on me
So I'd paint pictures, draw a little bit
And every time I was pissed off at some kid
I'd get home and draw a little sketch
Of any kid I hated with a knife in the neck
A pencil in the eye and a hole in the back
I had a back pack of six sketches like that
And over time people started to see
The pictures that I made, made a lot of sense to me
But it never ready made much of a difference
They still talk shit, but not at close distance
And that sucked cause all I wanted to have
Was a little attention with the good and bad
But over time I got sick of trying
And kept making them pictures and kept redrawing lines

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm going with this
I'm just reminiscing and telling the story of this
Sit back and take in the story of the kid
As I look back at the strange things I did

[Verse 2]
Everybody up!
Let me tell the truth to you
I never thought I'd be anyone you wished you knew
And just thought I'd end up a stain on the wall
Something you wanted fix if you've seen it all
Anyway back at PSI
I had a class with a smart mouth friend of mine
And we would sit in the back, the two of us combined
We'd make fun of everybody just to pass the time
Now we did it quietly so no one heard
A couple of nerds, sentence full of pictures and words
Until this kid heard we were calling him names and decided to get tough
I remember he came up to me that day in front of half my friends
and talk shit so loud people couldn't pretend they didn't hear him
Saying he would beat my ass and I laughed
But he was serious and pushed me back
At this point I was pretty confused
This little bitch was all amped so what could I do
I should have come back at him for all to see
But instead I just told him that, "It wasn't me"

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm going with this
I'm just reminiscing and telling the story of this
Sit back and take in the story of the kid
As I look back at the strange things I did

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm going with this
I'm just reminiscing and telling the story of this
Sit back and take in the story of the kid
As I look back at the strange things I did

[Verse 3]
It's like Flat Liners, see that flick?
People dying, come back saying crazy shit
people that they did wrong come back to attack them
And everyone that they hurt comes back for revenge
Well if that was ever going to happen to me
I'd pretentiously would be attacked constantly
But then again, for all the pain in my past
There'd be a lot of people that had better watch there ass

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm going with this
I'm just reminiscing and telling the story of this
Sit back and take in the story of the kid
As I look back at the strange things I did

[Chorus]
I don't know where I'm going with this
I'm just reminiscing and telling the story of this
Sit back and take in the story of the kid
As I look back at the strange things I did</pre>
