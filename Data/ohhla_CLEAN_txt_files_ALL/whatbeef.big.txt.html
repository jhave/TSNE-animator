Fuck em in the ass, throw em over the bridge (oooh)
That's how it is, my shit is laid out (what)
Fuck that beef shit, that shit is played out (played out)
Y'all got the gall, all I make is one phone call
All y'all dissapear by tomorrow
All your guns is borrowed, I don't feel sorrow
Actually, your man passed the gat to me, now check this

What's beef?  Beef is when you need two gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef?  Beef is when you make your enemies start your Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than thirty deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, check it

All I got is heat and tough talk for you (uh-huh)
Tie you up, cut your balls off just to use (oooh)
Man listen straight torture, look what that slick shit bought ya
A first class ticket to Lucifer, real name Cristopher
Watch me set it off like Vivica
Here lies your demise, close your eyes (uh-huh)

Pale blue hands get cold, your soul's risen
