[Kyleon]
Somebody call the coppers, Killa bout to cock the chopper
Pull the trigger, now you niggaz gotta get the doctor
Blocka-blocka, singing like a bitch up out the opera
Put it to your head like knockers - 4x
 
(*talking*)
Now I thought I told you niggaz what the deal was
You know what I'm saying, this Purple Punch
The motherfucking mixtape nigga, you fucking with your boy
Killa Gorilla, A.K.A. Killa Kyleon, A.K.A. Run It
A.K.A. Killa Gram, thirty six O-Z's of that china white
You know I'm tal'n bout, I'm in the mix with my nigga DJ Storm
And it's going down, Purple Punch nigga show up and po' up hoe run it
 
[Kyleon]
Somebody call the coppers, Killa bout to cock the chopper
Pull the trigger, now you niggaz gotta get the doctor
Blocka-blocka, singing like a bitch up out the opera
Put it to your head like knockers, I'll pop a popper
Rock your block, I'll turn your corner to a shooting range
You better duck when I buck, cause I'm shooting mayn
Day 1 Familia Click, won't hesitate to kill a bitch
You listening to the Gorilla Killa, I'll kill you quick
I'm still the shit, but I'm minus the toilet
And still in rotator, haters skin like boil itch
I'm foil bitch, I shine on a bad day
Cause Killa smoking like the shit he choking, in his ash tray
Before you get to the Boss, you gotta pass tre
So hit a nigga get off my dick, what up your ass gay
Hit you with a right hook, and make your ass lay
Point the finger treat you like a bitch, and tell your ass stay
Ain't no tripping with me, nigga I got guns
Pull the trigger, yeah now your ass done
Ain't no tripping with me, nigga I got guns
Pull the trigger, yeah now your ass done
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Ain't no tripping with me, nigga I got guns
Pull the trigger, yeah now your ass done</pre>
