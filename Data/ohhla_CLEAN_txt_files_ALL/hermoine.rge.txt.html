[Intro: Bilal]
What can we do?
...Do-do..
What can we do? Do-do..

[Chorus: Bilal]
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
I'm not sure what we're supposed to do
So I've been writing just for you
Do-do

[Black Milk]
On a whim, goin out on a limb
Thinkin 'bout what me and you had coulda been...
Lights, nights, left ya heartbroken
and it wasn't something I couldn't even mend..
Can't even pretend, that I don't feel some kind of way
now that you're with him, damn
Now I lost a friend, and I had no interest in these other
wo-men that's, on the other end
Talkin on they cell, askin me to meet up but I tell
them I'm in that studio by 8 so 
No going on dates, I'd rather chill
Lookin at your number, I should call you 
Yeah I will... No, I won't (Damn)
Too much pride, so I don't
Not tryna look desperate, look at who I'm left with
I'm losing myself quick! Grab a hold
Clearly you wanna talk, I see you grabbed that phone when it rang 
Used to do our thing when it rain
or will I ever see your face a-gain?
(What can we do? Do-do...)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What can we do? Do-do..
What can we do? Do-do..
I'm not sure...
What can we do?</pre>
