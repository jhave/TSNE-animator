Song:   Ye Yo
Typed by: ghettofabulous98@hotmail.com

Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo
(Help me)
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo, ye yo...

Sometimes,
Sometimes I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
I feel all by myself up here
That's when I take a minute
To re-evaluate things
All of the things I think are special
Oooh like
When you wake up in the morning
And you see the morning sun
And you need to know the world is on your side
Who do you run to
Who can you turn to
Come on
Then the evening comes to greet you
You need someone to hold you close
And you feel you need to rest your aching mind
Who can you run to
Who can you turn to
Well see the sun's in the east and the moon reflects
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo
I say the sun's in the east and the moon reflects
Like the knowledge and wisdom, I manifest
If you wanna go to heaven lay up on my breast
I'm ye yo, you're ye yo
Ye yo, ye yo, ye yo.....
