In My

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city

Through the city block [2X]

GD
Yung...Money

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block

One verse...
One hearse tight...Nigga

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block

Shit

I approach it wit my nose lit
No scent
Since I'm gauranteed in the lead I'm in

Ball bottle buying,
Papi sick no medicine

Sippin the elegant swank
Walk like elephants

Smooth the scene
Canvas color is green
I don't move unless the car clean
Call me
Dial Money in between
the boss like Bosley
You wont see but you heard it's me
I'm one of the henches hurdel-in

Murderer
I murder them
This trophy my evidence
It's evident
Evidently niggas bitches full of Estrogen
In the corridor
Never bored
Get busy BITCH
Seven doors had that white whore on some corny shit

Me

I support chicks
poor em in that spore shit
Tell em get that morgage
Morgan bring more in
forced into foursomes
Now she a TOP bitch
Cashed in
I Be on my Diddy Shit

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block

I told yall
One verse... on hearse nigga

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block

you want more?
well I'm a CEO

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block

Yeah
Rule em ALL

In my diddy bop
In my diddy bop
Boss through the city
boss boss
Through the city block [5X]
