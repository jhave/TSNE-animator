[Big Mello]
I'm trying to stay on feet now, hustling in these streets now
Got to feed my family, if I don't work we don't eat
No time for all that capping, showing off and acting
Brothers with that flashing, just don't know what's happening
Now it ain't what you do it's how you do, keep your bidness on the cool
Stack that paper the golden rule, don't let no one stop you

[Hook - 2x]
Haters they talk down now, playas put it down now
Don't worry how it's going down, what goes around comes around

[Big Mello]
So many haters doubted me, salted me in the industry
Folks and peeps stayed down with me, see I got love in these streets
My so called partnas doing Hollywood, turn they back on the neighborhood
Some cats be up to no good, I pray for them and it's understood
Now everybody got they issues, some smoke their's and some too
Whatever you do do what you do, see I can not judge you

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Mello]
Why all that finger pointing, counting people money
High capping and fronting, now you must don't have nothing
Empty wagons make a bunch of noise, men are men and boys are boys
Real is real and fraud is fraud, me I be bone hard now
Stack your paper mayn and maintain, do your thang stay out the rain
Don't let nothing bust your brain, don't worry bout a thang

[Hook - 4x]</pre>
