*whispered*
(If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out 
You'll feel a whole lot better
If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out)

[Verse 1]
It was buried under a flask and a
card peeking from the bottom of a glass 
All this nonsense, innocense, common sense, consequence 
Indulgence in bourbon, this 'urb, between city King's, it's disturbed 
I look around to see the same shit from her 
She gets so silent, watchin' life just pass by in a blur 
Ain't it funny, we can sneak into our lives and then stir
over the perfect things to say and then just choke on the words
Everybody wanna be the next 
Everybody wanna be in step 
Everybody wanna fuck 
Everybody want the consequence of playin' the fence 
Everybody's got shit luck 
Everybody wanna move to they own beat 
Everybody wanna make a dent 
Every girl is lookin' for the next best thing 
Every boy's in love with his girl's best friend 
Everybody hates me, everybody wanna fight 
We can't stand to wake up in the sun but can't sleep in the moonlight 
I'm right there with ya, I'm sicker than my own skin
I got the clothes and a jaded grin 
I'm at the bar or the coffee shop 
But I don't like drinkin' and I fuckin' hate coffee shops 
I walk to stop 
The world is best grinning like it's time to whirl
This ain't amusment, I'ma lose it
??? It was bullshit, uh 
Got two cents but everybody seems to have the same change
but can't break my five-o
Two cents, (yeah right) but can't spend nothing if I'm holding a cup
It's like 

[Chorus]
If you come down and just breathe, and just breathe in and out 
You'll feel a whole lot better
Close your eyes, disappear
If you can't see them, then they can't see you, right 
Close your eyes 

I can never be what I wanna be 
Nothin' but a man 
Nothin's even inside of me, nothin I can understand 
if I try, and so I try 
to get a grip, a hold, a handle, a hand {repeat section x2}

This
And it's strained to think it might break 
Scratch, crack, silence 
This
And it's strained I think it might break 
Scratch, crack

[Verse 2]
I live in the city, like any other we all live alone 
The only difference is we don't seem to know it 
Frozen and lonesome when it's cold 
In the summer gotta wait for the loathing, holding 
Our postures so low and we drink so there's not much worth noting 
Strolling, so vagrant, so shaken, so grown, so god so mistaken 
So broke, so, so complacent, so worn out, so worn out, so worn out 
So full of doubt, so full of restraint
So full of that self-control, or the lack thereof 
that we taught the soul 

[Chorus]

I can never be what I wanna be 
Nothin' but a man 
Nothing's even inside of me, nothin I can understand 
if I try, and so I try 
to get a grip, a hold, a handle, a hand</pre>
