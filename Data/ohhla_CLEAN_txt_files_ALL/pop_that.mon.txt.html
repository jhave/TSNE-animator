I'm in that white Ghost chasin Pac-Man
Hundred out the lot, I be leanin that Ciroc
Hundred, large bring a mop, cars tinted like Barack
I got a Brinks' truck in my pocket (pocket), thirty chains on my collar (Collar)
Two drops, no mileage (mileage), top off like Wallace
And I'm hell's smoke, bitch know that (know that), filthy rich befo' rap ('fo' rap)

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Shout out to the Infernos, Strawberries, Luke what it do? {M-M-Maybach Music} 
I love my big booty bitches, my life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city, I fell in love with a stripper
Bitches know I'm that nigga, talkin fo'-door Bugatti
I'm the life of the party, let's get these hoes on the molly
You know I came to stunt (huh!), so drop that pussy bitch (huh!)
I got what you want, drop that pussy bitch (Whoo~!)
Film it, film it, this bitch want me to film it
Ballin, ballin, like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's fifty, one hundred, I see no fuckin limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke (huh!), shout out my bitches too (huh!)
We the +2 Live Crew+, two for me, two for you (Whoo~!)
Feed them bitches carrots (huh!), fuck 'em like a rabbit (ha!)
Sorry that's a habit, smoke a spliff and then I vanish

[Chorus]

[Drake]
I'm about bein single, seein double, makin triple (right)
I hope you pussy niggaz hatin never make a nickel (RIGHT!)
It's good to make it better when ya people make it with you
Money comin, money goin, ain't like you could take it with you (alright)
It's about to be a hit right now, FUCK back then we the shit right now
Dropped "Take Care", bought a muh'fuckin crib
And I'm pickin up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like K.D.! OKC/okay see, that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike, I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me, man FUCK you and yo' time difference
I'm young papi, champagne, they know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could prol'ly pay 
for like all your chains and you'd owe me change, ah~!
Greystone, twenty bottles that's on me
On the couch, wildin out, yellin, "Free my niggaz 'til they all free"
One of my closest dogs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B, SO...

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, BEEEEITCH~! Stop talkin that shit
And suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone, that's gangsta, Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like Bone, I'm talkin 'bout "Bone, Bone, Bone-Bone"
I'm fuckin with French, excuse my French, I lose my mind 'fore I lose my bitch
Money ain' a thang but a chicken wang, bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM-beat that pussy UP! Stop playin
I make her ass scream and holla, like rock bands
I'm a beast, I'm off the leash, I am rich, like a bitch
On my +Pro-active+ shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi, yo' girl is a groupie
And nigga, youse a square and I will twist you like in a Rubix
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard, watch me do a trick, hoe
I'm 5'5" but I could six-nine, then beat that pussy like Klitschko
Its French Montana, fuck Joe, it's Weezy F., fuck hoes
Its "truk da wurl," it's "truk yo' girl"
It's Trukfit by the truck load, BIAAAAAATCH~!!!
Oh yeah, I forgot... Ooh yeah..
YOUNG MOOLAH, BAY-BAY!!!</pre>
