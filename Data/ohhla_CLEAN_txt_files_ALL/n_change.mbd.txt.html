[Havoc]
Gun wars, money, hustle, the hoes
Niggaz that don't get along for life, that's how it go
Momma's victim, take care of there kids, and let 'em roam
And you can see how he or she gon' be when they get grown
Your childhood, ideals crushed, youth press due and stuffed that
Basically, just go fuck ya ass up, you a volcano about to erupt
Runnin' the corrupt guns shiny, but them basketball trophies covered in dust
Them babies kids, the innocent that was lost in
Not them, circumstances, and had that hand forced
When I was little, yeah I dreamt of the Porshe, and of course
Ain't get it, admitted, them loose rocks, the only source
To that shit that rob and lease, preech the riddle was in reach
God, give me one last word, to kill her
Yo, you lookin' down in the hood, willin' with that advice
But it's beat the other nigga, gettin' killed tonight

[Chorus 2X: Havoc]
Some things'll neva change
Some things'll neva change
Some things'll neva change
Some things'll neva change

[Prodigy]
Make a nigga say, fuck birthday, and fuck Christmas
Fuck a wishlist, I'm writing out my shitlist
It got a lot of names, I got a lot of time
Blow out brains, see now you out ya fuckin' mind
You get gauged, for a pound of the wicked nine
Ya playin' games to the sound of them guns fire
Cereal and powdered milk, that was then then
A-1 Sauce sandwiches, we was children
Growing up broke, snatching chains and coats
Smokin' weed with coke, sellin' fiends soap
Drunk sleepin' on the bench, I couldn't make it upstairs
Woke up and seen the kids on they way to school, shit
Borrow money for my drug dealing friends
So I can buy beer, yeah that'll put me on my feet again
See, this real shit, you probably neva been through
Ching-ching, now I got bling, but..

[Chorus 2X]

[Havoc]
Back to back, nigga, just gettin' knocked
Since swallowin' the pack, guess what, his heart stopped
It all happens in the hood, it never seems to stop
And even the good ones, get drugs planted by them dirty copss

[Prodigy]
Back to back, niggaz be gettin' shot
You would think that they would learn from they first time being popped
From the hospital, straight back to the block
Can't budge my thugs, this is what we love and

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
