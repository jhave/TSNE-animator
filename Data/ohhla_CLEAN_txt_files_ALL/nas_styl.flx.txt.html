first wifee had me nothing fast
used to brag about who I had
Always wore a bag on my dick
Pants sagged on my kicks, Converse
Weapons, yellow, and purple magics
Fur had that black shit
shorties jumpin on mattress
97, pockets is fat, rock a soccer cap
Sunday, Yankee hats
God, can he be black, thanks for that
I'm original man, show improve
The mack move right in my hand
Blowdro, murderer, M.O., gone for O
Tinted window, hennessy XO, fuckin' wit Esco

Rockin VVS rocks, stylin, wildin
