Song:   We Can Make It
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

We can make it right for us
We can make it right for us

This for everybody that been through the struggle
Black, white, red or blue
We all the same, yeah

Throw your hands up
Put your hands up
Raise your hands up
Throw your hands up
Put your hands up
Raise your hands up
Yeah, okay

Growin' up in the projects, I had to stick to the script
Every other day another person was hit
We rode busses to school, I followed the rules
First grade, second grade, packed up and we moved
Still had to struggle, my pops gave up his hustle
Got into music, then game started to bubble
My main focus is to study, stay out of trouble
Bad Bubba, look at me now, thanks Dad, I l love you
Whoever thought that a 12 year old could touch souls
Even hip-hop braids in a row, that's so cold
I tell my friends, family and all my fans
May God bless everyone on this land
It's a hard life, but love is love, play your cards right
Reach for the stars, life is trouble, put up a fight
Before you know it, your inner sides start flowin'
We all have a talent, some just don't know

We can make it right for us
We can make it right for us
'Stead of treated, we get tricked
'Stead of kisses, we get kicked

We can make it right for us
We can make it right for us
'Stead of treated, we get tricked
'Stead of kisses, we get kicked (Okay)

Hard life is all about sacrifice
It ain't no limit, I told y'all I'mma be alright
I'm reachin' out to all those who might have lost their site
It's never too late, ask the Lord for life
You only got one life, it's time to do it right
Clean yourself up, take back charge of your life
Do us all a favor and please quit your behavior
Count your blessings 'cause only you and God could save ya
To the people, when the World Trade hit the floor
And all the soldiers in the Pentagon, God bless all y'all
To the families and all the loved ones lost
To the heroes in Pittsburg, you took it by far
The world state y'all, yeah, we took 'em head on
Your names will live forever, thanks for y'all we live on
Mr. President, nice job, well done
Now ain't no terrorists gonna spoil the fun

We can make it right for us
We can make it right for us
'Stead of treated, we get tricked
'Stead of kisses, we get kicked

We can make it right for us
We can make it right for us
'Stead of treated, we get tricked
'Stead of kisses, we get kicked (Okay)

Everybody talkin' lil' lil this and lil' lil' that
I told y'all before this is bigger than rap
There's too much hatin' goin' on, let us young ones be
Only time will tell, I'm just tryin' to be me
I make music for people to bang in the street
First single "My Baby" number one 10 weeks
I did a show with Michael, yeah, I'm comin' for the title
I'm young, but my dad taught me all about survival
I don't feed into the negative, I sho' improve what I do
Don't go for the masses to be true like the Bible
I've been here long y'all, I'm part of the cycle
That started? I do
I'm tryin' to be the next Jay-Z, Nelly and Ja Rule
Put it down like my pops, that's just the way that I move
There's gotta be another way, live to see another day
Every night I go to bed, I kneel down to the Lord and say

Just remember if you make it right today
It'll even be better tomorrow

Throw your hands up
Put your hands up
Raise your hands up
Throw your hands up
Put your hands up
Raise your hands up
Yeah, okay

Okay (Okay)
Don't stop, won't stop, can't stop </pre>
