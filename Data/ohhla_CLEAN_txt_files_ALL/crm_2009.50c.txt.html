[Intro: 50 Cent]
You wan' smoke that?
Go 'head, roll it son
I don't give a fuck man (Six Figga)
Smoke that shit man
Or you can smoke crack if you wanna smoke crack
I don't give a fuck what you wanna do man
Don't look to me to stop you man - yeah
I'm not gettin in the way

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Cash Rules, I keep a shooter 'round me, Queens!
Get the money, I have a nigga killed y'all (killed y'all)
Kill the hood, ask niggaz 'bout me, Jesus!
For the money, niggaz'll go real hard (real hard)

[50 Cent]
You are now under my hypnosis
Summertime grind, come out with the toasters
I return like a animal ferocious
New money breathe, new enemies, nigga you know this
Another mil', another nigga sick
I got nothin but hard dick for your bitch to lick
I box you orthodox out boy, outlaw bricks of raw
I'm out in the grind, I make the dope price soar
Shit cool 'til the mac out, run when it back out
A nigga finna blackout, better pray that bitch jam
It's in God's hands, it's all God plan
You mean even when a nigga gettin smoked, goddamn

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I push my pen with passion, I'm the author of the struggle
When pain is a head crack, designer of the devil
Trip' 6-6-6, I'm back on my bullshit
See clear through my third eye; it's gon' be a murda
E'ry summer, e'ry winter, e'ry spring
You think I'm bullshittin I put that on e'rything
The shootin gon' stop right after the shit-talkin
I was sellin crack while Mike was moonwalkin
20 off a pack, I stack, I can't call it
I blast ya like NASA, Jack, you outta orbit
I mean you outta order, you don't want me to send a nigga to you
So he could put some hot shit through you, do you?

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I'm back baby I'm back!
New shit, the drought over, new product
Yeah, man I can't fit in with these niggaz man
I mean niggaz got mohawks, they wearin skinny jeans man
I think these niggaz is faggots man, for real man
They with the rainbow club man
You think this shit is a fad? C'mon man!
I think it's more than that man
I think it's more than that
So if a nigga wear a dress, you gon' put on a dress too?
C'mon man...
