[Too $hort]
You want me to say I do?
I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
You love me don't you, now it's true
The opposite, that's how I do
Relationships, they come and go
Next thing you know she's on the flo'
Dancin, she wants some mo'
Her ex-boyfriend he'll never know
She's still sprung, can't tell her nuttin
She was young, when she fell in love with him
Used to spend every day with him
He cheated, and now she's hatin him
He's a fraud, don't tell her that
You can do a background credit check
Show her how to have better sex
And it still ain't over - never that~!

[Chorus]
It ain't over, I want you to get it closer
Wanna get to know what, what I want will get me goin
It ain't over, got a man but he ain't gonna
Wanna get me goin, come on baby show me what's up

[Too $hort]
I wanna go there wit'chu
Do the house and the kids too
I know what it is wit'chu
You hot, girl I'm thizzin too!
So you gotta be home at 10?
Next time I see you it's on again
I shoulda known your man'd
hit redial, and call your phone again
Who's ass is that?
Bitch don't ask me that
I'm keepin you, I won't pass it back
Let it ring don't answer that
Unless you wanna tell him now
While we havin sex and you hella loud
Screamin and yellin out
Tell him what we all about

[Chorus]
You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long
It ain't over, boy I just can't go, oh no

[Too $hort]
You think he slept around
Held you back and kept you down
You was sad, are you happy now?
At your momma and your daddy's house
With a sad and long face
Wishin you had yo' own place
You've been lonely lately
Even tried to go on and datin
But then you met me, I'm a different type
Can't fall in love, I'm pimpin right
Probably wanna fuck by the end of the night
Push your dress up and your panties aside
The best ever, it can't be true
I'ma pull on your hair and spank you too
You like it rough, I think you do
I'ma beat it up 'til the pink turn blue

[Chorus]
You say you want it and that I'm in love
I got another but I'm feeling yah
You so hot, but I been involved too long
It ain't over, boy I just can't go, oh no
It ain't over, I want you to get it closer
Wanna get to know what, what I want will get me goin
It ain't over, got a man but he ain't gonna
Wanna get me goin, come on baby show me what's up</pre>
