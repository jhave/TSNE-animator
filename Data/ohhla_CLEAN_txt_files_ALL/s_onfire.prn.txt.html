[Police over radio]
5-King-15 to 15-Adam
1-1-4 to all units, be advised the verdicts have come in
Verdicts are not guilty, repeat not guilty
5-King 15-adam come in
15-Adam come in

[Kurupt]
Yeah, hit the spider
Ride out the rider
Get lit the fired up
Lit the fired up
It's me, rhyme-maker
Double eyed salt and pepper shaker
Semi-valley earthquaker for acres
Outlaw law breakers
Nigga
Its on on sight
Dark Blue black and white fight
Forever, I pulled the war lever .44s
And nickle plated Beretta
To pierce armor and leather is pure havoc
The streets is on pure fire
Get folded like envelopes
I suffocate hope
Equipped with shells, boxed with full scopes
One incident reshapes the globe

[Porno For Pyros]
A creep in the morning that becomes daylight
I walk to the beat, to the beat
So who was going out with me tonight?
We're running out into the street tonight
I love life
I mean well
I've been told I can't control myself
Hear me out
Something I wanna do
Hear me out
Something I want to say
Streets on fire
I wanna get higher

[Porno For Pyros]+(Kurupt)
A creep in the morning that becomes daylight
(Yeah, so don't say nothin
I want it all emptied or I'ma start bustin)
I walk to the beat, to the beat
(Higher, higher, burning fire
Making music like a choir)
I'm trusted by the people like the crust on an apple pie
(To start the riot grip the heat and start the firin)
I'm buffin up my badge and a lean mean to spit in your eye
(Hot supplying, multipy through the fire riots)
I love life
(I'm twice as nice)
And I like to live it well
(The streets is a living hell)
I've been told I can't control myself
Hear me out
There's something I wanna do
Hear me out
Something I wanna say
Streets on fire
Everybody get higher

[Kurupt]
I'm gonna fight
Take off on sight
Picking off on the first thing in sight
Sayin like Bloods and Crips on sight
What I saw, scoping like Lee Harvey Oswald
Lit, totally and utterly subliminal
Police is as croocked as the criminals
Five-star generals
Premeditation
Bar flu world spark new generations
Oh, I've been hidin
Gotti, Bin laden
We out for the ridin
Roll like ten sqaudrons
Hit the national guard on the two way
Cause these nigga's gotta hear what I gotta say
I'ma roll till I can't roll no more
Say it!
I'ma fold till I can't fold no more
Say it!
I'ma split till I can't spit no more
Say it!
I'ma get up till I can't get no more
Say it!

[Porno For Pyros]+(Kurupt)
I love life
(Life, life, life)
And I like to live it well
(Well, the streets is a burning hell)
And I've been told I can't control myself
(Control myself, self, self)
Hear me out
There's something I wanna do
(Let's crack it with the streets)
Hear me out
Something I wanna say
(Yeah, check it out, check it out)
I want the streets on fire
(Higher, higher streets on fire)
Everybody get higher
(Making music like a choir)
Everybody get, everybody
(Higher, higher, streets on fire
Making music like a choir)
Everybody get higher
Higher, higher, streets on fire
Making music like a choir</pre>
