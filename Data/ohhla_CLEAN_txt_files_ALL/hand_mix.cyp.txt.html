(B-Real)
Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat 
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that 
Sendin off buck shots for I'm gonna wetcha 
Running hard, but I'm still coming to getcha 
Thinking like a peace smoke, comin on a homicide 
You talkin shit, try to take me for a ride 
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel one 
Finger on the trigger with my hands upon the steel 
Lettin out a bullet, this is going boo-yaa 
You're stuck in my so hood, so what ya gonna do now? 
Being the hunted one is no fun 
Here I come son, yo I think you better run 
Better run more, and move a little faster 
Second of thought and I'm coming to blast ya 
With my 

(Chorus) 
(B-Real)
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump 
Left hand on a forty, (puffin onna blunt) 
Pumped my shotgun, (niggaz didn't jump) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la laaaaa...

(Sen Dog)
Comin at you like a stiff blow, fuckin up your program 
Ain't takin shit from you him or no man 
Master mind maniac and a menace soooo 
How they want to pass sentence 
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger 
He missed, so now the nigga's pissed 
Rude and crude like a pitbull get to the point 
Your fuckin car to get pulled, now 
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle 
And I'm handin out beatdowns 
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle 
And I'm handin out beatdowns (get your face down!) 
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains 
I can get out, but the grudge remains 
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha 
Fucking do ya, shotgun go boo-yaa! 

(Chorus) 
(B-Real)
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump 
Left hand on a forty, (puffin onna blunt) 
Pumped my shotgun, (niggaz didn't jump) 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la laaaaa...

Kickin that funky Cypress Hill shit 
Take a lot of mental for the blunted to chill with
Cuz I'm the chill one, known to get ill one 
They stepped to the Hill "What's up?", I had to kill one 
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle 
And they got me on lock down 
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle 
And they got me on lock down 
Hit me like a nigga who done lost his mind 
Cause I ain't goin out like a spineless jellyfish 
Some say life is a bitch 
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch 
Out for the Hill fuckin up at a party 
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la laaa 
Look at all of those funeral cars 
Cause I'ma 

(Chorus)

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump 
Left hand on a forty, (puffin onna blunt)
Pumped my shotgun, (niggaz didn't jump)
