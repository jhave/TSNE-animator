[Intro: Ghostface]
Yeah you are now listening to the sounds of Ghost Radio
777 FM, we in God dimension
Sponsored by Stark Enterprise
Shout out to everybody on Staten Island
Don't touch that dial...

Ay yo, ay yo, my name's on your roster kid, I mean business
Big elevators mean big businesses
Sleeves rolled up around five, I, loosen my tie
Rough day though the stock was high
Plus I'm hungry, move like the boss of the joint
I know it don't mean nothing 'cuz I brought the joint
But still, realer hits, card dealin' shits
Bass lips, murder topics, niggas ain't shit
So what, I had a rough day?
That's right, and if y'all don't like it
then motherfuck, ya'll is Ghost in da house!
Make noise if it's C.R.E.A.M. in da house!
Aww shit now, fly coffee tables, haircuts dust
Money this long, you wish you could roll with us
Supersoak us, your bitch chose us
Be sure to stay away from friends you can't trust

[Tekitha (Ghostface)]

It's been so long
(Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Since he had a true friend
(That's right, that's right)
True friends are sure hard to come by
(Uh-huh)
But then again
His loyalties lie within
Always kept his head to the sky
And they can't see... no n-n-no-no
   (Check it..I want all y'all...remember this? Yo...c'mon, c'mon)
They can't see him walking through the darkness... no-n-n-no-no
   (Ooha-ooha! yo, Ooha-ooha! uh-huh, yeah, Ooha-ooha! Ooha-ooha!)
They can't see him walking through the darkness

[Ghostface]
Yo, yo, yo, the new President America
Flash money, act funny
Party, ride the bubbly
Goons and thugs, double hennessey
One shot to the nose, double energy
I don wallabees, fucking remember me
Guess who's back? The W embassy!
Even in the dark we electricity, rap celebrities for the longevity
Staten and Manhattan, that's all liberty
B.E.T, MTV always big on me
That I rock coliseums, cop a drop BM
Drunk throw his dick out on stage, I gotta see 'im
Then he sung:
*Ha! Let's get druuunnnnk! Ha!
 Let's get drunk and hiiiiiiiIIIIIIGH yeahhhh!*

[Ghostface (Tekitha)]
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, throw your hands in the air, throw your hands in the air
     (They can't see him walking through the darkness)
Like this y'all, like that y'all... c'mon, yeah
     (c'mon, no-o-o they can't see him walking through the darkness)
Yeah... ma, c'mon boo... yeah that's right... motherfucka
    (No-o-o, they can't see him walking through the darkness)
Yeah... c'mon ma, rock that sick... that's right yo, look at ??? over there
C'mon, c'mon we breakin' it down
   (Ooh no-o, they can't see him walking through, walking through)
Uh-huh, these are the best dancers in the house tonight,
Ladies and gentlemen give them a round of applause
  (No, and the earth, they can't explain... on his road to become... become)
Uh-huh, that's how I like it, that's right, listening to the sounds of Ghost
Radio...
It's like that y'all... Staten Island, New York
 (the chased and get hazed)
New York in the house, make some noise!
