[Chorus: Akon]
Ohhhh, don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood
Ain't nuttin change still holla at my homies
Ohh and when I hit the block I still will kill
And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to
Kill, if niggaz get to fuckin around
If niggaz get to fuckin around

[50 Cent]
Yeah... respect come from admiration and fear
You can admire me if you could catch one in your wig
You see the Testarosa, the toaster's right on my lap
So if a nigga get out of line and nigga get clapped
I got a arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, they'll let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain
Get the message from the lines or get the message from the 9
Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine
I let 21 shots off at the same time, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Yeah... where I'm from death is always in the air homie
Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me
I come creepin through the hood wearin teflon
Hit the corners motherfuckers get left on
Niggaz know, if not they better check my background
Try and stick me I'll fill your back with mac rounds
Ask Prim' nigga 50 don't "Back Down"
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line boy I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up
And if you are, fuck you cause I ain't change up
The O.G.'s wanna talk but I don't know these niggaz
And I ain't did no business wit 'em, I don't owe these niggaz
a minute of my time, I get it cause I grind
All across the globe like the world's mine, YEAH!

[Chorus]

[Akon]
{*cell door slams*} Konvict
Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
and seen the mac aimin at your head mayne (head mayne)
Before you know it life is flashin reminiscin
and your body is drippin and full of lead mayn (lead mayne)
I done been there (uh-huh) I done copped that (uh-huh)
It ain't never been a question I'm bout that (uh-huh)
Don't go there (uh-huh) you get clapped at (uh-huh)
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that (uh-huh)
You'll never catch me ridin around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I will kill, dip and hide on these niggaz (ohhhh)
50 don't make me ride on these niggaz (ay)
Cause I be long gone like the ripper, so

[Chorus]</pre>
