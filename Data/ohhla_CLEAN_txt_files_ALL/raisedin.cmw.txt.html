Compton is the place that I touched down.
I opened my eyes to realise I was dark brown.
And right there in the ghetto that color costs.
Brothers smothered by the streets meaning we're lost.
I grew up in a place where it was go for your own.
Don't get caught after dark roaming the danger zone.
Cause it was hell at the age of 12
as my Compton black brothers were in and out of jail.
Years went on, I played with the school crap.
Made it half way, it didn't pay, so I said fuck that.
Cause right then it was the cash I was after.
The street had a beat so I was caught up in the rapture.
It said sell, sell, sell.
And after that it was jail, jail, jail.
I also kept a nine as my toy.
I was only 15, so boys will be boys.
So by 16 I was hip to the groove
and fucking any stupid black bitch that move.
And on top of that I was down for the hood.
If you from Compton you know that the hood is where its good.
So load up the gatts and its down the avenue.
I'm kinda fucked up so I guess I'll kill a few
punk niggas trying to scheme on my tip.
Geah I'm selling the cavi and I'm checkin a grip.
But now the high rolling days been cancelled.
Damn, they kidnapped my homie for ransom.
But thats an everyday thing thats what the news play.
One times cant do shit so why the fuck do you pay.
And this goes out to all those niggas that know whats popping.
fool thats when your raised in Compton.

[he would grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum..
Either in jail, or someone would shoot him.]X2 

Drug wars, you got the pushers and the pimps
and to make things worse you got the bustas and the wimps.
Gank bitches trying to scheme on my money.
Sucker punks jack, now aint that funny.
But I'm a young nigga, with a respectable rep.
But my brothers gangbanging, I guess I'll follow in his footsteps.
Claiming a set, jacking a brother,
beating a bitch, you diss the hood I'll put you 6 feet under.
Who gives a fuck if its wrong, no time for thinking.
Just think of the bud and the 8-ball drinking.
So now its time to show my loyalty.
Shoot up my enemy territory.
And my brothers got my back they wont trip.
And I'm in it to win it so I won't slip.
It was like we had a gangbang rally.
A thousand mutherfucking thuggish niggas in the alley.
So while we waited to peel a cap
the suckers crept, damn, shot me in the back.
so now I bail in a wheelchair, no more stomping.
Raised in Compton.

geah, y'knowutumsayin? 
MC Eiht and Compton's Most Wanted putting niggas to rest.
Side by each, y'knowutumsaying? Putting em down.
Cause Compton is the place with the base
and if you don't like it take 2 to the face.
MC Eiht, and I'm outta here.
