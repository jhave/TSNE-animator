[Q-Tip]
Sometimes I phase out when I look at the screen
and I think about my chance for me to intervene
And it's up to me to bring back the hope
Put feeling in the music that you could quote
Not saying that I hate it, 'cause here I kinda dig it
But what good is a ear if a Q-Tip isn't in it?
So to stick it in, to inform your friend
Your boy from the hood, is on that shit again
He has upped the degrees and dropped the mercuries
To splash on the mass from low to upper class
And when the records spins and sometimes blows a wind
A fickleness of friends, they sometimes hate again
They always bring up Tribe on me, could not survive on me
'cause this is my man's on me, this is my fams
And here's somethin' new, it's front row for you
So don't misconstrue, it's Tribal and true
My dudes who hustle hard, don't stop your repertoire
As long as you could see, it's you who's stayin' we
'cause life is filled with (?) pills and little pearls and shit
I'm fuckin' up, I mean, I'm trippin' up
But still, there is a boy, them people get annoyed
Let's focus is on the feel, before we get a deal
Come on

[Hook]
Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But chillin on a whole, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But chillin on a whole, I see we're just the same

[Q-Tip]
With the vibe we came, to put back on the street
Let's take care of ours, and ensure we eat
And Oprah an 'em, they criticize the boys
Without in between, they lose all their boys
They can't keep us down, we're dominate and brown
And those other shades, they join our parade
But wait there's rain ahead, like Brit and Kevin Fed
And magazine debris, is shit she gotta see it
I'm no different to you, I goes through it too
I thumbs through the page, I don't come of age
I'm not a deity, I'm far from perfect, see
I roll the tumble weed, it's just a humble scene
That I present to you, is just a mister crue
Who burrs a harmony, and soon a melody
That speaks to where we are, the door, I hope's ajar
And soon we're walkin' in, a blip, it's just to say, "Come on"

[Hook]
Figurin' life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But chillin on a whole, I see we're just the same
Figuring out where we should be

Figurin' if life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But chillin' on our own, I see we're just the same
Think that we're not, where we should be

Figurin' if life can be a thing, the wilderness is wild to me
But chillin' on our own, I see we're just the same
Think that we're not, where we should be</pre>
