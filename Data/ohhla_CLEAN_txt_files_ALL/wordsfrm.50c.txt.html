[Lloyd Banks]
Marsh' knows man
Talk tough, 'til you get cuffed and start tellin, damn~!
Everyday I shot a new bitch
And when I'm done with her it'll look like...

[50 Cent]
At first they didn't want me, now they want me
See a nigga gettin paid they wanna push up on me
You should see these hoes chasin a nigga
I have 'em in the hotel tastin a nigga
50 like a lollipop, lick me baby
Then lick Dr. Dre and Shady, OH~!</pre>
