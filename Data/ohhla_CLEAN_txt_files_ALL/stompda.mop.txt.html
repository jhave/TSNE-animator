Yo Rule, you need one slammed in your face
Be hung out to dry, and left here to die

[Lil' Fame]
Yes yes y'all, you can spread love or take six
This ain't The Matrix, you fake bitch
I don't gangbang freaks, am I blind?
I'm quick to bloody a Crip and cripple a Blood

[Billy Danze]
Give him a slug, these niggaz ain't worthy of love
They should be put in a hole, that was recently dug
(KILLLERS!)  Pass me the jug, ghetto unplugged
My family's the type to turn it into "Fight Club"
