Who got the chance to make things right?
Why the politicians always want to fight?
The Christian coalition and the right wing ooooh!
Let me tell you what you can do
Step outside the cone of silence
Too much hatred and violence
It's time to rewind
We need a military decline
Got the power of the mind focused
Government like a locust
Are we gone or just going?
Time to act on what we be knowing y'all

Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the

Eyes on the prize and never wane
Take the bull by the reins
If you want it be the change
Like Ghandi and MLK
Wait up, got to change the system
Need knowledge, power and wisdom
Same way I rock this microphone
Speak up, just let it be known
Hey ladies, fellas
And everyone between
Take the power back, let them react
And let's show them what we mean; Check it out

Who got the power to make a difference?
Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the

We can work, walk, march and protest
Think about how we approach this
Ask questions but they keep frontin'
Due time we change a little something
Hey yo don't you know
Won't forget Amadou Diallo
To the crooked people and the crooked cops
Got to spread love before the world goes pop
Never again should we use the A-bomb
We need an international ban on
all W.O.M.D.'s gone
We need a multilateral disarm

Who got the power to make a difference?

Who got the power to make a change?
Who got the power to make a difference?
We got the
We got the
We got the</pre>
