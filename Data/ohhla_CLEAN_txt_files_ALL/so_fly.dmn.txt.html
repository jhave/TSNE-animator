Chorus:

Ooh I, wanna piece of pie
You're so fly, ay
Ooh I, wanna piece of pie
You're so fly, um
Ooh I, wanna piece of pie
You're so fly, ay
Ooh I, wanna piece of pie
You're so fly, um

[First Verse]
Well it feels good I like
There's a cute funk in the night
You playas and hustlas know, we gotta get that ass show ya right
So I'ma stroll out to the mall
Can't forget the strap, hell naw
Cuz ain't no tellin' on the mack tip
Shock the wrong hoochie get'cha cap peeled
If you'z a straight playa and you bes with me
Then you know what's crackin' off the Hennessey
Scopin' out, I need the right miss
No disrespect but it's like this

Chorus

[Second Verse]
There's somethin' bout a chocolate girl
Or the little things you do
I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk
I think I like the Sprite in you
I like the way you wear your hair
The sexy little things you wear
And that junk in the trunk girl, makes it all good yes sir
Now picture you and me, chocolate fantasy
At the Marriott, lost in ecstasy
Got the ringer off, on the telephone
Serve you somethin' right, so that you will moan
It'll be so good, what I do to you
Makes you close your eyes, and you go "ooh ooh"
Ask me how it feels, in your leg of lamb
Baby hot damn

Chorus

[Domino]
Now all my playas and my home girls, if you with me
Then hit that note for the deep stroke, shuke, shuke
Now all my hustlas and my hoochies, if you with me
Then hit that note for the deep stroke, shuke, shuke
Ooh, Ah, you're so fly
Ooh, ah, ooh, you're so fly
Ooh, ooh, ah, you're so fly
I say ooh, ooh, ah, you're so fly
