What 
Young Noble nigga 
Get it right 

Verse 1: Young Noble 

For the world 
My girl 
My kid 
My dog 
And I know you mad at Pac for creating the Outlawz 
For the block 
Cops and the pigeons who watch 
For the dope 
The blow 
The crime 
The dro 
For the rhymes 
The dimes 
The crimes 
And the time 
For the message 
The lesson 
The stressing and the blessing 
For the hurt 
The work 
The smurfs in the dirt 
For the schools 
The tools 
The rules 
The fools 
For the dead 
The fed 
The party's over here 
For the wild 
The style 
It started in the Claire 
For the street 
The beat 
The niggas with the heat 
For the Lawz 
The dogs 
We do this shit for y'all 
For the jails 
The cells 
The waiting on your mail 
For the pain 
The rain 
The mutha fuckin game 
For the heart 
The narcs 
The niggas in the park 
And you have to have your heat 
Because it's crazy after dark nigga 

Chorus: 2x 

Young Noble: 

For the dough 
The creme 
The hoes 
The fiends 
And I'm riding till my life is through 
And mashing for my dreams 
Click clack up 
I'm mashing for my team 
Bitch back up 

Ya Yo: 

We outta mask up 
And hit they ass up 

Verse 2: Ya Yo 

For the life 
The stripes 
The knife and the price 
For the Ya the Yo 
The days with the blow 
For the drops 
The coupes 
The shots off the roof 
For the niggas 
The bitches 
The trigger finger itching 
For the hoods 
The 'burbs 
The homies with the herb 
For the safe combination 
And keys to your place 
For the cars 
The jewels 
The furs 
The ??? 
For the bitches who be copying Ya 
Watching all my moves 
For the rise and fall 
Of mine and yours 
Yeah you're from the cradle 
I was born an Outlaw 

Verse 3: Edi 

Getting paid 
Getting laid 
All day 
Everyday 
Niggas hate 
Don't matter 
We gonna come up anyway 
Edi Ahmeen 
Outlaw 
Bring your team down raw 
Peep this scheme 
Now all calling them fake nigga holocaust 
And of course we enforce everything that we spitting here 
Yo you smell something funky hear 
That's because we just shitted here 
In this year 
Niggas get it clear 
See there shares disappear 
We coming from the rear 
Got you running in fear 

Verse 4: H-Rider 

When the job needs to be done 
I'm there for the cause 
Riding and dying for the cause 
They'll never come 
Dick riders 
And the dick provide you with guns 
That spit hand first 
Come quick 
Bang in silence 
Since I hit for the kid 
I'm a ??? rider 
Somehow I got bullets that'll find you 
And if you don't like me 
And cross me 
There's gonna be problems 
I harm 'em in the arm and leg 
Right here is where you lay 

Young Noble: 

Outlaw 

Chorus: 2x 

Verse 5: Napoleon 

It's the life 
Full of cash 
Full of gats 
Full of hoes 
Got bullet hoes for foes 
Trying to stay up on my toes 
In the middle of the ghetto 
Ain't got nowhere to turn 
Just plenty of money to earn 
And plenty of money to burn 
When feds hit the block 
Go ahead with your shots 
Lead for the cops 
Head full of dots 
Cremated on the spot 
It's a cycle for the long pay 
Might just go the wrong way 
Grinding in a strong way 
Get along 
No way 
Drama at the law 
Riding for the cause 
Coming at your door 
Your nigga dead and he don't know what he died for 
What about that nigga that struggling 
Ain't sleeping right 
What about them kids on the street 
Ain't eating right 
Outlaw 
Treat 'em like we do it so OG like 
Living life 
Taking flights 
Niggas might just die tonight 
Murder cases in a bloody way 
Something gotta get a day 
You outta your mind if you say ain't heard of me </pre>
