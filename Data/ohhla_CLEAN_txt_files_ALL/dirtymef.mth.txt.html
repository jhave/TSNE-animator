[Intro: Method Man (Ol' Dirty Bastard)]
Expect the unexpected, motherfucker, let's go, come on
Yeah, M-E-F, hahahaha, special guest
(Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck)
Hahahaha.. yeah..

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
One verse, and leave in a new Benz-er
Take a trip down south and put some hoes to work, you hear me
Dirt McGirt, you niggaz gon' respect it
I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo
And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit
Them down south niggaz been loved Dirt
Take a shot to the head, if you been through the worse
Show respect to your niggaz, who been doin' it first
And be comin' with that shit, I'm just doin' the worse

[Chorus 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Method Man)]
Yo, you don't wanna ride with Dirt, you still stuck in coach
You don't wanna fly in first, yo, I can spit
(Yo, you don't wanna ride with Meth, we still sniffing coke
Even if you tried your best, yo, I can spit)

[Method Man]
Yeah, damn, I'm just like Dirt in the booth
I'm the truth, I don't need to go to church in a suit
Each verse is the proof, I drink a 100 Proof
Cop searching the coup, I got some herb in my boot
When Wu is coming through, the outcome: critical
Fucking with this style, the outcome: get physical
Meth get lyrical, and y'all can get my genitals
Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins &amp; minerals
Heh, ya'meen, I'm taking one for the team
Like Martin Luther King, taking one for a dream
I'm dope, to many fiends, live by many means
If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything
That's real shit, let's get this money real quick
Dirt Dog, I'm feeling this, but I'd rather feel rich
I mean filthy rich, I'm corporate now
Big Meth, the label's Def, that's why I talk so loud, nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Hook 2X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck...</pre>
