[12 O'Clock]
It's hard for me to leave out
You call for more, want my define, more
A nuh mature, see my G-O-Ds, see my K-A-Ds
The nuh gotta leave, a nuh gotta leave
Stop blowin' trees, tryin' to put me to sleep
See I live across the street, you hot in my links

[Chorus: Melodie]
Stay with me
Stay with me for a little while
Won't you stay with me?
Stay with me for a little while
Baby don't go nowhere, 'cos I need you here
Won't you stay with me?
Stay with me for a little while

[Melodie]
You could tell me that you love me and you care
You ain't going nowhere, you gonna stay right here
Stay with me, stay with me
For a little while
Becouse I am waiting untils the fading
For your love to - bring me up to the place in love

[Chorus]

[Melodie]
You could tell me you love me, boy
Why you at the door?
You don't love me no-more
Sittin' round, talkin' bout what we gon' be
We are family but how we gonna lay it down?

[Chorus] - repeat 'til fade</pre>
