[Verse 1]
Chino, name in Indian: Murdering bear
Come fuck with me I put shotgun shells in your ear
Out of fear they've destroyed my carrier
Have nothing left
But I will have my revenge in this lifetime or the next
I experience road rage, walk in a slow pace
Killed a handicapped man for parking in a regular parking place
Learned my art with a leatherface, you must be kidding
I consider myself a dog trainer: I'm most bitten
But I've been written a billion bars of dissin
for any rappers dead or livin that we've ever heard since we was children
My brain got built-in Pentium chips, my thoughts the fastest
For Shakespearian actors: "Chino shall busteth your asseth,
When I spithed acid" ... yeah your freestyle was tight
You better rhyme of the head good, you can't read or write
A bittin' kid that'll get twist if he front, no publicity stunt
His life flashes by his eyes quicker than Black History Month
What!

(Chorus)
Yo'
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
Yo, That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
That would be me!
Who stand damn near six foot three?
That would be me!
Who got lyrics, jewels and plenty money?
That would be me!
Start drama and see the illest papi, yo' what would be me!

[Verse 2]
Yo', Yo'
You wanna be a soldier but ain't reppin' it right
Try me... metal detectors going off for the rest of your life
No matter how hard it gets,
I rather be a soldier drowning in my own blood
Not a coward in my own piss
Focus!... What the fuck you niggas think?
I roll with killers that spent more time in the pen than ink
Don't even blink, and turn your voice down a decibel
Or start lookin' for studios that's wheelchair-accessible
Leave you a vegetable, trust,
I have the letters on your FUBU sweater standin' for "Fucked Up By Us"
We thrust into beef now
Grill holds back like a Lee nail
You yell as you reach hell
You still wanna E-mail she males
Your train of thought derails
Lost dog, here's the details:
I make you think you on a beach how I make you SEE shells/Seashells
My L.A. airport beef was infamous,
I whooped ass the entire five hour flight
Plus three hour time difference

(Chorus)
Yo'
Who your girl made you pay to come see?
That would be me!
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
Yo, That would be me!
Who bench press about three fifty three?
That would be me!
Start drama and see the illest papi, yo' what would be me!

[Verse 3]
Yo'
I ain't from Atlanta but I'll leave you outcasted/+OUTKASTED+
And blasted, all fucked up like Schwarzenneger's accent
You has been, I split you apart
I spit from the heart
Yeah you iced out... that's how you slid off the chart
Blindfolded as I sit in the dark, a swoll beast
No peace, big Chi have the police calling the police
I call Aziz, omnipotence
Smoking I shine in its open
We ain't scared of jail we wanna go back
Blast in yo' back, nine bullets in the column of your spine
More than Columbine and Palestine combined, Forty-eight track
Half spic, half black
Sex symbol to the media
Keep my number listed so my beefs can find me easier
In sales you ain't dealing with me
I'm Puerto Rican and I got enough relatives to buy me platinum living with me
I never will be, overthrown... I'm unbelievable
Like the fact that D'angelo's baby's mom is Angie Stone
What!

(Chorus)
Yo'
Who the only star on WB?
That would be me!
Who the mami's think is so sexy?
That would be me!
Who the illest nigga outta Jersey?
That would be me!
Who your wife he let fuck her for free?
That would be me!
Who get your ass shot dead in the street?
That would be me!
Who stand damn near six foot three?
That would be me!
Who got lyrics, jewels and plenty money?
That would be me!
Who bench press about three fifty three?
Who writes hits like B-I-G?
That would be me!
Who go to war like P-A-C?
Yo, that would be ME!
Who carry gats like he crazy?
That would be me!
Who getting' rich still rock lyrically?
That would be me!
Who never lose street mentality?
That would be me!
Who let you live cus you comedy?
That would be me!
Who bring that rock star energy?
That would be me!
Start drama and see who rides for Jersey, yo' that would be me...</pre>
