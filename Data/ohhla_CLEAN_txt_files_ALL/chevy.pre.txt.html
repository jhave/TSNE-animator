[Intro: Slick 'Em]
Yeah........
It'll make you mad
comin live from the 305...Whoooooo
Its what I do baby
this song goes out
to all my dope ridaz
my chevy ridaz
on them 24's with the spinning hubcaps

[Chorus]
26's on my chevy (my chevy)
Chrome on my chevy (my chevy)
Candy on my chevy (my chevy)
Blades on my chevy (oooh)
Dudes on my chevy (my chevy)
Girls in my chevy (my chevy)
Screens in my chevy (my chevy)
Shove in my chevy
I'm so hiiiiiiigh.....
I'm so hiiiiiiigh.....
Did I studder

[Baby Blue]
When I ride so high like my reams
Wit a pint of droe
Sittin on 24's
Matter of fact dat was a year ago
Now I'm ridin on 26's
It's yo boy you ain't catch me rollin
In the back of my seats man
6-4 when I hittin dem switches
? sittin on deep dishes
And five hit 'em wit the L-G get man
I'm doin number so don't try to screw me
? and I'm eatin up like Scooby
I got a pocket full of bread
A girl givin me head in the back row at the movies
Sell me yo Gucci
Please don't try to save me a seat wit yo Coochie
Excuse me
Sssssss ha I smell PUSSY
I never deal wit a hoe who smell like sushi
I know you got to go trick, introduce me (now Blue you know you wrong for dat)
(Slick hold up)
I Baby Blue roll
Male gigalo, I get it on the low
Get out my window, reams glow
I ride slow forever flossin you don't know

[Chorus]

[Spectacular]
You can call me big 4 when I'm in my dome
72 chevy wit the shove in the trunk
Suede on the seats wit the suicide doors
Yea I like to make the dash board glow
Paint swelled up like apple pie
Say hi cause suicide all the time
2 seconds will get me from zero to six
You ain't pullin over then you betta come get me
Girls goin wild when I'm on the sceen
My seat belt must go seam stream
Bluestars stuck by custom glass
And you can hear dem pipes when I'm hit tags

[Chorus]

[Slick 'Em]
Now what you hatin for (what you hatin for)
Is it the chevy five (is it the chevy five)
On dem glass rims (on dem glass rims)
Wit the chromed trim (wit the chromed trim)
Da way I roll up (roll up)
Calm and laid back (laid back)
This here body droppin top
I know they hate dat
Keep smell of fear
Let's make it clear
These playa's ain't real
They counterfeit
Needs some Lysol
Cause Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, is the shhh eeha
Got me statin, vibratin
Got the street shakin
Lit boy bad there
Nothin but dem 12 quaking playa (playa, playa, playa, playa)

[Chorus]</pre>
