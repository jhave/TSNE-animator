Song:   It's Too Late
Typed by: aloevera@arcticmail.com

She said 'Meet me at the gates at eight
'Leave now, don't be late'
She said one day she'd walk away
'Cause I was always late
Thought things were okay
Didn't care though anyway
Say 'Sorry, babe, I had to meet a mate'
Tempting fate
We first met through a shared view
She loved me and I did too
It's now seven-fifty
Getting ready, better be nifty
Do my hair quickly
Step out, it's cloudy
Mate bells me to borrow money
I've got two henrys and a dealer to pay
Call up on geezers to rid these green trees
From my reeking jeans
Got a You-Think-I-Care air
Out glaring geezers' stares
I'm here and I'm there
Couldn't see past the end of my beer
What was getting near
All of the silence after the tears

[Chorus]
I didn't know it was over
Till it was too late, too ate
But if I ever needed you
Would you be there?

She said 'Meet me at the gates, don't be late'
But pretty soon the day came for change
And I was glad she never walked away
So I'm choosing what to wear
Doing my hair with an hour to spare
When my life went pear
She'd been there with a fixed stare
Big wheel climbed to the top
Geezers' stares bounced off
Standing at the top of this huge mountain
Smiling and shouting
Spring flowers sprouting
Not one inch of doubt in my mind
As I reached the gates
Came around the corner at a rate
Risked her love
But I was gonna set things straight
Never again am I gonna be late [x3]

[Chorus]

I said meet me at the gates
Leave now, don't be late
I waited for a while
Listening to her voicemail
Mind set sail
Then the facts turned me pale
Wind, rain, hail
My fears unveiled for my fair female
She'd walked away
Too little to late
I step up the pace
Walk past the gate
Rain runs over my face
Spirit falls from grace
I purchase a hazy escape at the alcohol place
In the Chase, I sat down, got a fat frown
Weeping and drown in my senses
For this love game's expensive
I walk in a trance
Got a wounded soldier stance
And the everyday geezers' stares throw me off balance
Now nothing holds significance
And nothing holds relevance
Cause the only thing I can see is her elegance

[Chorus x2]</pre>
