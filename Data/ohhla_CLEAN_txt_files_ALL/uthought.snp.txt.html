[Intro: DJ E-Z Dick]
That's right, that's right
Do yo' thang baby, do yo' thang huh
Ah ha ha, yeah... And it don't quit
but bitch please get yo' hand off my grip
Now that's right... and it don't stop right here on W-Ballz
Nothin' but a come up - the real Mackadosious, the real McCoy
That's right, DJ E-Z Dick
This one is strictly for the pimps, players, true money makers
Nothin' but a players ball right here on W-Ballz
Pimp fun under the sun, that's right we doin' it live
With Soopafly, Too $hort, and my main man Doggy Dogg 

[Soopafly]
I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
fell for the do-low, and you know I'm - 
too swift on my toes and it gives a pose
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agreed, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
In my room, got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flipped, talkin' 'bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick and that's too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much cock and givin' up too much ass
Nah nah nah, you ain't gettin' me like that... 
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, caught me a homerun
Baby was bad and all, she said "give me a call"
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' 'bout what could pop out and hit the groove
Then she said somethin' about the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird, so I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe... 
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with your weave
   
You thought you had my grip
But Soopafly never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Til' I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(like a pimp, and that's for real)
   
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe, lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on - 
over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named 'Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches 'cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
'cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little bit and get a t-shirt that say Ms. Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang that's stoppin' you from buyin' me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'ma buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl - bring her, 'cause I've been dyin' to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass 'cause you know I don't need her... 
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages baby
   
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
Trick beyotch
   
[Too $hort]
I said beyotch, what are you smokin'
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstandin'
Hit the parking lot, bitch I'll be standin' by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggaz ain't trickin' durin' pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort?)  Introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet ya, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dogg bitch, you ain't fin' to come up hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the Eastside
Not much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'ma tell you though
Can't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night, woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, 'cause now she can't find the rent money
   
You thought you had my grip
But Too $hort never ever slips
You thought you had my cash
Until I turned around and whooped yo' ass
(trick beyotch)
   
I got family members, homeboys
Motherfuckers I look out way before you... </pre>
