Whassup?
Whassup why don'tcha get your feet off my couch
Have some respect when you come in my house
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) Y'knahmsayin?
Have some respect - did your mother teach you anything?
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) That's right
Kool Keith, yeah

Yo, I blow them girls back like power jets off my dick
You think you quick vic, then come display your whackest shift
Trickmaster, faster, asscrack, rectums after
Pussy stinkin, who brought these freaks yo, what you thinkin
That's on my downplay, your husband rhyme, and sound gay
With that fast talk, fast walk, ass is flat on sidewalk
Big hoochie intakes, digest shrimp, stomach pork
Your feedback, smoke weed back, butt naked we don't need that
Shut down yo' circuit, watch me kid, fuckin work it
Overtime rhymer, don't bite my shit, bite pirahna
Fuck rock'n'roll, never catch me marryin Cher and Nirvana
See-through skirts, burnin rubber sticks like fireworks
New York in 10-B, apartment house, where her friends be
Dykes with mics get played like Cameo the fuckin Chi-Lites
Problems I have 'em, that's right you motherfuckers grab 'em
Piss on yo' fish lens, disrespectin all yo' friends
Take my food back, your weave out, your fuckin glue back
Your hair in pieces, with just enough for chocolate Reese's
Beauty parlor, rings around, check your fuckin collar
You on some new shit, so game, I'm movin quick

[Chorus]
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) oh yeah
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) can I talk to you?
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) tryin to talk to you
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) can I talk to you?

[Kool Keith]
Psycho, still klepto, destroy them girls with reps though
Niggaz pause backstep though, I'm classical, bust asshole
Remember 'bout that last hole, you fucked up, you switched up
Ran up out the club, took that little cash you bitched up
Power strong, my gators long, feel cats, them pussies warm
On steam like dream team, peep game with face schemes
You make a right I make a left, sound def, my arts and craft
Fuck y'all, y'all make me laugh, raw skill with paragraphs
Cut ass so fast and have, express rock East and West
You fucked up, yo' rap is weak, that shit you talk and how you speak
You suck dick I pull yo' tits you wash where, I like yo' clits
Top to bottom got 'em movin, hittin screamin stop it man
Nasty with - game plan, new style - same man
Switch yo with swift flow, Bronx kid, I let you know
Alternatin bass and pipes the crowds in this fuckin place
Girls get glassed at mad, problems on they fuckin rag
Play tags with doo rags, I flame broil, light up fast
Girls look, jockin me, there's no time, stoppin me
Groupin me, hatin me, swingin G yo fuck it B
Technique that run street, like Celly Cel, I got heat
Upbeat, and offbeat, suck my dick, take yo' pick

[Chorus]
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) tryin to talk to you
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm tryin to talk, tryin to talk
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm really tryin to talk to you
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm tryin to talk, tryin to talk

[Kool Keith]
Styles rep from Northwest, shiftin, affectin wreckin
Movin on the channel panel, stupid bitch, can you handle
Observe words, niggaz got you cryin on the curb
Enjoy my tempo, rap style, fuckin simple
I heard your demo kid, ridin in the fuckin limo
Skippin your pause button, ladies melt, press rewind
You must be crazy, runnin game out your fuckin mind
Stylistic weaves, dirty spot stains on your sleeves
Like Beenie Man, turn the track up, girl shut the fuck up
My style is dope kid, wind it up, yes I'm open
Masquerade, Bacardi flip wigs, turn the party
Unique and speakin, shoes shined for the weekend
My style is pumped up, in time watch you fuckin jump up
Turn up yo' bump up, on stage bring the fuckin punk up
Open up hairpiece, music bass, turn the trunk up
Prepare for blasthole, up close, I'm in yo' asshole
Automatically, you stand there, you fuckin mad at me
Whippin yo' lip up, with verbal hits from yo' hip up
Stand back and guard crack, P watch yo' fuckin back
That girl is crazy

[Chorus]
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm still tryin to talk to you
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm tryin to talk, tryin to talk
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm tryin to talk to you baby
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm tryin to talk, tryin to talk
(I'm trying to talk to you lady) I'm really tryin to talk to you
(I'm trying to talk to you)</pre>
