[Intro: Jae Millz (Fabolous)]
You know, wutz poppin homeboy
(a millz wut it look like baby)
You already know haha, a c
(ha ha)

most hated(ha)
its the remix!
tell the dj to heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
(niggaz aint gone have no mo' bitches after this one)
heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
throw it out ma work ya lower back and ya spine

[Chorus x2: Jae Millz]
bring it back, bring it back
I said bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
I said momma heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
throw it out ma work ya lower back and ya spine

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
when it come to mine they be like buffy from behind
in the summertime its like the top didnt come wit mine
if I'm a dine wont be mckie d's number nine
ya seen jon a toa
wit a mean blond eatin green cause a chow
somethin clean on, see bling on from a miles
pair of jeans on neva seen on canal, baby girl I do my thing
I swing it back bring it back like a boomer-rang
its click clack and kick back when the rooger bang
my chick in pepper, gucci slipper stepper
philly spot baggin buddie out wagon
broad name jadera, hard to get near her
she can make a "Careera" shakin like shakira
arch in her back bone, like throwin back trone
even if she take it there she gone bring it back home

[Chorus x2: Jae Millz]
bring it back, bring it back
I said bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
I said momma heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
throw it out ma work ya lower back and ya spine

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
as the sun rotates and my account gets bigger
how many divas wanna slid wit this nigga name millz
one of what!, the new mayor of harlem
bring it back one mo' time the remix is a problem
say the convo I'm tryin to bring it home
and I still got my glock and a bottle of patron
new blue yankee izimiakee cologne
rich young hoodie yellow gold white stones
I pop some of america's top bottles
and play the top clubs wit american's top models
and you kno I keep 'em puffin the la
I call it the kanyevel they inhalin think they touchin the sky
tell me who you kno seein him my air ones premium
some more less, wont see to many others but me in them
and yea I bagged a groupie one, from the video
but really though she aint comin if she aint runnin the pussy so

[Chorus x2: Jae Millz]
bring it back, bring it back
I said bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
I said momma heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
throw it out ma work ya lower back and ya spine

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
monster music I'm a monster baby
fresher than the johnson in johnson baby...
...weezy baby, 80's baby
back when heroin was crazy baby(bring it back)
and they tell me I'm dope
you should pose mothafucka cuz I got you on scope
ice everywhere moma we can hit the slopes
you can get on that mic if you can hit the notes(bring it back)
by the way I gotta say
I got, hoes on me like I spray tag body spray
and shit on yo head now they call you potty face
put the barrel to ya mouth see ya to the shotty face(bring it back)
now wutchu gotta say
and I make 'em bring it back like a replay
and I make her run it back like a relay,
I'm fly, you guys, delay(bring it back)

[Chorus x2: Jae Millz]
bring it back, bring it back
I said bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
I said momma heel up reel up, bring it back come rewind
throw it out ma work ya lower back and ya spine

[Lil Wayne]
I'm gone......[beat fades out]</pre>
