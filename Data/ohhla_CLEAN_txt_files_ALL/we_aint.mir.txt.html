Shit gone talk, walk yo' walk, bring sniff, I'ma break you off
Shit I paid the cost, nigga where the raw, head not found above the law
Nigga though I walk, through the valley, of the what?, shadow of death

Best believe, we roll deep, ug thug till I d-i-e

WE AIN'T SCARED! (IT'S ON)

Alcoholic, weed head, shit label me both
I'd rather die, go to hell, if I could not toast
Plenty reefer I done smoked, 50 pounds I done sold
Well Aug thug tru to da soul, 20 years back and forth
Nigga my lips is black as fucking coal, think I care, hell no
Either kill, or be killed, what the fuck I been told
What the fuck, I been showed, keep that there, on the low
I'ma let ya'll niggas know, we ain't taking this shit no mo'
Girl I'm not, yo toy, real man, not a boy,
Ya'll niggas, saltine, I'm what?, chips ahoy!
Thug boy, Real McCoy, Miracle, fuck Troy
Told you, nuclear, best believe I will destroy
It's on!
