The following previews have been approved for all audiences
by the Committee For Audiovisual Sound

*sounds of traffic*
On the mean streets of New York, everyone has a crew
Now the music industry has one of their very own

*music starts*
Violator Entertainment present
The most thrilling trio since Three the Hard Way
Yogi, Chaddeo, and the Mighty Hah
The Cru

[The Cru]
Uhh, uhh
Can you feel it?
Uhh

Now once upon a time let's see if I remember
Back in January (nah chill it was December)

[Rich Nice]
Also coming...
In the Summer of '96 we saw Nas Escobar captivate an entire industry
Little did we know when he stepped through the door
The Firm he represented would be right behind him

	The kid got his own Firm, tch, de canta mari con Cormega
	Mamaow

From the most lethal conglomerate on wax
Foxy Brown, AZ, Nas Escobar, and now introducing
Cormega the Executive

[Cormega]
This how it went down
Add to undergrowth therapy, now surgery
A nigga wetted me but, he didn't murder me Dunn
I survived, he thought that I died
Now it's time to throw the nine clip in, mission revenge
Once was friends, but that shit's dead
That stupid motherfucker shoulda shot me in the head
*BOOM*

[Rich Nice]
And now for our feature presentation
TrackMaster Entertainment in conjunction with Violator Entertainment
Bring to you... Foxy Brown
The album

	"What the hell do you think I'm runnin here, a chicken coop?"

[Barry White imitator]
Foxy, the word's on the streets from New York to Cali
You're the one
But you gotta be careful
There's a lot of haters in the game

	"This bitch rose thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars
	 workin part time"

Ya know somethin Foxy?
You're headed for the top... top...
Straight ahead
And when you get there, you gotta stir it allll up
You see you're gonna make so much money
When you walk down the street
They're gonna think your pockets got the mumps
Can you dig it... dig it... dig it...</pre>
