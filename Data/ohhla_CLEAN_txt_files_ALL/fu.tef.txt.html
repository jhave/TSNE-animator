Let me find out its my time to shine - ninety nine 
Prime time is here - time for my props to shine - Premier
Load the track up - watch a nigga do work
Show his ass act up - wild out - blow the wax up
I can see it now, the cars, the bitches, 
The money, the jewels, guns - in my britches

[Fame] Hey yo yo Tef fuck that, nigga. Jump in they motherfuckin ass, come on

aight 
Try this one on for size - I won't be able to wipe my ass 
To rock shit so I'll just piss on you guys
Read the floorplan, we do it the double nine way
Crime way - duckin - goin out in a blind rage
Learnt to combine ways to profit - who can stop it
From pickin pockets - to doing stick ups - to kickin prop shit
We keep it poppin - whatever the way go
Long as they know that we here - reason is not a option

[chorus]
Yo Tef, can I get a verse?
Fuck you, pay me
Oh y'all niggas want more
Fuck you, pay me
Oh, y'all niggas want in?
Fuck you, pay me
We in nine nine bitch, this is prime time

Y'all niggas made it like that - I created tight raps 
Back when niggas was taxin niggas - to do a track
I show love - niggas just aint know how to act
Try to play a nigga like that - nigga dont know how to rap
I got news for you crooks - not only can I rap I got hooks
Not those hooks, the other hooks - look
Y'all niggas is fuckin with me - getting on my last nerve
Acting like y'all could do something with me
I throw rocks at hotties - throw glocks at parties
Throw shots of bacardi - col' rock a party
Some say what I convey be like the black monday
The rap runaway - Slap, put the gun away

[chorus]
Y'all niggas is just getting started?
Fuck you, pay me
Huh, beg ya pardon?
Fuck you, pay me
Y'all niggas is down with who?
Fuck you, pay me
We in nine nine bitch, this is prime time

Private Benjamin - please - I injure men - send yer men 
In to have a meeting with Tef - have a meeting with death
Lethal weapon - leakin n stretched - the fuck out
With his eyes wide open and his tongue stuck out
Y'all motherfuckers dont want it - straight up and down 
I let my artillery speak - from Brownsville housing through Tillery Street
Type of motherfucker thats hard to go to war with
Cause I got alliances with the niggas you tour with - so come off it
If you got beef with me - or M.O.P.
Believe you me - Ill murder yo ass - on MTV
You're fuckin with a lunatic that'll put 2 in you
2 in yer crew - 2 in yer chick - fuck coming through in a wip
I'm doing this red handed - nigga I'm a world class bandit
Rollin heavily armed on mass transit
To walk up and spark up yer whole damn strip
Give a motherfucker a whole damn clip
BITCH, this is from the ville</pre>
