[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4 bust it
Come on, come on
Juvenile, Wacko, Skip

[Hook]
Where that Melph at
Where the Yo at
Where that Thomas at
Where VL at
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap

[Verse 1]
I'm in the Calio, You know I'm headed front of town
By Chaotic and the Real One, cause it's goin' down
You see the DB's tell em' Wacko lookin' for em'
I got some dro, I got some change, I got some pussy for em'
If they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin up Chuck
In a chromed out bubblegum pickup truck
Slide on Josephine, holla at Lil' Kia and Pluck
My nigga Troy'll tell it, hey they keep it real as fuck
We goin' to House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington and Frerret, across the street from Babosca
But first I'm bout to snatch up all Saratogas
Head straight to Foot Action and snatch me two pair of Soldiers
Take a left on Taladonna get a oh of that doja
Terror night at my trial, I'll get them guards and let's roll up
I'm bout to hit Julio, let's get to blazin' some soda
I got Geezy waiting on VL we about to bang up the 'Yola

[Hook]
Where that Melph at
Where the Yo at
Where that Thomas at
Where VL at
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap

Where Hollygrove at
Gert Town at
P Town at
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap

[Verse 2]
I'm in Hollygrove searchin' for the Skip dog
H2 chromed out, nice whip dog
Let's hit Gert Town, I heard they pop it off
Or hit P town, I heard they drop it off
My couson Leaf from the Vill told me to swing through, on St. Lou
He got two hoes that'll eat and drink too
We can bounce through the Lil' Feat and we can fuck with these hoes
They take dick in they ass, they take dick in the throat
They take dick in they ear, they take dick in they nose
They take a dick, anywhere your dick can go
But look, it ain't nothin'  like my bitch out the St. Bernard
A gangsta broad, get Wacko gangsta hard
She said we might could run a train if I pursue my G
If not I got it poppin' off on Music Street
Last week I had to do about two of them freaks
But them niggaz through there be trippin' so bring two of them heats

[Hook]
Where that Appleville at
The St. Bernard at
Lil' Feat at
The 8th Ward at
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap

Where that Desired at
That Florida at
AL at
Cross the canal at
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap
Y'all hear that Nolia Clap

[Verse 3]
I see you learnin', see you peepin' out that Nolia Clap
I bet you nine times out of ten that whole Nolia strapped
OK, we fell off for a minute but that Nolia back
We got quarters, ounces, and halfs and birds of smack
Ever since Soulja got killed I keep a murder gats
Stand on the middle of my projects where the murders at
And every nigga, every bitch who ain't heard of Wack
I bang women, bang children, bang them murder cats
I bang blocks, bang cribs, bang the Burban Lac'
I bang anything in sight without the murda tats
I'm just the hit to represent where I was born and raised
And every nigga in my section love to roam with K's
You got beef holla at me, get it on today
You not quickly uptown, downtown Roulette
Knock off your face, taste, waist, take arms and legs
Drop off your neck, wrist, toes, hair, palms, and head

[Hook]
