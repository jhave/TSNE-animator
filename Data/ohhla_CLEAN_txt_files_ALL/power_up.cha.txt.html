Here Lizard, Lizard, Lizard

[Chamillionaire]
Uh, you already know

Look..lobster and shrimp on a deep-dish
Eatin' dinner while she strip
But who's gonna pay the tip? Me
One G keep this
Sike, me trick you wish
Can have any girl we pick
Twinky-Deuce under the ship
So a glock stuck to the hip
Chamillionaire, aww he sick
Man I swear that niggaz throwed
Me, 20 off of the road
Lew Hawk, belts, buckles and vogues
Am I a plastic surgeon? No
But I'll re-arrange a niggaz nose
When he drop I'll take his cell phone and call up that niggaz hoe
Whoa! flow cost ya know it
Foreign too large to tow it
Scared of the dark, turn on the neons cuz I'm flostraphobic
Get away spin a trey liquor they bought to po' it
What you think I spent 10 G's on my trunk, just not to show it
Open up stop and go it
100 G's got to score
My trunk is liftin' up and droppin' down like trunk popparobics
Ladies gon' jock? ya know it
Wanna lick cock and blow it
Platinum they got to throw it
Err, ways stop and slow it
Head spinnin' like a whirl-wind
Forgot, do I gotta girlfriend
Hot car? nah okay she can rock my whirlwind
Virgin's in the Burban
I'm bought my damn car from Satan
Cuz my tires is on fire, when I pulled up on the dayton's
Ain't no need for debatin' I'm the Boss of the Hoss
When the Super King, Koopa's seen, trick it's off with ya blouse
I'm bout to get tossed, by the nigga with the mouth full of gloss
Keep it tight get it right, it's the ...</pre>
