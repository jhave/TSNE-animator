Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Valet park my whip nigga
Hammer time for my chips nigga
(Bossin' up!)
Add it up, your girlfriend choosin' so you mad as fuck
Chillin' with my coalition nigga's rackin' up
(Bossin' up) A-Add it up
(Bossin' up) A-Add it up
A lil' Louis but my bitch wants some bags and stuff

It goes
Valet when I park it
OG when I spark it
Money speak when I'm talkin'
J's on when I'm walking
They fired up like arsen
You can't touch my garments
Up late nights pass Carson
Drinkin' large proportions of that turn up, juice
Got your girlfriend, loose
Checkin' that ass listening to Loup
Give a nigga all holes no loops
Give a nigga all brain no lip
I be at the ball hanging no grip
Pant saggin' of four fitfh
My security bullets like 4 inches
Get that shit like four ninjas
Did that shit for my nigga's who
Made it out the hood to the good side
Bossin' up with no tie
You heard it through the grape vine
And I was actually there, Yeah
It's clear who's been gettin' to the bread like Panera, ugh

[Chorus: repeat 2X]</pre>
