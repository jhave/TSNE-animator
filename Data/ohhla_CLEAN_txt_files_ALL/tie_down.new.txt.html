Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Intro]
Yeahhh (knockout) {KNOCKOUT}
(Knockout) {ayup} {yeahhh}
But she ain't gon' tie me down
{Ray J} Nah {New Boyz}
But she ain't gon' tie me down
{No she ain't gon' tie me down}

[Chorus: Ray J]
She ain't gon' tie me down, while you on the road
Buying all the shirts, all the hats, all the clothes
What'chu want right now? Whattup right now?
I think you need to close your mouth
cause you ain't gon' tie me down, tie me down
Tie me down... you ain't gon' tie me down
... you ain't gon' tie me down

[Verse One]
Ayyy, know we been together for a minute
But uh, its kinda been forever since we been in
the kinda situation not involvin other women
And it's pretty obvious that your kinda trippin
Like "Who the hell is this bitch?
Lookin a hot mess, what you fell for this chick?
You know we got problems and you failed to fix it"
I'm like "You need to go somewhere else with this shit"
Because, I ain't gon' put up wit'chu
Talkin 'bout how she make you uncomfortable
Like I mean, shit I'm only 17
And um a perfect couple is only in a dream
And right now I'm pretty much away for this
Relationships? I think you should wait for it
I mean later we could try things out
But not right now

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Ha ha, yeah, look
Ay girl whattup? No I'm not gon' make a scene
But you can't tie me down like a pair of shoestrings
Yeah you cute, so what? Girl let's get it through your head
Yeah we make love, sex, weed all in the bed
It's the "Best That I Ever.." but things gon' change
When I'm not faithful, you be feelin all pain
Now you stuck like a stain and I can't believe that
Baby girl 100, I ain't tryin to do that
Got so many girls and I ain't lettin go
Cause my life is great, and you ain't nothin but a hoe
Yeah you come to my shows and you very supportive
Just show me a camera and my show recorded
It was nice, but I'm suprised that you still standin here
As you know, I'm a man, and I have no fear
I'ma start it from the top, girl this ain't no lovin
I'm a New Boy girl so

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
