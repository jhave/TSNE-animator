Yo
One time for Heavy Management, Baja Pantie
Them 6 - 7 Boys

Welcome to Miami where them boys used to touch tourists on a daily basis
Duck charges therefore hardly caught cases
This is a city full of culture and different races
Where all the mami's come fully equipped at young ages
With the hurricanes cause even the biggest hurricane couldn't phase us
We got a dome for the Heat that put y'all to sleep
and we carry hits from night till morning
Like Marino strong armin' the game
but I'm not retiring till I got a championship ring
poppin champagne simple and plain
check the map and look where we at
the bottom, simple as that
I'm bringing it back to the fore-front
like Luke in the 2 Live Crew days
he's the one that's got these mami's going two ways
"Oye"
God bless Uncle Al but knowin him MIA was probably engraved
on the tombstone that stands over his grave to this day!
HEY
So if your visitin our city and your sittin pretty on duce tres
or duce fours watch where you park your whip
cause they will leave it sittin' on bricks awfully quick
"Yeah this is for everbody in Miami"
"Put them 305's up"
"It's about to get ugly!"
"Que Vuelta"

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Westchester and West Miami
where the heavy-weighters move to raise their families
South Miami always showed me love them boys from the Creek
Lee Park and THC knew me before PIT
South Miami Heights, Carib Villas
South Wood apartments the Square, Goulds, Naranga
them boys throw dubs on Bangis

Kendall got them mamis that taste like candy
OT that's where you can catch Piccalo hollerin 4 LIFE
When I'm downtown I check out the shoe gallery
cause Danny always looked out for me
Eddie from 24th Street barber shop, kept me out of trouble
I went from the waterboy to the quarterback in the huddle
callin all the plays I live for, die for Dade
I ride for, lie for, cry for Dade
No if and or buts about it, I'm from Dade
Watch where you hang out in the Grove cause you'll go from
havin a grand in hand to layin stiff on Grand Ave
I can't forget Liberty City and those notorious polka beans
and Scott Projects where nothing's clean
Miami's where we double the money
cause of course we triple the beams

If you live for die for this city
I want y'all to represent where your from and throw'em up. 3 0 5

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Welcome to Miami where they Hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon

Pitts that chico from the bottom
that's about to take over the rap game thats if they allow him
You know the city of Miami got the country spooked
y'all got Uncle Sam, we got Uncle Luke
Where the poorest city, according to census report
thatls cause they didn't count all the bricks that came through the port
Live by the code die by the code
so much cane done came thru this city we named 40th street Bird Road
Who made Opa-Locka? Who knows
All I know is you don't wanna get caught up in the triangle
after dark trust me bro, trust me bro
Carol City stays Cheifen, Hialeah Mango-hill them chicos stay beefin
Alapatah A.K.A. Dominican town dique cause there's nothing but Dominicans now
And to them little Havana boys that hold me down
bet that up, Wynwood put them up
To all the Haitians from Little Haiti that show me love
Sak Passe gracia dios ya llegue
Now I'm on my way to the top bringin the bottom with me
You got a problem with that then obviously you got a problem with me
Pitbull putting it down for our city. Miami

Pitbull M.I.A.M.I. tike to put Miami on the map
we on the rise M.I.A.M.I. nigga shat?

Welcome to Miami where they hustle hey
And they ride duce tres like everyday
Palm trees blue skies ganstas and goons
Where parties dont stop till the next afternoon
