(Where the party at?)	--&gt; The Notorious B.I.G.

Come on, come on, there's a little party over here
It's too hot, give my crew props, let them know I'm here
I'm shoutin out to everybody on the ave's who hustle bags
From Buckshot over to Kurupt and Daz
And the bully blocks don't stop the track
I rock in universal cities for the college frats
It's on like that, I'm 'die-hard' like Bruce Willis
And if Biggie Smalls comes this party is the illest
Where's the party at?

(There's a party over here
Yo - oh no
There's a party over here)	--&gt; Fam of Rottin Razcalz

Settin it off is Miilkbone, so everybody chill

[ CHORUS ]
If the party's liver
We're gonna glide through the night and morn'
Since the party's liver
Slip in those grooves and let's get it on

Throw your hands in the air and let me hear you say yeah
(Yeah!) and act like you don't care
It's Hot like 97, the cops are finally lettin
Kids kiss like 98, now it's that time for sweatin
So now ain't nobody gonna tell me how 
To make your ears bust nuts when I turn the party out
I make your girl bleed greed, plant my seed, it's agreed
That Miilk got the brand new flava that you need
So come on get down and tell me how you feelin
Sexual healing's waiting for you on the ceiling
And all you gotta do is just reach out
Let the beat ride, there's a party on the street side
Outside's helter skelter, here's the shelter
To help ya, cause this track's hot to melt ya
So everybody get upon down
Cause when I'm around and move with the groove it's the bomb sound
Where's the party at?

[ CHORUS ]

Now all I wanna know is Jersey in the house
Oaktown, Detroit, Chicago, Houston turns it out
D.C. could see me to Norfolk, Virginia
Spin to Atlanta and Keith Murray'll get in ya
I go 'round like Mary Mary jeopardy to double
My daily ??? are barely able to hear me (oh really)
Get your groove on with more tricks
Like on a Pussy Prairie in the Kitty Cabin at Fort Dicks
We ran a train like transit, it's gone, I got shit sewn
It's the mutha number one, the honkey Miilkbone
So big up to Big D and Uptown
Naught and Illtown, Heavy D spreads the love 'round

(Where the party at?)

(There's a party over here
Yo - oh no
There's a party over here)

Settin it off is Miilkbone, so everybody chill
