Typed by: c692286@showme.missouri.edu

I got Now and Later, bubble gum and sour candies 
With a trunk load of cookies like Amos and Andy 
Got the bud from Hershey and Mr. M&amp;M 
And me and Willy Wonka is old school friends 
It's the american dream 
On the triple beam 
Little Bruce got the bomb ass cookies and cream 
And I'm servin' more kids than Chuck E. Cheese 
And a german chocolate cake'll cost you 16 G's 

B-Legit: 
It's the big time billa 
Sucka side killa 
Real about the fetti 
No Ben baby?? 
Got a truck load baby for the hillside ride 
Bombbay all the way from the Bay we slide 
Through your hood 
Gettin' off our goods 
Fiendin' for a knot 
We put it in the box 
We got a brand new batch 
And we put in the smash 
Better get it 'cuz we sellin' out fast 

Chorus: 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
If you wanna ball please 
If you wanna stack cheese 
You gotta buy dope from us 

B-Legit: 
I got variety packs 
Hits so fat 
And that's platinum status 
I'ma let you have it 
It's on for a little bit or nathin' at all 
I'm going wholesale 
I needs mail from all 

C-Bo: 
Suitcase full of G's 
400SC 
It's the candy man with all the cream 
I put the candy on the triple beam 
The ziplock baggies 
Distributin' to the nation to have your whole crew cavied 
Now fools want to blast me because I'm ballin' 
'Cuz got more cream than 31 flavors at Baskin Robbins 
Slangin' thangs for 16 9 for half 
Got ya flyin' to the Westside to double up your cash 

Little Bruce: 
I'm playin' chase with the FEDS 
And got the DA's pissed 
They raided my spot 
Shot both my Pits' 
While I was in Atlanta smokin Swisher Sweets loungin' 
Countin' hundred thousand in the Lexus clowin' 

Chorus 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
If you wanna ball please 
If you wanna stack cheese 
You gotta buy dope from us 

Answering Machine: 
What's happening? 
You reached Sik Wid It slash Jive. 
Leave your name and number at tone. 
I'll get writ back at you. 

Playa, we at the All-Star game in San Antonio. 
You and Bruce meet us here and don't to forget to bring it. 

Little Bruce: 
I hit the All-Star game with a thang my back pack 
And on no train we rollin' nice ass Cadillacs 
The north star system on 100 spoke Daytons 
I smokes big with Reider and Gary Payton 
Behind the back door where ballers be livin' 
Transactions on nation-wide television 

C-Bo: 
I'm down to make cheese 
Slangin' straight cream 
In the land of milk and honey 
On a mission about the money 
Breakin' down in quarters 
Saran wrappin' acorss the border 
In my 500 Ben behind the '96 Explorer 

B-Legit: 
I pull the keys out my pocket 
And I started to G 
Bo-Loc back seat strapped down with heat 
Track after track 
Unit after unit 
Runnin' straight through it 
It ain't nothin' to it 
It's kind of like me sprung out on doves 
And when you buy dope you better but it from us 

Chorus: 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
You gotta buy dope from us 
If you wanna ball please 
If you wanna stack cheese 
You gotta buy dope from us </pre>
