(Lil Mo, JD, So So Def)

Hmm, yeah, yeah
(Girls back it up now)
Oh what'cha gon do, yea

[Lil' Bow Wow]
Around here we pop them collars
Around here we get them dollars
Every girl I see that look right
A nigga like me just gotta holla
This kid here all about stackin' up
Talk big head but we can back it up
Long cause everybody get crunk
When we drop in the club starts acting up
I represent the S-O-S-O, D-E-F-M-O-B
That's me, JD, Brat, and JE
So please believe
What I do ain't never been done
Ohio is where I'm from
I heard what you said
And I saw what you do
And y'all playas really don't want none
&gt;From the day to the night, I ROCK
Say what you like, NEVER NOT
Stayin' alive, living the life
Gots to keep it hot
Shotgun in the drop
Riding good, twenties, TVs, leather and wood
Poppin', watching Big Momma
Holdin' it down like a playa should
Sing-a-long now!

1 - [Lil Mo](Lil Bow Wow)
    Come on everybody won't you bounce with me
    (Check me out now)
    Cause a party ain't party unless you bounce with me
    (Girls back it up now)
    Ladies throw your drinks up
    Playas throw your dubs up
    Everybody let's get the club crunk
    (Everybody get crunk in the club when it drop)
    (In the club start actin' up)
    Come on and bounce with me

[R.O.C.]
(R.O.C. what'chu got to say?)
Its the R.O.C. of the B-O-dub dash
Double dub O dub
Throw your So So up and bounce with us
Baby the R-A-H-U-A
And blazing them with such amazing sh..
It's ridiculous
You know how we get
Just that baller clique
And we all be sick
Ain't nothing really for us to write a hit
The flow speaks for itself
Literally cause I don't even write it down
Like now, no pen or a pad
They say only the great ones do that
Everybody in the P-L-A-C-E
Wild out R-I-G-H-T
Now let me see you bounce with me
All the ladies in the P-A-R-T-Y
Shake your a** T-O-N-I-G-H-T
Let me see you bounce with me
Let me see you bounce

Repeat 1 (4x)

[Jermaine Dupri]
I, I, I wanna see you bounce with me now
Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now
Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now
What'cha gon do shorty, what'cha gon do, uh

Repeat 1 till end</pre>
