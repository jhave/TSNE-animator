[Intro: Ill Knob]
I get mad..
Ah, huh, fuckas
Fuck around with them niggas, yo
Fuck doing around here, yo God, I fuck you up dunn
Fuck you do, nah, nah, kill that bullshit
Fuck, fuck ya'll niggas, what, yo fuck all ya'll

[Ill Knob]
Klik Ga Bow, when I be rockin', niggas ask what's next
I get up in that ass worse that unsafe sex, cash checks
Respected in the game in DeNiro, Sub Zero, underground, rap super hero
Hey, whoever know me, know the Knob don't play
I roll through the ghetto like the M.T.A.
The three shades of black, Coney Island on attack
Got so much heart, shit fuckin' up my rib shack
Love for my peeps, stay away from the beast
The bird flies west, when the sun rise east, what?

[J-Boo]
My crew thorough, comin' through, reppin' Q-Borough
Viper spit poison, underground like the Devil
Burn your whole style down, to the next level
Blaze like the sun rolled the L, keep them mellow

[Adriatic]
I spark a Dutch with ten niggas, then smoke it down to the clip
See that's that bullshit, we empty the whole clip
And bet that every slug hit, Protect Ya Neck, the Klik
Ga Bow, pull it foul, major cheddar to rake
In the seed, by the case, wild thugs far from fake
I took off, playin' the crate, that rob out, we creep jake
Oh, that's a familiar face, narcotics all through the place
Increase the crime rate, and snakes tossed in lakes

[N-Tyce]
I'm not the average, the ordinary
All this money got my pockets havin' more to carry
Visually you see my rarely
I keep the profile low, the dope Cal' flow
The most style niggas, don't step if you think it float
I'm into men clockin' digits, men who ain't only out to hit it
What you doin', yo, I done did it

[Chorus: Triggnomm]
Aiyo, we fuckin' wit the shit fully
Deadly Venoms, what the dilly?
My team's real, Klik cock steel up in this battlefield
We bang wit calic-kills, operation: dollar bills
Paraphernalia's and bass, we make sales
Take it to the hells, niggas, we ring bells
Niggas, we ring bells, niggas, we ring bells

[Itchy-Fingas]
Don Juan status, Big Sha eliminate you faggots
With magnums, and cock cannons, load them up with grams in
And ban your man's in, from hustlin', my block bubblin'
You fumble the rock, but 8 is all you got?
My click wit stay shit, bitches leave you stiff with long dick
Or thirty years, a convict, you Sammy Ball niggas talk to much
I let you walk too much, and now my guns, you bust

[Naisha]
Aiyo, I'm top choice, then I blast where my guns are biz-at
Leave you like Betty Shabazz, then done surfaced the crafts
Up in the dynasty, take CREAM, supreme faculty
My lyrics bleed, so dance with me, Lord G-O-D
V-S-O-P, over night Chi, jiggy smellin' ice rock
Grimee bullets who pass me, hooded up
Long concrete, jew-els set it up
Cause stink mug, my brow blow like Jesus

[N-Tyce]
Yo, Protect Ya Neck, we rip jams to wreck your set
Bless the deck, and I'ma take all the money back, cash your checks
It's time for me to collect, sip the Henny's, forget the Beck's
Who rip it next?

[Pearl Handle]
It remain seen, I'm seen on many blocks
Thirty first is the first stop, the hottest spot for all plots
Who got the bank stop? Who spendin' 18's to amp you? Countin' his cheese
Ready to increase his gamble, spendy fifty's, larger then life, ya'll
Runnin' stop signs and lights, ya'll
Infinity white, potent like a demon that's keepin' me hype
We believe in keepin' it tight, tonight

[Chorus]

[???]
My, verbal linguistics, explicit
I'm the dopest, mad ferocious, malicious, ambitious
My relentlessness, and my exquisiteness, inconspicuousness
Leavin' ya'll faggots speechless and defenseless
It's senseless, cause my visioness is endless
Your timiniss is limited, it's evident, my excellence should be evidence
Spit extravagance, from my esophagus will get you stopped in this
That's what posse is, my click done rockin' this

[Champ]
Enter one, the swordstress on the rise
Pack the nine, keep the clicks hit by my side
M.M.O., my guns linger in the place
Klik Ga Bow, Deadly Venom, Pearl hold the ace

[Raheem]
Under summit, overly know it and you prove it
Metal-less, mega death wish, nigga rich, mission accomplished
InfaRed-ness, InfaRed'll cop beretta's
Blow holes through your interior, watch me bring it to your superior
It's scarier, delerier, we never fearin' you
K.G.B. shapeshift that splash your rover, drama mannequins
Always ready for action, rap bashin', Klik Ga Bow, upcomin' attractions

[Finesse]
Yeah, Chameleon'll soak ya dudes like shrimp scampi
Lampin' in the pit of the cut, leavin' who damply
Wet up, shut up, whoever want it
Representin' for my cous', we leavin' them hornet
Boo-yah, can't wait to do ya, straight through ya
At the funeral, to do who ya, never knew ya
Who care? Ya'll don't care, we don't care
What's fair is fair, bitch ass niggas, till we fail

[Chorus]</pre>
