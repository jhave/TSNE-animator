[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
"It's the Ol' Dirty Bastard" - scratched up throughout
Hold on, muthfuckas, ya'll know Dirty?

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
It's the Ol' Dirty Bast'
Cut ya face, with a piece of old dirty glass
Bitch, shake ya dirty ass
Run up in your stash house, on a dirty mat
It's the Dirt McGirt, a/k/a Osirus
Spread my bullets around like a virus
Nigga, from the Wu-Camp, nigga
Slap ya face with a wet food stamp, nigga
I'mma make the world, do my dance
Try to lock me down, but I'm back in my stance
Wave my gun around, like it's part of my hand
Bout to take this game, like, 'pardon me, man'
Dirt McGirt, I'm a family man
But I still hold tools like a handyman
Say my name three times like Candyman
It's the what, what, what...

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz (N.O.R.E.) w/ Ol' Dirty Bastard acting wild]
Cuz we can do it like this
(Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt)
Cuz we can do it like this
(Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt
Yo, yo, yo, yo, Dirt McGirt)
Cuz we can do it like this

[N.O.R.E.]
Who get drunker than, N.O.R.E., on a Sunday
And on the way to Sunday school, intoxicated
See ah, lord forgive me, I'm a ex-coke flipper
And skipped on that good ol' bitch, she got a strip of these
Niggas is bitch-made, I got a switchblade
And I pack guns, shootin' niggas since the sixth grade
Mac Milli, Millitainment, it's La Familia, now
Guess it's niggas all in your rap, ain't gotta kill you now
Nore never slack off, I smoke a pack soft
And I run deep in this bitch, and let that mack off
Bing, Nore got a whole lotta bitches
Out of character, and eating out a whole lotta dishes
In my lifetime, sippin' on white wine, caveza
Nore ran twiz, got a whole lotta cabesa
Ching, simple like uno, dos, tres, ah'
And I leave the crib, and grab the tech, cuz I'm the drastic

[Chorus 2X]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Oh shit! Oh shit!
Ya'll remember when me and Mariah
I'm back with the kid, spit fire
Dirt McGirt, I break up the earth
My ice is white and blue, like Papa Smurf
Stash niggas like crack, throw them under the earth
Then past the dirt pound, and ask 'em "do it hurt, now?"
Ya'll gonna make me back the truck
To the Dash, O.D.B., that's what's up

[Chorus]

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Cuz we can do it like this</pre>
