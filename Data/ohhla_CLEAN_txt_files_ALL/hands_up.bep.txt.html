Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

We gon' make you move, we gon' make you hot, hot
Elbows above your head because we holding up the spot, hit 'em up
We gon' get it goin' even if y'all don't be knowing, y'all don't be knowing
Cos this shit that we throwing get you going, go retarded
Started up, bangin' like this got me chartin' up
Didn't mean to bump ya, pardon us
Diggin' this cut cause we sharpened up
You dumbing it down, we smarten it up
We penetrate even though your guard was up
Get down to the beat cause we fallin' up
Electric cause we like charging up
We the B-E Peas, uh
Rhythmic sonic pleaser
Hit ya, hot like fever
Boiling two hundred degrees, ah
You're burning up
Heats getting low, let me turn it up
Let me fuck up your ear till my sperm is up
In your brain, and the baby Will.I.Am's be saying

Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

Tabamatic, full manual flows deeper than Atlantic O's
Apl De Ap got ridiculous flows
Catchin' rhythm, makin' them grow
Mathematic Apl will go
Up in the scene we original
You know what I mean, B-E-P mineral
Stormin' strong for the several
Baracade laid for you terribles
Ho, I'm the chief Phillipino
Letting you know we about to blow
Will.I.Am, Ap and Tab double O
Set 'em up, shut 'em down, get 'em up
Time for us to raise it up
Never going down, always heading up
Raise your hands cause we blaze it up
Anybody here who waited long
To you I dedicate this song
Ain't nothing wrong, gotta make it right
Straight to the point, this is the new joint
And you know this is the jam y'all
Come on down and dance y'all
Have a ball y'all, throw your hands up

Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

Black Eyed Peas will announce
Some things that you can't avoid
You need to b-b-b-bounce to this
B-b-b-b-b-bounce to our joint
We come with more than a ounce
More like a tonne full of noise
So b-b-b-b-bounce to this
B-b-b-b-b-b-bounce to our joint
We came to get ya, get ya
Bouncin' so get ya, get ya
Ass up we got ya, got ya
Movin', let's make it hotter
Hotter than molten lava
Bubblin' like boilin' water
Aahh, get 'em up

Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up
Hands up, coming with rhythms to make your head jerk
Hands up, we makin' our whole joint short circuit
Hands high, touch the sky, get 'em up
Get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up, get 'em up

Hands up, get ya hands up
Get ya hands in the air like it's a stick-up
Hands up, get ya hands up
The reason why they up cause we rip shit up

We the riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy-rah
The higgy-higgy-higgy-higgy-higgy-higgy-hah
The riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy-riggy rah
The riggy-riggy, riggy, riggy-riggy, riggy
Riggy-riggy, riggy, ri-ri-riggy, ri-ri-riggy
Riggy-riggy, ri-ri-ri-riggy</pre>
