[Andy Samberg] Oh dang
[Justin Timberlake] What is it dawg?
[Andy Samberg] I forgot it's Mothers Day
[Justin Timberlake] Didn't get a gift for her
[Andy Samberg] Other plans got in the way. She'll be so disappointed
[Justin Timberlake] Damn I forgot it too
[Andy Samberg] This could have been avoided
What the hell are we gonna do?
[Justin Timberlake] My moms been so forlorn ever since my daddy left
[Andy Samberg] Cold
[Justin Timberlake] No one to hold her tight. Life has put her to the test
[Andy Samberg] I know just what you mean, my moms been so sad and gray
[Justin Timberlake] Word
[Andy Samberg] My dad can't satisfy her in the bedroom ever since he passed away
[Both] Hold up!
[Andy Samberg] You thinkin what I'm thinkin?
[Justin Timberlake] I'm thinkin I'm thinkin too
[Both] Slow up!
[Andy Samberg] What time is it dawg?
[Justin Timberlake] It's time for a switcharoo
[Both] We both love our moms, women with grown women needs
I say we break em off
Show em how much they really mean
Cause...

I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each others mothers
[Both] Fuck each others moms
Pushin' that place that you came out as a baby
Aint no doubt that shit is crazy
[Both] Fuckin' each others moms

Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover

[Andy Samberg] I'm layin in the cut waitin' for your mom clutchin' on this lube and roses
[Justin Timberlake] I got my digital camera, I'm gonna make your momma do a million poses
[Andy Samberg] They will be so surprised
[Justin Timberlake] We are so cool and thoughtful
[Andy Samberg] Can't wait to pork your mom
[Justin Timberlake] I'm gonna be the syrup, she can be my waffle
[Both] Sho nuff!
[Justin Timberlake] My mother loves bubble bath with chamomile
[Both] Straight up!
[Andy Samberg] Give it to my mom d - d- d - d- d - d - doggystyle
[Justin Timberlake] This the perfect plan
[Andy Samberg] For a perfect Mothers Day
[Justin Timberlake] They have to rename this one
[Both] All up under the covers day

Cause I'm a Mother Lover
You're a Mother Lover
We should fuck each others mothers
[Justin Timberlake] Fuck each others moms
I'm pushin that lady
Where you came out as a baby
Ain't no doubt that shit is crazy
[Justin Timberlake] Fuckin' each others moms

[Andy Samberg] Break it down

[Andy Samberg] It would be my honor to be your new step-father
[Justin Timberlake] It would be my honor to be your new step-father
[Andy Samberg] While your in my mother make me another brother
And I'm in your mother I'll never use a rubber
[Justin Timberlake] OH!

Cause every Mothers Day needs a Mothers Night
If doing it is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I'm callin on you cause I can't do it myself
To me you're like a brother, so be my mother lover
They blessed us both with the gift of life
She brought you in this world so Imma sex her right
This is the second best idea that we've ever had
The choice can be no other
Be my mother lover</pre>
