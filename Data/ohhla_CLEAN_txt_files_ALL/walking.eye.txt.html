[Verse 1]
Sometimes it's best to give up the fight
All that really matters is I know that I'm right
I can't be following anyone else's ideal path of success
I pass up that stress, feel mad for the rest, gasping for breath
Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death, passion is left
Ashes to dust...
Just consider the love of an antique pot on my window sill
My mask is my flesh my dream is to grow wings
And sing 'til freedom rings
I got a rhythm but I'm eager to unplug my speaker
And let my heart be my teacher
It's hard to tell where all this comes from
It's like my soul holds a song that eternity left undone
But it'll never be finished
That's the point
I got to get going
Thanks for the inspiration

[Hook]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

[Bridge]
Sometimes, how close we get
From the way it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'm a run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

[Verse 2]
Now I don't care about my whereabouts
I'll clear it out, I got to go that's all I know
I'll hit the road and find my soul in the sin
They say there is no maybe please don't doubt
Conceive what you can be, infinite
That everything and anything anyway
I see your eyes and realize I need to cry
That you and I it's hard to hide
What's being lied so deep inside
Thanks for your help
But I won't find nothing better
In a world this beautiful
I'll be walking forever

[Hook]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

[Verse 3]
Journey I don't expect nothing
But the un-expectable
The only thing I know for a fact
Is that I'll never know too much about myself
So I'm a keep learning
Cause I'm determined to find the pieces fire-burning
Turning these pages just as slow as I can
Reading every single word from the poet within
I float with the wind and stay content
Wherever it carries me
There was no beginning and there won't be an end
I'm just a piece of the galaxy
A seed in the soil
A stream of consciousness
And to the seasons I'm loyal
Don't take my movement personal
It's not that I don't dig you
But I can't be on the beach
Of your sea when it boils
And so I walk with the music
Because to me that's all that's real
Don't know where I'm going
Don't have a plan
I've been hearing instructions my whole life
And I still think walking away from the rainbow
Will make you more of a man

[Hook]
I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

Speaking of walking, as I walked onto the set
The director was like, what the fuck you doing!
Glanced around and said, my fault I'm in the wrong movie</pre>
