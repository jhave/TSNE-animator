Let's go... {*echoes*}

Yeah
It's real right now, all around the world man
There's poverty, ignorance, disease
Yo you gotta come above that
You gotta pass the torch on to the youth
And let them shine through the darkness
Yo Design man this is crazy~!
Yo let's do it
Shouts to all the people in the Bay, uhh
Let's get dirty, uhh
Yo yo...</pre>
