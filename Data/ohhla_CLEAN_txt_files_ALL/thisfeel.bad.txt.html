Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Never used to like waking up in the morning
Because I always thought school was boring
But now that seemed to all change
And now that feels a little strange that you
You be on my mind constantly
And baby I will marry you, honestly
If I didn't have a ring on this lyric
Music got my heart, but baby you can have my spirit
Girl hear it, Here it goes, Here it is
We should get away and have a hundred kids
I want to introduce you to my mom
We double like seven and James, that's how we bond
Together, Fly together, Ride together
Let's be together for good and better
Yeah [x4]

[Chorus x2]
This feeling that I'm feeling (is love)
This feeling that I'm feeling (is drugs)
This feeling that I'm feeling (cause I'm addicted)
You got me lifted

[Verse 2]
Uh, I can't exactly explain it
This feeling inside it pain and
Day by day my love is gaining
I spun a bottle and now it's you it's aiming
Like can't you see girl?
We deep in love, like can't you see world?
Yeah, yeah

Ain't nothing gonna break us apart
Even if it does, you still got that place in my heart
You make a nigga feel special and shit
Take away all my pain, I feel mellow and shit
I swear you got that touch, Swear they ain't stopping us
Swear there ain't nothing above, Girl give me some love
Yeah, yeah, yeah [x4]

[Chorus]</pre>
