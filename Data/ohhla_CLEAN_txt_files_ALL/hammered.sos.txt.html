[Verse 1: Substantial]
Bring your crew if youre feeling them killing them with 
This past super lyrical, spiritual shit 
That bashes your physical to little bits 
Its that simple youll want a miracle quick 
No one ask you to spit but youre yapping your lips 
So I have to just smack you and thats what you get 
So dont get me started. I get retarded 
Only when shopping are you hitting Targets 
I wont stop till maggots feel your carcass 
With little or no effort Im ill regardless 
Get bombarded with this hard shit 
Only equal to a blow from Gods fist 
Oh my God its so obnoxious 
How I paint pain with words like an artist 
Probably at home right now eating garbage 
While my teams dining on greens and cod fish 
Doing squat lifts getting brawlic 
Giving pounds so hard that they tear cartilage 
Some may think what Im talkings a gimmick 
Till theyre cursed with a permanent limp wrist 
That goes perfect with your purse and lipstick 
Dont get murdered for perping on pimp shit 
You deserve to get hurt with a thin shiv 
And deserted while birds leave your skin ripped! 

[Hook] {X2}
Silly rappers think they really matter 
In a trance so they cant hear the laughter 
Get your mans bet them bamas get fractured 
Cause none of yall really want to get hammered and battered 

[Verse 2: SOS]
Get braced for school. You too basic to come face my crew
Battle ya like Gallagher actin like your face is fruit 
Movin to your ankles. True. This is my way of thanking you 
for preparing me to make me wanna try shanking you 
With a little bit of language juice, as I spit on your damaged shoes 
Turnin this room into a tanning booth 
Leaving everybody that we feel is unworthy cracked in two 
That's what me and Substantial do to bad examples of 
Hip Hop... Arms, legs, and heads, they all 
Get chopped... Fingers and toes thrown in 
Ziplocks as they drip drop... 
Caning rappers like a Pimp shop... 
With single whores in Singapore so forget props
Muthafucka you'll be lucky if you ever get shot 
To put you out your Misery like Paul did Annie I'm your daddy
Call for Mammy cause my next target's your family

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 3: Sub and SOS]
(Sub) Start weeping and balling the reaper is calling 
These weaklings for speaking Ill beat them and maul them 
(SOS) Crack your teeth and smash jaws and give ya momma breathing problems 
When I call and tell her you're asleep 6 feet deep in her garden 
(Sub) Thats right stupids now fertilizing her tulips 
&amp; lawn for trying 2 get it on when the kid was sweeter than cinnamon 
(SOS) toast... crunching functions plus attacking joints 
Wont... see 9-1-1 coming cause that's the point! 
(Sub)Battering Men, Shattering limbs because were badder than them 
(SOS) Brain, splattering them, damaging them all with hammers and pins 
(Sub) Die! You worthless serpent with no purpose 
(SOS) Sorry weak amateur flirting with hospital curtains 
(Sub) Ill put your once rowdy ass in a full body cast 
(SOS) Hit your little punanny ass like a tsunami blast 
(Sub) You shits call it quits like retired divorcees 
(SOS) Pissing on you kids, this is how it is now cause you forced me
