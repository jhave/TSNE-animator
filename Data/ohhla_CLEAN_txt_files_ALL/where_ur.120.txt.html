Nfamous - step, step, step, step, step, step, step up!

[Verse 1 - Nfamous]
Caught between a rock and a hard place
Nfamous, rock the mike and fill up the bar space
A car chase couldn't match the adrenaline, that we're sending them
And haters who talk shit, me not befriending them
Me not defending them, too busy ascending them
They lacks in like albinos lack melanin
Ventolin, couldn't help them catch their breath
I got bored waiting for them so I soared ahead
Now each tread is made, on pavement we laid
To reach the next stage, the pavement is grey
But hey! We're not in it for the checks
We do it for the love, respect
The cause and the effects we get from
Fatter beats, fatter rips, fatter matter of subject
To free your mind state, man there's nothing above that
Now wind the clock back, when it came to urban music, radio and then rock that
But now they're playing local hip-hop acts, it's even on the tellie
Coast to coast, it's got to grow steady so I'm ready
To boast the most or get spiritual hope
Cause hip-hop's a mind state, not an area code

[Chorus x2 - Nfamous &amp; DJ Peril]
From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

[Verse 2 - Nfamous]
Lyrics are my language, my ink stains canvas
I study syntax in my world map atlas
Looking up foreign cities and towns
New borders we got to cross to rock these crowds til they're
Bouncing to the rhythm we delivering
Announcing it god given like everything
Blast the pop critics who think we're pretending
When we give our heart to the art, spill it now he no billing
Peril: Yeah we gave blood for them!
Oh yeah, you know it man
And after the show, we stay around and say hello to them
Meeting new peeps that we never met before
Crowds that once stared now cheer for more
We've been booed at hits, we've been swooned and kissed
We've copped it all, we're not new to this
The future is, unknown but we've got to grow
Cause hip-hop's a mind state, not an area code

[Chorus x2 - Nfamous &amp; DJ Peril]
From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

[Verse 3 - Nfamous]
Hey all around the world there are people like me
Loving hip-hop renegades and sanity
From Aotearoa to Iceland to Ecuador
Aboriginal, Japanese, German, French, what's more?
Nations at a battle, separated by a war
Their kids connect over friendly battles on the floor
No money to go out when staying indoors
Trynna build a fat beat like you've never heard before
Constructing rhymes to bust the mind, oh!
In destructive times we're got to find goals
1200 Techniques started with nothing at all
Now we're onto LP number 2, on tour
The evidence is when the youth of New York
Created different elements and they travelled abroad
All the way to Aus, touching our souls, it shows
Hip-hop's a mind state not an area code

[Chorus x2 - Nfamous &amp; DJ Peril]
From the north, to the south, to the east, to the west
Come on everybody, go off, a go off
I said it's not where you're from, it's where you're at
1200 put the boogie in your body bag

[Nfamous]
Clap your hands everybody
And everybody just clap your hands
Australia, clap your hands
South Pacific, clap your hands
Europe and Asia, clap your hands
And plus the Americas, clap your hands
Middle East and Africa, clap your hands
Well Ryde, clap your hands
Ahahaha
