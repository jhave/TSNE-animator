[Z-Ro]
Niggas be screaming Z-Ro, how does it feel to be a ceo
But I don't know, cause I can't get a set of keys to the studio
And I know my fanbase is probably tired of me talking about the struggle
But since I resurrected time all the niggas don't want to see me bubble
Should I be mad at my friends, that's what Pac said
Although I clear my ruga ripping till they drop dead
I could a give a fuck about a buddy, he don't really love me
So there ain't no love for these niggas, there's only love for money
Paranoid like a defendant at a murder trial 
Plus I seen it everyday, but signatured in cursive style
Motherfuckers be tattle tailing like they taking names
So when they take a son they drive by I'll be taking aim
Pressure to pian, are you able to maintain, where the sun don't shine
On a daily basis I hear shots but H.P.D. don't mind
Cause they figure we'll kill eachother by 2000 and 2 
But fuck the streets jesus our praises due to you
only if they knew, this is my life

[Chorus]
This is my liiiiiiiiife
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife
This is my liiiiiiiiife
When will I get to bubble, living so shife

[Z-Ro]
Ain't no waking up in the morning because I'm still awoke
Previous past tense events got a nigga ready to kill folks
But I can't lose focus, got my heart set on heaven
But I was a problem child running wild, for a nigga with a mac 11
I keep my friends and enemies closer than a mother and daughter
They'll sacrifice you like a lamb that gets slaughtered, weaker than water
With they woman ass ways that's why it pays to do drivebys
Niggas be horizontal as I slide by
All night long, I'm paronoid voice mail beeping for days
Everytime I creep you know I creep with aks and hks
The motherfucking killing field is where I lay my head
And the place that I make my bed is where I spread my led
Motherfuckers be coming to get me in the middle of the night
But I'ma wreck his face when I put a infrared beam in the middle of his life
When will it ever stop, until they drop I can't get no rest
Cause those that also feel me feel well to the flesh, in my life

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Can I get a little rest, cause I can't take another test
Haven't I proven myself, so why do I feel like I'm that victim
I'm just praying for nothing and do the lord even hear me
Could it be that I was too inoxicated in the words for coming out early
Cause I've lost most of my partners, I'm losing family members 
I remember when it was love, but I'll be lonely by the end of Decemeber
I'm feeling bad, but I can't talk to my dad, cause he don't care
Plus I'm missing my sister but she don't want to treat me fare
All this sleeping from house to house, fucking with my dome
Got two album of my own, but no home
So picture the park bench in blood, is the night time bed
Ripping the whereabouts to murderers and many nights I fled
Practically assed out, lord for being somebody pull some cash out
The reaction is the rawest, but I dash out
Fuck everybody, it's all about me and my woman and child
Because my 9 millimeter because he helped to rob, this is my life

[Chorus - 2x]</pre>
