[Chorus - Lil Wayne](The Game)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare... Hah!

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Weezy baby, tell 'em we amazin'
Better yet a army, the U.S. Navy
Then tell Slim, I was raised on Cash Money
They can't kick me out of shit, I ain't Dame Dash dummy
I'm the (  ) pass a hundred in that red Ferrari
Me and Weezy Blood brothers, we got red Ferrari's
Red tops in the hood, red tops on Bacardi
Red tops on top models at the after party
Before S dot Carter was Brooklyn's step father
I was getting G money like Nino at the Carter
I was just a baby, like the face on the third Carter
Even had a baby face, like Tracy Evan's baby father
Nigga, so you know what I mean
When I say I get the money like a money machine, yeah
I'm in L.A. Gasol-in'
But when I'm in New Orleans, you can call it Chris Paul-in'

[Chorus - Lil Wayne](The Game)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare... Hah!

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
Okay, holla atcha blood
It's Big Dog Weezy, in that big dog breezin'
With the wig off, it ain't easy to go this hard
But Weezy go this hard, like pussy right in front me
I get pussy, I get money, I don't get none of ya'll niggas
Like two, three, I'm after every one of ya'll niggas
What am I saying? I'm ahead of all of ya'll niggas
And mine gon' shine like Armour All hit us
Hah! I wear that chopper like a uniform
You bitch niggas never see me like a unicorn
Who the boy make the girls go crazy
I got that Red Magic, unbelievable, amazin'
Hey, it's a beautiful day
I'm feelin' like the father of a sunray (son Ray)
Like Jamie, Foxx or box like Floyd May'
If the "weather" right, I play the red box Porsche-ay
C'mon

[Chorus - Lil Wayne](The Game)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare... Hah!

[Verse 3 - The Game]
(We in the house) like a home invasion
And this time I'm gon' shine like the chrome on Dayton's
You can wait on Detox or you can have more patience
Baby sip that patrone as we get wasted
Weezy-We sip lean, me, I just taste it
We be soakin' up syrup like a waffle house apron
Infa red beam go back to the basement
I'm a "Street King", ask dude from "The Matrix"
Yeah, Cash Money in the basement
Me and Slim like the Hot Boys with a face lift
Translation, it's Freddy versus Jason
Who your favorite rapper, me and Weezy will erase them
And if they gettin' money then, we will paper chase them
With beams that "Glow In The Dark" like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the Red Carpet at the VMA's bitch

[Chorus - Lil Wayne](The Game)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
If you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare...

(Sample from 2Pac's "To Live and Die in LA")
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be 
You gotta be there to know it, where everybody wanna see
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be 
You gotta be there to know it, where everybody wanna see
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA
To live and die in LA

[Chorus - Lil Wayne](The Game)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (We in the house)
If you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress</pre>
