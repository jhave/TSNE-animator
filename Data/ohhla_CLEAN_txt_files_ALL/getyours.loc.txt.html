First Verse (C-Loc):

Now as in my town, in your town, playas keep it locked
Let us know where the party at Fool, and we'll rock
Without a doubt, in and out, like that dank on the road
Let's turn the block, smoke some dope, and I'll show you the rose
I'm makin', sun shine on a cloudy day, you feel me nigga?
Instead of sittin' while I'm whinin' my life away, you haters kill me nigga
From a spot, well fellas dope sack, last night
Sell they soul to make it better than the last time
Hustlas doin' like Wally never be free
And you makin' million dollar plans without me?  Make it the last time
Bout my grind, hope to shed this life of crime
You know my kind, just like you, and fill me up and press rewind
I'll tell you, all them niggas'll get they time to shine
You get your neck broke or choked for fuckin' round with mine
Ya heard me??!!

Chorus (Young Bleed):

Get Yours!
Never holdin' up when I get it I split yours
Doin' what'cha wanna my noggin' cuz it's yours
Keep it on the low til' ya bubble and spit yours
You heard me?

Second Verse (C-Loc):

Now where the work at?  I leave the crime scene in a blaze
Can you work that?  Just broke yesterday, now I'm paid
Now it's curse Black, for fools that fake the funk in my way
Daddy bust back, and leave 'em lost in life like a maze
Now feel me flat you gettin' stuck up
And fools that 'sposed to blasted at me, you done fucked up
I ain't trippin' I was quick to put the clip in
You punks better listen
Now you started this beef, so put your lip in
Muthafucka spit the game above your neck, like a tech
Picture me, out the frame with them thangs and a vest
You know the rest
Down and dirty out there eatin' curly fries
Tired of spendin' my mornings tellin' my Mama don't worry
Cuz we gone shine ya heard me?

Chorus

Third Verse (C-Loc):

So don't get full of that whatever the fuck
And lose your mind cuz I'ma lose mine and tear this place up
Now I'ma tell you, this your chance
To stop the buckin' cuz you fuckin' with a mad man
Muthafucka came from late night to the spot, tryin' to survive in the game
And doin' shows coast to coast, sippin' 'nac on the plane
While you do your thang, I'ma do my thang on the grind
While you rack your brains, I'ma stack change so I can shine
Like that flashlight, you know the one the tags whoop you with
When it's late night, for tryin' to run and swallow your shit
Now I tried to do right, when I got out on the fifth
But I got in tight my playa partna needed a lift
Went and drifted in that lost World of playas and thieves
That's how you flip, in the ghetto when you tryin' to break free
From a family tree of hustlas, playas, felons, and thieves
When they tellin' you they gettin' it yo it's a dream
And here it is ya heard me?
