Song:   I'll Make It Up to You
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you

[Verse 1]
Dodging cops and police stations
Never home paper chasing
But baby girl I promise
(I'll make it up to you)
You put up with all my BS
You deserve that double VS around your finger
You see every king need a queen
With you I'll shall share my dreams
And I might not beat it up now
(I'll make it up to you)
God blessed me when God made you
That's why I take chances and I make moves
So a better life we can engrade too
Going hard is our order
But I'm barely seeing my daughters
So this is what I said last time I saw her
(I'll make it up to you)
Ye, daddy's little girl always
And daddy love his little girl all day
Every day you don't ever play with my fam
And these next few bars for my fans
And know it's like I faded off the land
But all my life
(I'll make it up to you)

Ye...
(I'll make it up to you)

[Verse 2]
All in no days off
Lord knows I hope it all pays off
I was made for the top like stake sauce
Go hard like I already made soft
Poke shit I create that
Cream on my mind like an azak
Bout mind don't mistake that
My girl barber she straight bad
My team bad, my team up
My team good that's an A plus
We smoke loud, we stunt loud
But we don't say shit, make sense?
Loyalty over royalty
The foundation that's the sort of me
Say don't bite the hand that feed you
Say I respect who employed me
That's the end of that story
I tell my mom I gotta say
I hate for us to miss holidays
But (I'll make it up to you)
Forever love you with my all
Spring summer winter fall
If I ain't there I'm just a call, a call away
I call my dates
I run the long scene in the go, just play
(I'll make it up to you)
Directed by the most high
I'm so enwind to my so fly
If I owe you one just know I
(I'll make it up to you)
(I'll make it up to you)</pre>
