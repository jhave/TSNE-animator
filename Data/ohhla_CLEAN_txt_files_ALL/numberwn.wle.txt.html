Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I don't trust no one
I keep my friends close, enemies closer, fuck both, I don't trust no one

[Skit]

When you strive for perfection
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction
I lost my connection with a brethren
Athlete mentality so fuck my competition
Me and him was homeless, maybe we still cool
But every time we book, we stay in our green room
Maybe it's on me, or brother it's on you
Or maybe its they fault that we aint holla since June
Fuck it we on the move, none of use tryna lose
I am out of this world and you a man on the moon
I'll meet you in the sky
Look this whole time, we was comin from separate towns to hold down
I figure this where my heart at
This shit has got my soul
I tell them niggaz picture me rolling I get the Kodak
If ya'll don't know ya history ya'll should look a lil' closer
I feel like Quasimodo with all this shit on my shoulders
They say this media changed, these verses gettin strange
Who you know famous and rich can say the same?
How can niggaz blame us, I am not ashamed but
I don't understand how this game made us strangers, look
Competition, for the love and anyway it go, they gon remember us
My nigga, its all love, that's how this shit be goin when you go for number one
We tryna be number one, number one, we tryna be number one
When you strive for perfection
Desire get confused and you could lose your direction
I lost my connection with my woman
I needed her support but she was thinkin bout a marriage, FORGET IT!
I know your love is the purest
But sexin without affection is necessary for some of us
Here's my heart you can hold it, I won't need it on this road trip
And I ain't tryna cheat so go head, leave me to my lonesome
GO! you free to go about your business
But if we back to business hope we resurrect the feelin
I'm a real nigga, them other niggaz fill in
The only girl I say I love you, and I'm not pretendin
Look, I got no time for that type of connection
Meantime, I hope you keep your vagina protected
Your friends say, why we not together yet
Sad but its true, but I ain't on ya level yet
Tryna keep a level head
Workin like a Mexican
Runnin this bitch, feel like I deserve a medal here
First placin it, wine wastin it
With all due respect, I cant have you in the way of it
Competition, she in love, and anyway it go
I'm gon remember her, but still
My nature, its all love, that's how that shit be goin
She vying for number one
Tryna be number one
She tryna be number one, she tryna be number one, tryna be number ONE!</pre>
