Break out the whiskey and a bottle of wine
Take your shirt off bitch, and chop me out a line
Dim the lights down low, turn up the stereo
Don't say a word, I already know

You've never done this before, but you feel like tryin', tryin', tryin', 
tryin'
I've done this plenty of times, and I know you're liein', you know I know, 
hey, hey

You want a shot so I will take aim
Don't even ask me if I know your name (say my name)
Don't look so shocked, do not be confused
I just wanna shoot your soul full of rhythm and blues

Them boys been sellin' your lines, but you ain't been buyin', buyin'
But what I'm givin' is free, so it's well worth tryin'

Because I know you like to rock n roll
You like to rock n roll
I'll rock you baby all night long
Then I gots to roll

Ohhh, ohhh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohhh, ohhh

There's no one left here we can blame, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a lonely walk of shame, I know, but first
We gonna rock n roll
Can you feel that, ohh, I can feel it
I said can you feel that, ohh, I can feel it
A little lower now, a little lower now
A little lower now, lower now

Theres no one here left
We can blame
Its a lonley walk of shame
I know
We gonna rock-n-roll
Can you feel that
Can you feel that
You used to like to disco
Now you wanna rock n roll

Bus is leavin' baby, we're pullin' out
Them Austin, Dallas, Houston girls are callin' us out
Girl dry them eyes, I'm not good at goodbyes
Tell all your friends I'm that type of guy

That'll bring out the woman that you've been hidin', hidin'
It's human nature to be what we've all been denyin'
Baby don't sell tickets to a player that's already playin', playin', playin'
Just be who you are, but understand what I'm sayin' (what you saying)

That everybody likes to rock n roll, they like to rock n roll
Rock n roll, they like to rock n roll
Rock n roll, they like to rock n roll
Love me baby all night long (rock me baby all night long, yeah, hmm)</pre>
