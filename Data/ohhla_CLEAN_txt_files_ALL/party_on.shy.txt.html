Chorus 7X: sample
Soon as the bass kick

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on 5c-75
Everyone's gonna be there I bet it be live
Ran home mad quick jumped in the tub real fast
Condition my hair, put on cologne at last
Iron my pants with my blue jean jacket
Put on socks black tops with a hat and three packets
Clipped my key to my pants, my dough in my right pocket
Fly lookin dip can't get even smoke a brain spark it
Take a bus now, I call up Newport cab
Pay up front says the driver cause he almost got stabbed
Pay my fee real quick, jumped out the cab real fast
Cut through the alley, oh shit I almost bust my ass
Ran up the stairs and just look what I see
Crazy dope cuties just starin at me
Put on my chump chain with my lucky go getter
They're whisperin and laughin "Uh huh he's a winner"
Feelin dope, like I never did before
Umm, thought for a second and I stepped to the door
Knocked three times before someone had opened
They said "Yo look at shorty yo he must've been smokin"
Shut the door on my face, the girls they say "Don't worry"
I said "Damn, I'm still ranked as a shorty"

Chorus 8X

[Shyheim]
There's a party goin on are you with me
Before you pay your loot make sure it's not empty
Cause many people be schemin for a buck
Watch out, pray for luck that you won't get stuck
By a mob or a crew or a Clan but if it's one man
Let the shit hit the fan
Cause ain't no way in this world I'm playin pussy
Niggaz better try to kill and ambush me
Blow for blow, hit for hit money quit
Before I have to do some old wild crazy shit
So I take the live and put it with the raw
And score and draw mad blood from a whore
Then I burn an MC up like a burnt english muffin
Brothers always puffin in but ain't sayin nuthin
To a smooth brother Shy on the slippery script
For me to flip up and kick like a kung-fu flick
Polish MCs like Griff and offer up an alibi
High like Tone-Loc keep you horny like Spanish Fly
Clip up a whole new click with Mr. Clean
If that don't do it I get on the reverend Visine
And still come off on the top so you drop
Now I rock the parties non-stop
Hickory dickory tickle me - stop
Shyheim came to rock this spot
Hands in the air as you dance to this jam
In command hot damn the kid who slams
Up a party and steals like to star G
Used to body but now I'm pumpin hotties

There's a party over here (All that, all that youknowI'msayin)
Party over here
