[Juelz Santana]
Come on!
Jim Jones where you at baby?
Juelz Santana (I feel good right now man)
This is music right here
Once again where you at
I feel like Rocky or something
They try to box me in the corner 4 the longest
No keys, lock me in this corner for the longest but
(I'm Ready, I'm Ready, I'm Ready, I'm Ready)
Somehow I managed to creep from under the rock
Linkin' up with Cam and linkin' up with the ROC now
(I'm Ready, I'm Ready, I'm Ready, I'm Ready)
This is powerful music I bring to the table
The sequel to Able the way I slag Kane cause
(I'm Ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Y'all know I'm past then focus, incase you haven't noticed
Squeeze and blast them open as soon as the magnum open
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
Cam gonna make me star, I'm gonna make him a million
Jones is here, we invading the building and
(I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready)
I'm still on the corner grinding for them big stacks
Big coats, big gats don't ever forget that

[Jimmy Jones]
Yes sir, Yes sir
Oh yea nigga
My goal (??) the one on your charts
If it happens to be a (??) come with the arts
Everyone of my parts they still moving'
Hold the drums in front of the
I do this shit six lucky contestants
They don't give a fuck if you sixty
Still get coifed and arrested (click clank)
My justice is reched
You get knocked
Please, grab your crouches
Keep steppin'
Cause the game we done held back to long
The pain we done felt that to long
Cocaine we done dealt that to long
And my pops it don't help that you gone
Myself to move on
Its scary and I'm gonna need help
Streets flow at me
Dog marijuana don't help
Fiends junkies in the corners don't help
Knee deep in my grave on these blocks
I'm a goner my self

[Cam'Ron]
Killa, I'm here y'all
I'm ready, I'm ready
Hey yo
Was up buzzin' buzzin'
Birds flip a dozen dozen
Holla at your boy
Boy thought your cousin wasn't
(I'm Ready, Yes sir)
Jimmy Jones, Sessa Bones, Santana, Manefik
Y'all niggaz know holla at me if there's any beef
(Yes sir, gats, guns, knifes)
I know its vic versa
We like murder we convicted the track
But yo if you got bitches to fuck
Hit me up dawg
(Yea I'm ready)
Far as lyrics go
They rocking the citlets
They won't stop till I'm on top with the title
Hustlin no stoppin the cycle
I'm shopping for rifles I'm not for the idols
The twin towers dawg we on top of the Eiffel like
La piece a pizza eating a piece of pizza
You can't be where I be dawg
You need a Visa
Come on chief we for
Please believe it
I will squeeze and leave ya
All bullets stay where we can seek ya
Harlem world I'm spoil my town
You a clown you can't tell by now
