Hook: Bizzy

Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily,
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily,
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily,
[Bailin' for safety we make it and chill]
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily,
[Bailin' for safety we make it and chill]

Verse 1: Bizzy

Really be off and inna the coffin
And uhh, follow his grave,
Follow me murderous guage
Follow me murderous ways
Steadily pumpin' as me killas kill ya
Pop more ah silencer,
Pop pop outta the window we roll
Let the Ripster reel up off 'em
Better of this way,
Tossed off in the coffin and bagged,
Slang on the darkside man,
Bang on the darkside man,
Land ah the thuggish ruggish city will it reveal,
But I went back to my land wid ah 12-guage Mossberg pump
Big shells, you bloody murda murda comin' ta serve ya
Runnin' wid gangstas that's suppose
And to rip the roads is how we roll

Verse 2: Krayzie Bone

Cause it's on and I crept and I came up
Remember that killa the nigga named Leatherface
Now if you ah thug nigga pick up ya pump and buck it
Put ah bitch up in the gutter fuck it,
Nigga we judged and we fucked and we shuttin' this rap thang down
Neva takin' no shorts or losses man
No way no how no foul thang now,
I steadily thinkin' and then if I changed my daily thang
Nigga don't hang wid the phony busta niggas,
Only roll wid thugstas killas
Pick up me gun and me stick and me stuck
And me murda them everytime now,
Bodies be dumped off in dumpstas execution double nine style
Hey, say give it up to the niggas
Who steady be slangin' that llelo, bank-roll,
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low,
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low,
When the po-po roll that's when you lay low

Verse 3: Layzie Bone

Nigga shoulda seen the Bone done came and touched down
Came up wid that thang and me creepin' up outta me hometown
Me hate to be leavin' the glock glock nine
But I'm livin' so low down Bone gotta roll out,
We livin' like Trues,
Give it up to tha bang, always stay down for my thang
And I still remain the same,
Never gon' change I'ma hood I claim,
Nigga done jumped in the game
And straight up confusion cause niggas be shady,
Nigga still gotta watch his back daily
Even mo' lately, but they can't break little Layzie,
So ah nigga stay phat cause I gotta get paid
The buddah it run me forever me blaze
Thuggin' in my murderous ways
Crazin' ah guage let the buckshots spray
We shoot to this day,
No shorts or no losses was meant nigga now play (Bottom line niggas)
And Cleveland in yo face,
And nigga we rollin' wid Ruthless in the nine,
For the pain for the gain,
For the love of money fuck the fame
We peeped game we crept and we came

Hook:
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
[Bailin' for safety we make it and chill]
Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
[Bailin' for safety we make it and chill]

Verse 4: Wish Bone

Bone crept and we came wid ah gang bang
Told you get down for them thangs man
But Bone still kick it wid the same Trues
Thuggin' on the glock glock ain't shit change
Buck 'em fuck 'em put 'em in the ground way down, lay down
Busta, nigga don't be tryin' no dumb shit
Bone still be pumpin' them daily slugs at ya,
Creepin' up outta the hood,
Rolled to the West Coast wid this rap shit nigga made good
Thinkin' on the nine-nine reachin' for my nine
Reachin' for your shit wish you would,
Pumpin' them slugs, put 'em in the body bag
Nigga down fo' yo cash nigga that's yo life
Nigga it's like that when my shit clap
One to the temple straight to the mind
Bailin' down the Claire gettin' much love, needing mo bud,
Gotta sell me some dum dum smoke
Me meaning that yum yum dope
And it ain't shit to swang some thangs
Puttin' my guage in your throat

Stalkin' gat fools walking jack moves
Ready ta pap you if we have to daily
[Bailin' for safety we make it and chill]

Verse 5: Flesh N Bone

Ah nigga stay down for my thang bang
Sendin' me bullets up in the brains ah the bustas,
Hustlas so nigga never trust us we the muthafuckin' thugstas
Strugglas 12-guage pumpstas, takin' no shorts or no losses
Nigga the fifth dog, no tame swang (gotta get mark)
Insane, so many hoes done took ah loss,
Nigga get tossed by the boss
And I'm off the hook when I put it down Bone,
Wanna fuck wid ah thug ya wrong,
All around they lay when I spray that chrome,
Bullets they fly, niggas they die
I'm coming up willing to ride got mine
East ninety nine off inna that crime
Where the thugstas find they time to grind,
Droppin' ah dime, packin' ah nine, and ready to bang
Pullin' the triggas to blow out ya brain,
Bone gotta gain man we crept and we came
We crept and we came
We crept and we came
We crept and we came.......
