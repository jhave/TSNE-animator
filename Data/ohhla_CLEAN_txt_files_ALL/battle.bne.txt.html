[Verse 1]
I suggest you cut the game niggas
And all that flossin'll get you killed in the field
Thats why I'll be bringin the pain niggas
This heres a battle kit and alot will get you caught up in some drama
Better what out what you say I know some niggas that'll do your mama
I'ma hittin it from behind till the day I expire
Heatin it up and bringin the fire you can see it in my eyes
Thuggish ruggish out of the door
From the Bone Thug to the Mo
Drug dealers in front of the store
And all of my niggas in the graveyard
Stay hard R.I.P.
For all my niggas that run the street
I'll be smashing beats and representing y'all
And I'ma ball till I fall to the north call
Ain't takin no shorts or losses general nigga platinum ball
I came with rollas of bowlas when I hit the scene
Nothin but warriors on my on a mission for everthing bling bling
Gettin snatched lay down in a wrath
Nigga meat you in the streets lay yo ass on yo back
Plat nigga dig that
Lil skinny nigga bout it
Think you can fuck wit me I doubt it
Hit you up wit heated flames

[Chorus]
On my moma
I'm a bring you drama if you pick before dishonor in the battlefield
Nigga we'll put them flames on ya
(Repeat 3x)

[Verse 2]
Nigga fuck what you doin, nigga I'ma bout to ruin
Nigga the image and the style that your used to
I'm chin takin these motherfuckers poppin it off at the lip
Been talkin that shit since 96 disrespectin my clique
But I'm like pac motherfucker I'm a bomb first
And like I do you in the first bitch I'ma put you in the hearst
I'm lettin the whole world know it
If you want me come get me
We got the AK and the SK
And I buck it till its empty
Lock N load it cock it and expload it
Throwing your grid thats how I feel
Keep it real or I'll have to kill
Fuck them Do or Die niggas
Yall bitch ass niggas can't do shit to me
Put your fist up and the swords fake ass niggas aint had no victory
When I see niggas retreated
When you see me I'm heated
Hows you fuckin ready to release it
Keep it them niggas defeated
Bower down motherfuckers better leave it alone
I'm bringin the thug world order nigga the war been on bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you got beef with B.O.N.E
Then holla at me lil Layzie, the bad boy of bone
And I'll be thuggin till I'm dead and gone
The nigga been in the zone
Livin eternal through my song right or wrong
Whatever the case my niggas call me I'll be runnin
Niggas always into something
If is robbin nigga I'm down for retalation is a must
And cause I truck to bust my ammo
Leave a motherfucker dismantled
Come throw like ramble
Nigga you capsule
So many of us all miss you
So in the war we searchin for victory
Click to heat its bloody meat
Tryin to eat out here in the city streets it's a hustle
I never let these niggas knock me off my mission where's your muscle
Bust yo ass shut the fuck up and listen
Nigga the problem every nigga got their know
Gotta make their business
Tryin to be a Menace like Dennis, we'll stop y'all
Fuckin wit a top dog I mock y'all
Off your feet got your bitch like a food stamp
Aint graduate from boot camp
Fell off into salute champs
Well strategize and open up yo eyes 
And recognize the drama
I promise to see demolish
And any nigga that just ain't follish
And when god is the war ain't no women army
Mo Thug family Bone Thugs N Harmony
