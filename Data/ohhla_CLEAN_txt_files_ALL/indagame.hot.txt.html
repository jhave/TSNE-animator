"Hey wait a minute
Now we're in the business of runnin hoes"

Red Hot tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Big Daddy tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Rich Nice tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Red Hot tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)

[ VERSE 1: Red Hot Lover Tone ]
(Check it out)
It's the players ball, all in all
I'm pimpin em all, big, small
Short or tall, yes yes y'all
What's your name, dear, I don't recall
Maybe it's 'Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you' - nah, that's L.L. Cool J
Hey-ey I got a million and one things to say
Mackin till I'm old and grey
Ay, don't come my way
If you're expecting foreplay - okay?
Drop your Jabose, baby, I suppose
Bitches ain't nothin but sluts and hoes
Good for a segment
Gottta keep em barefoot and pregnant
And give em a mackin
For overreactin
Still don't know your name
Young players are lame, I wrote the rules of the game

Big Daddy tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Rich Nice tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Red Hot tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Big Daddy tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)

[ VERSE 2: Big Daddy Kane ]
Lookin tall, dark and handsome over there, cleaner than the Board of Health
Go on Big Daddy, with your badself
Makin money off a lady every night, each hoe never brings in less than 80
You know what I mean, baby?
It's easy to control a woman's body, that's fine
But the key is to control a woman's mind
So at the players ball y'all all know who the winner is
Cause my game is stronger than stainless steel Genesis
So what you're doin, kid, pimpin or simpin?
Mackin or slackin, are your girls cruisin or choosin?
Your true identity is being exposed
'Shade-tree nigga, you a rest haven for hoes'
So ladies out there, if your life seems destroyed
Come check me out so you can be employed
Because the corner full of women over there I'm to blame
Pimps know my name cause - I'm still in the game

Rich Nice tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Red Hot tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Big Daddy tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Rich Nice tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)

[ VERSE 3: Rich Nice ]
Now I can tell the flavor from the stench of the aroma
Once I bone her honey's in a coma
The Mack in your Roni and I'm smooth as Pretty Tony
Ladies all call me the young brown Goldie
Cause I can talk the drawers off a mannequin
Not even Father Flannagan could save that ass once I begin
'I mean you gon' love me like candy
I'ma be everything to you - understand me?' (Yes Daddy)
So all you macks tryin to test me or maybe impress me
Snap out of that shit, it ain't sexy
I put pimp in your limp, cut in your strut
Ain't nothin funny
Just get me my money
I mean you know how I run my game
Ain't nothin but a little shoobie-doobie when I start to do my thing
So if you see a player walkin and your girl starts sqwakin
Shut the fuck up when grown folks is talkin

Red Hot tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Big Daddy tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
Rich Nice tell me are you in the game?
(He's in the game, baby, he's in the game)
