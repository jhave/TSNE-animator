[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
When I'm sexin' you
When I'm next to you
I know
It's alright
It's the things you do
Make me cling to you
Cause I know
It's alright

[Queen Latifah]
(Verse 1)
There's a special way there
You do what you do
Anywhere and anytime
You're not an ordinary lover
You give me good times
Get me so satisfied when I'm

[Chorus]

(Verse 2)
I'm overwhelmed by the way that you handle
Cause I've been down for a little while
I got experience
To know
When it's this good
Everything, everything is alright

[Chorus]

[Queen Latifah]
It's alright
It's alright

[Bridge: Queen Latifah]
When you're near
I don't fear
I feel so safe
And secure
You feel good in my arms
And I know that you are
You're the one for me

[Chorus]

[Hook: Queen Latifah]
How do I know
You'll never go
You've got to be
Someone for me
I always wait
That you will stay
Cause, baby
You're the one

[Repeat Chorus &amp; Hook Til Fade]</pre>
