Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Okay I want you players to collection plate around
I want you players to collection plate around
And I want all you members
To put all of your weed on the collection plate
And pass it on up to the pastor
And I'm gonna use it for a very worthy cause
I'm going to distribute among all the hypes
And we gon all stay high
Woo
Can I get a amen for the weed?
Damn right
Now I want, I want em smoke the weed
Can I get a amen for the weed?</pre>
