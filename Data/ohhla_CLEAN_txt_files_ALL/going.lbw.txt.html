Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Going, going, going, I'm going
Keep the barbers in, but the club open on my key
Going, going, going, I'm going
Said she pulling bad bitches in her head
All these hoes going, going, they're going
Caught up on the cush in the club, so you know a nigga blowing
I'm blowing, I'm blowing, I'm blowing
And this jury got me going, you ain't going hard, locked up nigga going

I'm going hard on boulevard, wrap my rench and been out of park
They don't ride around my kill, feel free change, that's over kill
Rocks that's deaths on drugers charge, marley's, that's my favorite peer
Oh, boy, they start making noise, Gucci Mane, be making skills
Loobers lock a trampoline, blind on girls on limousine
Gucci Mane, a common king, your baby mom's a drama queen
Keep that shit behind the windshields, till the smoke behind the switchers
Hit that club behind the pitchers, ask it hard to marry, nigga
Marry, I'm a diamond bells, bells that look like mass umbrella
Putting bottoms on your bitch and now she lost like she Cinderella
These labels dead, they're cooling off, wish they stay, they hide the zero
When they're two years and over crystal, hope that bitch don't die at distant

Going, going, going, I'm going
Keep the barbers in, but the club open on my key
Going, going, going, I'm going
Said she pulling bad bitches in her head
All these hoes going, going, they're going
Caught up on the cush in the club, so you know a nigga blowing
I'm blowing, I'm blowing, I'm blowing
And this jury got me going, you ain't going hard, locked up nigga going

Lock into the bed, tell 'em I'm cashing out
Who came writing on their checks, too large I'm filling out
Pull out the 'rari, that's three eighty
I'm riding in the air and I'm strutting crazy
Got a bad bitch, it's shot to stay up in the cave
She suck me good and then she count my paper
The fuck you're hating niggaz, 'cause we're shitting on you
Like I can give a fuck 'cause all the bitches want
Temper motives is a hundred a show
Who got it, we light up the drow
My nigga douce, I pour it a floor, try to see how low I can make this bitch go
My niggaz don't talk shit, they just aim at your yankee feet
Call her over, I fuck her once, I keep her out and don't call the bitch

Going, going, going, I'm going
Keep the barbers in, but the club open on my key
Going, going, going, I'm going
Said she pulling bad bitches in her head
All these hoes going, going, they're going
Caught up on the cush in the club, so you know a nigga blowing
I'm blowing, I'm blowing, I'm blowing
And this jury got me going, you ain't going hard, locked up nigga going

Now I fit in stacks, I blew it on at nine
Said she from Memphis, said she hating on the Marley
I'm in the club with all my jewelery
And now with all my niggaz, I don't need security
Back seat of my fan and all my seat designer
All about getting money, I'm building my empire
I'm making no money, 'cause the time's now
Not your man, I'm Bow Wow, nigga, blame blow
From the deep south they never seen no game outs
I send them nuggets in your spine, they come to clean your house
This is south side, got a mean bounce
Bad bitches in my suit, they got a mean mouth

Going, going, going, I'm going
Keep the barbers in, but the club open on my key
Going, going, going, I'm going
Said she pulling bad bitches in her head
All these hoes going, going, they're going
Caught up on the cush in the club, so you know a nigga blowing
I'm blowing, I'm blowing, I'm blowing
And this jury got me going, you ain't going hard, locked up nigga going</pre>
