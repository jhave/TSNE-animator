Verse 1: (?????)

This is how I want to spit it
I bullshitted in the eighties(Forbid)
I had to get my mind up off the ladies
Like these wordly things, A baby beam and shiny rings
See this is how we do things when you're fuckin with the kings 
Of the streets
New York is all respected
But still we keep it hectic
In places where we be wreckin
Where we from, Timbaland(VA)
See thats my man so understand these things
Three niggas thinkin bout cream
Me and Magoo, Ya'll realize we roll with CRU (Huh)
All respect to, That's why your girl ain't lovin you
We peep the card in the steez
We even got the keys to the bed where you rest
Your life is based on stress
So just relax kid because my mack days are in the mist
And you ain't got a chance like Sharon Stone on the Last Dance
It's easy past, when I'm runnin wit your lady
Ask yo boys, I'm pushin your Mercedes
So what nigga

Chorus: (Timbaland and Magoo)   {Magoo} (TImbaland)

Verse 2: Magoo
Dick em, Court VD, Now I'm sick wit em
Ate a pack of cheese now I just bullshit wit em
Kick em, Nigga when your down, Look I got to get cha
Get away wit the crime, that's the wrong picture
I'm in a zone like a teen on a phone
H-I with no V, but I stay full blown
Hah yeah yo, Put nick out the door
You move quick but bitch, yeah your too slow
Get on your knees like a dog and scratch ya fleas
Somebody on the phone want to talk to your (???)
But I got my life and Mary what's the 411
Niggas get shook when I rhyme, You best ta fuckin run
Get out the way cause my recitals suicidal
I'm the rebel when I yell, Ya'll know, Ask Billy Idol
Son of a bitch cause he a son and yous a bitch
Me die for you, girl go dick your own bitch
