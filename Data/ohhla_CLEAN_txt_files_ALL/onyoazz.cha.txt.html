We some real muthafucker's, real muthafucker's, real (what you gon' do?)
Real muthafucker's, real muthafucker's

[Chamillionaire]
Koopa..
This is the day that they dreaded, they say Chamillion don't let it
get you upset, I'm upset if you needin' peace, you can forget it
Go tell them the villian is comin', they know I'm the realest that run it
Color Change guerillas gon' run it, you gimmick niggaz better punt it
Now it's too late, you don' done it, no stingy label can rape me
Let's see how fast you apply since you thought I was gettin' lazy
The hood don' told me you shady, but you don't know it yet baby
They told me everything about you, even know the name of yo lady
Ay didn't ya girl go to J.V., guess what I went there too baby
If you thinkin' I can't expose yo ass worse then this then you crazy
Yo own hood don't even like you, they like "Chamillionaire is gravy"
Niggaz like Rock-A-Bye baby, cockin' .380's on the daily
Yo best bet's on baby, ain't gotta call the hood baby
My heater heavy I feel bout 50 pounds more then I weight see
fam and the niggaz don't make me, since you don't make me, can't break me
My crib $250,000 I'm livin' in housin' and payment
I got the Vegas in maitenence, thought you was makin' lil statements
Showin' yo crib like you ballin' big, I was killin' em' with patience
Them pussy niggaz can't face him, they wanna erase him like Jason
But now they shakin' and pacing, like how the hell we gon' face him
I can't believe that you doubted me, while you was talkin' down on me
You ain't realize the people that you was around was all down with me
But I won't say no names, no trace of snitchin' inside of me
But I live by the G-Code, and you don't live by the boundaries
-Get Him!</pre>
