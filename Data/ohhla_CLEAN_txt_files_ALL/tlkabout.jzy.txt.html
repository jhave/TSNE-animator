I got this busy a dime, I told that girl you a block
The way that brick locking up
I say you must be a cop, hey get that light out my face
I said that must be my watch, you should see me at a store
That shit is something to watch, I said you fucking with slope
You know I put on a show she wanna give me some head
I said I take mine and go, he say he ain't got my bread
I said I take mine and blow, nigga you heard what I said
I said I take mine and snow, so now she rolling with me
Me I got off a Scrilla, she spill that drink on my seats, yeah you know I'm a kill her
Ain't talkin' bout haters, ain't talking bout snitches
What he talkin' bout nigga? nothing but doping these bitches

Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches
Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches

Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches
Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches
Let's talk bout doping these hoes, doping these hoes, doping these hoes
Nothing but doping them bitches

Bitch I talk about dough, I'm under the scope
Got the bitch with the pills, got the hoe with the coke
Got the bitch with the gas, got a hoe with the bags
Got a couple stripper bitches that be shakin that ass
Got a hoe with the whoa that be bussing the clow
And I don't know her name but I got her from snow
Got a bitch on the low another hoe on the cater
Say she playing Miami but now we fucking in Vegas
Call the bitch in the staples
Say she cheer for the Lakers
She gon stop for buck but she gonna fuck for a favor
Her favorite daddy or hater, I was battlin the player
I be doing the big CTE label

Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches
Let's talk bout doping these hoes, nothing but doping them bitches
Let's talk bout doping these hoes, doping these hoes, doping these hoes

Let's talk bout doping these hoes, I put that dough over bitches
Haters lips on that whip look like the bitch blow me kisses
[?] wanna blow look like that bitch going swimming
Fuck the lamb in the front, look like the bitch going with me
And my crickin city, we talking midgets
Popcorn got a pop, not that
I'm talking bills and that yeah talking scales of that chair
Look how that water just shut it, Look at that soda just lock it
All my bitches they love me, all my niggas they silent
Couple niggas that hustle, couple niggas that's rappin
Put them hoes in that fuck em, started off in the bed, fuck the hoes on the carpet
