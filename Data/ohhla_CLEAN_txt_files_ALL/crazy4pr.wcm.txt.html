Stick your ass out, that's gone whole on that ass
Stick your ass out, that's gone whole on that ass
Stick your ass out, that's gone whole on that ass

This DJ, he is so bad
Mix and kick a nigga all in the ass
With a Knick Knack Patty Whack, in the Cadillac
Front and back, side to side, where your daddy at

Get a little.. Get a little.. Crazy
Get a little.. I got money in pocket
Get a little.. Get a little.. Crazy
Get a little.. Crazy Get a little.. Crazy

He cuts the music when the sound dis-laid
Rock, Party people, starting starting up.. to the rap

Rock Party people, Rock Party people, Rock Party people
