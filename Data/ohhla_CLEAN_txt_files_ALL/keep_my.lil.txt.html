Song:   Keep My Eyes Open 2
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

As we proceed, 2 give you what you need
2 ways, to keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had
Only be 2 thangs, keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had

Get that shit bra, listen bra
They walking bra off top
I'm like listen I guarantee man they not missing bra
Fighting the war, that's the mission son
And the war ain't over, the stand up stares like
Check out the beats, that's minor [?] right
You're more like the duck type
I'm the above type
You so left I'm so right
Self made is so nice, but I live that strife life
Yeah I know that night life
So I don't love, strapped up like [?] lights
For the cold nights, I frost bite,
And for the hot nights, I got duct tapes
[?] saying don't jam, and I'm so direct, watch the program
[?] the game the rnb, so fuck the slow jams

Only be 2 thangs, keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had
Only be 2 thangs, keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had

They asked me to speak about how I feel
I'm the only nigga that's major that ain't got a deal
And I put my life in it, no strike in it
You direct movies, you got spike in
I keep it locked, I'm a spit regardless
You got money but I'm a better artist
Yeah I've been, I've been caught them charges
I was looking like a con artist, never would [?]
Now I'm working for myself, I'm not greedy no more
And I'm eating off a bigger plate
Now you wanna hate, I'm feeling great
If I'm down boy you know I got the duct tape
So I keep it legal, a 100% man
I do my thang and I married it
Now the game they can't see [?]
Niggas talking down on God but the lord [?]

Only be 2 thangs, keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had
Only be 2 thangs, keep my eyes open
2 ways to get paid, only be 2 thangs that's good or bad
I can't cry about the friends that I never had</pre>
