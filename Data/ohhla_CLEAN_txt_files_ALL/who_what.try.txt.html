Poppin' on my phone
Prayin' I'ma say yo name in my song (Timbaland)
Well dumb ass nigga will be yo' name for today 
And don't say shit while I say - what I say
But any damn way 
I still ain't talkin' 'bout the shit
You just like Lil' John say "you just a bitch"
That gun powder - spit
Haha - actin like daffy duck
We hog tie niggas to the back of the fire truck
My ??balls?? ain't tough 
It's whatever ??gorilla less??
I keep on truckin'
I'm the first nigga buckin'
Mr. PT
Optimist prime
The PT cruiser a.k.a prime time
Mr. October
Also known as number 2
As long as I'm second - then I'm after you
Ain't nothing else to do but rock the whole region
It's Pastor Troy 
Georgia boy huntin season
Now tell me

[Chorus till end] </pre>
