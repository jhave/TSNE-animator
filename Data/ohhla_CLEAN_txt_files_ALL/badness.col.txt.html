Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Yea, keep following me keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea
Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky!
Science can tell us how how but they can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed, the beauty of life-
The pain never lasts
The rain always past, the sun don't always shine
When it's gone I'm lonely, but when it's there I'm fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think I'm a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
It's funny, 100 yrs ago I would of called Id a call this nigga masta
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
I'm looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You cay I'm easily distracted I think the problem is I'm easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm trynna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
Omen
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail, maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart?
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard-
Nights with no progress
Man I'm thinking like I'll probably find a Locness in the projects before I find this-
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Couture strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping I'm reaching for closeness
Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me</pre>
