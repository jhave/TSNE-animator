{dice shakin}
Uhh {dice thrown} yeah
Uhh, here's another one, and another one
Yeah
Lil' Kim, the Queen Bee

Verse One: Angie Martinez, Lil' Kim

It's ladies night what, it must be Angie on the mic
The Butter P honey got the sugar got the spice
Roll the L's tight, keep the rhymes right
Yo I just made this motherfucker up last night
And uhh... I'm the rookie on this all-star team
Me and Kim is gettin cream, like Thelma and Louise
but on chrome, never leave that Brooklyn shit alone
So if you say it's on then it's on

Bang this in your whips
Pack em call the roadie with the chips in the wrists
Here's a french kiss *kissing sound*
I dismissed all you chicks split six from the four-fifth
Make you dance, ooowwww
I stay focused, in the dopest
Like a penny with a hole in it, y'all just hopeless
And toke this, I ain't lye-in
Niggaz tryin to knock me off, keep tryin
All it takes is one phone call to my street team
Promote that ass, like a soundtrack New Jack Ci-tay 
Set It Off with the eighty-fitay
Y'all missin the buck, with the fuck
Bump Biggie in the trunk and the buck to my thorough bitches
Lemme see ya do tha bankhead if ya richest
It's the rap Mae West to Q-B
And I got all my sisters with me

Chorus:

Oh this is ladies night, and our rhymes is tight
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)
Oh this is ladies night, and the feel is right 
Oh this is ladies night, oh what a night (oh what a night)

Verse Two: Left Eye

Uhh, never the one, packin a gun
Got some other raw chicks for that, lay your ass flat
I be the one chockin ya paragraphs, with laughs
Getcha back up on the right path
Ain't no stoppin me ladies from club hoppin gets my rock on
From flavors still frozen at Paradise joint
Booty shakin with the glass in my left one
Right hand sayin step-son
To me my girls is fancy fly bitches
Too my niggaz straight snitches, to them other chicos
Lady pimp ain't havin that shit
If you ain't got the cash to stash, suck my dick hoes
Strictly a bell ringer 
Lay another finger on this big bad one miss lady rap singer
I be the one to blame as the flames keep risin
To the top and it don't stop

Chorus

Verse Three: Da Brat

Y'all see, how these bogus niggaz try not to notice the dopest bitches
Approachin with good intentions but focusin on they riches
If it's, too hot then get the fuck up out the kitchen
Niggaz dicks, stay lifted when they thinkin of me
Cause the rhythm I kick, puzzle them like arithe-ma-tic
Fillin em with, sluggers off the nine milli luger click
Bitches bust, we just, keep kickin up dust
And you can spread rumors shit is makin me sicker than head tumors
Humor me, by huggin me sayin you lovin me
Playa phony niggaz be buggin, I can tell
cause the thug in me wanna sell drugs and push keys
Need to get me mo' of deez, VV's and M3's 
Smoke weed from overseas pimped out styled Rol-eys
Fuck the police keep my wallet obese
Who the, Windy City woman still still comin and gunnin
Straight from the Chi
Tonight's the night for all the ladies, let's get high!

Chorus

Verse Four: Missy

Aiyyo Kim, heheh, yaknowhatI'msayin ?
I ain't even gon' leave without sayin sun'un on this track
You ain't gonna use me to just be singin hooks
What I look like?
Patti LaBelle or somebody nigga?  Heheh
Check it out, uh huh, yeah

Oh what a night 
You should be like Missy 'stead of bein like Mike
I like to ride pony's instead of ridin bikes
Me and Lil' Kim got the rhymes to incite 
I gotta catch a flight
Aheheh, round three and shit
Niggaz can't see us from Elektra to Undeas 
Aaaaoooowwww niggaz wanna be us
Heh I'm out he, ooh

*ladies night, ladies night...*
