Song:   Heartbreak Hotel
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Broken all by myself saying
Woman don't pay no mind
Forgotten like a hotel Bible
Phone keeps ringing and I'm trying to keep my mind off it
And if you walk by my window
I'll open the blinds to watch you
Walk by like you didn't know
I was inside still praying for the day just be easy
Heard you're doing fine on the outside
Smelling like a fresh picked rose
Me, I'm still mothballs and lost minds
Down on the pavement praying, trying to make some sense of it
And if you walk by my body
Would you stop to breathe?
Or would you walk by never knowing
That I'm cigarette smoke floating in the glow of the TV

What would you expect from me?
I'm right back where I started
I never lost that first touch dreaming
Of that one first feeling that convinced me you were leaving
And how would you expect to breathe
With all of this around you?
Now I'm in this old empty room
Tracing back my steps to the place where I found you

Ring twice never come in so
People don't change like time
I'm sticky like the front door's deadbolt, the side door exit
Wish I could've learned to let go
And if I came knocking on Sunday
Would you wear your white dress for me?
Or would you watch love through the peephole
Talk through the chain blindfolded so that you never see me
I heard you like picking at wounds girl
Open up and let this one bleed
I never thought that you'd be the scalpel
To open up my doubtful and leave me in the backseat
And if I pull up from the attic
Would you wipe the dust off your dreams?
Or would you buy back what you gave up
Open up fact to your nature and admit you were human

What would you expect from me?
I'm right back where I started
I never lost that first touch dreaming
Of that one first feeling that convinced me you were leaving
And how would you expect to breathe
With all of this around you?
Now I'm in this old empty room
Tracing back my steps to the place where I found you

Leaving... [x5]
(Knock on the door, left on the floor... leaving) [x2]
You made me battle alone, don't make me battle alone

(Knock on the door... Heartbreak Hotel
Left on the floor... Heartbreak Hotel
Knock on the door... Heartbreak Hotel
You made me battle alone, don't make me battle alone)
