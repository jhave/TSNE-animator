[Rock]
Ay yo
I walk like a (G)
Talk like a (G)
Ever seen me in beef, my gun bark like a (G)
I rep the whole world from New York like a (G)
Well, I'll be damned, I guess I must be a (G)
I walk like a (G)
Talk like a (G)
I rep the whole world from New York like a (G)
Even when I eat, I hope I fuck like a (G)
Well, I'll be damned, I'm a G (I'm a G)

[Rock (Nate Dogg in background)]
(Verse 1)
I ain't know I was a G, I was a regular dude
I wasn't just plain bad, I wild for cheddar and food
Good, but misunderstood, so at some point, I wigged out
So when I'm in motion, I ain't realized I flipped out
Swearing, "I ain't out to hurt nobody"
Yet I'm standing in the lobby with a H-I shotty
Minding my homie Ozzie
But if a nigga drop me
He can rob the (???) hotty, just cause I'm mad at my mommy
They caught me, lied to police
Fought my story and said, "I did it"
Shit
I believed my story myself
They wore me to death
Tried to break me down, but nah
Fifteen to 2-to-5, shit, I lied til I cried
You gotta be out of your mind, he's in school everyday
Police 'em
That's what them nigga lay dudes used to say
Geezy, scared, I ain't never claimed to be
But guess what, that's just what made me a G (Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah)

Chorus: Rock {Nate Dogg in background}
Ay yo
I walk like a (G) {Nah, nah}
Talk like a (G)
Ever seen me in beef, my gun bark like a (G) {Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah}
I rep the whole world from New York like a (G) {Nah, nah}
Well, I'll be damned, I guess I must be a (G) {Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah}
I walk like a (G) {Nah, nah}
Talk like a (G)
I rep the whole world from New York like a (G) {Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah}
Even when I eat, I hope I fuck like a (G) {Mmm, hmm}
Well, I'll be damned, I'm a G (I'm a G)

Hook: Nate Dogg
All my westside
G's
They only hate cause they ain't ya (Ain't ya)
All my eastside
G's
They couldn't play ya, never shake ya (Shake ya)
All my northside
G's
They only, fear us cause they can't get near us (Near us)
All my southside
G's
But they too near us, not to hear us (Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah)

Pre-Verse: Nate Dogg
Nate Dogg, bangin' on me, 213
Long Beach City
D.P.G.
Always on the move, never do we sleep
R-O-C, straight ol' G

(Verse 2)
Ay yo
I walk
No, I stalk
But I talk like a G
Roll, like I smoke, never choke, I'm a G
Approach, like I stroke, every hoe like a G
Murder more when niggas still feel at home in the streets (Anywhere)
Only a G can say that
Right now, I'm in
L.A., black set trippin', with a red and green hat
And it match my shit, though
Plus, if you didn't know
I'm tryin' to get out every game and clique out this bitch, yo
I know at least, one thing, they agree
New York got love, for me, what the fuck y'all think
You don't know, then you don't know me
Same reason, return to
See a M-A-C, to a G, I'm a G!

Repeat Chorus

[Nate Dogg]
Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah (Must be a)
Nah, nah
G
Walk like a
G
Talk like a
G
Oh yeah
G
Must be a
G (G)
Must be (G)
Must be a G
G
Nah-nah-nah, nah, nah, nah

Repeat Chorus

[Nate Dogg]
Mmm
Yeah</pre>
