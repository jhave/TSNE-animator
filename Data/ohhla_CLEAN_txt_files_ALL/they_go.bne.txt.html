(L-Burna)
Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin'
It's all platinum, we make it happen
Livin' legends in your presence, learn the lessons we stressin'
It's all platinum, we make it happen
Look here, playa I make this money
Nah, this money ain't make me
And you better believe that you outta your mind
Thinkin' you gon' try to play me
Lately Layzie been grindin'
Member that thug about perfect timin'
Dropin' that heat that you keep rewindin'
Comin' outta the cut, look who's shinin'
L Burna, L Dog, lil' Lightnin's a go-getter
Still claimin' St. Clair wig splitters
Ain't wastin' no time with them bullshitters
I'm a heavy hitter, and the game don't wait
So I gotta get down for my thang
Let the whole world know who run this thang
Bone Thugs, and it just don't change
I'm the crook that wrote the book
Showed y'all niggas how to really get it off the hook
Better do your thang, and I'ma do my thang
Better open your eyes and just look
You'll see me ballin' on you bitches
Livin' life flawless with the riches
Mo Thugs'll kick the real shit
Can I get a witness, can I get a witness, can I get a witness?
Nigga, Little Lay'll get a broad
to make all of these ballers in the club wanna shake it
Back it on up to the zipper and break it
Til the thugs on the floor can't take this
Show me love, pump your fists
And when it get like this it's crackin'
For all the G's in the house, better chief tonight
Y'all already know what's happenin'

(Chorus - 4X)
There they go, there they go
Wanna let then nigggas know
They don't wanna fuck with me

(Aaron Hall)
While I'm locked up on the Island with no gat
And all I had was my hands to make it happen
In the back room, watchin' a bout while I'm workin' out
Lord, I wanna be back on top and that's without a doubt
Beiginning, who started this fly shit
All y'all niggas tryin' to copy, just get off my dick
Run around with my own shit
With my name tatooed on the
And I thought that's so elaborate

(Chorus - 4X)
There they go, there they go
Wanna let then nigggas know
They don't wanna fuck with me

(L-Burna)
Thugs up, bustas down lay it down
Better hit the ground, it's a stick up on the industry
And y'all better not make a sound
All the exects gimme my check
No disrespect, but I leave you wet
Better yet, nigga snatch your life and I won't think twice
And I go on to do what's next
If I have to flex
Well anyway, little Lay really been got plenty pay
I got a AK to keep thieves away
Gotta thank the Lord that I can breathe today
Cause in a major way I done done it
This is my mission, believe that I run it
When I wanna get blunted, don't front it
Take a little hit
Nigga, that's the bomb shit
To the real OGs that'll pimp that game
Eazy-E in loving memory wherever you at, hope you feelin' me
I played the hand that was dealt to me
Nigga, shell out the heat so I'ma cut up the flames
Put it on down, burn up the gauge
Y'all know these rap folks murder a thang
I never heard of you lames
Eat deeez nuts!
Be real with the homies when I'm out on the streets
I keep it real with the homies smashin' beats
Po po's wanna be after me
But they can't capture me, I'm too real for 'em
Nowcan ya feel it, feel it?
Nigga, is you wit' it, wit' it?
Now, can you dig it, dig it?
L Burna and Aaron Hall

(Chorus - 4X)
There they go, there they go
Wanna let then nigggas know
They don't wanna fuck with me

(Aaron Hall)
