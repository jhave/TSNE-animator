[Eminem]
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us, it's lust
It's torturous, you must, be a sorceress cause you just
did the impossible, gained my trust, don't play games it'll be dangerous
if you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt I'ma show ya
what it's like to hurt, cause I been treated like dirt, befo' ya
And love is evol, spell it backwards I'll show ya
Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion what-so-ever so
Don't ask me why I have no, love for these muh'fuckin hoes
Blood-suckin succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department but, I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin to start over
I got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster's
somethin I won't go on so you toy with my emotions, hoe it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't jokin when I told you
You take my breath away, you're a supernova
And I'm a

[Chorus]
I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu, right at youuuuuuu

[Eminem]
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase
'fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break
and leave myself open that I won't be makin a mistake
Cause I'm a

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin, I'm tryin to stop you from leavin
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin to stop you from breathin
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin
'til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple I told you this {*blam*}

And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our, love
Just promise me you'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a

[Chorus]
I'm a space bound rocketship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aimin right at youuuu, right at youuuu
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without youuuu, without youuuu, without youuuuuuu</pre>
