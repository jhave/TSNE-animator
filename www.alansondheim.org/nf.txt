I am getting old, tho I don't want to.


I am an American fighter in the Irak War, Sergeant Sang-sa.
I am not a Sang-sa, I am a Chung-sa.
Were you once a Pyong-chang?
Yes, but then I was a Ha-sa.
A Warrant officer or Chun-wi is not a warrant.
Corporal Sang-tung-byong?
That is not my name, but my rank.
Are there other Sang-tung-byong?
Yes, there are other Sang-tung-byong.
That is all, Corporal Sang-tung-byong.
Thank you, but Sang-tung-byong is not my name.
Are you called Sang-tung-byong?
Perhaps I am called Sang-tung-byong Corporal.
Is Corporal your name?
No, I do apologize, but Corporal is not my name.
Were you an I-tung-byong, Private?
I am not a Private, I am a Corporal.
Is a Corporal a Private 1st class?
No, a Corporal is not a Private 1st class, because a Corporal is 
Sang-tung-byong, and a Private 1st class is Il-tung-byong.
Were you ever a Petty Officer?
Il, I, Sam, Il, I, Sam.
I am the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
I am called Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang and I am in charge of everyone 
in America.
Are you in charge of a Company Commander?

and a Chung-dae-chang and I have made a flank attack, that is to say, a 
ch'uk-myon kong-kyok in an offensive, that is to say, a kong-se.
Did this occur during the hu-myon kong-kyok, that is to say a rear attack?
As the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, I made sure this occurred with the proper sa-gi or martial spirit 
when I made a rear attack during the hu-t'oe or withdrawal.
Did you wear a helmet?
As an American Join Chief of Staff Chairman, I wore a helmet or ch'ol-mo.
Did you use a torpedo or o-roe?
Of course I did not use the o-roe in a demilitarized zone or bi-mu-chang 
chi-dae.
Did you not use the torpedo or o-roe during a chak-chon or operation?
I did not and I did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
You did not have a torpedo or o-roe?
Not even the Ch'ong-sa-ryong-gwan or Commander-in-Chief has an o'roe?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff?
Not even the Yon-hap Ch'am-mo Ch'ong-Chang.
Look, a rainbow or mu-ji-gae!

Confusion


It can be shown by straightforward substitution that the curves of parent 
and daughter activity cross at the exact time that the daughter activity 
is a maximum. [...] Parent Activity A1. Daughter Activity, A2.

I. Fast Daughter, L2 = 10L1, T2 = T1/10
II. Slow Daughter, L2 = .5L1, T2 = 2T1

The first daughter, Th, will grow into secular equilibrium with the U 
within a matter of days. This is illustrated by the "fast-daughter" (type 
I) curve of problem 9. After a few days we may consider the Th activity 
equal to the U activity, and go on to consider how the Pa grows in.

30 billion spam messages a day on the net.  that's five for every man,
woman, and child on earth. therefore i am covering for about eighty 30
billion spams per day of which i receive 80 and if you think of 5 per
person re: 30 billion roughly on earth then i am receiving for 16 people.  
let these 16 be: martha, jim, azure, terrence, johan, ki let these 16 be:
martha, jim, azure, terrence, johan, ki 30 billion spams per day of which

azure, terrence, johan, ki let these 16 be: martha, jim, azure, terrence,
johan, ki - there were also the four tarin quadruplets.

but i made an error: of which i receive 400 and not of 80 and therefore i 
am covering for eighty and not sixteen people, therefore let all sixteen 
people have quintuplets, i.e. the terrence quintuplets, johan quintuplets, 
etc. because this connection is already corroded, dare i say DOS attack?

now what is that about? someone is complaining - rocky when we need him.

his quintuplets?

recently the quintuplet quark states of course - there's a relationship.
10^42 or is it 10^74 spam = quantity of particles in the universe.
or is it atoms?
how do you measure virtual particles?

The Opera series of the movement-moment of the Diva

A series of still images remade on the Zaurus from already issued images 
in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/.nikuko directory.

These are reformed in the http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ directory as 
Opera png & jpeg, 22 in all, ordered in terms of broadcast and 
disturbance.

What can I say beyond the Victor Frankenstein of my dreams watching his 
creature at the edge of the ice, expiring first, the creature tending 
towards self-immolation, the incandescent symbol reminiscent of Flaubert's 
St-Antoine at the beginning and end of his salvation.

All these males, Elizabeth already on the pyre, everyone ready for a good 
time. At the Zaurus prompt, it's like the Image Magick prompt, it's like 
the stage prompt, the proscenium shuddering furiously in its tendency 
towards distance. People are so small here shuddering.

BOOK REVIEWS


These are books I have been working with recently; I recommend all of 
them.

First TECH:

Amazon Hacks, 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools, Paul Bausch, O'Reilly.
This book follows on Google Hacks - there is now a series of Hacks works in 
progress. Amazon Hacks is useful, not only for buying and selling, but for 
the model of commerce it presents in detail. As a voracious reader, I plan 
to use the book in selling some books - only in order to buy others of 
course. The chapter sections include Browsing and Searching; Controlling 
your Information; Participating in the Amazon Community; Selling Through 
Amazon; Associates Program; and Amazon Web Services. I requested the book 
as a review copy.

Windows XP Unwired, A Guide for the Home, Office, and the Road, Wei-Ming 
Lee, O'Reilly. This book fills a large gap in my library; I don't 
understand WiFi that well, and this is enormously useful, WinXP or not. 
There are case studies, coverage of infrared and Bluetooth, etc. I've 
needed this work. It accompanies The Wireless Networking Starter Kit, The 
practical guide to Wi-Fi networks for Windows and Macintosh, Adam Engst 
and Glenn Fleishman, Peachpit Press. I'd still like to know why tmobile 
goes out every so often on the Zaurus, the details of Wep (which I can 
find online), but both of these manuals cover the field for someone just 
wanting to get on, wardrive, transfer/transfer/transfer, and so forth.

Two more tech books:

Google Pocket Guide, Tara Calishain, Rael Dornfest, DJ Adams - this is 
fine, not nearly as detailed as Google Hacking, but quite useful for 
someone who isn't that interested in programming with the Web API. (This 
is also a requested book.)

The Official Blender Gamekit, Interactive 3d for Artists, Ton Roosendaal
and Carsten Wartmann, Blender. I just ordered this; it comes with Blender
Creator, and 10 sample games - all of which can be modified. I'm really
excited about playing around with this. The Publisher version is 2.24;  
Blender is moving towards 3.0 and a new gamekit, so this was on sale ($35
US). What can I say? I love Blender, its small footprint, quirkiness,
ability for fast-fast modeling (as long as it isn't human!), and so 
forth. It's one of the few programs that have let me constantly amaze 
myself. You should have some knowledge of Blender itself before using this 
book, but there is an introduction in it, and it does come with the 2.28 
version.

Onto other work:

Hacker Culture, Douglas_Thomas, Minnesota. I love this book; it's the best 
analysis of the title concept I've seen (although Levy's Hackers runs a 
close second, as old as it is). It's not based on tech or exploits, but on 
analysis from within and without - internal phenomenology of hacking and 
hacking communities, and cultural studies analysis of the reception of 
hacking etc. within the social - ranging from film to legislation. The 
sections follow suit: The Evolution of the Hacker; Hacking 
Representation; and Hacking Law. There are sections on Phrack and the 
"Hacker Manifesto" - I couldn't ask for better. The epilogue goes over 
Mitnick/Lamprecht. I recommend this book to everyone interested in 
computer culture.

A Mind So Rare, The Evolution of Human Consciousness, Merlin Donald, 
Norton. I'd read and loved his Origins of the Modern Mind - and mind you, 
I'm very wary of titles like these - but the books are exceptional, and 
offer a foundation for thinking about mind in relation to the external 
world - ranging from hammers to computers, digging to databanks. (I had to 
try at the alliteration.) David Antin mentioned A Mind So Rare to me; I 
hadn't known about it. Antin's recommendation is _always_ worthwhile; I'd 
argue this book is a necessity in thinking through the philosophy of 
information, philosophy of consciousness, cog psy, and so forth.

Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace; and The Future of Ideas, The Fate of 
the Commons in a Connected World, Lawrence Lessig, Basic Books and Random 
House. Both of these books are exciting - they deal with code, 
legislation, community, the "commons," and other issues relevant to the 
present and future of the Net. Now that we have 30 billion spams a day - 
over 60% of all email - the issues he discusses are absolutely crucial.
I would also advise _everyone_ to join the Nettime email list, which 
discusses cultural/political issues; Lessig has been one of a number of 
reference points.

Snap To Grid, A User's Guide to Digital Arts, Media, and Cultures, MIT,
Peter Lunenfeld - one of the most intelligent books I've seen on digital
aesthetics. From Stelarc to jodi to listservs, the work is an immensely
valuable guide and analysis of the digital domain. It's already 2 years
old, but doesn't seem dated - but then perhaps the 'classic' era of
digital art/media is already past.

Collective Intelligence, Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace, Plenum. 
Post Deleuze/Guattari/Fuller/perhaps de Chardin visionary - irritating 
like the Krokers can be irritating (well, not _that_ irritating) but 
exciting at the same time; it gives some sort of distant spirituality or 
otherness to what we're doing at the moment. Makes me feel good and the 
analysis is fascinating.

Some other work I'm reading at the moment:

The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development, Carl Boyer, 
quite quite old Dover book, but for me really useful in thinking about the 
ontology of infinitesimals and the continuum. It does come before 
Robinson's work on infinitesimals, so its development is classic, but 
extremely detailed.

Opal, A Life of Enchantment, Mystery, and Madness, Katherine Beck, Viking, 
which just came out. If you haven't read the work of Opal Whiteley, you 
should; it's almost unbelievable - I'd recommend Hoff's edition of the 
Mystical Nature Diary. Her work and life have been crucial for my own 
thinking of the natural world and issues of naming - even though the Diary 
was written by and large when Whiteley was 6. (No, I'm not exaggerating.)

Frankenstein, Mary Shelley. I'd never read this before and was astonished 
at the incandescence of the writing and the fulfillment of romantic 
destiny - it is _nothing_ like any of the popularizations I've seen.

Studies in Chinese Folklore and Related Essays, Wolfram Eberhard, Indiana, 
1970. This is wonderful; there are translations of pounding songs, 
children's essays, poems scrawled on walls. I haven't seen any of this 
literature before, and the Eighteen Short Men, Eighteen Red Men, etc. 
pounding songs are amazing. I'm always excited when new domains open up in 
the world and suddenly one is born anew - it's like that.

Saving the Image, Art after Film, Tanya Leighton and Pavel Buchler, 
editors, CCA/MMU, complete with a long essay by Tom Zummer among others 
(Laura Mulvey, Chrissie Myles, John Waters, etc.). I just received this 
(from Tom; I'm mentioned in his essay), but the issue is an important one 
to many of us who have moved from film's physicality through video's 
mechanisms to flash memory, packets, and the electromagnetic spectrum.

The Medieval Castle, Life in a Fortress in Peace and War, Warner, Penguin 
- if you're interested in the theme, and I am.

Montaigne and Melancholy, The Wisdom of the Essays, M.A. Screech. I've 
always liked the Essays; this book transforms them in relation to theory 
of body, ecstasy, self, and melancholy itself. I'm rarely interested in 
litcrit, but this work is rather amazing, opening up new territories of 
the text. Rather old, 1983, republished with new intro by Penguin in 1991.

Of course if you haven't looked at Wolfram's A New Kind of Science (there
was also a great review of this in Dr Dobbs a while ago) - please please
do - the paradigm is easy to understand, the writing lucid, examples
exciting, programming somewhat easy if you want to go that way, and the
weight of the thing will make a great doorstop.

I've also been reading the poetry of Nada Gordon on and off for months 
now, and really love the intensity, interstitial writing, and sheer 
quality of language. Just thought I'd mention it.

Also:

The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa; some books on Korean for tourists; 
Sibley's guides to birds and bird behavior; Heisenberg's The Physical 
Principles of the Quantum Theory; the most recent Sara Paretsky novel, 
Blacklist, more of Shelley, Mary Shelley's notebooks...


- I've wanted to cover a lot of this territory, particularly the opening 
technical works, for a long time. Hope this at least interests you.

- Alan

under the control

tried to get off welbutrin which i took on my own, lexapro as well, the
other twisted molecule from celexa, the last taken after the debacle in
miami. so i stopped the first and went through a couple of sleepless
nights and shakiness., the days were filled with exhaustion, i couldn't
move, my work was an afterthought which kept pouring itself out in spite
of my mind's uneasy clawings. after that i gave up on the lexapro as well,
cold turkey, and then the shakes began, something that shouldn't have
happened after this drug, which has me in its unholy grasp. i found anger
welling up, rising to the surface, my existence a pure fury against my
situation and all that it entailed. the fury led me to push everyone
around me to the limits, there was no going back, nothing from the path
bringing the wonder of despair home again. i began to get dizzy, and
dizziness took hold of me, i'd stop in the middle of the sidewalk losing
consciousness, holding on to azure as if my life depended on it, which it
did. i couldn't work or worked rather in a trance and the production, more
distant than ever, continued as i found myself more and more sexually
aroused, stripping everything bare between us, my consciousness the first
to go. i was shattered, i'd go to sleep around ten, only to wake for hours
in the middle of the night, as now, when my hormonal rhythms are still
screaming and stressed out muscles tense to the breaking point. i was
never awake and never asleep, i could barely keep myself upright with
these spells or swoons as i began to think of them, a latter-day
neurasthenia haunting me as the world swayed and rippled. azure was going
through other trials and tribulations, i found i couldn't help her, both
of us swimming to the bottom of the airless grotto, gasping for breath,
screamed drowned in the screams of others. down there i meandered, my fury
reaching new heights, terrifying me, an enormous depression past despair
waiting at the suicidal door. for once it wasn't easy to lie within the
old familiar feelings of the down world, new gates and portals were giving
way exposing raw skin, nerves, unknown tissues for unknown purposes, each
of them blistered in the salt, some dull monster emerging. i gave up,
reached for the pill, the ultimate stage of the addict, after four or five
days of this, living off the chemistry once again. one wasn't enough, a
second that night, the promise and premise of a third, a fourth, the 
continuity of a functioning mind not quite my own, the turn towards a 
different kind of somnolence, all questions turned problematic with 
dulled belief in the possibilities of answers, answers linked in ragged 
nets to questions in the salt air above the ocean of truth precisely 
because of its lack of limitations. now i'm a re-covering addict, the 
addiction to lexapro forming the hunger in my mind, the welbutrin long 
lost and unmissed, expose of another chemical landscape. i couldn't manage 
both, i recognize the stress and most likely shortened arc of the madness 
of my life, i continue exhaling the language of description, the paste 
over the substance of the real, the substrate over the substance. a little 
while ago i was sleeping, something uncanny woke me, and i'm again here, 
the dizziness a slight new turn of events, writing this down before it 
gets lost like so many other texts expelled from the surface of my mind. i 
tend myself, i tend myself constantly, words flourish in spite of the 
onslaught of the casualty of the brain. i'm at the tip of the flame, the 
bottom of the chasm, salt burns my wounds, soaks the oils from the skin, 
fills the pen, makes thoughts rise. i'd rather fight the mind than the 
brain, i'd say i'm back, but for how long before some new addiction makes 
itself manifest, something keeping me on track and the track a little 
longer.

Don't listen to me.


I honestly believe the only truths that exist are discovered by people
between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four. After that it's downhill,
gone forever, all that teen energy lost in the fabrication of real-life
institutions harboring one forever. The adult world destroys insight,
theorizes endlessly, corrects and creates imagined wrongs, produces
hatreds and bureaucracies, rites and religions. Romeo and Juliet should
never have lived into adulthood; they are the first and last philosophers.  
We learn later on in life to disseminate, dissimulate, hem and haw, build
up layers of scar tissue covering our mistakes, as I've said before, we're
carved into the semblance of a human being. But the carving is monstrous,
the thickness of the tissue - which isn't layered as many popularly
believe - is cancerous and filled with harbingers of future death. There's 
no space for breathing, none for proper motion, we take medication only to 
prolong our misery. The follies of youth are the birth of the world, rock 
and rap head-bang the difficult meanderings of latter-day classical 
composers honored for their ripe old age. Contradiction comes only later 
in life; we're all born into clarity. Trust no one but yourself, preen, 
move hard against and into the world, write forever. We take your 
literature, call it stereotyped, sentimental, typical, mean, and turn it 
into illegible stylings of problematic language, questions that only 
answer themselves in the ugly dawn of old age. Hormonal fury drives all of 
us; the rest is substance, paste, obsequiously crawling from one religion 
or theory to another, desperately hanging on to the presumed final word, 
or else talking about the journey of life, which should have ended long 
ago. The elders lure the young into war and other disasters, while 
decrying gangs which threaten their own territory. Revolution and eternal 
questioning are the only truths, beaten out of the world, or forgotten, as 
one hurtles towards the fourth decade of life. Kill the messenger in 
yourselves; there's nothing more to deliver, not even at warp speed. The 
internet brings the same old thing; it's already past its prime. Gather 
elsewhere, go.

trip


now ill trip to make sense - in the midst
of my despair this even.

red rum & she was murdered. please peals
leaps pales:  sleep peels.

she'll shell: halls shall fail, waver: of
woven vows. "she vowed."

this momentum..

now i'll translate to make sense. in the middle
of an evening depression, which felt 'even.'

murder reverses the drinking of dark rum. etiquette
fales, perseveres, fades in transcendence. sleep awakens.

she'll work with machines, not in viking halls which already
disappear like so many ghosts. promises are woven in speech.

inertia drives the sounds, forcing them into words
and the semblance of meaning..

Short Reviews of Books I like after Incomprehensible Message

*GAS `reg' section*
*GAS `expr' section*

I've been thinking about two books that fascinate me - 

kari edwards, iduna, O Books, 2003
Nada Gordon & Gary Sullivan, Swoon, Granary, 2001

initial notes on the pda -

the two books - fieles within the virtual as well as delineations of 
desire 
intimacies formied by protocols within swoon first
in depth presence of digital community

the emotional flooding at the gates

kari in the midst of sea of concept and turmoil

ik k words graphically at crosspurposes

in g and s emotional flux

both Boons

bring daniesl raster - lebbeus woords - inti plau

Now onto it. Both books connect with virtual semantics; kari's overlays
are multitasking readwrites and interspersions; the references are rarely
to online per se; but underlie everything written; "'I have sex with open
impact cryptic numbers at play- / grounds, screaming out;'" [...]
"artificial arms and digital fault lines"  - the fault line between
faultline - 

While writing this the connection stuttering more than usual, quite more, 
I can't readwrite what I say - 

In Swoon, the huge and mur-key communication protocols modes portend the 
bodies of the initiates to the extent that embarrassment ensues across the 
modalities.

I wanted to mention David Daniels - all three of the works have underlying 
rasters.

Swoon might be the most important poetics work written at the hinge of the 
millennium; emotion fluxes through the filters of communicative 
strategies. There are numerous works dealing with online persona, 
psychology, psychoanalysis; there are almost none in which the culture 
manifests itself without description. Dibbell comes to mind slightly, 
almost evanescent, but that's a story within a MOO; Swoon's narrative is 
broken and open-ended. 

The two of them fiercely query each other, there are moments quite clearly 
written for eternity & the conceivable tablet, there are others that slip 
out often in despair or old relationships fissure/ reinscribe themselves.

There is absolutely nothing like this except and to a paler extent what 
millions are doing online right now or wish they were doing without such 
ability to reflect or cohere.

kari's work is more reflective, almost the non-intimacy of language 
gridding or obfuscations such as you might find in Dom Sylvester Houedard, 
but this is all arranged, arrayed. iduna writes through itself; unlike 
Swoon, there's no possibility of resolution, and the words chunk 
themselves through in a manner similar to the border language surrounding 
page centers which resounds early Clark Coolidge but more relevant, the 
languaging occurring through online writing and interferences sidetracking 
and tending elsewhere.

David Daniels - look up the work online - you will find language gridding 
carefully assembled through digital wording in yet another fashion - 
someone on television tonight used the Etch-a-Sketch for sportsplayer 
delineations - this is - this work is - simply brilliant, Daniels an 
original biography and portraiture, you must locate it.

How to locate these through bookfinder, amazon, google, abe, depending on 
the publication degree and appearance.

I see all of these works as harbingers of new semantics troubling the 
horizon, more than, say, the generative poetics or poetry which often 
reproduces what has already been accomplished in the static sphere.

A book I do want to mention with no relation to what has gone before -

Danna Scott's Boxing, The Complete Guide to Training and Fitness. I know 
Dana and her techniques are brilliant. From the back cover: "A licensed 
amateur and professional cornerperson who has been training amateur 
fighters for several years, she has worked in various boxing venues 
throughout the country including Madison Square Garden and has been 
featured on Lifetime Television and MSG sports." If you want to 
proactively learn about boxing, this book is it.

Still reading the official blender gamekit by Roosendaal and Wartmann, and 
strongly recommend this. As I mentioned before, it comes with ten games 
you can take apart, reassemble, etc. I've been using bits and pieces.

The Vimalakirti Sutra, translated as The Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti, by 
Robert A.F. Thurman. But is it holy? How does this term operate in 
Buddhism? 

And still with British romanticism, The Lake District, an anthology by 
Norman Nicholson, and The Grasmere Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth, edited 
by Pamela Woof. The latter's much more interesting than William's work, 
and the latter ties in psychogeography.

Anyway - perhaps sketching out a field here? which would be that of the 
structured body, the protocoled body whose expressive and somatic domain 
involves semantics filtered by the virtual.

I could go on; I've been thinking about this as intensely as I can. The 
boxing, Sutra, Words-worthy, are distractions. The farther afield...

"To create a fake user for an action, press SHIFT-F4."

I've failed you ...

Damn it Opal who are you?
None of the books tell it true.
There are a lot of people who might have sued.
Some say later you were arrogant and rude.
You might have made it up from leaves that were strewed.
You used did and do in ways that seemed really screwed.
Nothing about you seems to make sense except you were unglued.
Somewhere along the line you were glued and then you grewed.

Our Quiet Lives...


This is the safety zone. Within these borders... Everything else outside - 
corruption, decay. This is safe for us. Love at the barricades. What 
happens outside the frame. The frame problem - not to adjust the real, but 
to keep it out. The problem with everything real.

Go through the works. Begin with the indices, directories. Locate 
similarities in format, style, enumeration, content, names and dates. Mark 
and re-mark them. Keep them for future reference. By virtue of the sign 
the body is not a sign. That is, culturally determined but obdurate 
nonetheless. You can see the body. You never see the sign.

Everywhere there are incompleted books for you to finish. My friends 
belong nowhere and have no badges. Lack of identity is the beginning of 
wisdom. Without signs... You might wander through the wrong door.

What I was going to say slips out, as the tongue moves. That is, it 
remains, as in 'remains of the day,' un-spoken. You can only imagine, and 
what you imagine is always right, write and written, within the borders. 
It's safe within the borders. They're here for the moment.

All these packets are enumerated, addressed, like the directories 
themselves. They're ordered so you can read and are comfortable that way. 
You can dissemble, forget. The addresses disappear forever. Even to save 
the words... within the protocols, the borders. The words are boarders and 
grow old. The truth of the pun is the pun of the truth. Truth slips out, a 
pun, my word, safe here.

The world is so unsafe, plasma, sun-spotted. We take these few moments and 
re-make the frame. My books, my films, the animations of my life, are 
within it. Nikuko is here and Jennifer is here, Travis is here and Julu is 
here, and Clara Hielo Internet, too. We are comfortable here, these names 
our names. We are here for you, part of you. You call us forth with this 
reading which is a writing as well. We pour into you. 

It's safe and warm here for human life. We are amazed that anyone still 
does good, does something unequivocal and calming. We are amazed these 
tiny spaces come forth in the midst of armageddon. They come forth and are 
quiet, are peaceful. They hold us in their arms, they sing to us softly. 
We cry quietly among the lullabies. We are at home, and we are up and down 
with the frame.

irak and roll brother


i am a rock and roller
i live in east berlin
i knew heiner muller
he and christa lived in sin

i raged against the art machine
irak was on the run
and heiner screamed, was never mean
he killed bush with a gun

the barrel's hot, it's all we've got
down at the barricade
but heiner's down and christa's down
a fucking hand-grenade

we won't live to see the fall
of one wall or another
and unity's another lie
and christa's not our mother

brother heiner come home from the war
and help this rock and roll brother
christa and i can't take any more
and irak and roll brother

Skin-Changing


[photograph] "WATCHING A SNAKE FAIRY CHANGING HIS SKIN" (With handwriting:  
"They watched me while I changed my skin.") [from THE FAIRYLAND AROUND US
by Opal Stanley Whiteley, Typed and Proofed by David Caruso, 1999]

She watched him while he changed his skin. He watched her while she
changed her skin. He watched her while she changed his skin. She watched
him while he changed her skin.

There's something about this skin-changing. There's something about shape- 
riding here but it's unclear. Everyone who reads Opal falls in love with 
her. "I have read Opal and have fallen in love with her." 

Accordingly of one book, everyone who has fallen in love with her of the 
reading of her remembers when he has first read the book as a date of 
falling in love.

It is an account of skin-changing and the reading of it is a skin-chang-
ing. This is a talisman of this reading and a magic-card.

Cut out the magic-card from the screen and carry it with you alway and you 
will be skin-changing of everyone and everyone will be skin-changing of 
you.

Some Mistakes

written under illness with codeine surrounded by the fleshy protuberances 
of the last vestiges of plagiarism from which all things descend.

Someone makes mistakes with Spiders and Scorpions and the Scorpions eat 
the spider even though both are Wayside folks who are eateth one another.

Someone starts a big forest-fire and Fireweed or Willow-Herb grows up to 
"glorify each blackened waste" and this leads to much replanting.

Some places the Rameses II pet horned toad for dinner of David the cricket 
who is eaten by Rameses II. "when he was only a baby cricket with musical 
possibilities."

Someone places the collared lizard just next to everything and everything 
was all eaten us.

Someone starts mistakes and finishes them with other writings from the
Fairyland text which I have cited in a previous work complete with
attribution. This is a description of some of the mistakes although the
fire is not a mistake and this is a talisman so there will be no more
mistakes. Now there will be no more mistakes.

Please memorize this and tell everyone and there will be no mistakes.
