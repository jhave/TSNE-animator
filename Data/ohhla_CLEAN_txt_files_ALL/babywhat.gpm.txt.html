Nah, you didn't tell me
	Aiyyo, she was definitely with the program
	but she tried to flam a little bit on on, ? though
	Well then I stepped to her
	I I yo I could get with mad shit you know
	This how I I kick it to her G
	Bust it

*singing*
Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?
I wanna wanna wanna know!  Your name
Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?
I wanna know I wanna know!  Your name

You look good
Can I get to know you better?
Stay awhile
No other man can make you wetter
Oh by the way
My name's Grand Puba, I play no games
and if the same
why don't you just tell me, your name

Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?
I wanna.. I wanna know!  Your name
Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?
I I I wanna know!  Your name

Well can we go out tonight?
And sit by the candlelight?
That's what I wanna do
If it's alright with you
You see, I can make you feel like
a woman's supposed to feel
I'm for real, that's the deal
So come on baby tell me, what is your name?

Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?
Does she feel ashamed?
I wan I wan I wan I wanna know!  Your name
Baby what's your name?  Baby what's your name?  (What is your name girl?)
Does she feel ashamed?  (Yo G what was that?)
I wanna wanna wanna know!  Your name
			(Come in and hit the skins that night?)
Aiyyo I'll never sing that thing

I touch you and, I can't let go
I can't go a day without Grand Puba (who?)
Grand Puba (who?)  Grand Puba (who?)  Grand Puba, bust it (who?)
I touch you and, I can't let go
I can't go a day without Grand Puba (who?)
Grand Puba (who?)  Grand motherfuckin Puba.. *laughing*
Let's get out of here
That's how that story goes</pre>
