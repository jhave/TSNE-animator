Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Overseas like Mr. T, with Jackie Chan we throwin' bands
Blowin' on that loud pack, back to back in dumps man
Baby girl you with a G, take you ova to Amsterdam
Flyin' G4 when we land we ridin ceiling fans

Hundred thousand hundred thousand
Yeah, we blow the hundred thousand
Summer vacation and we kickin in Resortion Island
Pinky ring acre and my house as tall as desert mountains
I'm like a plus sign cause my money always stay countin'

Coma, coma, coma can it get any dumber?
Young Juiceman ridin' 30's on a Hummer
Then I take a trip to Cali, first sound of thunder
Girl I'm in pain, can you be my super woman?

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

09 Batman, lights like Catman
Yellow black diamond's just like Packman
Still in the trap so my plug Afghanistan

Why you work with Italy, damn we got some chemistry
Hundred thousand Nike shoes 'cause you look so good to me
Thirty thousand swisher blunts 'cause that lap taste good to me

Pasta and linguini, already know it's Sicily
Back to back in Bentleys, head to toe is pedicure
First round draft, you ain't fuckin' with no amateur

Hollywood and photo shoot, hundred thousand cameras
(Cameras)
Prada shoe and Gucci bag, girl check out our literature
Weekend night shopping over there in Delaware

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Lamborghini, Maserati, Hummer truck in asguwince
Spend a whole month in a mountain up in Aspen
You get what you need baby girl, just ask me 20 thousand
South of gap

Baby goin' tax free, just left South Beach
Just did Kush tree, shoulda bought a boat but instead I bought a G-3
Take you to the bankers, baby we gon' make some big cheese
Layin' back in Atlanta, went one point two three

Can raise salt like we playin', where the fuck is jetchi
Bitch stay big like when we hit Palm Springs
Money so long bustin' through my pocket thread string
Get you to my trap, have you jumpin' on my bed springs

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman

Overseas with Jackie Chan, 09 like Batman
Maserati, Lamborghini, Hummer trucks on ceiling fans
Take you out of town, take you places you ain't never been
Spend a couple hundred thousand, come kick it with Juiceman</pre>
