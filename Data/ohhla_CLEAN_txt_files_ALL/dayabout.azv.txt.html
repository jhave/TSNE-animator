[Verse 1]
Finally from every dimension with few restrictions
From up north to the youth detentions, I lay it down
Clear enough for who choose to listen, we all thorough
Infected by cruel intentions, but who the wise
The lies got two disguises, the surprise
Is to know when to utilize it, stay alert
The street talkers say the worst
So overall you gotta watch where you play in the dirt, it's just the rules
A killer could be just as cool, it's no image
Camouflaged right next to the fools, so who's who
It's the game that chooses you
A lot of shit is more easier to say than do, show and prove
Maintainers never blow they cool
Understand, every man should really know these jewels, I'm feeling live
Slim with a gorilla vibe
Away from haters 'cause I know what they feel inside, but never worry

[Chorus]
Blowing cess in the dark (What your day about?)
Playing chess in the park (What your day about?)
Taking trips every week (What your day about?)
Spending chips on them freaks (What your day about?)
Getting money all night (What your day about?)
Betting houses on the dice (What your day about?)
Got your vest and your heat (What your day about?)
Get respect in the street (What your day about?)

[Verse 2]
Young in the mind with a old spirit
Hot blood with a heart that's so frigid, melodic music
Expressed through slow lyrics
I only spit it for the niggas that hold digits, and don't front
I know about the coke blunts and Remy nights
Got a cousin up in Elmira sending me kites
I'm felt, the ice in my ears don't melt
I could drink a whole bottle for delf and won't belch
Believe it's the same me ducking the D's
Eighty-six with the do-rag, cuff in the Lee's
Appraise this, biological' I'm ageless
Psychologically, I show amazement
Salute, been blessed with the [...?] of a coupe
Hoping the real just respect what I'm trying to produce
Quiet Money is the empire, bigger than rapping
Fuck niggas 'cause I been fired, that's what's that

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From the streets to the track board
Bubble up, from the crack to the rap laws, visualize
We all uncivilized, the trained behavior
As kids taught to memorize, copy and mimic
I travel through the blocks that's dimmest
Fly nigga, use my teeth to pop the top off a Guinness, never hate
With the hunger of a heavyweight
I stay balanced in the mind when I meditate, and blow trees
Every verse is like a o-z
I know niggas in the 'hood like they know me, so no beefing
It's nothing that could stop me from eating, too in tune
Taught to heal through the doctrines and teaching, redeemed
For women I'm the man of their dreams, stand alone
When I zone nothing coming between, let's get money
The trick is to flip money, double up
Dirty or legit money, it's all the same

[Chorus 2X]</pre>
