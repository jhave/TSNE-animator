(Chorus)

ruff out here 
im out here fightin 
cold and hungry 
fish ain't bittin 
Life's so frightening
i'm damn near thumpin  
cold and crumbling
nothin's hatching 
now im back
in stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go
whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaa
stuck in the cold in the cold no place to go
whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaa
im out here fightin 
cold and hungry 
fish aint bittin 
lights so brightlin
damn near thumpin
broke and crumbling
nothin's hatchin
now im back
in stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go
whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaa
stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go cold
exploooooooooooooooode

(U-God)

I hit the concrete
show and proove to all  the ruff man in stove fuse burn it's bomb week
watch when i snug e'm
you won't see nutin 
but the dust when the mightiest to the finest crust
the blindest the vodka's don't yo
we rabbit the land
unkind it's hard to manage
FBI
and the Public Eye
the rap seems sord of savage but those
live in the math 
as doc cash livin fast 
shang fool  anger
consealed in IMS
out the ass of the 36 chamber
god get a grasp 
it's rhyme time
time's is gettin harder
damn he spoilled rotten
hot livin colla
remember when coke was $18.00 a gram
now i was a scholar for sellin bottles
now im in the high class models
never to rest 
material's his Eyes
on fire on my chest
stress full throttle
russian's still place yard testin my strengh
fuck you with my motto
"huff"
here why ??????? For survivel I monster truck you
buck you some more
you be stuck to the wall with a big fuck you fuck you
in the search continue
i build to fill my cup
for peace of american life
i don't really give a fuck
i don't wanna die i don't wanna go
i wan't total knowledge i don't wanna be hold left in the cold pickin up
our garbage 
my lung's are grungy die harder four course swash by diction in the graphd
man lord's Hungry............................................


(Chorus)

im out here fightin 
cold and hungry 
fish ain't right in 
nice so bright in
i'm damn near thumpin  
cold and crumbling
nothin's hatching 
now im back
in stuck in the cold in the cold with no place to go
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
stuck in the cold the cold no place to goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
im out here fightin cold and hungry 
fish ain't right in 
nice so bright in
i'm damn near thumpin
broke and crumbly
nothin's hatchin
now im back
in stuck in the cold
in the cold
with no place to gooooooooooooooooooooo
stuck in the cold
in the cold
with no place to go
cold exploooooooooooooooode</pre>
