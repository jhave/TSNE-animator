Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 2x)
I'm the one wit the crushed out tank
I'm the one who makin' young girls faint
Don't smoke and too young to drink
Just a kid but got a mill in the bank

[Lil' Romeo]
Sharp brown-skin
I can always be found in, that dirty South
Chicks say I'm expanded, I go all out
Till' they fall out
I'm a ball out
When I go shoppin' romie rome buy da mall out
Kids meals ta big wheels
I did deals
Eleven years old, man it feels like I been here
Girls screamin' he's so cute in they gym gear
I will not lose, Romeo gonna win here
Tic tac toe
Get that dough
Rip that show
I'll come back and kick that flow
By da next time i'm around you'll know
I ain't playin' boy it's time ta make room for Ro'

Chorus: Lil' Romeo

[Lil' Romeo]
Center stage, dark shades to cornbraids
I'm a little man
You know doin' big things, man of my word
Earn everything I deserve
Hard work and dedication
Man get out and get your own, stop playin' ball
Lifes about makin' calls
My dad said the strong survive while the weak fall
So I stuck wit it
Pressed my luck wit it
Imagined it
Now I'm on stage gettin' crunk wit it
Make way, i'm the hottest thing in da industry today
All I see is the future cause I'm feelin' the A
After me the world of hiphop gonna change
By the time I'm 16 I'll be the best in the game

Chorus: Lil' Romeo (repeat 4x)</pre>
