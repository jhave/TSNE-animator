I promise, g'eah I love this shit man
You gotta love me man, you gon love me after this one
Man that's a promise man I love you, the boy

[Yung Ro]
I wanna make you love me, but that's an im-possible task
Down that road there's a possible crash, could end up in the hospital fast
I bust shots when I'm mad, I bust shots when I'm sad
And when I'm happy I bust shots, reminding niggaz I can get mad
Can get agg'd, can call Cham can scoop 50
Can get Rasaq, Cat, Hatta, J-Mack, Lil E will shoot with me
Plus Boogie will shoot any blank space, don't matter the same
Don't believe me sign on the dotted line, and don't forge your name
The Boy's the name record the pain, Pac spit the same shit
Pass me his shoes comfortable, what do you know the same fit
I let the flames rip, got the key to the game dick
It's going down like your main bitch, Ro suffered pain thick remain sick
My brain's quick, fly talking till the brain quit
Mami say that my brain's quick, I'm flattered bu the mission's to get brains quick
Get brain switched, same bitch lame bitch
She say don't share she's not the hoe my bad, would you rather me call you dame bitch
I'm on the same shit, that got my nigga put away
But I can't seem to put away, the fact they wanted to put me away
But I saw good in J, made me an offer I couldn't say
No to man talk with a purpose, condiment I think he stood this way
His thumb on his chin, while rubbing his goa-tee
Squinching his eyes like a wise man, so proud that he chose me
That very thought froze me, I knew I had a mission
And through that with faith in God, I could attacked this mission
I don't just rap I'm living, this hood stuff sonny
Street wisdom no books homie, take in many tip from me
Wanna see me look up dummy, not on my level you should done in
It seems like since I look at money the way I do, they all want a hook-up from me
But tell 'em I'm not a fool, so go ask Barthalemuel
A lot of tools get shot at you, no time for a ditch backyard or pool
I'll make you road kill, get crushed like them possums do
Shouldn't of been running in traffic, dumb shit like them possums do
B. Booker coming back from the Penn, he say I got 'em through
And L. Dogg peeping my pad, while we writing trying to see what I'm jotting new
I'm talking to my money now, honey how are you fine I hope
Just kidding fine I know, grinding mo' fuck shining yo
Cause I don't shine I glow, not man made can't cop it fool
And I hear dudes out there mocking who, Nobody come on stop it dude
Unless you want a shot at you, boom-boom blocker you
M-m got him good, Ambulance vroom-vroom gotta move
Gotta do what I gotta do, it's all bidness watch it dude
Cause the real ones cross mixed attempt don't it, and I don't know what you got to prove
Now look what Ro has blossomed to, money got niggaz watching you
You watching him he watching you, they watching you you watching who
Got you boom now you doomed, shot in the leg and hopping too
Streets hot as hell shoot the block ain't cool, kids listen up this what rocks will do
We bake good cakes the hood make em, without chopping dude
X-O, drank, dro, wet that's what's popping dude
Ooh what's popping boo, she like ooh you're not you're who
I'm like take a guess, star struck she like you're-you're you
Yep I'm that boy in the flesh, no imposter boo
She like I'm from Ohio, and I'm starting to hear a lot from you
I'm like I got you boo, understood my thought we through
Her's different kept going, I'm like hey I got you boo
So you can stop it boo, she kept talking Rasaq is cool
Koopa's mean, 50's real and as for me Chopped and Screwed
Ain't nothing I can't do, plus rolling with a cocky crew
For the patrol we hauling the road, set up a road block or two
The best of both worlds, dope music glad I got you too
Treat both games like kids child's play, now watch what poppa do
I go and cop the shoes, fuck it it's nothing cop the crews
Should see the smile on Jacob, when me and Chamillion cop the jewels
Carnoble my nigga, he show you what that boxing do
I'm coming down your chimney like Santa, don't want them stockings dude
I'm at the top, and you listen for me to tell you stop and move
You need to slow your speed, like when you do when them laws clocking you

(*talking*)
G'eah Yung Ro, you gon love me or else</pre>
