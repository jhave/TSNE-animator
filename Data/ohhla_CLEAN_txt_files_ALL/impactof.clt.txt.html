[Hystwise]
Ayo' my armor cored mercenary staff holdin' swords what
Hold up - Godblade carrier its over
Bizarre traits scarfaced soldiers
Dark reign colder than an artic day
No witnesses the fam is...wait...hold up...no witnesses the fam is...wait
Hold up yo' - Hold up yo'
I think I got this
Yo' Skee I think I'm a merc this shit yo'

It's still a sick plague what
To get brave quick they get ate up
If they simply must straight up
Raise guns come slingin' them up
Man I run this
Plain out spell the name out
Its H Y S T double U I S to the E GO!
Resort to the tactic war faggots you called out
Khaki pants still holdin knives like a boyscout
The button up is doin it fuckers ain't salutin' the kid
So I double up when shootin' at them
Clikclak clikclak Nigga I ain't doin' no bid
I bested them try'na run in they bitch like estrogen
Me and Skeem who you messin' with this is not football
We'll take the first down no measurin we sickest
Yo Hyst is it the limit when it's all said
Revenge is full of trife shit the clips is full of bald heads
You'll like this nigga don't stunt guardin' ya' fam
Cause we'll roll up on ya' ass like a parkin' ramp
How dare you try to match this rapper slash
Slash ya' back with bags of glass that's wrapped in plastic bags
Ya'll lack luster son's got a delicate style
It lacks mustard I'm ahead of my time but yo'
You can get it early too
Cult VI Hystwise Skeemo don't holla

Niggaz can't touch my team
What would it take for you fucks to see you can't touch us
Rollin' with ya' thug named Skeem the young cat
Hystwhizzle bats knives gats might get you
This quarantine staff lock it all down
You sick that's unfortunate you gettin' a coffin
It's still a sick plague what
They get brave quick they get ate up

[Skeemo]
Ayo' I flip packs while you still flip burgers
Code of the street you murder me you get murdered
But you ain't never seen no heat
You ain't never seen a nigga take 3 plus lay in the streets
You ain't a soldier spit at least 6 at ya' rover
It's over ya' mouth'll get ya' shot dick blower
Robberies and murders on ya' block I did it
You might get ya' truck shot at if I'm in it
Let me catch you on the ground I pop 3 in ya' coat
Touch mics with a decent approach
The heaters'll blow bang you in ya' nose and neck
You pose no threat leave ya' clothes soakin' wet
And I ain't talkin' 'bout a rain storm
I'm talkin' 'bout ya' red fluid when the bullets in my chamber gone
Tell me somethin' is you 'bout it or not?
You wanna play Peekaboo? you under the car come out and get shot

Code name citizen H - my flow grade you would give it an A
Blow strays like perverted vets

Get it got it you can hide brah
You lamp in the house while we sit around plannin' this out
No witnesses the fam is down
And the plot is like niggaz on stretchers we the E M T's that carry 'em out!
Cat what ya' worryin' for?
I'll blast first till you smash dirt sputter out ya' last word
Ya' bastard one shot tools studder masters'll
