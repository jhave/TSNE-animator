[Verse 1: Low G]
It's me Low G, Sagittarius
I like the thug girl that love to stare at us
Platinum nails with a matching skirt
Thug girl
I can make you coochie hurt
She rolls with the clique, bad attitude 
The bitch gettin' rowdy, cause she had a feud
About you and your crew, if you talking shit
She gots a .25 with an extra clip
Baby girl
You make it feel so damn good
Ridin' my dick
Chunckin' up your hood
She like the curls and kick the freestlye verse
In the club
You pack my gat in your purse
She got the nuts on every G I know
I love when you holla, "Fuck the Five-0"
I'm a be on your side when you need my help
Thug girl
Livin' in a gansta world

Refrain: Russell Lee
Thug girl
You're the reason why
I love you so 
I don't want you to go

Repeat Hook

[Verse 2: South Park Mexican]
Well, I like the thug girl with the big brown eyes
SPM baby, on the rise 
She got Versace and a big gold chain
Drivin' out of state with my cocaine
She know how to roll, big fat sweets
Holla, "Nigga, you can smoke
If you match me"
Shoot big dice
Jam Spice Crew
Eat food with the hands and treat, God's root
I do for you
Cause you care about me
When I was locked down in Harris county 
Puttin' money in my books
For my commissary
All my broke homies at home, watchin' Jerry
I told her, "I was weary
Hooked on Miss Mary"
She said she had a boyfriend that she wanted me to bury
From there, we hit it off and I must admit 
Thug girl
Thuggin' and I'm loving it

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Hook

[Verse 3: Pimpstress]
Well, I'm that thug that you can't resist
Crazy ass bitch, I was made for this
Got a house full of dope
Million dollar kid
Nina Ross givin' birth
To seventeen kids
Can you fit, where you get
Extra clip, on my hip 
Hollow tips, let it zip
All, through your shit
If you pass the cemetary on Main and 5th
You can see a collection of my greatest hits
As I sipped on Perry
On the contrary 
If you feel me, then holla already
Some of you broads
Become old news
Gettin' tag-teamed and wrecked up by who knows who
World rule number one, wanna touch for fun
You get touched by gun
And to get fucked with, son
Hun
Our own lone boy out of control
Cause when the sun goes down
It's a motherfuckin' jungle

Repeat Refrain

Repeat Hook Twice

[South Park Mexican (Russell Lee in background)]
A thug girl, a thug girl
A thug girl, a thug girl
A thug girl, a thug girl (Thug)
Girl, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
A thug girl, a thug girl (Thug)
A thug girl, a thug girl (Girl)
A thug girl, a thug girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl</pre>
