(Brother Ali Talking):
Hey little honey bee. Haha. You look like you were looking at me
I was standing over here. Naw. You wasn't looking at me?
Well what were you looking at then? I know that you weren't looking at nobody around me
Yeah, come over here. Lean a little bit closer
Let me tell you something in your ear

Chorus: [X2]
Baby don't go I know you're listening
But you gotta try to play your position
Fallin' in love and you won't admit it
We're only livin' come on and risk it

Verse One: 
Baby girl I ain't easy on the eyes like the rest of them boys
And I don't spend a months pay check on my clothes
But when you in the bed with the pillow under head
who you really want to get up and check on that noise?
Got a permanent feather in my cap
Got a stretch in my stride, a stroll to my step
Realizing that it's all about the mindset
Get a little closer the older I get
Wear a ticklish grin on my chin
The good Lord put me in this particular skin
When He speakin' to the angels, I be listening then
And I show an inside joke with all of them
I'm high without smoke
Shine without a rope
I am the old, step outside when I am broke
They always crowded around me when I spoke
Because every time I start rhymin' it's a quote
Leave it to me to see the diamonds in your coal
Holler at the glow from the bottom of my soul
Ain't no need to polish it no more
Baby let your guard down and let your heart go
Girl

Chorus [X2]

Bridge:
C'mon and just throw your knees in the air for me baby
Tremblin' like you just might care for me baby
Say hell yeah
Good till you say hell yeah

(Brother Ali Talking):
I'm saying. I came all the way over here
I done laid myself out. The least you can do is dance with me. C'mon

Verse Two:
If I ask you to dance then we gonna actually dance
I don't just rub my pecker on the back of your pants
If you're down to take a chance then let me lead you by the hand
You an expert on boys, let me teach about a man
They stand close to me
They want a dose of me
If you witness me how come you don't love me?
I had to look this way because I'm so stunning
I spear blind you until you don't see no ugly
Party starter, show stopper, real, no drama
Born alone, die alone never had a coauthor
Don't no joker throw down no harder
Light the roof on fire we don't need no water
We gonna sit on a wish and let our feet dangle
Let the song with no chorus be the lead single
Damn how the world do it, the world is wrong
She knew I was right the moment she heard this song

Chorus [X2]

Bridge:
Just throw your knee in the air for me baby
Tremblin' like you might just care for me baby
Say hell yeah
Good till you say hell yeah</pre>
