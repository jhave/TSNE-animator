Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Smokin! (Okay!)
{*monkey sounds: oooh oooh ahh ahh ahh*}
Here we go.. smokin! (Okay!)
{*more muted monkey sounds*}

[Redman]
Yo, yo.. jungle habitat, peep the wildlife in the open
Off the hook, nigga dial twice if it's broken
Doc, wall to wall with a mic and I'm loc'n, shit
You might find termites in the chokin(?), yes
D.O., my wood grain say, "Fuck P.O." (Okay!)
And I'll prove it when I redline a buck-three-oh
Hoes wit it, but never gave a fuck befo'
I'm frontin a hundred on top, and ones below
Bitches - fuck you star hoes, my hoes run out
department stores with alarms and bar codes on
Think you catchin me and my bitch?  You dead wrong
I'm over here prepared, blowin a air horn
{*BLAAM!*} You niggaz talk widdit
I do it blind blindfolded without walkin with sticks
As dark as it gets, you slept in the Bricks
Now you lose - like e'ry year, you betin the Knicks
We walk, dogs with more balls than pool rooms (Okay!)
Attitude wolf, I react to full moons (aoooooo)
I, shoot up the place so y'all can see
You stuck up like them white boys on Harley's be

[Chorus: Redman]
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
All my niggaz out in Brooklyn keep your heaters cookin
keep the mamis lookin (Yeah yeah!)
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
All my niggaz out in Jersey keep smokin the hershey
keepin your money thirsty (Yeah yeah!)

[Redman]
Yo, yo dawg, I'm an MC, I don't think how you rap stars'll think
I rush you, like you made the last call for drinks
My pipes burst and I ain't installed the sink
A radiator, I keep it in the car to mink
Chk-chk, yo trail the Bricks where I wrestle grizzly bears (Okay!)
and stick a track for it's snare and kick
When it's committed, damned if you see 'em again
Cold-hearted, leaves fall off the tree on my Timbs
Help me; I keep the flow cold like your wrists
The words practically geronimo off the disk
When Flex bomb it look, everybody runnin
You bitches goin wild, even Kitey wanna tongue 'em
I'm like the Gooch, lookin for Arnold Drummond
Walkin with a trenchcoat to part the pumpin
Like MJ, I wanna be startin somethin
Whoever ain't widdit, gotta move widdit
One-fo'-fo' hydro smoke to choke on (Okay!)
Branson holdin handguns to toke on
Uptown with Big L watchin over
He tell me there's NARC's parked on the shoulder
(Look over there) I don't care, cause I'm drunk as hell
Shit I do eighty on a speed bump to bail
Doc Deebo, keep both cannons on reload
Weed keep my fingertips yellow like Cheetos

[Chorus]
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
To my niggaz in Atlanta that, carry the hammer
Wrap 'em with bandanas (Yeah yeah!)
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
To my niggaz in the Chi, that smoke on the lai
Proceed to gun-fire (Yeah yeah!)

[Redman]
Yo, to my bitches, my niggaz jump up
It's Elmer Fudd with the shotty pump, who want duck?
Ride in my hooptie, back, slumped up
Five niggaz with me, strap, pumped up
Dump Forrest Gump, hand on the pump
Janitor, gettin drunk off a janitor drum
Way I spit, on my tongue, I branded the gun
Tarzan, I rap loud, animals come..
.. I'm on top of a giraffe neck
throwin spears, I'm Def Squad in both ears
Y'all niggaz ready for streets?  Here it is
Circle status, with no pyramids

[Chorus]
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
To my niggaz in the West that walk without a vest
That just brrrrrap (Yeah yeah!)
Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot (That's right!)
To my bitches in the Bricks that get they money quick
That get they pussy licked (Yeah yeah!)

Are you ready to get, high with Doc (Okay!)
If you high nigga then lick a shot! {*BLAM*}</pre>
