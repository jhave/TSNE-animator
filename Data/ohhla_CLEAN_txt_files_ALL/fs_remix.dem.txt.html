[Intro: Demarco] (Jim Jones)
Yeah! Whoa oh!!!! (All my soldiers we miss you!!!)
This is for my soldiers (We see you when we get there)
Real real soldiers! Yeah!

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Jones!!! They say the good die young got me watchin for the hit (Life!)
In the hood we keep guns we usually got them on our hip (Loaded!)
Catrell was fourteen when he got shot up for them bricks 
They say there's alot of real niggas that I'm gonna miss (Stacks!!!!)
So to all my soldiers the one we'll never see again (Epo!!!)
To my fallen soldiers till us gangstas meet again (Holly!!!)
I'll see you then till then you'll see me then
Couple new V's black tints no CNN (You know how we do it)
And tell BIG we still throwin up ice (In memory of)
We still hit the blocks on them cold ass nights (We gotta get the paper)
Pumpin that Pac while we pourin out liquor (Yep!)
Packin our guns cause we at war nigga now what does that mean 
 
[Chorus: Demarco]
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real
 
[Verse 2: Demarco]
As a likkle yute used to hang out pon di corner
Mi and di whole a mi friend dem we a bun some marijuana
Although nuff a we, never grow up wid nuh fadda
Still we haffi try we best mek it cross di border
But some bwoy true dem big like Hulk Hogan
Come a chat tell dem we nuh listen slogan
We prefer dead before we tek program
We nuh grow wrong, nuh we nuh grow wrong

[Chorus: Demarco]
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real

[Verse 3: Demarco]
A nuff a dem nuh like we
Dem know dem wrong and still A tek it fight we 
Kill off mi friend and tink mi tek it lightly 
And di whole a oonu bwoy mi a pree
Ah! We nuh waan nuh more funeral, nuh more burial
Stop behaving like wild animals
Get more spiritual get more biblical or go tek a wash off ova di mineral
You save your soul you save yourself, while you rest in peace
So tell Jah Jah we need some help, fi trample di beast

[Chorus: Demarco]
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real

[Bridge: Demarco]
Yeah! Whoa oh!!!!
This is for my soldiers
Real real soldiers! Yeah!

[Outro: Demarco]
This is for my fallen soldiers
We miss you, although you gone we with you 
Gone pon di battlefield, life is so real...</pre>
