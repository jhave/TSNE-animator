Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
We made a promise to each other we gon' never end...
she gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

[Future]
We met through a mutual friend
We started clubbing, dranking, talking, laughing and grinning
You had your eyes on me the whole time
I could see ya through my lens
Your face your shape and the lil things about ya...had the kid all in
Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins
But the fuck this high siddity girl want to do with an astronaut kid...
I'm asking myself questions, I had to understand...
You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man
We didn't mean for it to get this serious...
I got another nigga bitch with me
And I'm falling for her, yeah I'm falling for her
We ain't got no strings attached
I want her more and more

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
We made a promise to each other we gon' never end...
she gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

[Future]
We can talk about whatever, we can fuck wherever
It's like we're walking on rose petals, when we together...
I see you jocking me, and I'm jocking you harder...
You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you're loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing...
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain't mean for it to be this serious...
I made a promise to you and I'ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special connection, can't nobody come between

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
We made a promise to each other we'd never end...
she gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah</pre>
