[Intro]
New Ransom, French
Shit's called Ride Out

[Ransom]
Let me stop actin like I'm hardly sane, when I'm spittin bars of flame
Scar your brain, and I'm still smooth enough to massage your dame
Clog a drain, gorilla status, don't let me stomp your frame
Far as pain, I walk around bloody like I was John McClain
Palm and aim, you the weakest link and I'm the strongest chain
Pause the game, keep money stacks, as 'bout as long as trains
All the blame, place it on him, he don't go hard the same
Give you the fair 9/11 like I was on the plane
Wild boys flyin in jets, hoppin in foul toys
Me and Frenchy, Tio and Roma, cocaine cowboys
You can smell what I'm sayin homey with no Altoids
Deep as the Garden on fight night, except without noids
The streets give me energy, I speak with intensity
Police gon' remember me, cause beast is my pedigree
I keeps my integrity, increasin it steadily
You vegan-ass niggaz know beef - that shit'll never be~!
(WOOOOOOO!)

[French Montana]
I got it from here Ransom, uhh
Homey put your order down, rich thugs all around
Roll up, quarter pound, niggaz flow watered down
Homey I'm a block boy, Skittles give you lockjaw
Be there in the top drawer, stay up in the top floor
Nigga I'm the whole package (package)
I will have the doctor, sewin yo' ass up like clothes fabrics
Cause nigga I'm the best and I don't know Cali (Cali)
Ball like Michael, Philly, old Mavericks (OLD Mavericks)
Block shit twat and your flow garbage (garbage)
You ain't shootin shit, you're pressin charges
I will help you niggaz find God
Surf down sing-song your iPods
Demolish you niggaz
Bill box you out, straight Ben Wallace you niggaz
You know you better get your money, guns and soldiers
'Fore you try to diss me to get some exposure
Nigga got my bars up, guns long, stocks high and my scope out
I'm aimin for the top five, look!
I'm low-key, picture me hide out
Blast open the trunk, nigga let's ride out
Bitch nigga!
Mon-TANA! Coke!!
Real dreamin
Real dreamin
(DJ Envy, people's choice)
Y'knahmean? (Let's keep it movin)
Better slow down</pre>
