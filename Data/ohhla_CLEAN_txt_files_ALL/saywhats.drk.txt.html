Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passin' through the studio
Is in character as if he actin' out a movie role
Talkin' bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kickin' out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy is about the only thing I need back
But, it's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Polatto suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight's closed
Eyes hurtin' from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full now the shit just bein lypo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showin' you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married I ain't Miss
24 hours from greatness; I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fittin' in to standin' out
Los Angeles cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother's embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't want to feel a need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus
But yet I roll around the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm workin' with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to their clubs
And say I had fun but I can't imagine how
Cuz I just seen my ex girl standin' wit my next girl
Standin' with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird, unless they're all down
And so I stay clear, we're from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listens
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
Of always being somethin' that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Taz, "Damn, Drake fly!"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker I know!"
That was your bad, how could you pass up on him?
He just take them records and he gas up on them
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on him
Surprised no one ever put yo ass up on him
Oh they did po, at least they tried to
And that's what happens when you spittin what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fuckin' video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, could have fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I can get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit; I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in their verses
Cuz their girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got that making-of-a-legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they aint never real
Yea....that's all I can say</pre>
