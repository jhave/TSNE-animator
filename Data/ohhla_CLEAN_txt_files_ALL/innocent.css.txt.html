[Intro)
Did my time (in a) county jail (Just when)
Just when things (started) going well
(And I) paid the price (for the) crimes that I did
(Wanna) change my life, (wanna) raise my kids
 
[Chorus: Mark Morrison + (Cassidy)]
I'm an innocent man (I'm an innocent man)
Misunderstood (I'm misunderstood)
I'm an innocent man (I'm an innocent man)
Just from the hood (I'm just from the hood)
I'm an innocent man (I'm an innocent man)
Misunderstood (I'm misunderstood)
I'm an innocent man (I'm an innocent man)
Just from the hood (But a man is good, Understood?)
 
[Verse 1]
I do the damn thing, bezel and the damn bling
Sling grams, spend 10 grand on a damn ring
I run Philly, I ain't tryin to be the damn king
But the damn thing could get pulled like a hamstring
I used to hang with these niggas from my hood man
Yeah I showed them the world, I took 'em out the hood man
Yeah, cars and chains but it's all good man
Cause I got money to burn like backwoods man
And we was smokin, jokin, and poppin bottles
Gettin open, strokin, pokin, and poppin models
I was hopin, that they could get paper with me
But when I started getting cake they started hatin on me
They showed up to the crib that my mother was at
My son, my baby mother, and my brother was at
And they was strapped, actin tough and start bustin the gat
To protect my family I started bustin it back
(Prattt pratttt)
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 2]
Jail vicious, it's hard to be patient and stay strong
When you get pictures of chicks half naked in they thongs
The anticipation be makin the days long
I waited cause I just gotta make it like Trey Songz
My lawyers couldn't lose, they proved the D.A. wrong
I smiled at the trial, kept cool and stayed calm
I waved at my mom and swallowed my pride man
Them guys on the stand brought tears to my eyes man
The stuff they was discussin was nothin but lies man
They said I bussed the chrome at homie that died man
I thought them lil dudes was part of my squad man
Til they started actin up but they must've been high man
You see that I aint shook from the look in my eyes man
But bein booked was a blessin in disguise man
I needed time to get my life organized man
So everything that happened was part of my God's plan
Understand?
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 3]
Involuntary manslaughter, just parole
I spanked the murder like a bad ass 6 year old
I knew that I was gon' be rich since I was 6 years old
Now I'm the richest rapper under 26 years old
So it's on now, I'm home now, it's a celebration
I got my drink and my 2 step cause I'm elevatin
I'm gettin hella cake and with the number 1 record 
But I'll still bust my gun if you come test it
 
[Outro]
Change the life (that I)
That I live
(Got me) living five
(Living) negative
(Need to) leave the thing
(That is) destroying me
(So I) pray to God
(That he) has mercy
I'm an innocent man (x7)</pre>
