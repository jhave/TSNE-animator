Now, where the ladies at?
"Yo, we're chillin' over here"
And all the fellas?
"Takin over this year"
I heard the party's round here, right?
"You know that's right"
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Now, where the ladies at?
"Yo, we're chillin' over here"
And all the fellas, the fellas?
"Takin over this year"
I heard the party's round here, right?
"You know that's right"
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

It's so real when we come through
Sunshine be on my sidewalk when i come through
Schoolly d like family reunions
Midday may, it's all lovin'
Take a walk down to d dot c
The war's tuggin'
And ain't no druggin'
My credit's a gain
While you searchin for some trick
To put the shit in her name
I be spendin on wall street
And buyin' boardwalk
Dodging problems of the world
Drawn out in white chalk
Peace, mr. war
I'm seein' all dimensions
But unlike your eye extensions
My vision don't blur
'What' 'when' and 'word's
Where the gossip occur
Heard i'm sexin' sade
And i bought her a fur
Battin' eyes at toni braxton
And i bought her a fur
Now i'm hittin' whitney houston
Oh, she bought me a fur?
Far-fetched like glass teks
And kiddie rolex
Soon comin'
But now it's time to kick the fun in
Now, where the ladies at?
"Yo, we're chillin' over here"
And all the fellas?
"Takin over this year"
I heard the party's round here, right?
"You know that's right"
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey

I'm pourin out these rhymes
For them kids who ain't here
Stakes is high
But we gonna try to have fun this year
Before there were guns
There was native tongues on these plains
But others on
Without them being pawns in this game
'Cause a pawn in this game
Is left with no game to play
So, um, you best ta check
And hear what we got to say
Now if you came to party
Just let it be known
Now if you came to fight
You might get that head flown
By the one and only
Maseo plug third
J.D. dove plays the wall
As kenny cal spurts words
And a number
To a crew of dope girls from the woods
And not dope meaning weed
But dope meaning (good)
Like them west coast kids
Who be throwin' up signs
I hate a buster
Unless his name is busta rhymes
So check the way my mind moves
Over times and grooves
Got some money to blow
Wonder why wanna know
Where the ladies at?
"Yo, we're chillin' over here"
And all the fellas, the fellas?
"Takin over this year"
I heard the party's round here, right?
"You know that's right"
Dinninit, yo, hey, hey, hey
