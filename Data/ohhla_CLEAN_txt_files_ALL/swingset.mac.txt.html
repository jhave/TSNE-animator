Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cruising through the city with the windows down blowing
Through a pound ready for another round
Some hoes in the back of the whip and they rollin servin
Pussy like the U.S Open blowin on this
Potent different flavors I done saw em all I bee stayin
Higher than the taj mahal straight epic
So now you cant forget it kickin girls out the crib
Like they got some bad credit when you blowed
And you drunk and you don't give a fuck take this soul
And this funk tell the Dj turn it up purple
Stuff got it stirrin in my cup while hoes I get around
Like the wheels on the bus Im'a true player
Original mac and I keep the pussy poppin here listen
To that hoes showin me some love so I'm givin
It back she wanna be mrs.mac how you figure that?</pre>
