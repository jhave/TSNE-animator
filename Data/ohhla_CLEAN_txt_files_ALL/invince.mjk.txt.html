Typed by: Tha Lyriz Finisha

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start But girl you

just won't approve of the things that I do When all I do is for you but
still you say it ain't coolIf there's somebody else, he can't love you like
me And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me And he's
buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me And he's taking you all
across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me And he's buying

diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me And he's taking you all across
the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do Giving you
everything, fulfilling your fantasy Then maybe you'll change your mind and
finally give in in time Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed

to do for you my baby

(Fats)
Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible</pre>
