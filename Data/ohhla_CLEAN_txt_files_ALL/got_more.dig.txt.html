Verse 1 *(Shock G)*

Mammy, zammy, damn there's nothin to me
but when they rock us in the streets we say "Ooo-we"
you see the freak in the beat, she do me
I hit that mitty-bitty wit the sticky ooo-we gooy
I got more funk in my left in my left pinky toe
I got more soul in my style
then they will ever know
I got more rhythm than I'll ever need to show
we got them groceries bro
yo Luniz let go.

Verse 2 *(Numskull)*

I got the flow so let the Luni man take over
get deep into my hold
if ya lost, then picture gold
I heard styles that others stole
but it's no original flow
like the Luniz an the man wit the nose.

Verse 3 *(Yukmouth)*

Notice my flows kick like a loaded Mac-11
ghetto heavy, could climb wit mo "Good Times" than James Devin
glock wars
meanin you critize Tupac for
homies in the hood, we strap Rugers an "We Got More".

Chorus *(Shock G)*

Didn't ya know
our brothas got more
so check the new flow
cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh.
Look how we throw
a lil sumpthin to roll to
hold you, from the O-we-O-we-O.

Verse 4 *(Shock G)*

I got that Voodoo runnin through my veins
quit
surpressed yes
crazy no
not insane
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order
I got that dominate gene
so if ya 'noid hide yo daughter
the love ya givin is based on what I do for you
for the right amount of money you probably let me ??? you
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride
ain't no whore
don't second guess yo man cuz he got more.

*(Chorus)*

Verse 5 *(Yukmouth)*

Studio gangstas wanna battle, well let's battle
I blasted
they plastic ass get put under ground wit the fragments.

Verse 6 *(Numskull)*

Snaggle tooth rhymers wit no flavor
save a gang a neighbors
then move away so they won't be called haters.

Verse 7 *(Yukmouth)*

Captain Save-A-Hoe
up-up an away ya go
the "O" is too unfadeable.

Verse 8 *(Numskull)*

But don't trip
get a grip
make ya own skit
be sure
before
you slide through the door cuz "We Got More".

Chorus *(Shock G)* 2x

Didn't ya know
our brothas got more
so check the new flow
cuz here we go-e-o-we-oh.
Look how we throw
a lil sumpthin to roll to
bump hoes to
from the O-we-O-we-O.</pre>
