[Verse 1] (Vast Aire)
Yeah yeah
In the streets, anything can happen
The stock exchange is like the glock exchange
The supply goes up and down
And the bullets go up and down
Give me some elbow room and I'll lock it down
And I don't even like your town
You need recess
I came to destroy rap and also save the princess
Like I ain't the real
What the fuck you want a happy meal?
We get it popping when I crack the keg
And your show's like a horse with a broken leg

[Verse 2] (Vast Aire)
You ain't that gully, you a playboy bunny
I got a flow that'll water your shit down
You can keep your crown
You gotta open your ears just to peep my sound
(Heard you had a lot of pride)
Well it's on the ground
And I might have to stomp it now
(Oh you want to swing)
I wouldn't do that homey
I learned my style from Old Man Chow
And it's like that
You'll need a New York block to strike back
Look, poverty is wack
And the niggas in the street want they life back
They want the mic back

[Verse 3] (Vast Aire)
Yo, with a little hard work and some enchanted magic
I'll spit a 16 with the turbo graphic
We used to call dudes like you toys
Now we just melt the plastic
Look son, you know this game
It's called death, now ain't it a shame
I wish I had three men
So I could mess up twice and get away with my life
I've got fireballs, he's got spikes
Quick hit the turtle shell, jump into a pipe
He's a super koopa trooper
I gotta psyche 'em out with the ill maneuver

Uh huh, uh huh
Alright
Look, everybody go
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start, b, a, start
Yeah, yeah, uh huh</pre>
