It's them boys Partners-N-Crime,
Representin' New Orleans,
With that boy Lil' Keke from the Southside, ya feel me?

Off top, South Coast Music Group, Jam Down Records collabo,
We gone ride this one here all the way from Houston, Texas to the N.O.
From the N.O. Back to Houston, Texas, Worldwide

First Verse (Kangol Slim):

We bailin' straight out of New Orleans, and headed straight to H-Town,
Cuz this boy Keke, is bout to go down, but in a major way,
We on the I-10 highway, so blaze the hay,
Look like it's gonna be another day,
We bes Partners-N-Crime, had you hoes actin' naughty off the

We wanna see ya shake it like a dog, come from out them draws,
Won't you break a nigga off, let me hit'cha with this long,
Fifth Ward from the South, Third Ward from the South,
Seventeenth Ward from the South, everybody from the South,
And we all bout it, down to see you girls come straight up out it,
If you thinkin' that we fakin', girl I doubt it,
Practically in heaven bouncin' up out the Z-28 Chevy,
Go call your girlfriends, tell 'em that we ready,
To hit the tele, we wanna see you girls take it off,
Bounce that ass and come up out them draws

Chorus (Partners-N-Crime):

We wanna see you hoes take it off, take it off,
Bounce that ass and come out them draws, out them draws,
We wanna see ya say what?
Shake, shake, shake it like a dog,

We wanna see you hoes take it off, take it off,
Bounce that ass and come out them draws, out them draws,
We wanna see ya say what?
Shake, shake, shake it like a dog,
Shake, shake, shake it like a dog

Second Verse (Lil' Keke):

Shake it baby, shake it, talkin' bout shakin' that thang,
When I step up on the stage bitches makin' it swang,
I'm not the one, Lil' Keke the Don, I straight wreck it,
I'm screamin' Southside, got these hoes gettin' naked,
All the playas in the place steady flashin' that cash,
Hoes shakin' and bouncin', I'm talkin' bout movin' that ass,
I'm puttin' it down, Lil' Keke lil' freaky from H-Town,
I'ma shine and recline cuz I'm platinum bound,
This commission rich niggas we some Southside dogs,
Run my hand up your skirt, check for G-string draws,
We in the club, nothin' but love it don't stop,
Sittin' up outside in the Bentley Rolls drop,
Party packed wall to wall got the whole place jumpin',
All the ladies on the floor it's time to shake somethin',
They bumpin', talkin' bout they ready for what?
Just hush all that chatter, and shake that butt Baby

Chorus

Third Verse (Misdemeanor):

See I like it when you shake that, make that groove,
Pop that, twerk that, make your backside move,
See it's somethin' about that G-string,
That bring out that G-thang,
Let it hang,
Girl I promise I'ma make it ring,
You doin' that, shakin' that like you don't want it Black,
You comin' home?  Cuz girl I'm tryin' to christen that,
Get into that, Keke that's how we do it Black,
Ain't no stoppin' when they poppin' in the N.O.,
And on your side of town I know that's how the story goes,
But when you here, dog, we gone drink all night, club all night,
Man, we gone all night flight,
Cuz the party don't stop in the N.O.,
And the bar don't close in the N.O.,
You told 'em right when you told 'em bout the Southside,
The gettin' paid side, leavin' others outside,
South Coast representin'
