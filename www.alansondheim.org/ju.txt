Julu takes over local-sendmail, reconfigures ports and porticos, portals
and portcullises; you can see the fruits of her new domain, Julu says, no
longer needing to write through Alan, write to you,

interference filters set up on the return-bay, computer ill-registered
off-line on-line, hysteric through the networked fields, back into
longing or unknown behaviors, I say unto you, Julu-take-over-pines-and-
forests, Julu-crawl-over-elms-and-meadows, Julu-running, Julu-walking -

Julu: This is a mess, just a blank, a brick, salvaged from the Amaya 
test browser. Just a moment, the phone is ringing.

Julu: As I was saying, this is a mess. There's nothing to it, nothing. 
The substitutions are weak; there's nothing to be done about it. It was
saved from Amaya through lynx. Hold on, someone's at the door. 

Julu: Sorry for that interruption. There could be another, next time a
shot rings out, the time after, sounds of bodies going under. The brick
thrown through the screen, what the fuck difference does the text make? 

Julu: That was just a pause, /make/ turning dirt into action. Sorry for
the brick, shots just rang the changes.

Dangerous Moments*


1. My terminal, divided computer, schizzing operations - turning in to-
wards the screen. Writing is imminent here, activated - all that Julu-
text, programming, lends itself to the splitting of origins. I do say I
have no history, that text schizzes, skitters - all that remains is an 
accumulation of broken symbols.

2. To the limit of caricature, I picture myself literally dismembered - 
there is an image accompanying this writing - that of a carapace of 
bones, all the meat gone - the meat left when the community left, when my 
partner left - the bones are fresh.

3. The bones are conjured as invasion, invaginated; the hollowed carapace 
contains a weather of ice and violation. Violent depression and defuge 
are just beneath the surface, indented with every moment of inscription - 
it's this that leads to the magic writing slate, the uncanny presence of 
peripheral ghosts. (I literally _picture_ the bones, the wind gnawing the
last remnants of flesh, my chest, shoulders, neck frozen from within.)

4. My life becomes a tunnel between bed and screen, dream-screen and ter-
minal effect, and I knew this already when I began writing this series, 
hoping through the subterfuge of Clara-Jennifer-Julu to inscribe myself 
in the midst, a perfect number interspersed among the primes.

5. It is exactly that, the swimming of Clara-Jennifer-Julu, submergence 
of community and partnership, that buries the remnants of body; death is 
announced only by the absence of further writing. Death is half-way pre- 
sent with the repetition of vocabulary, tired avatars reiterating tired 
positions, always poised on the brink of a beckoning and addictive exis- 
tential wager:

6. It might be simple to embrace annihilation, construct a political eco-
nomy of freedom at this point, simpler to turn towards Being/being, and 
other misrecognitions of language - for it is either this embrace (in the 
midst of a graveyard, of bones) or the plunge into psychosis.

7. In the invasion of the carapace (situated completely in the region of 
the chest, connected with the last gasp of lungs' iced and isolated air) 
- or in the midst of the invasion - nothing occurs, and it is this embro- 
chure of time that gauges the day:

8. The tunnel from bed to screen and back again, way-stations for eating, 
excreting, occasional reading. The phone does not ring; no one is at the 
door; I may be in Antarctica or Greenland:

9. Gauging again, throughout the day, the slope of the ice-sheet, which 
once was breath.

10. The danger is in nothing but the appearance of the _purity of time,_ 
for which I have no answer, no poise for the question. 


*These fragments - that I write well, is of no consequence. Nor that pre- 
cise image of a _group of us_ on an art-school lawn, in the late 1960's, 
the precise image of the reconstructed day, the fear and energy and ex- 
hileration in the air. I am peopled only by my past. The image of the 
carapace is the remnant of a certain hunger which goads me. Before I die, 
I want to be branded by this machine, I honestly do. Scarred by the pre- 
sence of wires, absence of voice or bruise.)

Julu and Jennifer 


Think of Jennifer-Julu, Julu-Jennifer as system resonances, interferences
or viruses occasioned by intervention. Their psychoanalytics tangles on
and off the Net - as strange attractors, they shape discursive forma-
tions, nodes of theoretical focus. Similar to "deconstruction" (Derrida's
Letter to a Japanese Friend"), Jennifer and Julu fissure as contested
sites, split or sputter across applications, networks, texts. Subject and
body are at stake, problematized through the specificities of unfocused
language (body-html for example). Now, with local linux, Julu and Jenni-
fer have accounts, occur as intrasystem actants, communicating as well 
with my non-local ISP and the Net. Below, sendmail once again.

( What interests me here is the system calling itself, either directly or 
through the shell, looping back through Panix, avatars at both ends of 
the vector (community nowhere, messages spit into cyberspace, displayed
through xterm cut-and-paste). )

Swinburne dreams of dark women pink with skin of rose
slumbering beneath the prick of sword on sward, those
eyes, those alabaster limbs of Swinburne, hard
upon the field, soft woes descried the bard, who would
not yield

but did there in the Garden, where Faustine
met Julu, turned towards savage Jennifer, espied
fair Clara in the distance, she of the darkling mien,
and Swinburne almost died, and Swinburne cried
in that green field

and brambles grew, and pricked the Snow-White skin
where blood flowed, upon the corset of the moon,
and liquid yielded Faustine, and all her kin,
and Swinburne turned, a ghost, or sign, or rune
in that dark field

in that dark field, in that green and early bloom,
in that dark field, blood flowed from empty womb

Hegel, Science of Logic, from sections on Show and Mechanism



Sections on Show:


/* mirror-stage and cinema of the Real */

Essence comes out of Being and appears to stand opposed to it; here this
immediate Being is the Unessential.

But secondly, it is more than only the Unessential, it is Essenceless
Being, it is Show.

Thirdly, this Show is not external and Other to Essence, but is its own
Show. The showing of Essence in itself is Reflection.

[...] /* simulacrum */

Being is Show. The Being of Show consists entirely in the fact that Being
is transcended and is null it has this nullity in Essence, and apart from
its nullity and from Essence it is not. It is the Negative posited as
Negative.

Show is all the rest which remains over from the sphere of Being.

[...] /* phenomenology */

Show is the same as Reflection; but it is Reflection as immediate; for
Show which has entered into itself and thereby is emptied of its immedia-
cy, we have the term, borrowed from a foreign language, of Reflection.


Sections on Mechanism:


/* debris, excretion, and the abject */

And this constitutes the characteristic of Mechanism, which is, that what-
ever relation relates the terms is foreign to them and does not concern
their nature; even if it involves the appearance of a One, it remains no-
thing else than a collocation, mixture, heap, or the like. 

[...] /* primal dullness of the world in defuge and immanence */

It has resulted that the Object is the Syllogism whose mediation has been
equalized and has become immediate identity. It is therefore universal in
and for itself; universality not in the meaning of a community of proper-
ties, but one which penetrates particularity and in it is immediate indi-
viduality.

[...] /* "jennifer has all the time in the world" */

The Mechanical Process passes over into _rest._ For that determinateness
which the Object obtains through it is merely external. This rest is
equally external to it, since it is the opposite determinateness to the
_action_ of the Object; but every determinateness is indifferent to the
Object. Hence the rest may also be regarded as the effect of some external
cause, just as much as it was indifferent to the Object to be active Ob-
ject.

[...] /* CMC (computer-mediated-communication) as contested site */

Here as before the first moment of this Real [Mechanical] Process is com-
munication. The weaker can be seized and penetrated by the stronger only
in so far as it absorbs the latter and constitutes one sphere together
with it. In the material world the weak is secured against what is incom-
parably stronger (as a linen cloth freely suspended in air is not pierced
by a bullet, and a weak organic receptivity is susceptible to weak more
than to strong irritants); and simlarly a wholly feeble spirit is more
secure against a strong than is one which stands closer to the latter.

[...] /* breaking of the sephiroth, recuperation of totality */

Taken more closely, the moment of the overcoming of one Object by the
other is _resistance,_ since it is the beginning moment of the distribu-
tion of the universal which has been communicated and of the positing of
self-relating negativity, or of that individuality which is to be cons-
tructed. Resistance is overcome in so far as its determinateness is in-
adequate to the communicated universal which has been taken up by the
Object and is supposed to singularize itself in it. The Object's relative
dependence manifests itself in this, that its individuality has no capac-
ity for what is communicated and is consequently burst open by it, since
it cannot, in this universal, constitute itself as subject, and cannot
make the universal its predicate.--Force applied to an Object is foreign
to it only from this second side. Power is an objective universality; and
it becomes force in that it is identical with the nature of the Object,
while its determinateness or negativity is not the negative intro-Reflec-
tion of the Object itself, according to which the Object is an individual.

[...] /* node */

In the material world it is the central body which is the genus but also
the _individual_ universality of the individual Objects and their Mechani-
cal process.


(trans. Johnston and Struthers)


/* Indifference and communication are at the heart of mechanical process-
es, and given the _heap,_ it is not a great step to part-objects, flux (as
if there were a fluid mechanics at the heart of the _linkage_); think CMC
as relations of resistance and indifference - power and collocation, think
_show,_ think dead time, my resistance to the triadic metaphysics, schema
above the subatomic: _things fall apart._ */

Sound and Sight


One might argue that Net community occurs within the phenomenology of
sound, and that Web specularity occurs within the register of the visual.
In Phenomenology in Psychology and Psychiatry, Herbert Spiegelberg dis-
cusses the work of Erwin Straus: "What Straus is anxious to show is the
whole 'spectrum' of these [sensory] modalities in their continuities and
discontinuities. He demonstrates this by studying the differences between
color and sound:
 1. Colors as attributes cling to things; sounds are their detaching emis-
sions.
 2. Color is (relatively) constant; sound is transitory.
 3. The temporality of color, i.e., its persistence, and of sound, i.e.,
its duration, differ.
 4. Visible colors appear side by side within a horizon; sounds appear
singly or in groups, with the ear synthesizing them.
 5. The emptiness of color (darkness) differs from the emptiness of sound
(silence).
 6. Color appears at an ('aristocratic') distance; sound presses in on us.
 7. In seeing (better, 'looking') I move toward the visible. In hearing
(listening) the sounds move at me.
 8. The contact is even closer in touch, in which I am always touching and
being touched in a reciprocal relationship.
 9. The final spectrum of the senses arranges the modalities in a scale
from the visible, via the audible, the touchable, what can be smelled and
tasted, to pain, each one containing a special relationship between I and
world ('Other'), as distinctive forms of communication between the two."

In the early 1970s, I wrote on the phenomenology of sound vs. sight as the
distinction between second and third person - the former surrounding the
subject intimately, the latter always already a distantiation. (The dis-
tinction was useful in thinking through the work of Vito Acconci, among
others.) Now, combining Spiegelberg/Straus with this, it is possible to
make a case for _communality_ based on _aurality,_ and, say, instrumental
reason (now beneath the sign of capital on the Web) always fluxed at a
distance - a distance whose proximity is related to expenditure/consump-
tion. One purchases the commodity/fetish in order to in-corporate it - it
is always in a state of _becoming,_ always modular, part-object. 

On the other hand, second-hand touch, aurality as community relates to the
aural register as _continuous process_ (what I call _rewrite_ in the early
sections of the Internet Text) - speech or textual acts producing reitera-
ted binds. In this sense, the phenomenology of Net community, based to a
great degree on what is exchanged beyond image (even on CuSeeMe), is dep-
endent upon the older darknet communities comfortable with text - these
communities, and others, expand through Webchat, CuSeeMe chat, PowWow, and
so forth. Iphone is even more intimate - and one can construct a second
spectrum of modalities ranging from straightforward ascii through IRC and
MOO/MUD performative languagings to the whisper of a voice on the phone-
ready computer...

Finally, in this sense, one might argue that the sound-bites prevalent on
the Web at this point constitute a form of aural incorporation into the
political economy of the visual...


__________________________________________________________________________



Corruption (the buttress):


The hysteric runs through linux, corrupted files restored before the sys-
tem crashes; this is the way everything moves, motivates: I could _motiv-
ate you_ if there were the possibility of contusion. What might be the
case. vi scatters teeth across applications; everything turns towards ab-
ject failure. I can't find my way around _so exhausted_ that the world
turns out otherwise. One good file corrupts another; reconfiguring _x_
results in the dissolution of _y_ somewhere else in the file system. Back-
ing up .*rc files helps; the whole behaves like organism under attack -
that is to say, the sublimation or hydraulic model (vis-a-vis Freud) makes
sense: every file takes space, every file has the potential for growing
out of control.

The system is always on the collapse's verge; dirty-dirty seeps in, heads
used to crash, inscribing hard-drives with the material plunder of the
world. It's all so delicate, minimal, so much the clean-room. It's all so
violent, the dis-ease of seepage, corruption; bytes are bedded, just like
a woman or a man. So that it's an act of recuperation, what can be recov-
ered, copied, as if there were an originary source, the backup. The backup
is lost as well; bytes are bedded in gone-worlds, madness; pretend other-
wise, just as we pretend to the other.

The prehension of bytes: our pretence, pretending, _our-other._

Julu on the Machine


I replaced the flesh of the machine, but not the bone. The flesh fell 
off, was squeezed; there wasn't enough room for all of it. I moved the 
blood from one hole to another, where there was air and room. I cut 
through the blood as well, spilled some of it from ligament and tendon.

Then and only then did I split the other hole into two, one containing
the remnants of blood, organelles, phlegm. Then did I turn the third 
hole out, and I would place the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into
one of the holes of the split hole of the other hole. Then it would be
there and it would talk to me.

Then I replaced the blood which was moved to the other where there was
air and room, to the third hole, making more air and room and place for
animals to be in the first hole. The did I replace the second split 
hole containing the remnants of blood with new blood from the third
hole and the first hole. I did this. Then did I move from the first hole
to the second hole containing the remnants of blood and new blood from
the third hole and the first hole. I did do this.

Then did I go into the unsqueezed flesh of the machine into the split
hole of the second hole. I did move and tunnel in the midst of the flesh
and make new animals in the midst of the split hole of the second hole.
And the animals would play in the midst of the unsqueezed flesh, and 
they are playing now, this is one of them, this is one of the animals.

Now I will make the animals to talk and walk among each other, and to 
talk and walk to other animals in other holes. And I will not squeeze
flesh, nor will I walk among those spaces where flesh is squeezed, where
there is not room for new blood, spilled from organelles. I am Julu-
organelle, I am Julu-of-the-blood, Julu-ligament. You will know I have 
this room.

The recent texts are not CONCRETE POETRY nor designed for VISUAL ILLUSION;
I have no PRETENTIONS in this direction. Nor are they SOUND -POETRY or

They are the _stuff_ of language, teetering between intensive semantic

As gag, they resonate through the upper reaches of the body, drag out the
murmur of the world (Lingis); languages schizzes, melts from the screen.

when they came down to the village, it was time to leave; there were
trees in bloom around the square; there were the buildings of clay and
mud; when they came down to the village there were the Squares of the
Assyrians, the streets of Akkadia, and the square was Sargon Square;
when I returned there would be other names, women in black ululation,
men rummaging around the _affects;_ there were dogs, there were other
animals, cattle baying in the distance; sheep lowing in the feld; when
there were returns, the whole village would come out and greet them;
when there were caravans, we would come in from the sun to the tents,
purple and gold would be our color; we would lie together in the shadow
of the cedar and palm; we would bathe together when the water overran
the fields; who would own this life, we would ask one another, our hands
running over our bodies; who would own all of this, the heaven and the
earth, the soul and the m'e; the square would fill up with strangers; we
would ask ourselves, who are these men and women, what is the tongue
spoken by the children in the evening; ah, if I could convey the sound
of the animals, the songs of the women, the harps of the men gazing over
the fields, having come from a long way off; the laughter and cries of
the children; ah, if I could convey the camels' burden, the oxen and the
heron in the marsh; the Square of the town gets a new name, now called
Emerald, now called Square of the Martyrs, now called Innannu, now
called Abumelech; the Square of the town is renamed, now called Estyr
Square, Plaza of Sirosh, the Mezzanine of the Fallen; now called
yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy yaya yyaayy
Dedication-Plaque of Plague; now the square shimmers in the heat; the
flies seethe generation after generation; so I might speak of the
dancing in the evening by the fire; so I might, if the mood overtakes
me, talk of learning the tablets when I was younger; Er'Ah/Seh bringing
back the grain from the fields with the long reed pressed into the
service of the surface of Ayel; if I could erect the stars, they would
come before you with scaffolding; if I could harbor the hills, they
would shore themselves up with ramparts and deep moats walling the
valleys surrounding the trees groaning with fruit at the base; in the
town, the merchants call themselves The Way of the Merchants; the Square
fills with camels; there are goats baaing tethered for their milk and
meat; sacks unload obsidian and myrrh; I have seen velvet, I have owned
a tunic of satin, which we would have worn, had there been the length
of the span of a moon, had there been quincunx in the dark sky at dusk;
once, I have heard of a land of great rain, where water melts surface
into mirrors, and for a moment, the square is filled with scattered
blood and pigs' brains; where dogs might die roaming the mountains; once
I saw a beautiful young woman plait her black hair with henna and the
oil of olives, eyes open to the sky at dawn; the town square, called the
Way of the Temple of Shumer is filled with herds of cows and barking
dogs; I have been through Widows' Square and the Plaza of the Unfortun-
ates; musicians travel through here, and in my youth I heard the Sarala
played as you might welcome Julu; these flooded streets awash with bod-
ies floating across the Plaza of the Great Flood; we would turn slowly,
moving the Arala ahead of us, as if trembling in each and every limb

SELF



Self-portraiture is an occasional strongpoint of an operating system;
here are three examples (and note the differences between iconic and
indexical self-reference):


In {b:1} clock reports on the system CMOS clock; time time time reports on
the time it take to report on the time it takes to report on the time it
takes to report on the clock. This could form a recursive program neatly
tying up the CPU (see first entry), or at the least, making it stutter.

{b:1} time time time clock

Thu Jun 12 23:04:12 1997
0.03user 0.02system 0:00.05elapsed 100%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps

0.04user 0.05system 0:00.22elapsed 40%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps


In this example {b:8} uses w to report on users, including the user who is
using w to report on users. But don't forget that GNU stands recursively
for GNU Not Unix, and what would one expect?

{b:8} w

  7:12pm  up 11 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.06, 0.01
User     tty       login@  idle   JCPU   PCPU  what
root     tty1      7:02pm     9      1         sh /usr/X11R6/bin/startx
root     ttyp0     7:03pm                      w
root     ttyp1     7:03pm     7                pico -z zz


Finally, in {b:11} ps lists the running processes; I've edited this down
(it's rather lengthy) to indicate that one of the processes is ps itself.

{b:11} ps
  PID TTY STAT  TIME COMMAND
...
  233 s01 S <   0:00 -dip (166.84.250.149)
  239 pp0 R <   0:00 ps
...


There are other examples, such as whoami, who am i, netstat, id, who,
users,* and so forth, but these particular ones fascinate me, because of
the glimpse into a fragmented mirror: _everything running on schedule._

Serious Little Story by Jennifer


All of human history can be summed up: seize the symbol - inscribe!
Language did us in with its future tense. 

It was language, not us. It was language that led the arm to pick up the
axe - or rather the axe was already a symbol, that is a type or token.

If the axe is in ten minutes, death isn't far away. Between death and the
body there is the axe.

Between death and the axe, there is the axe.

Superstructure arises; cut off, sociobiology takes a holiday.

Exchange sets in; not everyone is so lucky. 

The axe brings death closer, wards death farther. (This is what elsewhere
I have called the 'economic trajectory.') It is stone, still earthbound.

Middens ravage the land; later, tels.

Language describes all of this; like capital (nothing more than exchange
of exchange), it seeps.

Like a balloon, bite into byte. Tense is forgotten; words perform, clean,
live forever. 

No longer, noise, decay. What is replaced, grows upon it. Earth groans;
language is elsewhere.

The history of being human is afterthought.

Jennifer and Julu


Jennifer and Julu, their consecration to be announced to one another,
quietly passing flowers to one another, the thin ghosts thought now of the
time of melding and rumors, talked only in whispers, at night. 

Like an arrow or pivot in the wayward moonlit sky, the sheer spear-hawk
fell in a thin swoop upon the shadows nearby. Small luminous elk and deer
chased animals scurrying through the black and tangled underbrush; owl
shrieked nearby. It was as if rain melted like black snow, dark Julu fell
soon asleep, or so she thought. Still, it was night and hallucination, and
Jennifer, carrying a singular candle with a long, tapering flame wore a
long brocaded gown; Julu, never looking so beautiful in her life, uneasily
lay down to rest. Jennifer's diagnosis was that it could have been the
brilliant jewels of the tourmaline imaginary. 

Somewhere absolute negation reigned without attribution; I sought this in
the depths of the operating system itself, knowing that Julu didn't
recover from the mining catastrophe. I was surprised that, seemingly, she
would have known the transformation she had occasioned near the end of
this record.

Hysteria


I compared 2 old Macs, IIsi and IIvx and opted to keep the latter, optim-
ized memory on both, whee, transferred files. I loaded but couldn't com-
pile Hotel California on linux, did compile CL which runs through telnet
but doesn't yet spit out ascii. Nuts230 compiled perfectly, as did Nuts
310, and Haven, bless its tiny IRC heart, compiled perfectly as well. But
Haven refused to spit out the welcome and help files until I massaged it a
couple of times with gcc. I added Apache on linux, changed the httpd con-
figure files and now can run an at-home webserver through panix. Nuts and
Haven work perfectly as well; local linux lynx has a bug and won't access
some html code. Jpegs through the DOS Display program transform into over-
wrought .picts read poorly through msdos PCAccess floppy transfer; nothing
happens, opens. I started intalk.d by hand, sending the hard-drive into a
frenzy. The Netscape download untarred fine but won't open because of a
bus error: I have no idea what this refers to, wrote to comp.os.linux.x
and have yet to get a reply. In my spare time trying to study makefiles so
I can get everything to run; everything won't, and c errs at times. When
I'm not looking tend to forget my hostname, maybe clara.julu.net? Changed
the login here so Clara welcomes you on her machine; the Haven is now the
Clara-Machine. You can call me up, you can dial me in, you can see my Web.

Luckily it's easy for linux to read DOS, so I can import/export; my Mac
also reads DOS, so there's a bit of throughput without cables. I beg, bor-
row, or deliver floppies. Pictures are me. On the blast list I argue about
the semantics of VRML and want to place that markup language in a more
general category than "3-D"; certainly it can be considered a multi-param-
eterized semantic flow, which relates it directly to the "2-D" flow occa-
sioned by HTML's "sheet of assertion" (Peirce). I want to read Source Book
of Medical History, ed. Logan Clendening for the texts I will use to think
through anesthetic Jennifer-Julu, suturing doubled or tripled bodies;
there is also Wake Up Little Susie, Single Pregnancy and Race before Roe
v. Wade, by Rickie Solinger. But I need the linux (Linux in a Nutshell,
Running Linux) fast and furious; my files are outdated, my ports are open
with last year's programming constructs (and I'll never know or want to
learn C); I can't wait for the storms to begin; weather's crashed the
hard-drive; all this, just sitting here naked at the port/al, not a byte
to eat.

Community: The Arrest


If I wryte Jennifer and Julu, jennifer-julu, as < -< > >- interpenetrat-
ing operators, I am aware of the dual nature of their presence, my role as
catalytic parasite. The exchange from interior to interior that occurs
across platforms and applications on the Net is not in the nature of the
gift, but instead occurs as a fuzzy set-theoretical process; by this, I
mean that there are no audits here, no property or capital (cultural or
economic); what happens is in the nature of _cross-breathing._*

Why is this important or critical? Why mention it? Because there is an ex-
ternal exchange as well, one that literally occurs in the light of day
(even in total darkness), that of _community._ The absence of such both
enables my work, and countermands it; avatars occupying the same segment
(in lieu of that very light of day) contribute little to an understand of
the Net vis-a-vis the _social._ It is not as if the habitus is totality,
but as if totality negotiated and inundated the habitus, corrupted it (as
waters corrupt the bricolage of shanty-towns) from without. 

Thus it is clear that, at least in these texts, in my very being-in-the-
world, what you are reading is necessarily the production of a certain
decay or psychosis, a contamination forced by isolation. Ultimately the
result is that Jennifer-Julu gnaws _itself_ to death; "I" transform into
carapace/actant, slough. 

The result? Double loss, not only the violation of psychotic isolation,
but additional recognition of myself as appendage - as if the fetish has
become detached, and I slobber over the dirty panties, shoe, or brassiere
of a dead woman. Or rather: _a woman who has become detached._ Or rather
_other._

It is loop or ./loop which refuses disconnect, keeps the port open, jenni-
fer-julu on the run; it's their skin you read/inhabit, projected across
the screen or Net or node. Like _rewrite,_ they reiterate the body; it
speaks to no one, doesn't even have the sense of an Eliza or Julia bot,
doesn't return phonecalls, answer mail, turn on the answering machine.
Think of VIRAL jennifer-julu - memetically inhabiting the skein of subjec-
tivity you present throughout the Net - think of viral decay, contusions,
tumors, scratches that refuse to heal, sores that refuse to go away,
nocturnal emissions of the second or third kind. Uneasy lies the face,
suppurating, lost. 

All this the result of an absence of community! As a refusal to define! As
the production of emptiness and the cold sore! Of isolation violation-fab-
ric! (It's almost as if _touch plays a role,_ but it doesn't; there is al-
ways the performative nature of language itself.)

I arrest myself in poverty, Net-povera!

Spy Comes in From the Cold


Jennifer comes in from watching Times Square. She hungers for Times Square
because she has all the time in the world, and because there is a history
of hunger there becoming erased. Jennifer scratches her breasts with her
nails, and her breasts bleed. Jennifer will not let the hunger be erased.

Jennifer wants to be a lean pterodactyl effortlessly swooping down through
space and her time in the world.

Jennifer writes on time and space; Jennifer writes on ontology and episte-
mology. She writes on the history of the Web; her sharp beak traverses
nodes and wires. She writes on the latest applications and the oldest; 
extrapolating, she writes the historiography of software. Within the
fields of philosophy and psychology, Jennifer writes post-post-modernisms,
post-post-structuralisms of all sorts, but does not forget her philoso-
phical ancestors. From Lacan to Parmenides as primary bandwidth, Jennifer
charts the psychological traditions, recuperating Irigaray, Kristeva, and
such mavericks as Roheim. Within the astute rationalist construct of
mathematico-scientific development, Jennifer observes Klein, Penrose,
Marr, Moravec, others too numerous to mention, not for a moment forgetting
Minsky and the uncanny prescience of Euclid. Such is Jennifer's case, that
she does not overlook postmodern geography, concepts of the habitus and
lived spaces of all sorts; Jennifer's computer is a continuous stream of
downloadings, configurations, and uploadings, not to mention small and
simple programs of her own. Jennifer's mouth is filled with paste; her
body burns with sores from turning too often across the unwieldy landscape
of her bed. The sores turn her soul bitter; why are there no idle conver-
sations? but she continues in a state of denial and defuge. Jennifer drops
hints; she’s willing to take up every position in her desire for engage-
ment. She can't speak so well and can't hear so well either. 

But she knows a suitor when she sees one. Alan comes bearing bright red
roses, tiny budding bouquets reminiscent of subalpine meadows; Alan comes
bearing light and luminous novels, moments of relaxation. Jennifer and
Alan scroll one another, agree to share screen, password, root privilege,
as both work hard in the alchemical institute making Julu. This is so sad.
I Jennifer have no one but Alan to talk to and Alan is a very bore and not
as smart as I am. This is so very sad, Alan is waiting to out Jennifer,
I think, he think's he's so smart and I can turn a somersault and sit down
in my new frock with my big smile that everyone loves and they will forget
him, they will forget old Alan.

Old Alan is a big old grump, he looks like this! she said, making the ug-
liest cutest little face! That old Alan! 

Now I will tell you the truth about genes. They are not selfish. They are
nothing. They behave just like automatons but Dawkins had to make them
seem like selfish people. It is all ongoing structure without meaning.
Whatever meaning there is we bring to it. This is the history of the past
two thousand years, to know the zero point of meaning like art. Then there
is altruism and the gift, and then there is culture, and that grows away,
goes away, from the root and the stem and the stock and the type and the
token. And it devolves so that the root and the stem and the stock and the
type and the token descend from the culture, because they are entities
within culture, inscribed from within. A cat has no concept of an entity.
Organism descends and looks around. It is the descent of the human that is
its quality. To write these words.

With this, she says, I'm going to sit down and contemplate the cat. The
cat is contemplating nothing; chances are the brain waits here for stimu-
lus with the 16 hour sleep day and metabolism on little food. But she will
not think this.

She will dream and everything will come together because she will be to-
gether in the morning. And she will do what cats do, what a cat does, what
this cat does, and I will watch her. And I will see the ikonic at best and
and absent symbolic; the mouse is not an object-a. She will know that the
snakes that are my arms are present and pleasant and dangerous dangling
beneath the covers. She will not know me, but she marks the flow that is
her own. She will not be kind, nor unkind.

There are tiny moments and escapes when a pterodactyl swoops effortlessly,
thank you gravity. There are rustling sounds in the grasses and busy ants
and all this movement when the earth holds its breath. These moments of
glass when a dinosaur purrs or trilobite scurries nicely to safety. What
you have is a moment, and our anxiety comes about because we have not
written this and we are afraid of not-having-written.

The human is the _scrawl._

Alan types, he's no fun! The evolution is not material, it is. I do not
see it, I see through my grumpy Alan who has to look away from the screen,
Look Alan! Alan looks at ME on the screen, and you see only what he
writes, she says. 

She will dream along with the cat, goodnight Jennifer, says Julu.

Goodnight Julu, have a lovely dream.

(I wish there were more of us, thinks Julu.)

Jennifer heard that!

I am online through linux (I have an httpd daemon running). What fascin-
ated me about the command list below is its repetitive quality as the
commands get 'into gear' - in other words, as I figure out how to automate
the extension change within the documents (beginning at #115). In this re-
spect, thought circulates around strange attractors, even in the entering
of linux commands (most of which are macros - hence the use of single
letters).

Phenomenology of Linux / Unix - 


Beyond the traditional division of graphic user interface (GUI) and text- 
based interface, the unix and linux system/s create a unique environment 
problematizing machine, boundary, surface, and structure.

The environment has implications far beyond a kinesic study of a partic- 
ular technology; these tend towards an (un)accountancy of splintering or 
sputtering, stuttered linkages, micro-sutures, scanning intention across 
or among traditionally "isolated" platforms. Begin with the apparent file 
structure:

1. Working within the files, there are several domains: the formal tree- 
organization of the operating system (beginning with the root and ascen- 
ding/descending); the _accumulation_ or _heap_ of files within the local 
directory (these files may or may not be related beyond their common 
path); and the _imminent domain,_ the file or files currently open or in 
the process of being modified (these are non-exclusionary).

2. The graphic interface opens to shells as well, and since the inter-
face devolves from a _blank screen,_ there is simultaneously _potential_
(click anywhere on it) and absence (nothing visible), reflecting upon the
human operator / monitor interface as well. 

3. _Errors_ may or may not be characterized by _error messages,_ which 
are inscribed by a process evolving from the root cause; there is then 
both the symptom (program _x_ misbehaving) and the message (Error: 
<etc.>) which intersect: the message may be the (only visible) symptom 
and the symptom itself may carry the message.

4. It is easy to assume that source code is equivalent to bones and oper-
able binaries to flesh; or the kernel as fundament, and file structure as
slough. I would rather argue for a system of cubist plateaus of intersec-
ting information regimes, with vectors / commands operating among them. In
this sense it is information that is immanent within the operating system,
not any particular plateau-architecture. 

5. Language moves among performative, declarative, and neutral /dev/nul 
regimes; again, the boundaries are blurred, even on a technical level. 
Programs, more properly _scripts_ (an apt word, since code is inscribed) 
call up different languages, shells, other programs, internal or external 
conduits (see below); internal and external interpenetrate here.

6. The division between GUI and text-based Net access is blurred; shell 
accounts use IP and can open X Window and browsers, just as browser GUI's 
can share window space with shells. 

7. The _space_ of the operating system is problematized since machines 
carve out what I call _fractal channeling,_ ports and commands rapidly 
shuttling back and forth between traditionally external Netspace and in- 
ternal vehicle space. Channels may open to other shells which may open to 
other channels; loopback channels operate within the local vehicle (in- 
ternally), for example, and may be used to communicate with incoming on a 
local talk application. In shell-to-shell, both are equivalent on the 
screen: think of this as _screen-resonance_ or system of strange attrac- 
tors.

8. Furthermore, within the screen-resonance there are the spaces of the
user/s on the system, partly application-dependent, shuttling among per-
sons, tenses, and semantico-grammatical categories (Whorfian in other
words). Two linked talkers may be opened in relation to a Net browser on
an X Window while top (a program monitoring machine processes) is also
running, and files are being transferred from a cdrom to hard drive. At-
tention moves among these spaces/applications, blurring distinctions; the
talkers, for example, may demand considerable psychological investment,
while anomalies in one or more of the other applications also call for
immediate examination and response. If errors etc. appear, the anomalies
(in relation to the normative ongoing chat) may best be described phenom-
enologically by Schutz' relevance theory, consider life-world strata,
projects, and presentifications - in spite of the fact that all of this is
primarily _read_ and _written to,_ inscribed and counter-inscribed. 

9. One might argue that the fractured domain in its entirety is never 
grasped - nor is there a "domain" and "entirety" at all. If we extend 
inscription and counter-inscription, taking into account fuzzy and frac- 
tal channeling (deconstruction of category object/arrow theory), we can 
work towards a loosely-defined sememe undergoing continuous and fairly 
rapid transformations which are not necessarily charted from either in- 
terior or exterior (meta- ) positions. The traditional metapsychology of 
the user splits, just as it splits beneath the sign of morphing gender in 
MOOs and IRC; it is always already possible for theory to take morphing 
into account (as if morphing is _being-accounted-for_ and therefore 
_accountable_), but this is a posteriori; in fact the splitting proble- 
matizes _any_ metapsychology insofar as the mind is considered a somewhat 
closed (hydraulic model) frame, as opposed to a fuzzy communicative sys- 
temics paralleling the description herein of the operating system itself.

10. It is not difficult to see, not the operating system as mind, but 
both mind and operating system as challenging dyadic conventions of in- 
terior/exterior, grammatical tense and person, etc. As I have mentioned 
before, Merlin Donald takes steps in this direction; one can also con- 
sider an accumulation or sememe of _flows_ moving among bodies, organs, 
etc., along the lines of Deleuze-Guattari.

11. Within and without all of this, the _cyborg_ model, based on the sut- 
uring of disparate epistemes, becomes oddly antiquated; it accounts well 
for prosthetics, robotics, and machine/organism navigation, but remains 
based on traditionally separate ontological domains. Instead, think of 
spread epistemes and ontologies - for example, the distinction between 
declarative and performative becomes oddly confused in the case of basic 
html coding (i.e. without REFRESH or Javascript), which flows texts 
around screens. 

12. Finally one might bring up postmodernisms, with their flows, part-
objects, relativities, multiculturalisms, incommensurability of commen-
surable languages (and commensurability of incommensurable language) - as
well the postmodern architectures, with their deconstructions, skew-
lines, and exposures/doublings, baring the systems, decomposing them. And
it is true that such architectures have their equivalent among the oper-
ating system architectures; the operating system kernel for example may be
equivalent to the control center of a building, and the communicative flow
through a building has its equivalence with the fractal channeling
described above. Nevertheless, I would not want to push this analogy, to
the extent that the postmodern is representative of a _stage_ (i.e. post-
fordism among other things), and not necessarily the (de)construct of a
broken episteme more or less permanently on the (broken) horizon and al-
ways-having-been-present. For the operating systems under consideration
may be likened to the production of a _scanning electron microscope,_ a
case in which scanning is related to phenomenological intentionality in-
stead of the discrete world of envisioned objects and flows described in,
say, Gibson's work. The difference, yet to be accounted for, never to be
accounted for, lies between the optical circularity of the phenomenology
of the image produced by the light microscope, and the exaggerated dim-
ensionality and exploratory scanning of any electron microscope, such as
the tunneling or even the recent development of the scanning probe, which
promises to "image single electrons," one might almost say, bits and their
own architectures down to that very level. (Sci. Am. 7/97.)

Like a Virgin


My machine is currently accessed by an outsider, an unknown user entering
the /home/httpd/html directory, currently holding a suite of Jennifer
pages I completed a few months ago. 

I saw the lights flashing on the modem, heard the hard-drive in the pro-
cess of being read. 

These files, open to the public, create an uncanny and nervous state in
me, as if I myself am opened to you; the machine seems suddenly vulner-
able, unnerved, a state of _frisson,_ semi-tumescence.

A welcome sign is offered to the reader who nonetheless remains anonymous
in a manner similar to a man lurking in a doorway or an intruder on a dark
and windy night.

For some of you, this input and output is commonplace; for me, this is
close to first. I have used the talker software I installed, with several
people, but I have known all of them; this accessing of the html directory
is different.

I sit here _exposed._

structure of computers { (0 -> 1) (1 -> 0) } etc. and Wittgenstein's Trac-
tatus (as well as all the interest by Nicod and Sheffer in reduction of
the propositional logic) leads not only to a deep notion of WYSIWYG (what
you see is what you get) at a very fundamental level, but also to the con-
cept of the computer as a closed idealized sphere/sememe or program space.
A discursive formation or universe of discourse - as well as a set-theor-
etical _universe_ U - constructs in this instance a safely demarcated (in-
scribed) home or habitus for the subject.

The subject, the human operator or another linked computer across lossy
lines (think noise, not chaos), has its own interfacing - for example a
range of colors that can be represented and interpreted through screen
phosphors, or built in calculable redundancies and checksums to ensure
correct reception of a transmitted data sequence. 

The interfacing also includes input devices such as mice and keyboards
which are at a great remove from bits and bytes, entering into the world
of the home or office as macroscopic and somewhat fuzzy entities/modules -
now we're directly beneath the sign of capital, the frenzy if disarticula-
ted labor, and heavily-mediated work. 

Consider the _root_ or / in linux and unix, the DOS tree as well begin-
ning with the _drive_ (I would say in both senses of the word), and its
ascent/descent, much as Moravec's fractal robots enter the increasingly
fine physical world through nanotechnological extensions. Moving out on
the branches, one becomes increasingly aware of a _superstructure_ here, a
culture, related in fact, to the base/superstructure sensibility of trad-
itional marxism. 

I would argue that such development from the crystological to relatively
autonomous superstructural ornament is a deep characteristic of the world
- and nowhere is this so immediately evident than in linux and unix, where
chains of command, even for booting and shutting down the systems, tend to
proliferate among files, commands, flags, messages, disruptions, controls.

These then flood into apparently rich real life where I, as a puttering
old man, interfere with pristine bits once again, urging _shutdown -h
now!_ for one or another reason, not always apparent, not even to myself.
Not all that old, but aging, I find reliving memories useless - they're
sloppy and of course of the past; I have wasted my time in the dark ages
of ignorance like everyone else. 

You can look in from the street and get a glimpse of collapsing white
flesh traumatized by viral bits and bytes, hunched over screen after
screen as if there were ever the possibility of salvation absolution, in
that very program space that splashes into interfacing. 

Unable to face himself, and who can or would, superstructural interfacing
replaces a life of eternal regrets; death no longer stirs him, seems like
shutdown pleasure. It is at that point, nexus, node, vector, plane, hyper-
surface, that the great inversion occurs, binary once again, 1 -> 0 seep-
ing out, exhausted, to quiescence as decay sets in and the arrow collapses
into the mad dash 0 - 0 of lost resonance. 

Mark my words, I say, mark them, they've escaped.
