Chorus: 2X's
When will I see my friends
as the time go I could never
When will I see my friends
in this time lord I need some
When will I see my friends

Mr. Serv-On:
Have you ever tried to count every raindrop 
before it hit the ground probably not better yet 
count every love one or friend that aint around I did
hopin that the time it took it would ease my troubles in
the end all I got was to many tears an my reflection in a
puddle sometimes I just want to stand in the rain and look up
with my arms open hopin God could tell me why babies die 
why my cousin Fish keep smokin, mama told me say a prayer
and it'll ease the pain you think Mouse before he died
 at lease smile and said his son name I'd give anything 
if I could hear my Aunt Gussie curse me out 
Auntee if you see Randall tell him his pad holdin up and
hold me a place in his new house cause so many nights 
I look at my Dun and ask myself whats the purpose its been a
long time since I been to church is that reason enough to hurt us
they told my cousin he got HIV known he facin death he walk
around with a smile, every Sunday he praisein a thought he 
still Gods child and mama lost a nephew and a sister in the same 
year and never once I saw her just lay down, give up and 
shed a tear

Chorus: 2X's

Mr. Serv-On:
See Steve in North Carolina lil brother Tony had five 
mouths to feed, God did Joeys killers know that before they 
shot him to his knees, God please tell me I'ma I a good father
my daughter a week old and I can see it in her little eyes she
already got a troubled soul and it seem like I'm runnin my last
and final race if derall and Ken not to busy send a little 
sunshine to they lonely brothers face I know everybody they die 
for a reason you think my cousin Chuck with his last breath 
wanted a hit of Gin before leaven or if Momo was still liven 
my family wouldn't look at each other with so much hate we'd 
all be speakin Shhh!! Fat rube mama never got to enjoy grandkids 
homie I know its hard when your son ask to see his their other 
grandmother and where she live I go to the Cemetery and it seem 
like the only place I find peace do you really believe a man 
when he let out of jail he really free I think if I was a bird 
I wouldn't fly away cause for some reason 
I think everybody I love would come back and I'd be to far to come
back to enjoy dat Day

Chorus pays through out the Outro:
