[Verse 1]
I won't stop spittin' till every sin is forgiven
Every dead man re-living, old chapters revisioned
Injected with a deep incision of the Holy Entity
Headed for the golden gate eventually but centuries have past
Spent time on the wickedness of mankind
From the rise of Hitler to the killings up in Columbine
Men slapping they concubines, capped for ya Cuban shine
For the world steady decline, I pour the newest wine
Into new wineskins and empty vessels, corrupted metals
Flowers that fall and shed petals on cold streets
This world is like a child that won't eat
While Christ stands there with Holy bread, scars on both feet
Including the wrist, sword slash where he wore the sash
But it had to past, the Lamb's scroll, bloody autographed
For we the people of democracy, mass technology
New world psychology, ya faith need an apology
Study like theology then look to God, like I never read a Word
Lord rain heavy, on this bed of dirt
Cause that's all I am, all I'm worth, Christ if ya walked the earth
You'd have the leather on my back down to the undershirt
Sold out like Madison Square, an addict for prayer
I close my eyes and God's right there, no Vatican here
Religious worship is useless; it's like eating meat toothless
You know the routine, still can't swallow
Ya playin' lotto, hoping the sun will come out tomorrow
Either go all out, or fall out, that's just my motto
My angel army, fully prepared for the millennium
My faith is not built on if they process the Pentium
Or 56k cache, instead of Y2K, I said Y2J
Yes to Jesus and he blessed my pathway
Stride full never halfway
You might be the first to go, living in the last day

[Chorus]
Rock solid, if you living this life, ya
Rock solid, if you walking with Christ ya
Rock solid, if ya studying the chaps
Putty in the cracks, rep and be a body in the gap (2X)
Rock solid

[Verse 2]
I'm a Christian soldier hundred proof, when he comes thon we lifting off
To the voice of triumph, for the saints that's been spitted on
Mashed down and trampled on, eluded, steady persecuted
For the sake of the name, and all the souls the church recruited
I'm a make it plain, I couldn't spit a verse without saying his name
No matter what, Jesus stays in the game
Even though its not, before you came to Christ you was holdin' knots
Then ya tripped and fell and came to Christ with swollen knots
And mercy refused to let you suffer on continually
Woke you out ya sleep cause you was sleeping with the enemy
What a friend, from the jump-off, to the very end
He don't condemn the saved, he's here to save those past condemned
In every scroll I rhyme, I'm in a Holy Ghost state of mind
And if ya hating mine, take a number son and wait in line
Cause I'm a keep preaching, 'til every demon is screeching
Retreating from every heathen and the bondage chains weaken
Till they break lose, with Satan I'll never make truce
My covenant with God is sealed with matzo bread and grape juice
The bread and wine, body and the blood, a scriptural scud
Head for you Anti-Christ's, lost life's and Christian dud's
The Word I head that, the wisdom encrypted I need that
I squeeze that, rap with the Lord, listen for feedback
So when the waves crash, Christ is there to make em' ease back
Believe that, the Lord is my Shepard, God bless the sheep, black
That don't conform to the pattern of this world's wickedness
The tint taken off my third eye, thon I'm livin' this

Chorus

[Break]
Ten thousand may fall
At my, right hand
But with you I stand tall (2X)
I can walk on water focused on you (2X)

[Verse 3]
Know I'm blessed, headed for eternity's rest
Cats wanna lay me flat with burgundy vest
It all good man, I'm ready to leave this world of stress
World of flesh, the strongman curls the best
Got y'all using scripture to twirl the ces
Up in the club, 151 and hurl of X
Chased with beck's, scheme on a girl to sex
Thing you the hardest, pop, while you bop to next
Cuban ice on ya pinky, wrist, watch and neck
Bump get vexed, peering out ya Gucci specs
Ya pride is high, ya loot done hit the deck
Ya fit this cat, it's time to reverse ya trek
This be the Jump-off man, watch ya step
Blood and sweat put in cause we love the rep
Take it by force, while other cats, quiet is kept
The kingdom is nigh, believe we gonna rock 'til death</pre>
