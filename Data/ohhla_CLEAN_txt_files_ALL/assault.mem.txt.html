[Mad Child]
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery

Blood rushing excitement, eternity of darkness
Trust me, you don't want to start this, I'm heartless
Colder than this, this is some rip your face apart shit
Department for the clinicly insane, my apartment
Transmit total derangement, an engaging engagement
Crystal prism, abstract expressionism
I'm back, from vision, empressionist on a mission
Battling psychopaths, slightly sick and twisted
Social butterfly in a glove, double fisted
Silver streak, mean rays of purple haze
White widow, the flames, ponder in his veins
Now, wandering in days, no signs of weakness
How can you critique this, can't even compete with
The ultra electric, startling when battling
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery
Skulls are shattering this is Assault and Battery

[Prevail]
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy
Words are staggering, daggering like a tragedy

You can be all in my face without toxic fool
You can be all in my face, but I could lose my cool
My attempt to hold back could backfire on you
My new identity is an entity to the tone of two
My totally true tongue ties titanium in two
To the places that we roam, tombstones are overgrown
Projects are overblown, reflections are never shown
Connections are never cloned, sucessions are over the phone
Like my vocal catacomb, that knows to abandon homes
Since those, from nine to five to collide with my form
My forum's held Saturday, Sunday and Monday
Maybe one day, you'll learn how to do it the Prev One way
Until then, I kill them until they get it straight
When they move for the bigger fish, focused on the bait
In this audio bizarre, noone knows who you are
No descendents of Ham, no babies are taught
Leave the black in the cold and the cold in the bar
Like a shifted momentum, who would've thought
Anyone could contend them, I'll bend them
And send them to the lions in the kingdom

[Mad Child]
Death by invitation, torturing teens in bondage
Approaching a scene, mentally unharnessing carnage
Hell hath no fury, pathological liar
Tails, halos and horns, kings of sinful desire
The ultimate degenerate, iron chain lashing
Knife weilding, eye gouging and scalpel flashing
The cult classic, with intense scenes of gore
Imploding my load as I melt into the floor
A sexual awakaning, sadistic hypnotist
Poisinous tantrest, switch to dominatrix
Distorted form of forbid of flesh for sensation
Mind of a serial killer, locked concentration
Sweet taste of bliss, in from the Holy Grail
Now hold the hand of pleasure as we hitch hike to hell</pre>
