[Deuce Poppito]
Lil momma you off glass

[Trina]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I know you like the way I shake that, drop that
Cock back, make the pussy pop back
Fuck a nigga in a Benz with the top back
If you lyin on your dick, nigga stop that
You wanna fuck me for free, nigga freeze that
Show me where them D's at, lil momma needs that
I need a nigga who gonna lick on the clit
Who gonna pay all my bills
Who gonna trick on the rent

[Deuce Poppito]
Well damn lil momma, can you swallow my dick?
Can you keep that pussy poppin like a bottle of Cris?

[Trina]
Hell yeah cause you know lil momma about it for sure
Cause off glass is my motto, my motto

[Trina and Deuce Poppito]
If you got plenty cash, in your Chanel bag, baby you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
If you a high priced bitch with that ice round your wrist, you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
And when your back in the club and pop that pussy for them thugs,
Lil' mama You off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
And when you gettin plenty bread and got that fire, you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass

[Deuce Poppito]
Lil momma got in goin on like the candy and chrome
Off glass in cut with no panties on
I don't know lil momma, it's just somethin about ya
That make a nigga wanna fuck the dog shit out ya
Do your thing lil momma go in twerk it bitch
When Deuce Poppito see what you workin with
In that see-thru shit with your nipples hard
That shit gotta nigga dick triple hard

[Trina]
Yeah I know playboy
It's just somethin about me
It take a real nigga to bring the freak up out me
Turn out the lights and slip up out me
Ain't nann size dick you could keep out me

[Deuce Poppito]
Well damn lil momma, can you swallow my dick?
Can you keep that pussy poppin like a bottle of Cris?

[Trina]
Hell yeah cause you know lil momma about it for sure
Cause off glass is my motto, my motto

[Trina and Deuce Poppito]
If you got plenty cash, in your Chanel bag, baby you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
If you a high priced bitch with that ice round your wrist, you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
And when your back in the club and pop that pussy for them thugs,
Lil' mama You off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass
And when you gettin plenty bread and got that fire, you off glass
Ah-hah, lil' mama you off glass

[Trina]
I know you like the way I bounce that, strip that, flip back
Make the pussy drip back
Niggas cryin like they broke, I ain't with that
You better break a bitch off like a kit-kat
I know you like the way lil momma mack work, your stack worth it
I'mma fuck you till your back hurt
I'm gettin grands hoe, you don't know nann hoe
That'll stay fitted down to the sandals
I know you like the way I throw that, slang that
In MI, that's where I got my game at
I'm Da Baddest Bitch, can't nothin' change that?
Every nigga that I fucked, they done came back

[Deuce Poppito]
Well damn lil momma, can you swallow my dick?
