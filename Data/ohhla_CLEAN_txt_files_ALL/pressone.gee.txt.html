"You have a COLLECT call from a Louisiana inmate.
Press 'one' to accept."

[B.G.]
Greetings, hot girl - what's happenin' on your end?
As for me over here, you know a nigga chillin'
Besides that, sweetie, I'm just keepin' it real
Puttin' up with these crackers in this hot-ass field
But you know I'm a soldier - nigga try me, I'll spank him
But fuck all I said, it feel good to be the Baby Gangsta
Tell Miles I asked about her since she say I don't holla
And when I touch down, me and her gonna get us some (?)
Shorty, I've been hearin' that you've been wilin' out
Everyday of the week, and you tear the club doors down
What's happenin' with you, wodie? You doin' that 'cause we bound?
You doin' that 'cause for this lil' town I'm not around?
Don't get the game twisted - girl, better not try your luck
You know I ain't the one, you know quickly I'll fuck ya up
I'll be home next week - now I'ma keep it on the low
Nigga think I got six more months left on this (?)
Uh-huh

[B.G.]
That minute that I had had done turned into a second
Got a day and a wake-up left, and I'll be steppin'
straight through them iron gates - puttin' all this behind me
Come in the hood on V.L. - that's where you'll find me
Hoppin' out the limo, poppin' bottles - it's gravy
I know what it mean when I get that phone call from Baby
Let's go to the Mercedes, lock and cock somethin'
A hard-top six, or a drop six, that'll be lovely
My shorty think she got six more months to play
Can't wait to see that dick-look on her face
Right now I'm with the fellas, I'll go and see her later
'cause she tried to be a slick playa
But I ain't trippin' - it's cool, gotta respect me
Long as she don't get outta line in my presence
She still my shorty - gon' be my ho
Can't forget she was there everyday of my (?)
Uh-huh

(Hook [Automated voice &amp; Baby])

[B.G.]
Now it's about that time I go fuck up her dome
'cause she have no idea that this hot boy home
It ain't been a day, and I'm already on chrome
I'm tryin' to imagin' her face, and how long
that it's gonna be when I hit the porch
and put my soulja Ree's through her front door
When she still think that she can have fun
and run with her girls for six more months
I'm cruisin' down the block slow, I pull up
Jumped out, said, "What's up?" She laid up there and threw up
"What's wrong? Don't act like you don't miss your nigga."
She said, "I do - I'm shocked."
"Come here and kiss your nigga.
I had to surprise ya because you piss your nigga off.
You don't respect me pussy-poppin' on nobody wall.
You my main bitch - my travel-with-cocaine bitch.
Set-a-nigga-up-you-gon'-disposition-then-maintain bitch."
