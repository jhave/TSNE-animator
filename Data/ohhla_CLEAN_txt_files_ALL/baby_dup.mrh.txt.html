          ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
          and we'll linger on

BREAKDOWN:
(Xscape &amp; Mariah):I know that you'll be back boy
          when your days and your nights get a little bit colder
          I know that you'll be right back baby
          oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time

VERSE:
(Da Brat)
Who brings the ruckus and the pain like Ness
it's evident tha residents of So So Def 
Got the industry on lock where 
outsiders can't enter 
Ever since the arrival of this west side 
Representer who rocks your musicbox 
And break down your structure you 
Fantasize as you visualize me as your dreamlover (WHOA!) 
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face
Reality reason through mc's 
Inflicting fatalities 
Ain't no cap on my salary 
I'm gettin' g's if you heard of me's 
Then you know that we's makin' g's 
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me 
To tha back steady stacking papers smokin' on fat 
Stacks of danks see to some 
I'm a hero of this feel on file 
But that's my style 
And they don't pay me nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real 
For my peeps in that street cause to them
I'ma always be their baby

(Mariah):May we always be together
         In the sands of time

(REPEAT REPRISE OUT TO FADE)
