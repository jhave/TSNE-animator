[Zack de la Rocha]
Mic check and one two, one two...
Mic check and one two..
Mic check and one two...

Lick off the shot my stories shock ya like Ellison
Main line adrenaline, Gaza to Tienanmen
From the basement I'm dwellin in
I cock back the sling to stone a settler
Breaks him off clean, call me the upsetter
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross 
the capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo..

ROLL RIGHT!!! ROLL CALL!!
BUT NOW WE'RE ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALL CALM!
ROLL RIGHT!!! ROLL CALL!!
BUT NOW WE'RE ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALL CALM!

This hits like fists bomb with the left and don't miss
With the sickest stilo I spark fear like pigs in the park
Head crack, I hijack the papers
The vapors caught fire up in your mind, come back rewind one time
Here comes the hands on the leashes, the cross 
the capital, the pale families, the fear, and the mouthpieces
The single sista lynch, the cell doors crash
The master's drums echo, echo, echo, echo..

ROLL RIGHT!!! ROLL CALL!!
BUT NOW WE'RE ALRIGHT, WE'RE ALL CALM!
ROLL RIGHT!!! ROLL CALL!!


We gotta take 'em to the seventh level!

We gotta take 'em to the seventh level!
For their lives and my lives were never settled

C'mon! Don't freeze when zero hour comes
C'mon! 
C'mon! Don't freeze when zero hour comes
C'mon!

{instrumental break}

SEND 'EM TO, THE SEVENTH LEVEL!!
SEND 'EM TO, THE SEVENTH LEVEL!!
SEND 'EM TO, THE SEVENTH LEVEL!!
SEND 'EM TO, THE SEVENTH LEVEL!!
For their lives and my lives were never settled!</pre>
