That's how much I want you
Like a good brew, like a fine wine
You improve with time and I want you
I want you
That's how much I want you

Baby
It's no secret that I want you
We can have fun if you want to
I see it in your eyes, it's like you're hypnotized
Your scoping got you open cause you want me
You told me that you have a man though
All you got to do is let his hand go
I want you rain or shine, you know your heart is mine
No matter the weather we can stay together
You feel the energy, advanced chemistry
Outcome is heavenly
Let yourself go and lady follow me
If you focus, believe me, off it will pay
Life could be wonderful, we could take it day by day
Not to much to say except I'm known to lead the way
And I got my eye on you

I want you
That's how much I need you

Baby
Listen, it's no secret that you're beautiful
But fair warning I'm a handful
Since I'm popular, at times I pop my gun
Paparazzi paint pictures of me like I'm Gotti
Photo posted in print on page six
Murder be the cases when I'm caught up in the mix
My life is very deep, in the streets we play for keeps
In that world my name's the reaper
Known to many ghettos as a celebrity
One of the last dons around the town, an army surrounding me
I need to know, can you hang?
Sometimes pistols bang, howl at the moon
When I hunt I display fangs
I got my eye on you

That's how much I need you

Baby
Listen, it's no secret that we're soulmates
Just give into your heart and feel great
Why should we play this game? 
I know you feel the same, fortune turn to flame
Baby can you handle fame?
The media probe me cause they don't have no shame
Via satellite around the world they know your name
Live everyday like it's our last yet so groovy
People watch us both like a movie, action
Dangerously in love like Mickey and Mallory
Cause it's to the death when picking a companion
Cautiously I move, I don't let nothing rattle me
So what's it going to be, cause I got my eye on you

That's how much I need you
It's no secret that I want you
That's how much I need you
It's no secret that I want you

That's how much I want you</pre>
