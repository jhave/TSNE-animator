[Big] Uhh
[Dad] I like that, you like that? Heh
[Big] Here's another one
[Dad] And another one
[Big] And another one
[Dad] And another one
[Big] Uhh, what, what?

Intro/Chorus: R. Kelly, Biggie (variations on Big's part)

You must be used to me spendin
And all that sweet winin and dinin
Well I'm fuckin you tonight

[Big] Here's another one
      And another one
      Uhh, uhh, what?

[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]
Some say the x, make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we fuckin (that's alright)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends

Chorus 2X

[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

Chorus 2X

[Verse Three: R. Kelly]
Lets stop the bullshit baby
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that ass to me

Chorus: repeat to fade with variations</pre>
