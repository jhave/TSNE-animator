Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio

[Verse 1]
One o'clock, Sunday pack, touchdown
All green grass stretch a hundred yards
Waiting on a jump, then my float abroad
Say you want some dovers, ask me what I chose
A Julio to work, call me mister boy
I gotta have many money, cause my money long
I got them dirty birds, I'm talking falcons
You know I jugg and count on every beat I'm on

[Chorus]
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio

[Verse 2]
I catch everything I plot, told that Julio
I got that righty white, get phoned for 84
Superball pile to work, touching down
Hall marry by the embarrass your second time
For the long we're coming for cause it's necessary
Been born by a hundred cause it's necessary
We just trying to win the superbowl in February
Harry Douglas clutchman 88 to fetch

[Chorus]
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio

[Verse 3]
I make your main bitch do the hoola-hoop
I made a million dollars due to auto blunt
So hit me where I at, it's like a sound tune
You wanna hear the marley, take it here to drink
My goal automotor, cause a quarter ticket
Serve a lot of dope, serve a lot of devils
I got my time checked and my diamonds general
I got my niggas with me, wanna kill something

[Chorus]
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio
I got them dirty birds call me Julio
Soon as the word touch me, make 'em Julio
Me and my bro sipping down Julio
You all about me, touching down like Julio</pre>
