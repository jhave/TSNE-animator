[Nature]
Aiyyo, I got a bitch buy me 'dro, a bitch buy me clothes
A bitch that can't cook, stay burnin Sloppy Joe's
Olive Oyl legs, even them stocky hoes
Bitches that I used to beep, but forget they codes
They stay frontin, no kissin, strictly face fuckin
I get em drunk in my room, and keep Mase bumpin
The one wit Total, your friends might of told you
I violate menage's, pimp game be bi-coastal
Officialize one's high fold you, run and tell em next
Cuz only some become gremlettes
I never spend for sex, strictly rainy days
Strictly wit the fat ass, backshots made me spray
Like the shotty pump, they tried to tie me up
And want to spend the night, every time we fuck
Get a snooze on, cum stains in a futon
It ain't a game, still you run when the food's gone
Now who is wrong

[Chorus]
When I spit, you spit, hot shh, new shh
Exclusive, Nature, Clue shh
When you spit, I spit, new shh, hot shh
Exclusive, Jungle, watch this
When I spit, you spit, hot shh (DJ Clue), new shh
(The Professional), exclusive, Nature, Clue shh
When you spit, I spit, new shh, hot shh
Exclusive (STUPID!!), Jungle watch this

[Nature]
Got a fiend that owes me ten, a fiend that owes a buck
Got a decent job, pay they debts slow as fuck
Catch em in the street, ?mo fit? up, say "come on you bitch"
It's only money I'm involved wit
Calculations, foreclose homes out in Vegas
I run wit TM, meanin bitches pay us, it's outrageous
CLK's, rims ill, tinted up, pullin bitches wit bird shit on the windshield
Hoppin out, niggas front, we knock em out
Like a smooth boxer, writin new how shh
Generatin paper like Lou Gosset
Makin moves while your crew gossip
Read about us, raw shh, our feats'll doubt us
Niggas talk shh, a team of cowards
Need to stop frontin when there's nuttin to do
Nuttin new, niggas is comin for you
Yeah, it's 1998, Nature somethin for Clue

Chorus 2x *with Clue shoutouts*

[DJ Clue]
You know how we do it, Queens style
Every trip, haha</pre>
