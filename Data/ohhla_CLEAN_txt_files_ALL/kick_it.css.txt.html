Yea this for the grown and sexy, this for the grown and sexy (hey hey)
  This for the grown and sexy this for the grown and sexy

[Cassidy]
If you down for me then I'm down for you
I'll lay a nigga down if he fuck around with you
And if you there for me then I'm there for you
Thru the laughter and tears I'll care for you
And if you ride wit me then I'll ride wit you
Stick by ya side and provide for you
And if you roll wit me I'll roll wit you
Be ya friend till the end and grow old wit you
Peep it tho, I'm a pimp and I keep a hoe
I met this on the low freak bout a week ago
Yo I'm on the avenue, and she was walkin by
While I'm comin out the store wit a bag or two
Yo I woulda passed on her, but shorty had a ass on her
That'll have you spendin cash on her
I moved fast on her like come here boo
And she was nice from her shoes to her hair do
Bracelet was bright she had ice in her ears too
Type that you might make your wife in a year or two
Yea boo, you officially nice, thass why I'm tryna git wit you tonight, ima
hit aiight

[Chorus 2X: Mario]
Stay the same, your so sexy
Can we hang, I wanna kno can we
Do our thing, I wanna git witchu ahh
I just wanna kick it wit you

[Cassidy]
Now when I got to the crib I was ringin her phone
Like I'm thinkin bout bringin you home
But thass not whut its all about, unless thass whut you make it about
I ain't pressed I'm just takin you out listen
Git ya hair done, git ya nails fixed
Do all of that then call me back on the cell sis
I ain't the hell rich, but I'm still
Gon fill you wit hchampagne stuff you wit shellfish
Lobster rigatoni focaccia
This lifestyle only for mobsters I gotcha
We goin to the dinner spot round ten o'clock
Ima drive by beep the horn then spin the block yup

[Mario]
Let me knoooo if you're down tonight

[Chorus]

[Cassidy]
I went to git her we went to dinner and ate right
But its the late night I'm tryna see what her face like
She ain't the first date type she got class
But she dealin wit the B dot cass you heard that
We got off the turnpike where she lightin the herb at
I reached in my pocket and got it like hold up
I passed her a dub and a dutchie like roll up
Somethin came to me I made a U-way you know whaat
You playin games ma, and I'm a player right
But I ain't playin when I'm sayin you should stay the night
I'm sayin like if I ain't poppin you off
Ot gettin top at the bus stop I'm droppin you off yup

[Mario]
Let me know if you're down tonight

[Chorus]</pre>
