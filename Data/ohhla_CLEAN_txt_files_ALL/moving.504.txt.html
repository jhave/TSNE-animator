Baby baby get up what? 
You'e already late for work
What time is it? Its 10 30
Oh yeah I forgot tonight, I'm working the graveyard

(Chorus)
I know my man is moving things
9 to 5 baby, I got a job baby.
I hope one day my nigga change
All the time baby I'm on the grind baby

I keeps that 9 in my drawers cuz you know I like to ball
Nigga I ain't Warren G, but sometimes I want it all
Flip a half into a whole, I mean an ounce into a brick.
Get it for sixteen five, me and my niggas gonna be rich
Put them 20's on my Benz so you know I got so mens
Keep your eyes on your enemies and nigga watch your friends
See in this game you get schisted I get some niggas that don't like me
See the Ghettos trying to kill me, and the feds wanna indict me
On a murder I didn't do, I'm still thuggin with the crew
Because once you snitch then you threw but if u hustle then you true 
Would you live for this shit? would you die for the click?
Sell your soul to get rich and run your mouth like a bitch

Chorus(2x)

Nigga we hustle the streets so lets fuck the police
My enemies don't want to see a nigga up on his feet
I got the chrome for the haters and burbs on the table
Give my life for my niggas and we splittin the paper
They say thuggin is the secret that help a nigga fall 
OZ's flippin quickly to see we never fall 
The grind got us strapped with 9's on our lap
The crime is a trap chop dimes of crack
Hennesy got your mind if you slip you might die
Penitentiaries give us time I'm fighting for mine
If I die in this game send my soul to God
I'm making mine in this game even though it's so hard

Chorus(2x)

Yo baby, guess who stopped by today? who? guess?
Your sister came from California?   mnn mnnnn.
I ain't got time for all this guessin I just got home from work
Come on I want you to guess, we gonna play a game
Your auntee from Jersey? mnn mnn, wrong again
Who? The mother fucking ATF that's who?
What? yes you know what I'm saying. 
What, you running them games on me?
You let them in the house?
Hell ya what am I supposed to do I didn't know what to do
They wanted to search the house and if they find some 
Mother fucking dope in here they are gonna take my children
Away and I cant be having that shit. Man, slow down, slow down.
Slow down? slow down? ima slow down, ima slow down.
You know what? I'm tired of this shit and another thing 
I called your mother fucking work today and guess what they told me. 
You haven't been to work in the last 6 months 
Now what you been doing huh?
How the fuck you think you get all this shit you have?
I don't know how I get it. you tell me that's what I want to know.
You don't want it? Tell me where you get it from.
Don't play with me you know what happening
Hmm hmm I know what's happening. you know what?
I don't want this shit. Fuck it all. Fuck it all
