I'm not payin 140 for them (size 8 and a half)
I'm tellin you I'm only payin 90
(that's what you keep spendin your money on)
Yeah
That's for real

[Verse 1]
Ayo , ayo
Who wear it all I'm an addidas freak
Multi thousand pair of sneak freak
Real fly physique that'll look yea , fat watch , live footwear
Have the white folks displaying my gear
C'mon son let's keep it movin right footwear , check out my book yea
Stop , look , stand and you stuck but don't stick
Come aboard now , we got the Georgetowns , it's on now
So many phat styles , make a kid's head fall out
Yo Filas , those too par I'm supposed to
Always keep it real with the selection , holdin you
Prince black Jordans , K-Swiss gear , remember lottos
Stash mad bottles , in the fence ooh the odora
Anita place me your order , slow your speed down
Buyin food for your daughter
Stan Smiths , handlin whips , grapple pits , travel fox yo
Ready to cop more shit

CHORUS 2X:
[various scratches that refer to sneakers]

[Verse 2]
Fly royals , got love for a ?member a six? , we do the basics
Stood out , slide em on , taste it wild lace in these
Ciconi's and ponies , Spa built mix wit ? ? ?
Keep it real , heav set , head set , intellect set
Black Mutombos , Columbo on the set , internet
Plus Pumas and Patricks infrarensics , switch up the black shit
Green Araccis , unattached shit , 575 blue bals , blue bals
Bo Jacksons gray and black , ready to throw my hands flashin
Ewings, Barkleys , Lex use an entertainer , forget Air Cross Trainer
Free container , Polos , Mark 5s and the leases , the fly pieces
Shit be on the back mad features
Hoyas, caught ?? in the tonic , feeling bionic
Design it with my fly garments , what up

CHORUS 2X</pre>
