Love within a storm (4x)

First it was nothin', not even, a fake ?
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, looove, looove
Oooh...oooh

Love within a storm (4x)
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly dissapeared
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again

Fall in love again, in a storm
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses)

Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we didn't, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'

We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line)
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you, and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Sha-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you</pre>
