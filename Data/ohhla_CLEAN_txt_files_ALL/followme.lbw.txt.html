[Bow Wow - talking]
Yeah, uh, uh a huh, uh, yeah
Uh uh a huh, uh
I'm gamed (*laughing* who what?)
I'm gamed (ok)
I see that ya'll wanna be like the boy wonder (true true)
Well, don't they all (me, me, me, me)
So just sit back and relax and let holla at ya'll
(Talk to 'em playboy), this how you be me (how)

[Verse 1 - Bow Wow]
It's me capital B, rap it'll be
different after me, what a disaster to see (yeah)
It's a fact, that no other cat attractive as me (nope)
Can't no other MC step in my IV's (haha)
But see I wrote a booklet for you to get (cope it)
The game on track, a couple platinum plaques
Number one, it's apparent you gotta appeal to parents
Be real when they see through you like you transparent
Number two, I scan the whole world in panoramic
Find a loophole develop my flow, then I ran with it
Now step number three, ha, it ain't that easy (nope)
Gotta listen close if you wanna be Weezy
Dress wild, make sure your attire stay hot
Top to bottom, got them school girls cryin
Step off, you gotta make sure your style remains raw
But wait, there's more (yeah)

[Chorus] - 2X
All you youngn's tryin do it how I done it
What I been ya'll wanna become
But it's nothin now - Follow
All you kids tryin get it how I get it
Wanna spit it how I live it
Won't you listen then - Follow

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
Yeah, gotta have some attitude, can't dress sloppy (no)
Talk with some slang and you gotta act cocky
Make sure your pants sag low
And if you rockin a new Era fitted
Make sure that you stick the shows (haha)
It's a must that you rock two chains (bling)
Cause dog where I'm from, well +Money Ain't A Thang+
Clothes gotta be oversized (yeah) tires real wide
Gotta be a dime or over just so she can ride
Gotta be real smooth, be too cool
Gotta be that cat, that guy, that dude
If you wanna be Bow, watch how I walk this (ok)
Easy, sit back, listen while I'm talkin
Make sure your shoot game is up to par
Make sure you remain number one on "106th &amp; Park" (yeah)
Gotta like your girls ghetto, gotta be a headliner
Gotta be a platinum back to back rhymer
I'm game .

[Chorus] - 2X

[Verse 3 - Bow Wow]
Follow me, follow me but don't lose your grip (ah uh)
Get your cornrows and Shell Toes and learn how to skip
Mix that with a throwback and a flow that's sick
Now hold that pose right there, that's almost it (*cameras flashing*)
And if you wanna copy my jewels
Don't go and get no Looney Tunes tryin do what I do
Like dude I got more karats than that wascaly Rabbit
And it's a fact that I'm responsible for ya'll funny rappers (haha)
I try to let it ride for a minute
But every time I kick a sentence it's like ya'll re-spit it (yeah)
Readmit into the system right after I did it
You kid, you make a living off the way that I'm livin
Copy my image, so I want a percentage
Listen don't be sloppy, I'll show you how to get it
You gotta rhyme hotter, dress proper
So you got a lot a ladies and diamonds in your pocket now
You got it?

[Chorus] - 2X</pre>
