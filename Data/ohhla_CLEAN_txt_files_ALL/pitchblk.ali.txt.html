[Verse One]
From can't see in the mornin'
Breakin' my back, until can't see at night
Number five, back seat I write
Shadows On The Sun with a shabby little light
I would gladly give my life to this battle till it's won
At the crib the
Shower don't get hot
In the winter my kids eatin' Top Ramen for dinner
Listen
I ain't dissin' but there's something that you're missin'
A lot of us are livin' in this type of condition
Buildings filled with heights, tryin' to get their heads straight
Got a baby and the radiator chip lead paint
The land lord, a hustler, he ain't givin' a fuck
If I rift with him too much then this shit will erupt
There's a housing crisis in my city
So if he evict me
There's a long list of kids that are willing to give up their left kidney to
Replace me
Get my place, work my ten hour days and live shitty
Don't push me because I'm close to the edge
Paranoid I pistol at the post of my bed
Why?
Ain't no killer, but I'm half-assed blind
They tryin' to run in the pad and grab what's mine
What?
Busted TV, you can have that
Fine
The book in the front room, I mastered every line
But if you so much as ruffle my curtain tonight
I'm gonna teach your jerky ass about the circle of life

[Chorus]
Wrong side of track
Dark side of the moon
Left side of the brain where he organize the tomb
Choose sides wisely because when you gather your platoon
Cause I show down and draw on your ass like high noon
Wrong side of track
Dark side of the moon
Left side of the brain when he look inside the gloom
Choose sides wisely because when you gather your platoon
Cause I show down and draw on your ass like high noon

[Verse Two]
I show up to the showdown
Get up for the down stroke
Push the brass knuckles through the back of your clown throat
Leave a grease stain like your ass a phantom
I blow out the candle in your jack-o-lantern
The hands of the last man standin'
Magically become cannons when he blast into a tantrum
Whip him, lash him, beat him, batter him
Keep him graspin' for that last gasp of wind
Death rattle pass through him
Let him close his eyes and his bullshit life flash for him
Finally when his soul detaches from within
Catch me passin' through the moonlight, holdin' back a grin

[Chorus]</pre>
