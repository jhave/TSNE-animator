[Intro - Skyzoo - talking] 
I write a little different 
I write a little different 
They say I write a little different 
Write a little different (let's go) 
 
[Verse 1 - Skyzoo] 
Uh, write more than they could listen to 
I jump down to dig a hole that they can listen through 
I'm numb now 'cause all along what I'm givin you 
Is more than you imagined any ballpoint pen could do 
All and all minimal, I ain't roll a sleeve yet 
Breath of fresh air and I ain't breathe yet 
Third lap around and I ain't leave yet 
If I talk different or it come across different, all it is is just a reflex 
Pardon that, I expect 'em to miss a part of that 
Four car lane to explain where my margin at 
Four parts weighed and one part raw 
And even that's over the scale, take one part off 
Assumin you used to it, I ain't cut it the same 
I double back, recut it and then cut it again 
My hands dirty off the way that I waiter, we don't cater alike 
My blog anything that I write (let's go) 
 
[Chorus - Skyzoo] 
They say that I write a little different 
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen 
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen 
But hey, I understand they don't follow how I pen it 
(Go) 
 
They say that I write a little different 
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen 
It's easier to get it if you tighten how you listen 
But hey, I understand they don't follow how I pen it 
(Let's go) 
 
[Verse 2 - Skyzoo] 
Every hero got his theme music 
I made mine to coincide with how you see music 
Content mirrors whatever you be music 
Still up under the honor when I conceive music 
The first caller to call it and work morning to morning 
From off the start of his calling and took a lead to it 
And I'm only followin to follow through 
So if I'm knockin from the bottom then I'm by the roof 
Growth spurt probably, all they ever got from me 
Is step stools that I threw down for them to follow me 
Next move, I move 'round for they apologies 
Opposite of hear me now, guess I'm out of reach 
I be on another note, hoverin above a quote 
Still only curt with the words that I ain't touch or wrote 
And they still couldn't corner me yet 
So I'm back on post like they bought me they check, ya heard? (let's go) 
 
[Chorus] ("go" used instead of "let's go") 
 
[Outro - Skyzoo - talking] 
Write a little different 
They say that I write a little different 
Write a little different 
They say that I write a little different 
Penmanship motherfuckers
