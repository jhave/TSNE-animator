One night grab a mirror we must face our face
So as long as I'm here I'm gonna say what I gotta say

[Hook]

Cuz if you got it down
But if you fake apprecite that you don't come around
Cuz I'm a real nigga I fuck with niggas

[Hook]

Now everybody hollar bout how real recognize real
But the real is that you dick ride faker than three dollar bills
I'm with that white girl watch these faggot suckas squeel
Thought he was a G but aint slangin like that nigga sell
I'm gonna say this one time then I'm gon be through with this
I aint never give a damn bout being the best lyricist
Rhyme it just to put words together
You can kill that shit
As long as when I spit it
These real niggas feelin it
This a purple river but I'm still hard as concrete
Just to heat turning lanes brains in the potted meat
I'm a theif still your man (Damn)
If she jockin me (That's right)
Won't like it buy some time
That's just how its gotta be
