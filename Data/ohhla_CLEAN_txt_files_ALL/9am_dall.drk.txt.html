[Drake]
Yeah, uhh... yeah

These are my one St. Thomas flows; me, my niggaz and some Madonna hoes
They look just like +Virgins+ but trust they down to go
Yeah, discussin life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dinin, pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stackin money from here to the ceilin
Whatever it is I got it's clearly appealin
These other rappers gettin at inferior feelin
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healin
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealin
If ya ain't got it, ya ain't got it, the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is goin, I heard it pays
I just came off makin 2 million in thirty days
Damn, I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here reppin us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin us
Yeah, I know these niggaz miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin like teen spirit
I'd ask kindly if no one out here would bring their feet up
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who ya like? Tell me who it is
I'ma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggaz from my city tryin to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feelin there is the shit
I swear, ahh, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced yo' ass to let up
Why yo' scary ass lookin down? Pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous get-up
With nose plugs in now I can smell a setup
So you just wastin your time, you only makin me better
Yeah, I try to tell 'em don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cashe, that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the oak woods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything has clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
to write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'ma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwin up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
We're still throwin touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses hopin that someone catch it
People say, "That old Drake, we started to miss it"
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Duckin your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to comin in second
But I never sneeze, Y.M.O.E. nigga yeah

Uhh, uhh, yeah, this what y'all want? Ha ha
October's Very Own, Young Money, ATF
"Thank Me Later" in this bitch, what's uuuuup?
Hahaha, yeah, uhh
Free Weezy in this bitch, what's uuuuup?
Ha ha, yeah June 15th in this bitch, what's uuuuup?
Noel, that's it, AH!</pre>
