[Intro]
Long awaited~!! Most anticipated
We back again; as we welcome you
To the Republic, of Cali-for-ni-a
{DJ SKI, The Game, California Republic mixtape}
{Long awaited, droppin Thursday - BITCH!!}

[Chorus]
My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day
Summertime in L.A.

[The Game]
Yeah; I'm from Compton, home of the fiends
Home of the monsters, home of triple beams
... Home of the shattered fuckin dreams
Where most niggaz I grew up with ain't make it to see they teens
Ain't no Freddy, ain't no Jason, but niggaz too scared to dream
And they rippin pages out of them books 'bout Dr. King
You don't wanna know half the shit I seen
where readin a magazine get you hit with a magazine
Niggaz ain't scared to murder cause the jails too packed
Kill a nigga, he be out before the "R.I.P." tat
I seen Raider snapbacks by Starter
Then I seen Dre make that Sox hat harder
Then I seen Makaveli go at Shawn Carter
Then I seen that block where B.I.G. got slaughtered
Then I knew it was my callin, G the fuck up or die ballin
Lace them red Chucks up, but die fallin

[Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
Yo! Let's go
I'm risin in this game and it feels great
Still tryin to keep it real, niggaz still fake
... I'm so impatient, but I still wait
Dropped "The Marathon" in November, niggaz still late
... {*intentionally long pause*}
... Still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, need a high heel eight
Or better, blowing this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever, I'm in to win til this movie ends
Smoking California, eating Peruvian
Out on Miami Beach, my niggaz a few of them
Just like Beverly Hills, the bitches we usually wear
From wishin on a star, nigga took it far
And if I lost it all to war, I wouldn't trip at all
Look; it sound crazy when I say it
But the fear of fallin off is the only thing that could take it
We straight

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I got my hoodie on, it's a Starter
I'ma rock this muh'fucker for Trayvon Martin
I'ma rock this muh'fucker for Trayvon's daughter
that he coulda had; where's his killer at? The whole hood is mad
That ain't the first time, won't be the last
See reflections of my past, while I guzzle through this glass
Make me want to run up on you with the muzzle, "Where the cash?"
Retaliation is none, niggaz can't afford the gas
Got a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates
Red Ghosts in the driveway and ducks by the lake
Spending time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait
Let a nigga call it a duck, he gon' eat a thirty-eight
I'm supposed to be this fuckin rich
I'm supposed to be this fuckin great
I'm a +Menace II Society+, no Larenz Tate
but me and my niggaz straight and

[Chorus]</pre>
