[Boots Riley]
In the military outpost known as hell
We was way too drunk off Muscatel
Prone to fail and get thrown in jail
From the stories that the TV was known to tell
This night at the end of the world
Police sirens sing to boys and girls
Handful of pills to press your curl
Baby shine that light, let your fight unfurl
My confession is also my blessing
Hollered Hail Marys suckin on a Smith &amp; Wesson
May salutations interrupt your isolation
I'm just like you, another profit calculation
I learned a lot from things left at my apartment
Forgotten papers that you dropped on my carpet
Musical chairs, you thought your luck was just startin'
Who told the record to stop?
Took the collection note you left at my spot
And made you origami

Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!
Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!

Prone to fail and get thrown in jail
From the stories that the TV was known to tell
This night at the end of the world
Police sirens sing to boys and girls
Handful of pills to press your curl
Baby shine that light, let your fight unfurl
Dancin' in my kitchen with Sly Stone's permission
Lit my ignition, cursing fascist apparitions
You said your life was something like the inquisition
All you could do was lay there in prone position
I said there's love inside the people connectin' and interactin'
Strugglin', finding direction
That's why you see insurrection
Here's some affection
We the targets of war
Took the eviction note they tacked on your door
And made you origami

Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!
Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!

Handful of pills to press your curl
Baby shine that light, let your fight unfurl
I heard that power is the rum of the brain
And for us it's fixin', not just numbin' the pain
And I'm not just comin' complainin'
I'm just explanin' how this life is a blessin'
I took the farewell note you meant for your exit
And made you origami

Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!
Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!
Woo hoo!!
Good morning, Mrs. Smith!!
Woo hoo!!</pre>
