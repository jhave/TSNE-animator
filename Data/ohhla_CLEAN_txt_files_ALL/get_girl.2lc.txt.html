( *Mr. Mixx cuts in Dolemite* )
(I wouldn't lie to you ... I want you to get ready to get on,
'cause I got some ol' nasty-ass shit to talk tonight!)

(Please somebody...)

(Come on girl)

(Get it) (get-get it) (get it) (get-get it) (get it girl)
(Get it) (get it) (get-get it) (get-get it) (get it girl)
(Get it) (get it) (get-get it) (get-get it) (get it) (get-get it)
(Get-get it) (get it) (get-get it) (get-get it) (get it girl)

[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
I'm the only man that can rock your world

[ Brother Marquis ]
Come with me and let me
(get it) (get-get it) (get it) (get-get it) (get it girl)

( *Mr. Mixx cuts up* )
(Come on girl)
(Get it) (get it) (get it) (get it) (get it girl)

[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
I've been lookin' at you for a while
With your big brown ass and a pretty smile
Every guy call you sexy but your man is weak
He can't satisfy you, baby, I'm your freak

[ Brother Marquis ]
If you want a real man the man is me
Come into my world, I'm your fantasy
'cause where you're goin' is into my world

[ both ]
Just straight up lovin, come and (get it girl)

( *Mr. Mixx cuts up* )
(Don't stop)
(Get it) (get it) (get it) (get it) (get it girl) etc.

[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
When you come to me all you do is ask
'cause your fulfillment is my only task
I won't mislead you or mistreat you
I'll just kiss, hug and squeeze you

[ Brother Marquis ]
When you think of me lovin's on your mind
It's written in the books that I'm one of a kind
I like makin' love seven days a week
Not like your man, I'm just a freak

[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
Your man did you wrong, now it's my turn
After all his dick, I knew you would learn
'cause there ain't another who can rock your world

[ both ]
Just open those legs and let me (get it girl)

(Get it) (get it) (get it) (get it) (get it girl) etc.

(Don't stop)

( *Mr. Mixx cuts in* )
(Grab hold of this, baby)
(Oh no, I can't do that)
(Grab hold of this, baby)
(Oh no)
(I got a big black dick and it stays hard as a rock)
(Fifteen inches long and eight inches thick!)
(Ohhhhhhh!) (Don't get me wrong, I'll take a lil' mo) x4
(Ooh, this is some good pussy) (?Stop her with yo tongue?) x3
(Ooh, this is some good pussy)

(Get it) (get it) (get it) (get it) (get it girl) etc.

(Please somebody)</pre>
