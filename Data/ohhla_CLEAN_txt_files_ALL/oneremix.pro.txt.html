Girl, you looking for a Hot Boy ha, ghetto rough ha
You wanna see how it is to have me tossin' you up ha
Look, I'm 5' 11", bull legged, skinny, you get it and
Now settle down and let Juvie handle his bidness and
Turn it over, tune it up, let me hit that
Ain't a better place you could be so you could quit that
You with that nigga, ha
Playin' games, askin' for change
'Round my people sayin' your name

[Profyle]
Girl, you should know playin' around with fire
And you might get you burned
You must be inside
To think that I'm a hoax playin' me for easy sleezy
Baby, you should know
That not the way I roll
No

1-	Don't play dumb when you know you want some
	You ain't gon' get it
	Baby, you know I ain't the one
	He was your man, but he's my best friend
	So I ain't gon' hit it
	Baby, you know I ain't the one

I just can't understand
Why you wanna go behind the back of my best friend
Messin' around with me
You must be insane
Don't you realize the game recognizes game?
So face reality, don't hate on me

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Don't get it on, get it on
Get it on, get it on, on on
I can't get it on, get it on
Get it on, uh uh uh uh

I ain't crazy (I ain't crazy)
See this is all too close
Don't try to play me (Don't try to play me like a fool)
But baby I ain't the one
Don't play dumb
When you know you want some (Don't you want me baby?)
He's my best friend (He's my friend)
He's your man
Baby I can't go on

[Juvenile]
Ah, whatchu worryin' 'bout me for, babe where you live?
You needs to clean yourself up and take care of them kids
Let me tell you did, I'm a man, you understand?
I don't wanna touch you with my hands, you understand?
But I'm gon' leave that 'lone, let that go
Just make sure it don't happen no more
I'ma hafta admit it girl, you thicker than a sticker
But I'ma let you go cuz you got your nigga witcha

Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
