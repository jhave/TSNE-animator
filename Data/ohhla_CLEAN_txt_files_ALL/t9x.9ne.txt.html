[Tech N9ne]
Fall into a spell way deeper than hell
Sensation was given to me from my homegirl Chelle
Told me, since I was in pain and I like to rebel
This Motorola I'm givin you will suit you real well
Ten minutes twenty minutes thirty minutes feelin funny
Butterflies (Jeah!)
My eyes dilate another size
Overwhelming since of love
Got these nutts so sprung
Walk up to a stranger baby
Can I suck yo tongue?
Tinglin baby got me feelin mingling baby
This is a hella higher learnin than singleton baby
One minute I'm cold next one I'm heat (Jeah!)
Give me some, Big Red so I don't grind my teeth
This is deep
I take another one (Jeah!)
And another one (Jeah!)
And another one
Uh oh here comes the other one (Jeah!)
I'm simulated main
I'm hella blown away
And all my problems that I had have all gone away (Jeah!)
I'ma pop another pill and I'ma take a sip of Carabou to wash it down (Jeah!)
You thinkin I'ma overdose I never had a moment that'll turn a nigga round (Jeah!)
I really wanna get you but I gotta do my dick is in the bed I wanna start (Jeah!)
I feel I wanna fuck you but my dick is really numb
and I don't see me gettin hard (Jeah!)
She told me to take this cap of GHB with a gulp of Mountain Dew with glee
So I could possibly end my existence (Jeah!)
GHB, ain't no need for resistance (Jeah!)
Ecstacy (Jeah!)
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Ecstacy
I love you very much
G-H-B
I love you very much
Shrooms and weed
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience
A-C-I-D
I love you very much
P-C-P
I love you very much
Carabou Lee
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience

[Tech N9ne]
I'm on five pills and a cap of date rape
One Carabou Lou and it ain't even late, great
I feel good (Jeah!)
Let's go to the Ex house
That's where Heather and Marty got everybody Exed out
Walkin the crib
My homegirl say Tech's with me
Cuz she know all the bitches wanna get next to me
I'm a star and ladies wanna have sex with me
But the bitches still get jealous offa Ecstacy
It's like thirty people in the house (Jeah!)
Rave bitches, massage and glow sticks in the mouth (Jeah!)
I take another cap of G with my Mountain Dew (Jeah!)
I'm higher than the top floor of the Fountain Blue (Jeah!)
Somebody said they got the chronic, line it up mane (Jeah!)
Let's smoke it all til we fall then get up again (Jeah!)
I wanna fuck but I'm numb cuz I'm fizzled up (Jeah!)
Skip to the Lou, I tried to piss dick is shriveled up (Jeah!)
My nigga Kutt got the blunt nigga pass it (Jeah!)
I didn't even know you was here
so he passed it with a couple hits of acid (Jeah!)
Like I refuse to stay alive (Jeah!)
It's pills and mo thrills, I'm lucky if I survive
I'm high!

[Chorus]
Ecstacy
I love you very much
G-H-B
I love you very much
Shrooms and weed
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience
A-C-I-D
I love you very much
P-C-P
I love you very much
Carabou Lee
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience

Dipped out the Ex house
It's right around two
Off to Westport to kick it with the Hurricane Crew
Saw my niggas C and G after party at the room
My homegirl Iesha slipped me a couple grams of shrooms
Damn, it don't stop
Embasy suites three o'clock
With my niggas C and G
Make a hella G and E
I get, two more hits of that Ecstacy shit
I don't wanna come down off that Ecstacy trip
Bitches, in the room lookin so fresh so clean
A couple, hella high panties, and brought no jeans
My nigga said that he got codeine
Mixed it with cherry roper tussin and duece I took a sip of his lean
In the bathroom to bust a shit (Jeah!)
I couldn't do it so my bitch came to suck the dick (Jeah!)
It was hard and soft but hard enough to penetrate the slit (Jeah!)
Bout twenty minutes damn near fainted when it was time to spit (Jeah!)
Five o'clock in tha mornin and we still zoned (Jeah!)
Seven o'clock in tha mornin pill is still on (Jeah!)
This life I live, I might not die
If let lone (Jeah!)
Love my experience
This is my fucked up life (Jeah!)
Don't try this at home
Yeah!

[Chorus]
Ecstacy
I love you very much
G-H-B
I love you very much
Shrooms and weed
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience
A-C-I-D
I love you very much
P-C-P
I love you very much
Carabou Lee
I love you very much
This is the Tech N9ne experience
