[Chorus: x2]
I just call her boo
I don't know her whole name
Keep it on the low mane
All we eat is lo mien
Came from the block
Now I gotta whole thang
And you betta put a low jack on yo hoe mane

[Tity Boi]
I just call her boo
I think her name is Shawna
What I really know bout the girl that drive the Honda.
I just call her boo
I think her name is isha, might be Tasha might even be Keisha.
All I really know her baby daddy wanna feature
And when they ran up on me she damn near had a seizure
See I just call her boo
I think her name is Ana
I met her in Miami, she say she from Atlanta
I just call her boo and she finish school
And she like to drink and like to smoke my reefer too
See I just call her boo
I think her name was Tonya
I know she from Decatur, she got a stupid onion

[Chorus: x2]
I just call her boo
I don't know her whole name
Keep it on the low mane
All we eat is lo mien
Came from the block
Now I gotta whole thang
And you betta put a low jack on yo hoe mane

[Yo Gotti]
Shawty stupid dumb thick I just call her red
Now that I think about it maybe I should call ahead
She got that super fire I can't even lie
She like a water park she ain't never dry
And I just call her bae and she just call me gotti
Ain't no relationship we just fuckin shock
She got her own bread shawty school me in a drop
Her mama own some daycares her brother got them blocks
And she a college girl sophomore I hit her in the dorm
On the hard floor she got her shit together so I respect her more
So if she ask me for some money she is not a whore

[Chorus: x2]
I just call her boo
I don't know her whole name
Keep it on the low mane
All we eat is lo mien
Came from the block
Now I gotta whole thang
And you betta put a low jack on yo hoe mane

[Tity Boi]
I hate lame niggas so this a hate crime
Rich niggas shit up on em a gang sign
Gotta glock 40 in my waist line
Just bought a new crib by the lake side
What is life like it's love and I love my girl
Show up life a big spenda I'm tryna fuck the world
Yeah fuck em girl you ain't gotta go back
Call em tell em that yo pussy got kidnapped
And she layin with her forehead on my six pack
Yeah we got something in common we like big stacks
Yeah I know her name but I like to call her boo
You shoulda put a chirp on her so she wouldn't move

[Chorus: x2]
I just call her boo
I don't know her whole name
Keep it on the low mane
All we eat is lo mien
Came from the block
Now I gotta whole thang
And you betta put a low jack on yo hoe mane</pre>
