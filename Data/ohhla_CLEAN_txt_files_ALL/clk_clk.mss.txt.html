[Missy Elliott]
When I walk up in the club, they be pushin
Misdemeanor got that ice to keep them lookin
Crop top, drop top on my Phantom man
They trippin and them haters just pussies
Feelin on me, feelin on me like a porn star
I drive fast car, still shave my cho-cha
Get the cash, get the cheddar, get the beams mean
Ching-a-ling, bling-bling, my money real green

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat, playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back

I fall down, get up, then I gotta dust it off
Say you dust it off?!
Yeah I quickly dust it off
I'm off the walls, I do brawls
I don't stall, yes it's on
Said it strong, I can't be cloned
You can call me Mike Jones
3-0-5 2-1-2 8-0-4 is my cell
Yall must dumb as hell
If you think that is my cell
Hotel, motel, holiday don't play
Around the way, O.J.,yeah, I'm so icey
What them haters say, Misdemeanor okay
Call me 4 play, position more than 40 ways
Like a chocolate glaze, I'm hotter than a summer day
Stingray, Sugar Ray
Knuckles all up in your face

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat, playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back

I blocka-blocka, straight jocka
Matter fact, the face snappa
Money stacka, no slacka
Hit record, gun strappa
I hit-hit, hear my click-click
Two snaps, you hit
Then I click-click
I make cash, pay them bills
I pay them bills to buy new wheels
I wear high hills, I touch and feel
Catch me in your mans grill
My record deal, my movie deal
Is super sick-sick, I click-click
And if you doubt me I'll click-click
Smack dem boi's, I will destroy
Hit-hit, straight down and spilt-spilt ya boi
I kick-kick like karate flicks-flicks
Ya get ya ass bit, don't make me have click

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat, playa betta fall back
So step back, playa betta fall back
Click clack, cock back, semi automatic track
Drink a lot of similac, shorty betta fall back</pre>
