Verse 1: (B.G.)
Money makin' is my thing
A mill is what I'm tryin' to reach
Good shit to my peeps is what the fuck I preach
Baby Gangsta is my title
Al Kapone is my idile
To protect and serve 
I roll with my assault rifle
Jack niggaz  for nothin' less than a quarter key 
Take hits on buster niggas..... startin' at five G's
Oh, I'm the young nigga dressed in black on black
With glocks to mack in the hoop in 'dis black on black
Spillin' brains ain't nothin but a thang to me
Sellin cane and fame ain't nothin but a thang to me
When you see the B.G. 
I run wit' all real niggas
Valence and Magnolias
It list nothing but trill niggas
And we get ill, tryin' pay the bills, nigga
Use the skills to hustlin to make a mill nigga
For information w'ere beachin' to make you squeel nigga
Don't spill, we use the index finger to kill nigga
How u feel gettin caught up in my paper chase 
Ya' feel the deal gettin caught up in my paper chase 
Go out the way 'for my pockets to be nice and fat
I tote that K 'for my pockets to be nice and fat 
Picture a nigger from uptown wit' a million
Actin' bad, buyin' motherfuckin' buildins
Get out the way or give your cash to me
You see, I bring heat backed up by B.G.
Young niggas gettin busy
Totin' K's like it ain't nothin' 
Uptown niggas buckin' like it ain't nothin'
Baby given coke to the young soldiers 
I told ya we takin' over
Knockin' heads off shoulders
Think you boulder 'cause you older, but I'm colder
With the trigger I'll run all over ya'
Niggas talkin' yat and stuff
Wan' be rough, but I'ma see if you can back it up
Wan' be tough 
Let's take to a triller level
Let's get iller like a guerilla 
On the killer level
Just fuck wit' me that's all I'm wishin'
I'ma dust ya' 
Because I know you're softer than whoopie cushion
I be dishin' clips in and out like a ??? cat 
Come from the back in black 
Ready t-t-to attack-tack 
I'll leave 'ya flat, nigga
  
(Chorus)
1,2,3
3,2,1
Cashmoney Niggas got the biggest guns
It's like the hip to the hop
The glock to the hip
You best rush home
'For you get bust on....skip
  
Verse 2: (Turk)
I'm tryin' to be cool in this game
This shits nothin' nice 
Play wit' niggas 'dese days
They'll leave yo' body cold as ice
But I say fuck 'em all
My ball never fall
Five feet eight inches tall
My back against the wall
All I do is fuck hoes 
I got dreams to make a mill
Like them niggas in the nolia
The hustlin' skills pays my bills 
But still keep my hand on my glock just in case
Niggas try'na plot seventeen shots gonna stop 
The many tracks and that's a fact
Leavin' niggas on they back 
Bitches play goin' get smacked
Espicially if I don't disrespect you
And you disrespect me
I'ma have to show 'ya 
That I'm out that fuckin' M-a-g(Magnolia)
I'm keepin' it real wit' my click, 226
Smoke weed, hit P, get a lil' dizzy
Take sips off daquiries 
Ridin' five-hundreds Benz across town
Me, Duga, and B gettin to' down
Actin' wild, three young niggers
Don't mind pullin' the fuckin trigger
  
Baby:That's the return of the trill as niggers
  
Verse 3: (Bullet)
Livin' uptown you got's to flight 
Get down and take it like
High School ?????
And I'll be finish over night
28 grams and it's on
The make me four g's strong
Young ballers stay shop
???? and ???
Hoes on my bones 
I bust a nut and I quit
Lil' ?? be my click 
Back to this gangsta shit
I'm movin' six tryin' to get rich
Do my third to bricks
Now where I lay my head at 
Small baller beleive that
That's why I get paid at
Off some silver ??
Dressed in black 
Wit' two gats a glock and mac
You got's to play it like that
??? ?? and 'dem sacs
Snatchin' grounds or get jacked
Now grab that thing and bust back 
I got some killers on my team out that S.T.P.
Dugie, Nautice, Goldface, and J.B.
?? broke out a house ???????
??? ????? s-t tryna' get my nose dirty
  
(Chorus)2x
