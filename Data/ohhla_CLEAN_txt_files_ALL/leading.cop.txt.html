[Copywrite]
Y'all motherfuckers wanna hear some heat?
Might Mi, turn this shit up 'til my eardrums bleed
Any label give me conterfeit money (Uh-huh)
I like pickin up Beetlejuice from the crib, I'm bout to get ugly
EC All-Stars Part II, it's not a game
Fully equipped with lots of brains, gettin lots of brains
Fuck with us, make ya life a constant pain
But I ain't gotta drop no names just watch a Rasta play
(You!) Soft as clay, put the gun away bitch!
My teams off the chain like a runaway pit {*barking*}
I ain't Christ but I'm one of his kids
But more like the Anti-Christ drunk off Brandy-n-ice, and I'm nice
Not sober and we brought doja
Team smoke like we got gloucoma {*coughing*}
Twist the trees and still spit with ease
You'd think I was Lil' Kim's main-squeeze the way I eat bitch MC's
