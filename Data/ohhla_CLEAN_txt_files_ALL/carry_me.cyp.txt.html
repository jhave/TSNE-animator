[B-Real + (Mike Shinoda):] 
I was an outcast, outsider. - Trouble maker
A lost soul! - Outta control in danger
Didn't have a care in the world, my feeling were numb 
Never showing emotion, it's easy for some
I don't know how it happened? How I got to this point? 
But I needed a way out; I was stuck in a ploy
I needed another path or I'd self destruct 
I was down on my luck; my head was so fucked! 
A menace rollin' the streets is what I was 
Holdin' my heat and rollin' with the serious thugs 
You couldn't tell me a thing, I was like my brother
Words went in one ear and out the other
Slangin' and bangin' - with a chip on my shoulder
"An insane, hit the brain! " [echoes] Certified street soldier! 
So close to the grave, [echoes] (Oooooooooooohoooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!) 
You at an early age, can't tell you the price I've paid! 

[Chorus: Mike Shinoda] 
Oh the sky overhead, it's like - a canvas of grey
I don't know how much time I'll be given to stay
From the first spring to light, 'til the end of the day 
I'm just livin' my life, 'til they come carry meee awaaaaaaaayyyyyyy! 

[Sen Dog + (Mike Shinoda)] 
I've been there in LA nights in the block where I came up 
My pops used to hate when we hanged with them bangers
Guess he knew one day that we'll become us 
That's just how it is when you live where we come from [echoes] 
"Fight, don't run! " is the motto we live by 
Get 'em on the ground and stomp a mind about ten times! 
Sure we was just kids back then 
I had no remorse for what we did back then [echoes] 
Six of us, one call, we'd all pack in 
Hit the strip, and go and get the shit crack in! 
Gun wars, and drug deals, I seen 'em happen
When I started losin' homeboys, I wasn't laughin'! [echoes] 
I looked all around and seen none of 'em there! 
That's when I figured out - that nobody cared! 
If we lived or die; we'll just get high and ride (Oooooooooooohoooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!) 
And I wasn't gonna let this happen one more time! 

[Chorus] 

[B-Real:] 
My mother would stand for me every step of the way 
She did not judge me! She told me I'd win some day! 
When I was at my lowest - when I had no focus 
She pulled me out the gutter, said I wasn't hopeless 
Every night she prayed for me I was out on the street 
Chillin' on the corner with the hand on my heat! 
Eyes open wide for the pigs and foes 
It's an every day hazard when you hustle for dough! 
So many nights I didn't come home, she thought the worst 
Maybe somebody shot me down without any remorse
Maybe I hurt somebody and I was stuck in a cell 
Well I regret all those time that I put her through hell! 
When I reflect back on those days, my heart aches 
And everybody I lost or let down, I wish I could take it 
All back and make it better but I can't, so I try to make amends 
And be there, through thick and thin! 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda] 
Come carry meee awaaaaaaaayyyyyyy! 
Come carry meee awaaaaaaaayyyyyyy! 
Come carry meee awaaaaaaaayyyyyyy! 
Come carry meee awaaaaaaaayyyyyyy!</pre>
