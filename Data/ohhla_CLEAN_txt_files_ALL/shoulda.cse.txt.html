[Intro: Ghostface Killah (Case)]
Yeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah), Tony Starks ya'll, Ghost Dieni and Case
Come on, (oh yeah) yeah, whattup man, sing that *censored*
Let em have it

[Case]
Been around the world, ladies come and go
Till I tell myself, you weren't one of those
That's what I get for being alive
I'm not upset, or heading upstairs

[Chorus: Case]
Tried to love you, tried to keep you
Never made a difference I see, shoulda known better
I feel so dumb, ?maybe loved one?
Never made a difference I see, shoulda known better

[Case]
Such a perfect love, so I thought it was
But you weren't loving you, girl instead I'm loving none
That's what I get for being alive
I'm not upset, girl I can't believe how much I really loved you
And I really don't believe how much I cared
So I guess I made a fool up out of myself
But believe me, it wasn't meant to be

[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo pardon me son, yo let me jump in Case
Been through the same (censored) bro, know what you talking bout dog
Stopped this young thing from eating pork
Now she on the phone hollering (censored) you and child support
That I ain't go no CREAM, and the kids they gon get it
Cause as soon as she get it, she gon spend it
And that's what I get just for loving her more
Got me feeling like a stranger when I walk in the door
Looking at me like it's my fault (word)
But devious thoughts in the back of her head wishing the kid fall off
And get laid off or get sprayed off or lose my face
But I refuse, like a plane, I'ma take off
And boost my carreer (yeah)
Now that I'm alone I think without stress, word to mother, can't slow down
I'm a Taurus the bull, when I love, I love too hard
A earth sign that love is love and respet God</pre>
