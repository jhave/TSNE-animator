[Chorus - Keys] 
If only I could see you again 
I will make sure that those days never end 
If only I could do it all again 
Just to have one more chance 
I'll never let it go 
 
[Fabolous talking over Chorus] 
I mean life's not like that though 
Sometimes you only get one shot 
Most times, yeah 
 
[Verse 1 - Fabolous] 
Don't you hate a could of, would of, should of nigga? 
Could of did, would of did, well you should of nigga (nigga) 
I am never on the iffy shit 
You see her with me, you ain't gotta wonder if he hit 
My daddy was a player too, Ken Griffey shit 
He said kill these hoes and get the death certificates (haha) 
So when I do me, I over do it 
In the red Rover sendin bitches over to it 
Might use the Caddy, part-time golfer 
But act now I'm a limited time offer 
And I'm off the, chain like a stray dog 
If I want it, I'm a fetch it, I don't play dog (I don't play dog) 
I see the game from a sick angle 
New York had a chance, the bitch pick Tango 
In my case you get one opportunity 
Minus convertible, so let's call it drop-tunity, haha 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Verse 2 - Fabolous] 
Get a slice of the pie now, you wait 'til the pizza's cold 
Then you sayin what you +Shoulda+ did like Keyshia Cole 
+I Should Have Cheated+ (nah), I +Shoulda Let You Go+ (nah) 
I just shake 'em off (yeah), Etch A Sketch a ho (haha) 
I draw a blank, back to the drawing board 
I'm like Michael Jordan if we talkin scorin broads (damn) 
To me you got one chance to miss ya shot (yeah) 
Better get ya J up (yeah), life is not a layup (nah) 
Meanin, sometime they make it hard 
Like a straight dude, naked broad get on top of me 
Why give an inch if she can take a yard? (woo) 
You land on "Chance," take a card, it's Monopoly 
I think past "Go" (yeah), 200 on my mental dash though 
And my foot is on the gas ho 
If opportunity ain't there, make one 
They ain't give me a chance, so I had to take one, Los' 
 
[Chorus] 
 
[Fabolous talking over Chorus] 
Niggaz be lookin at shit that's right in front of 'em man 
They don't even see their chance is right in front of 'em 
You know? It's fucked up 
 
[Verse 3 - Fabolous] 
I look at Obama and I more than glance 
I don't just see change, I saw a chance 
How many hustlers do you know waitin for a chance? 
Some pedal more than Lance in the Tour de France 
How many convicts inside waitin for a break? 
That's rare, short time, waitin for a steak 
How many shooters holdin heat, waitin for a shot? 
Fall asleep in the car waitin for a shot 
Sniper's in D.C., I know what he see 
I'm tryin to put you on to it, Cici 
Just ate fried chicken, I took greasy 
I told this bitch I'm a Mac/Mack not a P.C. (haha) 
I sit niggaz down, don't let 'em stand a chance 
Only way you squares ride is a ambulance 
Kill 'em while you got a chance in a Bronco 
Or it comes back in the end, Benny Blanco, yes
