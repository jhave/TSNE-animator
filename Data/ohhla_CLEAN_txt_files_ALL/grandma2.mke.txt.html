CHORUS (Mike Jones)
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
I think of you daily without you here I'm crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you

VERSE I
You was more than a grannie, you was my homie
You stayed by my side never left me for lonely
When daddy ran out on me and left me alone
You and momma was there just to help me along
You gave me the ?
And because of you my life took a change, my life took a change
You gave me the ?
And because of you my life took a change, my life took a change
My Amy is happy now my momma is good
Got them out of the ghetto now they all livin good
My Amy is happy now my momma is good
Got them out of the ghetto now they all livin good

CHORUS Repeats (Mike Jones)

VERSE II
It's been a while grandma, since I last wrote you ya know
You helped me out more than you know grannie
Last album, I sold two million copies, thanks to you
All the game that you gave me, I put it to use
And now I'm here
(ohh ohhh)
I'm about to drop a tear on this track man
Everything that I wanted to give for you, give to you
You ain't here right now
(Grannie I think of you daily without you I'm goin crazy)
Y'all wonderin why Kai soundin so cold singin that part right there
She just lost her grandmother too
I had to get somebody on here who could understand what I'm goin through
I'ma sit back and let her tell you her side you know what I'm sayin?
Shit ain't easy, believe me man

Verse III (KAI)
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
I thank you for the love that you gave me
I thank you for the way that you raised me
I thank you for givin me my momma
I thank you for bringin me out of drama
I never forget the smile, nooo
Or you telling me you're proud of me for livin my dreams
And you don't know what you mean to me
And I miss you wanna say I love you
I'll be always thinking of you
I'm thinking bout you
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
Thinkin of you always
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
Grannie I think of you daily without you here I'm goin crazy
Grannie I love you and I'm thinking of you
