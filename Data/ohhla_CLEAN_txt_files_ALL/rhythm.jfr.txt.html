In the beginning.. there were many
As time went on there became few
Now there is only one..
One man.. ONE DJ.. standing alone.. on Mount Olympus
Ladies and gentlemen, DJ, Jazzy Jeff!

Alright, alright I reckon
Back up off of my DJ
Give him some room to operate here, c'mon!

Ay Jeff, this what we gettin ready to do right?
'Member how we used to rock back home in Philly right?
At ALL the house parties and all the ballrooms and stuff like that
'Member how we used to rip things up at like ? Room,
and Central High, and Overbrook High
and all them places like that?
This what I want to do right --
-- I want to give these people a little taste of how we used to rock
How we used to get on the wheels of steel
Used to just throw the records on -- and just get stupid
Back forth left right crooked upside down and all that stuff
I want you to do all that stuff for these people right
cause I talk all the time
I tell everybody how def you are
Everytime we go somewhere I be yellin and screamin
I want you to get busy on your own Jeff
I want you to tear these records up Jeff, rip em apart
Go 'head now man get busy, go Jeff go

{DJ Jazzy Jeff gets buck on the turntables}

Worrrrrrrrrrd!
I'm telling you, this man can not be taken
He can't be beaten, don't keep on talkin
All you other DJ's, don't keep on talkin
Jeff, this what I want you to do
Take that record from the top right?
Scratch it in right now
and I want you to do what's called a breakdown
Just break it down for em right?
Now start it with the music
and then cut the music out and just break it down for em Jeff go ahead

Now break it down

{DJ Jazzy Jeff does the breakdown}

Ahhh Jeff, that was DEF man, that was def!
But you, you did it too fast man
You gotta do it a little slower this time
Or or maybe no music, yeah that's what we can do
Yeah, that's the ticket, that's the ticket
Ay Jeff, just break it down with no music right
Bring it in, now bring it down and then do it slower
No music so everybody can hear it

Now isn't that special?

{DJ Jazzy Jeff does the breakdown}

Yeah Jeff, that was def!
Hold up, now you had enough time to warm up back there man
Are you ready to really get stupid?  {Jeff scratches "Yes!"}
I didn't hear you man
You read to cold rip things apart or what?  {Jeff scratches "Yes!"}
You ready man?  I didn't hear you  {Jeff scratches "Yes!"}
Aight I'm with it..
Aight Jeff, now hold up
'Member the other DJ, that DJ approached us
Man he was talkin all that trash about how good he was
What did you tell him that he could do?  {Jeff scratches "Eat shit!"}
{Jeff scratches "Eat shit!"}
What'd you tell him?  {Jeff scratches "Eat shit!"}
And you know he +STILL+ kept talkin trash right?
He talked +ALL+ that trash Jeff
And then the next day we found out that he had took your stuff
but you didn't even care
What'd you tell him he could do?  {Jeff scratches "Bite it!"}
What'd you say he could do?  {Jeff scratches "Bite it!"}
Now what did it sound like when he bit it?  {Jeff stretches the UTFO sample}
{Jeff stretches the UTFO sample}

Aight, enough about that guy, you know what I was just thinkin about?
'Member the other day we were walkin down the street
and that girl came up to you and she was lookin you up and down and grinnin
and she wasn't real, what'd you tell her?  {Jeff scratches ???}
What?  {Jeff scratches ???}
You even broke it down for her, get busy  {Jeff scratches ???}
Yo word now after she felt it and found out it was real man
you kinda looked like you was widdit a little bit man
You was movin and all that stuff man
She had her hands all over you
Hold up tell everybody what you started screamin man
{Jeff scratches "Don't stop!"}
Hold up tell em louder I didn't hear you  {Jeff scratches "Don't stop!"}
{Jeff scratches "Don't stop!"}

Yo word, that was def
Ay Jeff man, that's just the way we used to rock it!
Man we used to RIP crowds up, but hold up
'Member how when all them DJ's used to be on the stage
and everything after you got off
They'd be whisperin and sayin stuff to themselves
about how you ain't this you ain't that
What did you used to do Jeff?

{Jeff lets the sample of Vincent Price cackling go he was holding back}

Word, Rhythm Trax - House Party Style
