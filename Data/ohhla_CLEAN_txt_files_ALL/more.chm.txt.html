[Baby Cham]
C'mon, C'mon

[Singer](Baby Cham)
You should know we want it all (uh huh)
Nothing in this world is free (uh huh)
That's why I'm gonna get that money (uh huh)
It's all about looking up for me (uh huh)
Oh yeah, you wanna hit this Na Na? (uh huh)
Gotta take me on a shopping spree (uh huh)
Gotta buy me a six double-o
Before you talk about love to me

[Foxy Brown] (Baby Cham)
(uh huh) That's right, ladies
Don't puff for no broke niggas (no no)
Niggas with no dough (cash flow)
Can't get no ass, no poom poom (that's right)
That's right (Baby Cham)
I'm here to let y'all niggas know
(Foxy Brown) That's right
There's only one thing you can do for us
Uh! (c'mon, c'mon *echoes* let em know)

[Foxy Brown](Baby Cham)
If you know anything about a Brooklyn chick
They don't give nuthin unless they rich, and (uh huh)
Since I'm the original dun da dun
Rapstress, it's obvious
I'm like a Playboy bunny (what)
I love to pose nude (what)
A six page spread (what)
Some Prada shoes (what)
So, imagine me with somebody like you
Run up in the ass, with nuthin to stash?
I don't give a <fuck>, give me somethin to crash
Like a 600 Benz, a drop top Jag (that's right)
Me and my girls on trips to Trinidad
Spend a little dough in the Gucci store (what)
Pop a little Crys, little bottle of the Moet
Know you love to see a chick when I'm mobbing ?like whoa?
Just a little hint, I like my wrist froze
H-Class rocks from my nose to my toes (woo!)
I'm a sassy chick and everybody knows
[Both] "Y'know, she look nice, I'll put her in clothes"
Nigga named Dex, he from John Crow
Stay talkin bout all them big bankroll
Ahead of my years, switch my full gears
Original rudegal, poom poom pierce
Uh, uh, uh! (c'mon, c'mon. C'mon, c'mon)

Uno know them cars and bigwigs
Our designers causing big hits
Wanna be with champion guzzlers
Chicks wanna be dating the hustlers
Plat'num cars slashing at the 'mounts
On my cell phone making booty calls
Wanna see Victoria Secret drugs
You know we loved it on the ground
Chyna looks nice (I'll hit that)
At whatever price (I'll get that)
You go girl (you don't have to)
Say what girl? (but I want to)
You know we making moves and all
Plat'num plaques hanging on my wall
Seven figures keep on rolling in
So I can buy you anything!
