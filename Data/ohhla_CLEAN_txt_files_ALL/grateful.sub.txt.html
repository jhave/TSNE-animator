HOOK (Kokayi)
Hey, if somehow I find a way
Just to make through today
I will say that I'm so grateful
If I die before the break of day
There is nothing more to say
But for the time we've shared, I'm so grateful

Verse 1 (Kenn Starr)
I re-emerge back from the ashes
Born again back from the past tense
Sorta like The Passion, the backlash from them back lashes
Our future and our present and past sins wrapped in
A sacrifice, askin' myself if I'm rappin'
For the right reasons, scared cuz it seems if
A lifetime dream might be just for season
If that's the case then how am I 'sposed to leave it
Believe that I could do this forever and a day
But to God man forever is a day
So I'm set up either way
Tryna find answers
Yeah a nigga pray, wondering if mine answered
Like gettin' a catscan and hopin' that they don't find cancer
I'm hopin' that all my fans stand up
Show me your support and tell me you still listen
Lemme know if its cool to keep it real for a minute
Let's build for a minute can anybody relate to
Being in the game strugglin' to stay faithful
Not to a lover or a significant other
But the morals instilled when you was lil' from your mother
But still it's a mother navigating through an industry
Infatuated with hatin' and friends turn to enemies
Saturated with the temptation to take a turn towards
Chasin' the fame and admiration ain't tryna burn for it

HOOK

Verse 2 (Substantial)
When my last experience has been acquired
And I arrive at the date I will expire
I hope I am surrounded by extraordinary folks that I admire
And hopefully a few that I've inspired
Nothing here is certain, except the show must end and they'll eventually close the curtain
But will my life be worthy of an encore
Or standing ovation, man I'm so gracious
Even though I put in more work than job core
Walking the line between heartfelt and hardcore
Transforming pages into little paper Concordes
So I can travel the sky before I live in it
No regrets y'all if my all's what I'm giving in it
This song ain't about what I should've did different
Just appreciatin' each moment up to this minute
This Kick, this Snare, this Bar
I'm ecstatic that I've made it this far, this heart
Could've cease to beat and I would hardly be seizing beats
Or even see my seed or greet peeps with "Peace"
I would rest in it, that's a definite
And my goal's to never quit 'til I'm a resident
Of a casket or better yet an earn
The sun will shine forever while you burn baby burn
Last words to my daughter would be learn baby learn
And make your mark
Can't break your spirit even though they might break your heart!
