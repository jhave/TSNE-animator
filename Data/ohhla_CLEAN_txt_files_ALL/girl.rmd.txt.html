[Girl1] I got into another fuckin fight with my nigga today
[Girl2] See what I'm sayin? Niggaz ain't shit
        Especially them project niggaz
[Girl1] For real, peep those niggaz right there
[Girl2] What you mean?
[Girl1] That nigga right there, that six foot night right there
        Tossin his fuckin nines like he's the Don
[Girl2] Nah, nah, nah, shorty right there

[Cappadonna]
Girlfriend, what you did was wrong
Baby my love is still strong
on some King Kong ding-dong
Never celebate, never souflan
poppi kin, poppi wardrobe king
Suck her G-spot, and you know she so hot
She said she love me a lot
Remedy, she told me she drop
Fuck her so hard, all outdoors
Pussy is mines and plus yours
Didn't mean to turnin em out, turnin em on
Stetched out in front the next girl house
BB dick out, Remedy, slash Cappadon'
Slash pardon me for turnin you on
Turnin you on

[Chorus: Cappadonna]
Girlfriend
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct
Didn't mean to turn you on
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct

[Remedy]
Check that yo, fuck what he thinks
You know the pussy bleeds and stinks
Buy ya tranked out, blanked out, all crazy in pink
I seen the pussy kill the best of men and take down kings
Fuck material things, fuck ya phat diamonds rings
Men do lifetime bids for this, 2 lips hit the clitoris
Inconspicous, hit with Syphilis, ridiculous
One gash, came between the man and the stash
Half his cash, sucker for love ass
Souflan, no doubt, was never in the plan
Ball-and-chain, pussywhipped man can't understand
It's like the Cappadon said
MCF means you thinkin with ya head
If you thinkin with ya dick son, ya might get sick
Cuz when it comes to the piece son, ain't shit for free
Either pay for every piece of it or start a family
Now all rise and eyes on the prize of this song
And if I did I never meant the girl to turn you on

[Cappadonna]
Sellin ya gold, sellin ya soul
You crossed out, and crossed over
Gold digga and Hilfiger, booster and strippa
Flip on a nigga too quicka
Projects, is what I deal wit
Cold-hearted chicks catch on fast
Twist they ass, take more cash, and more crack
Tishy on the block, like bitches never do that
I protect females that fuck me on the first night
Bitin my spray nozzel, see Goines
Turnin y'all ladies, off and on, popcorn
Freddy Kruger, thoughts of how I'm gon' do ya
Ya mind all screwed up, BB conduct
All of y'all girls are outta luck
Takin too long, givin ya shit up
BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct, BB conduct

Chorus to fade w/ variations

[Outro: Remedy]
Turn you on..
