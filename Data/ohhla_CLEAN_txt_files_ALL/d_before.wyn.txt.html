Intro:
Ohh, this feel good, alright, yay
Carter tray, on it, let's play, haha

(Chorus)
Okay
I know two girls that done did it before
But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before

Verse 1:
Okay, put your hands up if you did it before
Now your girl lookin' at you cause she didnt hell know
And now everybody sayin' that you did it before
And you know that's because that they did it before
'Cause if they did it before it would be different though
I wonder if Tammy knows, that I did it before
With Nisa, I wonder if if she didn't hell know
That we did it before I know they did it before
The day we did it for oh, if they did it before
And we didn't before, we can get it fa 'sho
'Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa 'sho
I'm a tear that pussy up, like I did it before
And after I did it they baby sister be know
When I see her i'm a act like I didn't hell know
That we did it before like didn't before
But we did it before, hehe

(Chorus)

Verse 2:
Yeah, so if you did it before be a pro
You gotta act like you did it before
And everytime I meet a girl
they say that she did it before
You know I gotta act like I never did it before
But she be deep cover if she didn't hell know
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
if she think that I didn't, hell know
That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla give me some more
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four
And when four-o-one came, she was hittin the door
Not fixin' to go but she was hittin' the door
And I was probablly butt naked just twistin' an o
Then I call my homies up, kick the shit how did it go
And I know they gon' laugh 'cause they did it before

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
Okay, alot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like they didnt below
Or if they did it with more, yeah, if they did it for dough
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before
oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
ya'll probablly did it before, she probablly licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can vision you both
Like I done did it before 'cause I done did it before

(Chorus)</pre>
