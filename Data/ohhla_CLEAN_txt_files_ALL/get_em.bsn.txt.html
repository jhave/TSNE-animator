[Chorus]
(Uh) Man verse by verse I'm a make these weak niggas' disperse (sweet nigga)
Man I swear verse by verse I'm a make these weak rappers disperse (sweet nigga)
Man I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh)
I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em' (uh) I'm a get em

[Verse]
I'm very instrumental, to any instrumental; you ain't on my level my nigga, even a little
You at the bottom, not even at Malcolm in the middle
You homo ass nigga, (shh) go-N eat some skittles
Now hop up on the rainbow try to reach where I hang though
I'm a little further up then and near the angels
So at your highest point you still wouldn't reach my ankles
You are what you eat but that ain't true cause I'm anal... (eww)
And the people show love like a bear hug
I'm here to last, they temporary call em' haircuts
Fair enough I stand behind my balls like a felon does
If you a boss, meet the executor and when it come to paper, meet the editor
(Uh) A little better brah you need to step, step it up
I'm on my business that's my forte, you
You beat around the bush like four play
And they anticipatin' me like a court date
So for the bars I'm a charge like the court say
And if the court say they know I did it like OJ (what?)
Then I'm in the next city like a tour date
There ain't no I in team but it's an I in win
Ain't no I in lose but there's an I in him
Mini me... Me... mini muahh... so beat the repitwa of the upper extra lode
That's high, high in the sky, high to the point that I almost saw God. (Wow).
I stand out from the rest like Yao
But ain't gotta play ball to having you cheering... (The crowd)
Perform so well I might as well take a bow
Shittin on these niggas' like a movement from my bowels
People wanna know how if feels in the clouds
But I guess they'll never know cause I'm never coming down
I started with a dream, added a little faith in, mixed it with adversity and let it marinate.
I put it in the oven for awhile and let it bake (yup)
Call it food for thought, put it on yo' plate
A friend of mighty Motown, home sweet home
Where I roam like a phone in the unknown zone
My niggas' roam like a phone in the unknown zone
And we condone a tone a money hoes and clothes
And my record sell like a boat load
Fam you couldn't fill my shoes like bozos
And I'm solo, cause I herd that what hoes really want... is a ring like froto. (no)
Coastal, man my nickname postal
Why they loco like they old schools (mannn?)
I should beat them like pro tools
Will Farrell nigga started out old school

[Chorus]
Man verse by verse I'm a make these weak niggas' disperse (sweet nigga)
Man I swear verse by verse I'm a make these weak rappers disperse (sweet nigga)
Man I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh)
I'm a get em (ehh) I'm a get em (uh) I'm a get em (ehh) Watch me get em (uh) I'm a get em</pre>
