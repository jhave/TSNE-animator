"There is no delayin' in the rhyme I'm sayin'" (Yeah)
"The beat is funky" (It's going down tonight, uh)
"And my word is bond"
"There is no delayin' in the rhyme I'm sayin'" (Uh, no, no)
"The beat is funky" (Don't wanna spar)
"As far as you was concerned" (My TO be far, uh.. It's going down tonight)
"You ain't seen nothing yet" (My DJ's name is Babu)
"After this jam, I really don't care" (Uh, uh)

[ Chorus: Evidence ]
I been to, so many different places
I built with, so many different people
I smoke, bats with cats who opened up their sacks
and put that shit in my hand and never asked for it back

[ Verse One: Evidence ]
My thinking cap, that's a part of my head
I'm inking, raps to wax perform live, make my bread
Some seen it coming, others say "What is this?"
It's Evidence mixing pleasure with my business
My sound describing color, between green and purple
Then I walked through a wall and drew a perfect circle
Simplistic, but not, unrealistic
Some people should build twice before they diss it
Sometime the wrong album get's the right press
And the right get the wrong, but remain righteous
Just like, some are broke, some people healthy
Some interludes are better than songs on LP's
I take it as it comes, every day's a new one
Take breaths on beat, custom-fit vocals to drum
Straight bomb on cats with these lyrics called babs
The original structure still clear of sandtraps

[ Chorus: Evidence ]

[ Verse Two: Evidence ]
Attack, my lyrics hit the track, impact
Four, three-two-one, detonation, you're done
Hit the spot with different catens meditated
Then blast through your shield, the one that's metal-plated
Word up, shit is timeless you can't date it
And marriage, out of the question, that you sadated
A +Reservation For One+, no one else
'Cause even when I'm with other people I'm by myself
For wealth, it ain't my first concern you know this
'Cause if you broke you either don't work or in showbiss
And just 'cause you spin don't mean you know what dope is
Or hold a mic, immature night, please quote this
I built with so many people, different states
zipcodes, different plates, outter country on the lake
Doin' dates on tour, guaranteed heat for shure
Intense with the microphone, your majesty is pure
Plus, I stay armed so don't ring the alarm
The carm before the storm, threw off ya judges now it's on
A kindness for a weakness, mistakes made it venues
But fuck with my crew, Dilated Peoples, we been to..

So many different places
I built with, so many different people
And I smoke, bats with cats who opened up their sacks
and put that shit in my hand and never asked for it back

I been to, so many different places
I been with, so many different people
I smoke, bats with cats who opened up their sacks
and put that shit in my hand and never asked for it back</pre>
