{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}

[Run]
Now there's a backseat lover, that's always undercover
And we talk til my daddy sayyy
Said you ain't seen nuthin, 'til you're down on her muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheerleader, was a real big beater
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of lovin, was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}

[D.M.C. w/ Steven Tyler in background]
See-saw swingin, wit the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singin, "Hey diddle diddle wit a kitty in the middle"
And they swingin like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, At the high school dance
Wit a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me, she was foolin
Cause she knew what was she was doin
when she told me how to walk this way!

[Chorus - Steven Tyler]
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
Well just gimme a kiiiiiiss

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}
Oooh, a-like this!

[Run w/ Steven Tyler in background]
School girl sweetie with a classy kind of sassy
Skirt climbin' way up her knee {*phone rings in background*}
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker
And they find they were lookin at me
I was high school loser, never made it wit a lady
Til a boy told me somethin I missed
That my next door neighbor, had a daughter had a favor
So I gave the hoe a little kiss, like THIS

[Run-D.M.C., Steven Tyler, and Rick Rubin]
See-saw swingin wit the boys in the school
with her feet flyin up in the air
Singin, "Hey diddle diddle, wit a kitty in the middle"
I was swingin like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin, when she knew what she was doin
when she told me how to walk this way

[Chorus - Steven Tyler, Rick Rubin]
She told me to
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
(She told me to)
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
WALK THIS WAY
Talk this way
Well just gimme some head!

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-HAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOHH
G-G-G-G-AOWWWW-AOWW-AOWW-AOWW-
AOWW-AOWW-AOW-AOOW-A-LIKE THIS!
