[Ced] Yo Keith, that trip was kind of long
[Kth] Word up Ced
[Man] Excuse me, aren't you guys Ultramagnetic?
[Ced] Word, what's up money?
[Man] Yo I just saw that spaceship over there
[Man] Let me ask you somethin
[Ced] Yeah
[Man] How much money did you make this year?
[Ced] Yo that's kind of personal money~!

[Kool Keith]
You wanna know my business? I got things to do
People to meet, people to see
Very important - matters to turn to
A waste of time for me to try to burn you
and talk a minute, you're not worth a conversation
I speak intelligently, with information
Goin and flowin and showin, you're still growin
adolescent - with a childish mind
Your brain is small, plus it's hard to find
I need a microscope, to see a two-cent brain
that don't think, when they rob and steal
and rape and kill - and murder their loved ones
Now put your brain in the guillotine
Slice up the cold cuts, you're goin nuts in a three inch cell
You wanna low rate me?
You're better off in hell, feel the flame
fire burn roast and toast
Let me heat up your skull, while I brag and boast
I keep your brain on stand-by
Cause this message, is coming from the source! {*echoes*}

[Chorus: samples only]
"There's a message in the music that will bring you piece of mind" - 2X

[Ced Gee]
Your attention please, come on and let me try this
This beat is funky - so I just
made up some rhymes that are hyper than hyperspace
Ced Gee will kick bass, face and eliminate
Rappers who think quick slick with a few tricks
Can't be quick fixed if they try this
man, and, aiyyo, I have the right to be
on any stage and mic someone can pass to me
Cause, I'm in there, and I swear
I'm like Vladimir, no one bet-ter
step to me, get to me, or pes-ter me
Confess to me, be guessin me
Adressin me, be less than me, or testin me
because, it only brings out the best in me
So, yo here's what you really need to do
Instead of battlin we need to, really improve
our race, and every other race
Bring 'em together - and let's face
the problems, that we need to be solvin
People are dyin, starvin, robbin
Bein discriminated from different jobs
and things like that so think about that
We have a tool to use that they call rap
So, yo, let's use it and not abuse it
And in the long run, we have improved this
situation and turned it into a positive
They doubted this, but we're proud of this
institution we invented of course
And this message, is comin from the source! {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
Once again, I hear your garbage on my radio~!
Left to right, and comin through my stereo
I turn it off, go off without show-off
Blow off MC's who can't talk or read or write
or learn, stutter - I think you need to go to rift
But watch me shift
The smarter I get, the dumber you get
The better I get, the wacker you get
Ha ha hah, I gotta laugh - MC's are very funny to me
And on Easter, they're like a bunny to me
Hoppin around, without an education
Formation, results in occupation
Better skills, how to sign a application
for a job, but you'd rather be a slob
A parasite, eating corn off the cob
Beggin everybody, you got a dollar for crack?
I'll pay you back
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday's here
Where's my money?
It ain't funny with a pipe in your face
For a fracture, last time the cops smacked ya
for hittin your moms and pops
You need a shake in your brain, adolescent
I'm a vet, you're juvenile, and driven wild, meanwhile
You look stupid and petty, and now senile
How's time in jail without bail?
Now you're up for sale, you're like a prostitute
Another man's wife, on the la-la tip
Think about it again, cause this message
is comin from the source! {*echoes*}

[Chorus] w/ minor variation</pre>
