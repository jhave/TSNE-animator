Chorus: Lil Caesar

One two y'all, you know I rock ya
Step in the realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A.
*repeat x2*
One two y'all, uh, uh

Easy livin, bitches givin pussy like it's free
My GS3 gleams perfectly
Lil Cae's get flour like the stems
Land's and Lexus' flexed with the M-A-F-I-A
Blunts make my day
Friday to Friday stay-be baby
plus stylus, sippin on Berry's iris
My windfall- be rich by sixteen
Swimmin in CREAM, fuck a dollar and a dream
Saw her knockin all ho's, dancin a machine, uhh
True bawler, bitch case might call her
A little shorty but I like my bitches taller
Nastiest, the flashiest, you got bust past your shit
while Big fuck your bitch
Uhh uhh, while your nigga take flicks
Uhh yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique

Chorus: Cheek Del Vec

One two y'all, you know I rock ya
Step in the realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A.
*repeat x2*
One two y'all, uhh uhh uhh

Verse 2: Cheek Del Vec

I admit back in the days I did stupid shit
Now I changed, I'm in to bigger and better things
like rockin Cuban change, bitch copped the range
Del Vec was set with the Lex and diamond rings
Pop Moet with my bitch when it rain
Drink away the pain, got mad stress on my brain
A little nigga rolled for dough
Copped ki's across seas
and sent a memo from
a Cuban kid named Sallio
selled mad pulito
Coppin 'bout four bricks then I called Nino
Meet me at the airport, feds is on the stalk
Almost got caught cause the dumb bitch talked
How much you makin? What we're doin, wouldn't live that
How much my V cost and where my cash stash at
But the feds still couldn't get nuttin
JM I'm still stuntin and frontin

Chorus: Lil Kim

One two y'all, you know we rock ya
Step in the realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A.
*repeat x2*
One two y'all, uh, uh

Verse 3: Lil Kim

Time to make moves, and cruise to the bodega
Grab enough G's while niggas master the Sega
In the crib getting high all night
Whippin all on you vics clique feel tight
So you say "Whose, Little Kim, the hit chinquer"
Pull the grass, fast cash and money maker
Do you deal well it's the female 
Mafia Member, whippin that ass in December, remember
Terrified of this goddess, who be that artist
Hittin dick the hardest, Anne Klein don 
Coochie cutie, Chanel number 9 for the booty, now you wanna stare? 
This butt's for studs all the rocks that I wear
Ice just be freezing while I'm breezing, it's the season
For Land Cruisers, drug users
All around me Junior M.A.F.I.A. steam on
Strap up 'fore these niggas act up, uh
And I'll be sittin at the top 
While you takin all your rate out state
In 8-5-0s I, be sippin Moey in the sky
On the way to the Bahamas in silk pajamas, with all the Big Mama's
Yeah and for you jealous ass hoes,
I keep a rose in my clothes
Uh and there it goes

Chorus: Larceny of the Snakes

One two y'all, you know I rocked 'cha
Step in the realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A.
*repeat x2*
One two y'all, uh uh

Verse 4: Larceny

If I told ya once I told ya twice
Love take ya life with this shot gun 
Another game over night
Ask my wisdom I gets up in them
Quickly make straight niggas
Turn strictly dickly
Got fucked by the buck wild Juve
Screw me, can't a nigga do shit to me
I rep tillit, snake bitch feet it
Larceny I steal it, change more for villit nigga
Keep your money in your pocket, watch me rock it
Slinging drugs on the corner
What's you bank stop it, 9s I cock it
Armed robberies, don't ask me why you girl's slobbing me
I'm schoolin niggas while your straight foolin niggas
Niggas frontin, I'm straight blood poolin niggas
Doin ya'll niggas "Un guard" you aint hard
Ya'll niggas cotton balls, I'm stickin all of yall</pre>
