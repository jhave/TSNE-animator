[MJG]
I'm so cold, I need a coat in the kitchen
I bust two verses, then go into intermission
No way you can provoke my vision
I, dont play I make a hoe pay a commission
Baby, come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggaz wish they never spoke while they were spittin
I'm so ready I'm bout to blow from the tension
Like surprise you dont even know what you gettin
I'm becomin quick at gettin slow ???
Cant throw my position, I flow with persition
Is a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and no ammunition
MJG, and I'm so in attention
I see you tryin to creep me for my dough, why you trippin
Youse a shipwreck nigga when you broke co-mission
Jesse Jackson cant help you with the Hope Coalition

[Chorus - Shannon Jones]
Well, I'm spendin loose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
Its not easy to do
I got the streets in my pocket
With the hating better stop
Straight Cadillac Pimpin'
Young nigga better listen

[Hook - 8 Ball x 2]
If I should die, before I wake
Roll me sum up, make sho I'm straight
Make sho my cup feel no react
Make sho my paper come in stacks

[8 Ball]
I come through like a mack, truck rumbling streets
Big Boy hit tracks straight pummeling beats
Rock hard like coke in a ???
Pay top dollar for the hot product indeed, yeah
Turn it up and get addicted to it
And have raw music soon as you listen to it
Jump up like a old fat lady at church
Jump back like a uncut thang at work
Mang, hop in and take a ride with a pimp nigga
Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha
Talk slick till I make a chick get the picture
Just a page outta fat boy ghetto adventures
Listen, I'm a titan on the mic
Original, them weak niggaz bite what I write
Oh Lord, we going to get it jumpin like revival
Survival, Straight from my street bible

[Chorus]

[Hook x 2]

[MJG]
These verses are must rip, dont slip, pimp a bitch
Put on your look, best outfit, get rich

[8 Ball]
This here, get you out of your seat fo sho
Jump up, get crunk like you got the Holy Ghost

[MJG]
Ay Yo, collection plate, be straight, dont hate
Indicate, no shape, no plate

[8 Ball]
Dont Hate, pay away, make a pimp, pockets straight
VISA, check, cash, any city, any state

[MJG]
Deep Down, in the country, in the hills, makin deals
No ex-aggeration, it is what it is

[8 Ball]
Come on, you aint never heard shit like this
Two Pimps spittin game right out pu-pils

[Chorus]

[Hook x 2]
