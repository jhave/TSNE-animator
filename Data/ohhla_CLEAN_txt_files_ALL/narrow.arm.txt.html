[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah yeah...
Kamachi, Planetary, King Syze...

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo! They love the way I pin a champ
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp
I kill the reciters of lies
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays
A sideways death for a narrow grave
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy!

[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched
Lock and load up, post up, toast up

[King Syze]
Hey yo, my vocal duel, payments hiatus save the local crews
Only the chosen few can ride with the most explosive crew
But not you, jealous ones they envy us
Cause we spit venomous, until books remember us
Hell fire embedded in us, plus sins condemning us
It's just what I write, ignite cop killers and predators
I be like this, best believe I can't be ignored
Spitting metaphoric, until the chosen child is aborted
When my mind's in orbit, forces knock you out your high horses
Deal with high sources, until the meal is five courses
The flames is high, when my brain and the train collide
Under much needed change in time, the game is mine
I build strength through the niggas that be hating me peers
But it's the army, part of me ya'll been waiting for years
From a small block, hip hop, busting my tool
King Syze, dope shit, what can I say, man, it's nothing new

[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers are so tough
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched
Lock and load up, post up, toast up

[Planetary]
I'm a scientist in the lab, with a violent twist and a gift of gab
Pharaoh tongue that can lash through your clique and stab
From the days where you carried screw drivers
in back pockets in case you had to prove that your crew lava
We was painting on your property
and until this day I still got rookie niggas out trying to copy me
Planetary nigga, Q-D original,
Smooth criminal, bash your mental, bruise your physical
There's something about the evilness of this track
It makes the heaven's gates close, and the tabernacles crack
In fact, it separates all the lies and the facts,
It makes you see the light right before the sky turns black
It turns boys to men, it turns toy soldiers to generals
Innocent motherfuckers graduate to criminals
It makes you think twice about who you are
It makes you feel like death coming every sixteen bars

[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched
Lock and load up, post up, toast up</pre>
