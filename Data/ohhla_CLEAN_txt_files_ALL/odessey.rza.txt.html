[Intro: RZA]
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it
Get it, get it, get it, get it,
And so as Bobby...
And so as Bobby...
And so as Bobby start to learn more jewels of life
He became more the wiser, and the RZA was being manifested from within
For a new embryo, had been born through the cypher
Bringin' forth into existence, the Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
And he started to spit shit like this

[RZA]
Yo, Happy New Year, throw on your Wu-Wear
We true here, you crab derelict bastards, you can't push through here
The ice melter, you best to to dive for ya shelter
This a sign, when it's called Alpha Phi Sigma Phi Delta
Digi tech, 36 tech, eject pelet
Rip through rap cadet, no one left to tell it
Then them hook, walked through justice in Brooks
Scotch whiskey, in the middle of Patty, with four glocks wit me
Hand pull trigger nigga, 16-shot dart spitta
Chart splittas, who walk through the hood, heart bitter
For industriliazed rapped capatilist, trynna snatch a crack of this
BZA bitch, please don't make me flip, flip, flip, flip

And bones get sparked, my wiz as strong as Joan of Arc

While ya dogs just bark, bark, bark
We spread this attitude, to every point of latitude
Every street crevest, every quarter, every avenue
I might be on the Iffel, wit a 30/30 scope riffler
Ready to snipe you, and wipe you from the face of the earth
You can taste it diverse, the blood thirst
I start to bring the great Flood, first, first, first

[Outro: RZA]
So as his mind start to grow
He start expression himself through his hip hop culture
Changin' his thoughts, standin' on his truth of square

Build it better himself to those around him
And he start talkin like this...
Hungry men have no respect for law or authority
Or human life, a man's bread and butter is only insured if he works for it
Leadership means everything, pain, blood and death
What night is to day, man is to woman
And woman is to man, fear is the state of nervousness
Only fit for children, not men
All men are created equal, so to offend man, is to offend God
Fear is lose control of one third, if you become like a helpless deer
Or a feathless bird, we stand as the true of living, living true
And these jewels, thoughts of great wise men, like Marcus Garvey
Start to build up inside Bobby's head
And it lead him to the knowledge of himself
And he became a strong muthafucka!</pre>
