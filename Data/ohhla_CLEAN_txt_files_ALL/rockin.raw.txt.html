[Money B]
Okay ni-ggas, and ba-bettes
I hope you ready for this one, cause I am Money B
Coolin in the house with the Piano Man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
And we bout to get busy, like thiiis, check it out!

Tinkle tinkle tinkle, plinkle plinkle plink
This groove moves me, but whattayou think it takes
to make a hip-hop masterpiece, well if has at least
a break with a shuffle, Money B will bust a couple
of fly funky phrases, cause my rhymes get praises
Even add the flavor with the {*scratch*} because it pays
It's written by the groceries, or should I say the veggies
Come over here fair maiden, allow me to pull the wedgie
from the baggy pants you're wearin, excuse me for starin
You've got a very nice rear I hope you don't mind sharin
A minute to get to know me, I'm sure you will adore me
So walk and talk with me cause every freckle has a story
I'm showin that this is, fact and not fictitious
Lend me your ear, ba-bay, cause I'm your poetry man
I make it alright, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'll be your guidin light your superstar but only if you let me be him
So while you think it over I'll be rockin to the P.M.

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Well like I said I'm a poet like a painter with a palette
of styles, ahhhhh, which one shall it be?
A def freestyle?  I'm not dissin
This one's for partyin, word to your guardian
So be it moms, pops, or your grannie
I'm non-stoppin and clockin, crazy fanny
So hand me, nuff respect, cause it's a must have
Cause I can bust ass, cut you like a mustache
Put you in the headlock, send your butt to Bedrock
Yabba-dabba-dooin, so I suggest you don't be screwin
around with this you thought you was gonna be down with this?
When donkeys fly, guy
I'm the type of person that your mama always wanted you to be
MC M-O-N-E-Y dash B see
It's a crime to hear your rhyme you thought worthwhile
but yo, you got a style like Private Pyle
Surprise surprise surprise, Gomer
Like Canseco, I take no, and still be hittin homers
Especially when the pitch of the key, as bein thrown to me
hittin the spot and it rocks'n'rolls and yo Hob
Keynote has gotta be the Piano Man

{*DJ Fuse scratches: "Yo Piano Man", "rock rock on"*}
{*Shock G, a.k.a. the Piano Man, does his keyboard thang*}

Take me to the bridge, but don't cross-over!

{*Fuse scratches, Shock G keeps rockin the ivories*}

The Piano Man, abbreviated it's the P.M.
And when he plays, believe me that's what you'll say when you see him
Operatin on the ebonies and ivories beside me pride
No lie I kid you not the man is live, G
He receives me like a huge gulp of Gatorade
He rips it up and later on gets paid
So make the most of this, cut yourself a piece of the rug
And grab a cutie, and grab the booty, real slow
Because, I know you can I know you can can yes you can can
oh why can't you?  It's easy to dance to
the P.M. not a wax museum, so stop posin
If you're frozen, he'll break the ice cause he's nice
And twice, the fun when Money Fuse get loose
Pourin it on like a bucket of gin and orange juice
Raw Fusion, puttin the Piano Man on display
And this is the way he gets loose

{*time for more Piano Man flava funk*}

And while the Piano Man is wreckin it, I want y'all to check it
Ronice, take us home sweetie

{*while he plays, she sings "Piano Man play your thing" and ad libs*}
{*eventually Fuse joins in for some scratching*}
{*this goes on 'til it's over at seven minutes, two seconds - FUNKY!*}</pre>
