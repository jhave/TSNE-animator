I'm lookin for a made misses, not one of them lazy chickens 
But one them on top of her game, paid bitches 
I lay bitches and slay bitches, fast and free 
So fuck that, I want a lady I can give cash to be 
A lover, makin me say "unngh" like Master P 
And helpin me out when I'm deep in a catastraphe 
She has to be, top notch and full of class 
Or rollin a new drop top full a gas, to pull her ass 
Gotta come correct and you better have your game tight 
She ain't the type of girl you meet and then fuck the same night 
She's a hot girl, one that you can smoke Jane with 
But so jazzy, flashin her diamonds on her bracelet 
She don't say shit, keepin our love on the d-low 
I trust and believe in her, like Shira, she's my hero 
She don't need no zeroes she want a jazzy dime nigga to kick it with 
Splittin it fifty/fifty down the middle 

(Chorus) 2x 
I need a jazzy bitch, a classy bitch 
Walkin and pass me the switch, flashin her wrist 
Where you at ma'? 
I'm lookin for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya 
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter 

(Boondox) 
She had broke niggas and she said some nice hoe niggas 
Showboat poor niggas perpetratin with no scrilla 
She like more zippers, flow flippers and go getters 
Hydro twistas, gold grillers to roll with 
And you don't have to be a dope dealer or an old nigga 
So don't go twistin with a gold nigga 
'Cause she's a boss bitch, a slim Diana Ross bitch 
That you can floss with that don't cost shit 
And anytime I want to I can toss it 
And when I toss it, I ain't gon' lie, I raw dog it 
'Cause she's so jazzy, every five minutes I stop and tell her 
Bitches playa hate because they not, they jealous 
Loooooong micros with lots of cheddar 
Givin me more D's than Jay-Z, she'll Roc-A-Fella 
Classy, I gots to say it in a capella 
So y'all rats can hear me clear, y'all gots to do better 

(Chorus) 

(Kalage) 
If you feel that you's a jazzy nigga, you feel the same as me 
Jazzy hoes, I feel ya Jermaine Dupri 
Because classy ain't the thing to be, and yes it's plain to see 
If you a skank you can't hang with me! 
No I can't have no rat claimin me, like a leech, clang to me 
Or much, you should be shamed to be 
Ridin in the Chevy thing with me, it's not the place for them 
Jazzy, classy girls I'm chasin them, I wanna stay with them 
And lay with them, passin pussy's not the way for them 
I'm lacin 'em with more ice than a hockey stadium 
She gets down with me, freakin in any position 
Fine as all our dough, no, don't need me no pigeon 
I'm needin a pinchin to make sure that I'm not dreaming 
Like Cash Money, when you see her it's like bling, bling 
I'm lookin for ya, so let a nigga spoil ya 
As if I was your daddy and you was my daughter 

(Chorus) 2x 

What, I need a jazzy bitch, c'mon, I need a jazzy bitch.... </pre>
