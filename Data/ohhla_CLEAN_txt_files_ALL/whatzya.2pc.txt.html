{*phone beeps as it's dialed*}

What's ya phone number?

[Verse One]
Now I can make miracles with pimp hoes, it's instrumental
Waitin for the nymphos, that's the intro
Shook when ya rushed me, you walked up and touched me
Why?  Do you want to fuck me?
Just cause I'm paid in the worst way?  True
Lookin kind of good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild or ya act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch when you lick yo' lips, shake yo' hips
God damn, I love that shit
Now let's stop fake and be real now
I got a room and a hard-on, still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes
Say you wanna see my scar and my tattooes
When we headed for my hideout, act right
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
  If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take, to break you off?

[Verse Two]
Oh shit - baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the Gods if I seen it right
Now she could get me - hard
Didn't wanna talk to me 'til she seen my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's yo' phone number?  Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time to tell your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby gotta leave me alone
Picture my rhyme, take time to rewind
these ordinary words I say
If you open your mind, bet a minute you'll find
it's time let the Outlawz play
What's yo' phone number?

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

{*phone rings*}
