[P. Diddy]
Yeah, yeah
I like the way it's goin down (That's that shit right there)
C'mon, c'mon (That's that shit right there)
For all my ladies (That's that shit right there)
Bad Boy baby (That's that shit right there)
I got that peaches and cream (That's that shit right there)
Peaches and cream
It's the P the U the F the F

From the car to the bar, from the bar to the telly
Your neck to your bra, your bra to your belly
And she know, where PD go, left the ego
Catch me below her belt like a foul boxer
She a freak, but she sweet so I can't knock her
I just push her legs back til she propped up
Tongue her and see her hit high notes like the opera
And I don't waste a drop til I taste the spot
Give me chills but I make it hot
Watch; I'ma prove in times, I'ma make ya lose your mind
in a lengua smooth as mine
And I never question what hon' do
When she meet me, she knock on door 1,1,2
From the 404 to 212
You got peaches and cream, ma, where's my scoop? c'mon!

[Slim]
Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken of you
So sweet, so very wet
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

1 - Peaches and cream
    I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
    Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
    It's even better when it's with ice cream
    Know what I mean

    Peaches and cream
    I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
    Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
    It's even better when it's with ice cream
    Know what I mean, peaches and cream

[Q]
I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet, baby inside of you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

Repeat 1

Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' - shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clique

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

2 - Oh girl I need it
    I gotta have it
    It's always on my mind
    Know what I mean
    Peaches and cream
    I like it in my car
    Or even in my bed
    Or baby on the stairs
    Know what I mean
    Peaches and cream

Repeat 2
Repeat 1 to fade</pre>
