   Verse 1
   
   I am woman, hear me roar
   When I grab the mic it's never a bore
   When I'm on stage, sayin' a rhyme
   I often wonder what ya think of mine
   Is it fresh or weak, or is it live or dead?
   Yo, it's got ta be somethin' if you're boppin' your head
   To the beat, can I get an amen brother?
   Liked that rhyme? Well here goes another...
   
   [Hold up, hold up, hold up. Check it out. Before we go any further we
   gotta announce who we are. I am DJ K-Rock and this is my homegirl, MC
   Lyte. Kick it for 'em!]
   
   Verse 2
   
   We had to pause for station identification
   Now ya know my name here's some more information
   Well, let's see, what you wanna know about me?
   MC L-Y-T-E
   [The Queen] Nah, that's too corny
   [The Sexy] Nah, that gets the guys too horny
   [The Best] Now that sounds conceited
   But what is true is true, so it has to be repeated
   The best is Lyte, when I'm on the mic
   And MC's look straight ahead cos this pitch'll make your neck tired
   And I say loosen up and relax
   The fiction you been livin' Imma fill with facts
   Right now...
   
   [MC Lyte, DJ K-Rock. Name of the group is Me and My DJ. Kickin' it
   live in '88. Do it.]
   
   Verse 3
   
   I am woman, hear me roar
   Comin' out fresher and flyer than I did before
   That's right, I'm well respected
   Don't get stupid, I'm well protected
   If ya wanna battle I'm well prepared
   Me and K-Rock are far from scared, you know what
   We're brave, livin' in a cave of gold
   Waitin' for the misbehaved to get bold
   But as I look around so far so good
   MC's behaving just like they should
   Hands are folded, no whispering or passing notes
   All attention to me ya have to devote
   I'm like a teacher, but then again not quite
   Cos a teacher's salary I'm makin' a night
   On the mic rhymes witty and bright
   Maybe that's why the name is Lyte
   Yo, bust it, Imma end it right here
   DJ K-Rock, you end it over there
