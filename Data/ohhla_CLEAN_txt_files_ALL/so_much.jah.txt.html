[Ja Rule]
Rest in peace to my nigga Stretch, my nigga 'Pac
So much pain

Uhh.. yeah, huh, yeah
All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uhh.. huh, yeah
Yeah, so.. much..

   Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
   Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh

[Ja Rule]
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggaz time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga - you know the game
Smokin weed, fuckin hoes, slangin thangs, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do?  I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep - drinkin Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain

   [Chorus]
   Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
   I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
   Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
   I'm tired of the strain and the pain

[Ja Rule]
Years and years of strugglin all my life
Runnin wild as a kid, grew up blazin 'em right
I'm in a - little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a - givin me hell and my heart is screamin, "Don't enter"
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your "7 Day Theory"
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggaz wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin, sendin shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in - keep us hustlin nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin crime excited my mind and leadin the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
for gettin fucked up and blastin - we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

("They'll never take me alive..." -&gt; 2Pac)
   Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
   I'm tired of the strain and the pain
("They'll never take me alive..." -&gt; 2Pac)
   Ooohhh, tired of the strain and the pain
("They'll never take me alive..." -&gt; 2Pac)
   I'm tired of the strain and the pain
("They'll never take me alive..." -&gt; 2Pac)
   Ooooooohhhhhh, nooooooooooooo
("Cocked on these suckers, time to die" -&gt; 2Pac)

[2Pac]
They got me mobbin like I'm - loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - PASSION
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin when I'm - BA-BLASTIN
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin on the streets
And I be, ballin loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise - hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough - I'm kickin dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin mean; until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me
There's so much pain

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ variations

Ooooohhhhh, pain </pre>
