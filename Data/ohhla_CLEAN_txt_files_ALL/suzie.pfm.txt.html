Yeah! This here's the anthem y'all. That one girl who's always at the show
for one reason only. Next time y'all see her, I want y'all to say..

[Hook]
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
Whoa-oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Now here's a story 'bout a girl that I'm sure you all know
She turns around when they yell (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You always see her at the shows, Gucci glasses on her nose
Too much make up on her face or hardly wearin any clothes
She ain't interested in flows, and she knows it's a fact
She's always early but ain't trynna see the openin' act
She wants the dough she could stack
She startin' local wit rap
She in the front row but really trynna go to the back
Oh, excuse me, let me introduce you to the groupie
Flash the car keys and the sharpie, you can autograph the coochie
Now ask yourself, "How many stars can one chick date?"
Her little black book resembles Kay Slay mixtapes
She got 2 Source covers, 4 Grammy nominees
A hot 16 in the cypher'll prolly have her on her knees
But she'll have you beggin' please, cuz she's always on her toes
And there's a simple way to call her, let me tell you how it goes...

[Hook]
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
(She's a...) Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(She's in...) Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
(Now if you know her say...) Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
(She's a...) Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(She's in...)Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
(Now if you know her say...) Whoa-oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh)


[Verse 2]
Backstage, dressin' room, just finished rippin' a set
I could hardly feel my legs, my body drippin' wit sweat
There was a knock at the door, I said "It's open"
She walked in, a face I never seen before, but I could never forget
Then she walks up to me, goes to whisper in my ear and pulls me near
It's pretty clear, this chick is tryin' to seduce me
She leans in closer, grabs me by the hand
Puts it underneath her shirt that read "I'm with the band..."
When I finished reading that, she was unzippin' my pants
I tried to speak, but she just said (shhh) "I'm in command"
And I ain't mad at it, in fact, the shit is fantastic
Till she said somethin sporadic - "You know I loved you on Illmatic..."
But I didn't let it phase me, I just figured she was crazy
Then she said, "Ether was fire dog, you really crushed Jay-Z"
Man, you shoulda seen my eyes, she really took me by surprise
And I just thought - oh shit, this bitch thinks that I'm Nas...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now when you see her at a show
You wanna get this girl to blow
Just tell her you could flow
(Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hiiii)
You don't really have to prove it
She don't listen to the music
The truth is she kinda stupid
(Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Don't get gassed if she hollas
Cuz she's all about the dollars
But I tell you this, she swallows
(Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hiiii)
Take it from yours truly
There'll never be a better groupie
Every rappers needs a Suzie
(Whooooa oh-oh)

Th.. That was great. What'd you say your name was? Su-Suzie? Iight.. ok..
yeah, yooooou gotta get the fuck outta here. Ok? No, well ya see.. here's
some cab money to bounce. I got a.. I got a date... No, I got a date with
this chick who thinks I'm Busta Rhymes... PEACE!</pre>
