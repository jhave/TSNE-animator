[Intro - El Da Sensei]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, what the fuck yo, here we go
El Da Sensei, 3D, A.Vee for the 2-G season
I ain't even gon' say it no more
I'ma just sit back and let the song just play
KnowhatImsayin, yo
Let it go, let it go, let it go..

[Verse 1 - El Da Sensei]
Never simplistic I keep it updated and complicated
My own shit for sure, not a flop or drug related
Compact with raps, beats that clap
For hard hats and backpacks who can adapt to my design of rap
Table of contents makes me wind man
Constantly on replay makin' sure it be the Sensei
When natural, my natural renoun sounds from fans
Suitable, crucial that they become recruitable
Who should you address as your man at arms
Bent down on clowns before I bodily harm
Of a shine dime no petty crimes, so I'm
stayin' in touch to feel again and feelin' the dutch
First letter A and then comes the Vee
But harddrop can't be ordered to no fuckin' factory
Sacred 3D blends recommend my medicine prescription free
Open to all veterans
This specimen yesimen[?] wrestlin' caps, like triple eights
My mindstate compared to tapes from here to '88
Classic and style, master with slick words
Give you shit you never heard straight from New Jers'

[Hook - El Da Sensei](2X)
With these words and this beat combined
You know we shine with that of the meat rack
Fuck that kind of track
Where ya at?
"New Jerusalem"
Where ya at?
Where ya at?
"Around the globe we explode across the map"

[Verse 2 - El Da Sensei]
I'm gifted with the word of speak
Mister highlight, primetime shine, granted player of the week
I mortalize my fans who got my shit in they crates
CD's and mixtapes, posters with autographs on the case
Beats laced with the finest of rhymes, signed on vintage
Year '71 link shot the proper image
My fast vocab' it stands depends
Spills upon the public eye, bringin' the truth and no lies
Excercise my status, show and prove my craft
Lethal rhyme blast, seekin' the top charge fast, a past
All data I mean to intervene
Lay my cards on the table flush the whole damn scene
Take a time warp trip, '85 to '86, when I first learned to burn
Chuck Chillout on the mix, through hardships
I mix the hard shit regardless
My performance be the hottest I'm down to lock shit

[Hook - El Da Sensei](4X)
With these words and this beat combined
You know we shine with that of the meat rack
Fuck that kind of track
Where ya at?
"New Jerusalem"
Where ya at?
Where ya at?
"Around the globe we explode across the map"
