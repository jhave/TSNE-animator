[Keyshia]
There's this girl I know, so deep in love
Do almost anything to make him see she's the one
But he doesn't feel a girl like her, he's so so wrapped up
Cuz the average girl will give him anything that he wants

He's so caught up (He's so caught up)
He won't call her, he shows no love
So she decides
I changed my mind, Ooh
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
No no no no no
Don't waste my time (Don't waste my time)
(I don't love you)
(I don't love you no more) No no
(Bring it back, bring it back, baby)

It's the funniest thing cuz I
Know how I feel inside
But you never felt the same as I
Never, never, never ooh, yeah, miss him so much
I betcha he don't even notice
He don't even realize, cuz he's

He's so caught up (So caught up)
He won't call her (Won't even call me)
He shows no love (oh)
So she decides
I changed my mind, I don't love you
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more)
I don't love you no more
no no no no, no
Don't waste my time (don't waste my time)
(I don't love you) I don't love you
(I don't love you no more) Don't

I'm so over you
I got no more to give
I gave it all to you
And you couldn't handle it
And I don't care if you come back to me on your knees
I just don't love you no more

I changed my mind

[Shyne]
Speeding on the highway, gangsta lean
One sixteen, full steam, nah mean?
Bitches on my jock cuz my flow was hot
And they spot the watch filled with rocks from a block, huh
When the light hit, strictly fish skill
Fuck that light shit, a noise out the garage, double pipe shit
I'mma deal like hey yo ma, I know you likes this

Capital N
Capital E
Whatchu all know about G-force
SL's with automatic doors, ha
Flow sick, no shit, roll six, head crack
Walk the street with my chain out for frontin'
Fuck y'all niggaz walking 'round like y'all sayin' somethin'
