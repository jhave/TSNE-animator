[Intro: Kurupt]
Bitch ass nigga was talkin' all this shit right?
I'm like damn, you bitch ass nigga
I should sock you in your motherfuckin' mouth
Talkin' all this shit about my homie
So I chirped him (chirp-chirp)
Hey cuz, this nigga talkin' all this shit right?
Boom, the homie came up and was like
"Nigga say that shit in my motherfuckin' face"
Popped him dead in his motherfuckin' mouth nigga
Niggaz be talkin' all this shit
The only thing I wanna know is, look

[Chorus: Don Blaze] (Kurupt)
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me

[Xzibit]
Sometime men got some more than women
You do too good in Cali the prey start to turn to venom
You can't walk in these shoes nigga, you can't fit 'em
I'm bout five seconds away from the "let's go get him"
So nigga (say it to my face) if you're feelin' like King Kong
Mysery love company, I guess I'ma leave y'all
Until that day, you wanna tuck them nuts
And try to hit my switches and get your frame fucked up
You gotta (say it to my face), I'm right here with a 12-gauge
You talkin' to a man that plan on dyin' of old age
Until that day, I crush everything in my way
And give a fuck about what y'all say

[Chorus: Don Blaze] (Kurupt)
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me

[Xzibit]
Too much of anything makes you a addict
Wantin' contact with another man makes you a faggot
Patience is virtue, don't make me hurt you
I came full circle, about-face reversal
Salute the general, make yourself presentable
Analytical, every move made political
(Say it to my face) and wake up in a hospital
Huh, gutter never takin' me under
Fuckin' nerve of you motherfuckers
Thinkin' I was slippin', I was servin' you motherfuckers
X went off the deep end, I'm determined you motherfuckers
So watch how you speakin'
cause I'm listenin' closely for any pussy approachin' me

[Chorus: Don Blaze] (Kurupt)
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me

[Xzibit]
Nigga, you better come with the Taliban
Never been a slave or afraid of another man
X move like the brutal force of an avalanche
It ain't my fault you smoked off your chance
See motherfuckers envy what they cannot be
Mr. X to the Z, H.N.I.C.
Shh, half assed niggaz gon' shit on me
If they sentence me to five I'll be out in three
You'll be deep in the dirt for the bugs to eat
Tucked in for eternity, time to sleep
Til' that day, I'll crush everything in my way
And give a fuck about what y'all say

[Chorus: Don Blaze] (Kurupt)
See when the drama pop off, then pardon me, it ain't my fault
My back was up against the wall... thanks to y'all
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)
You need to say it to my face if you got somethin' to say bout me
Cause that's the way it's supposed to be... but you ain't no G
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches) Wishin' you could be like me
(Niggaz talkin' like bitches)

[Outro: Kurupt]
All that yackin' don't do shit
Dogg Pound homie... the homie Xzibit
Kurupt Young Gotti... Bigg Snoop... we here
Daz Dillinger... nickels and nines homie
Look back...</pre>
