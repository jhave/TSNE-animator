[Pusha T]
OK, Pusha...minus the T
Niggas is talkin' to blasphemous
Tell me is it these ashy cuts that got you thinkin'
I'm not in touch with that mask 'n glove
Don't let the Reverend hold your casket cuz
We think you thinkin'
These verses is curses the only thing worse is
I'm the ring master of the circus
Meanin' that, I'm the only one in the show with purpose
Most of you motherfuckers don't scratch the surface
Look, still ghetto, still tot' heavy metal
Still throw a nickname on all of my vehicle
Like the Cooperfield coupe, now you see it now you don't
With one flick of the wrist wow! the roof will go poof! (poof)
I'm an achiever make all of you believers
And I'll be damned if you overthrow Virginia's Caesar
Spend a day, sin a way, walk with me
Hug corners in the hood like a ghetto renegade switch!
Spend a way, rolls gold Jesus
Pink diamonds face flush like it was Duncan pink lemonade
Listen I'm not actin', this not rappin' this is live in action
Let's consider all the facts in
I got caught dealin' some way back when
Now that I'm blowin' it's smoother men
I know its hurts to see it but players please believe it

[Chorus: Pusha T (2x)]
I'm cool what you wishin', don't talk 'cause I'm listenin'
Fuck 'round and end up missin' if you curious
No weed or no vodka my soul will make me pop ya
Don't make me have to milk box ya, I'm serious

[Malice]
See how ya boy do I pull up in that ride quick
50 on the wrist leanin', niggas is sick
Steamin' they can't understand the meanin'
So they plot and conjure up ways to interrupt my well bein'
But that 9's been a damn good friend
Plus worthy made it to see 30 and I owe it all to him
Jewels lookin' as if I done robbed a vault
So if your bitch takes an interest it is not her fault
I mean look, head to toe heavy in weight
Pockets loaded hey I must say I take a cake
They speak ill, but words don't break him bone
They bounce off him, 'cause see him is purchasin' homes
See his stones how they complement each other
Size of the rocks and they fluctuate in color
That him is me get a clue enough's is enough
Took it easy on y'all fuckers and I ain't even rimed my truck (Uhh)
To put it simple I'm a rarity ma
From the cars to the jewels what clarity ha
Stick with me show you life thats out of this world
And I ain't lyin' to you love I only lie to my girl
I lust for the riches what a treat this is
The Lord is dealin' with my demons and my weaknesses
God forgive lose it all or God forbid
But from the Cradle 2 The Grave I'm a live

[Chorus (4x)]</pre>
