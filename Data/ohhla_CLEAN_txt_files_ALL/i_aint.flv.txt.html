[Intro]
Heh heh heh
Payback! Ha ha (hee hee hee) Flavor Flav!
Oh we gon' do it again son (son of a...)
Son of a mother, son of mother son of... mother
I hope (hee hee hee) oh snap
Whoah-HOOO! What?

[Flavor Flav]
Just to keep it real wit'chu, what's the deal wit'chu?
What's this shit I feel wit'chu?
Everything is goin wrong yo
This shit has been goin on too long yo
We gotta put this thing on the right track
We gotta put it back - to where we once had it before
Don't you remember we had it goin on galore?
Louis' and more? (Gold rings?)
Everybody was eatin, I was meetin and greetin
Lookin good from the head to the feet and
Didn't give the kids a beatin, I was a good dad yo (YEAH!)
Even when I became famous
I took the whole family to the shows
The kids with the snot runnin out they nose
Jumpin all out of my limos
Now that's the life I chose

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I ain't scared to come through your town
Flavor Flav be layin it down
I won't die, I can't drown
No one can take Flavor down

[Flavor Flav]
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
In every way I couuuuuuuuuld
To make you see how much I love you
As I understooooooooooood
Everywhere I moved (you trapped me) {SAY WHAT?}
I put my guards down (you slapped me) {KICK IT FLAV~!}
I trust you in again (you jerked me) {WHAT BABY?}
I try to work with you (you overwork me) {NOOOO!}
You're only for yourself (and you know it) {NOT AGAIN}
You're gonna take a lose (and you'll show it) {WATCH IT}
Come here baby (don't bother me) {WATCH OUT}
Come here baby (DON'T BOTHER ME!!!)

[Chorus]

[40 seconds of instrumental]
