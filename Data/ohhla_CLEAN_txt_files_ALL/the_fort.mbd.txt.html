Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

Yeah, we gotta hold down the fort
	We gotta hold down the block
We gotta hold down the fort
We gotta hold down the fort, check it
Nineteen-ninety-motherfuckin-three right?
What's YOUR new year's resolution motherfucker?
Check this out
	We gotta hold down the block
Word is bond kid, uhh, aight

[Prodigy]
Beef on the block, who is he?
Set it Dunn, me and my automatic likes to get busy
Ghetto representer, there ain't no motherfucker better
While you be catchin feelings like a love letter
I gotta hold down my fort and won't lose
Nigga die, because I got the tec 9 blues
Bulletproof Polo, I'm goin out solo
Whoever wanna come better step like they know cuz
I'ma survive, more rougher than a certified
Around the way, parlay and get high
My mega blast'll last in days to pass
Niggaz shoot, too fast, to pull out your gun last
That's why I like to spark first, and shoot your
bitch-ass down your next ride'll be a fuckin hearse
Cause little niggaz don't die son
Half-step and get that ass lit up like a flare gun
Cops they want static, whatever they can have it
My name is Prodigy and I'm known to cause havoc
And when I flip I be on some ill shit
I walk the street, like a real super trooper
The block shit proper, who once got had
Mad beef with the dread who sold me that dirt bag
Mad props to the bad little niggaz in the neighborhood
Long live the short, gotta hold down the fort

Gotta hold down the fort
	GOTTA HOLD DOWN THE FORT
We gotta hold down the fort
	YOU GOTTA HOLD DOWN THE FORT
We gotta hold down the fort
	YOU GOTTA HOLD DOWN THE FORT
So hold me down son (YEAH)
Hold me down (YEAH YEAH)

[Havoc]
Yeah how we go son, pull out the motherfuckin M1
Straight from the 'Bridge so you know where I'm from
The little, project nigga, I gets no bigga
Yo, my crew is buck so motherfuck how you figure
Step the fuck back, nigga, attack with the mack
Cause word is bond it's on
Shit is real around the way so sit back and take notes
Dead you on your coat, then cut your motherfuckin throat
Takin life like a thief in the motherfuckin night
While I write write, you bite bite bite
Niggaz wanna step to my business
But I just parlay and sip on my Guinness
Cause I'm the ripper, Mr. Flip the Scripture
Niggaz can't fuck with the flow of a real lil nigga
I wreck shop, in fact, get the mac, this is real
Shit is real, how the fuck you figure, nigga nil
So son hold me down while I pull out the glock
Gotta hold down the block, that's word to my pops
So once again it's on, light up the chalm
Time to drop the bomb, word is bond

We gotta hold down the block
	HOLD DOWN THE BLOCK
We gotta hold down the block
	WE GOTTA HOLD DOWN THE BLOCK

Yo son he pumpin over here Dunn?
  I know he ain't pumpin over here yo
Yo word is bond yo son peep he comin over let's bring it to him
  What, what?  What what what, what?
  Who the fuck are you?
Man fuck that, what?  *automatic spray*

	HOLD DOWN THE BLOCK
Yeah whattup now?  What what, what what?
Whattup now?
	HOLD DOWN THE BLOCK

[Prodigy]
To all the niggaz that's live or real
You gotta hold down your block, cock back the glock
Fuck the cops, cause your neighborhood chores
If they beef, make em bleed on the project floors
I get my kicks from loadin up gun clips
Don't fuck with suburb chicks, I need a gangsta bitch
Don't need a crew, I can bust you down solo fast
And after that, dip into the weed stash
I'm quick to blast, enemies won't last the fate
I kill em fast so they can't retaliate
Cause when I'm not alive who'd takes my place
to hold down the fort, we move on
My man got my back
I'm ready to go at anybody, who think they John Gotti
Peace to Manny C, good lookin out B
I'm Hellbound, got my block locked down

We gotta pull out the glock
	GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
We gotta pull out the glock
	WE GOTTA PULL OUT THE GLOCK
Check it, yeah
Call that nigga</pre>
