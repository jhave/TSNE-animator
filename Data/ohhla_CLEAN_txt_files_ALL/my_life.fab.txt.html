[Mary J. Blige]
(*harmonizing*)
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see thous
But I'm gettin a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin us is very special
Lovin life and life and livin
Your very special

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint
But since ya'll watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin that look like a nuisance
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence 
But it look like the students are playin hooky, and truin
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent
And ya'll done seen how this "Young'n" look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J.
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays 

[Mary J. Blige]
Cause love and life, and life and livin
Your very special

[Chorus] - w/ variations

(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special
(*harmonizing*)
Me and Fab are very special</pre>
