[ VERSE 1 ]
The microphone stand is where I make my escape
Out of the blue I see some dope rhymes that I shoulda take
I used to say em off the top of my head, man, could I drop a
Megaton bomb that was odd to stop, a
Movin train, hope I don't have to explain
That any rapper step in my way, he's bound to be slain
The stage is the court, I'm the judge and the juror
And when rappers pass me by they should Heil to the Führer
Although you may hate me and down to degrade me
There's some suckers walkin 'round tryin to cold imitate me
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
And you can tell by these words it's a freestyle

[ VERSE 2 ]
MC's I wipe out and rub them, don't care if you love them
And I wish you placed my name ?that flies? way up above them
Each and every show I do ends with applause
Here's lookin at you, kid, now go for yours
And if you choose not to, then I'm gonna take it
A night you'll never forget: it's just what I make it
And it won't take long for me to sing a new song
Because the key to gettin paid is you should never prolong
See my mind is set to automatically jet
You can't name the day you seen me let a mic pass yet
Once the microphone is mine I start by thankin you greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
You can tell by these words it's a freestyle

[ VERSE 3 ]
Just take another look at this one tough cookie
And could never be duffed by a new jack rookie
See, before I came with an MC name
And I feel sorry for the rapper that tries to proclaim
Because you won't have a chance and you will need advancin
Marley hasn't made a beat yet that wasn't enhancin
As a matter of fact I keep my rhymes intact
Severly's how you get served for callin me wack
Never again, I'm reminiscin
Last rapper in the world you should think about dissin
Cause my lyrics are burnin, Marley's tables are turnin
And ?sufficiant? we give suckers are watchin and learnin
MC Shan and Marley Marl and we're respected so greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin cause I'm so versatile
And you can tell by these words it's a freestyle

[ VERSE 4 ]
I come runnin when the microphone calls
Say a few ???, say ???, say ho and yes yes y'all
It gotta be ill cause I don't write no frill
You used to love to hear the story and you always will
We put the B, the B, the Bridge on p-plastic
??? like ???
But the ??? made the jivva-jivva-jam c-classic
Come to think about it, we're respected so greatly
And you haven't heard of anybody duffin us lately
Never cursin or rehearsin, I'm so versatile
And you can tell by these words it's a freestyle</pre>
