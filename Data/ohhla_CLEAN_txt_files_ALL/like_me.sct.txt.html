Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I'm a tell you like this
I'm boosie bo, you ain't heard?
I gas it up, rim it up, tint it up and swerve
I got them birds, I'm just playing
Got this mike in my hand
I make em fight, understand
I make em girls do my dance
I make the thugs catch the holy ghost
I'm in the club the whole club full of dojo smoke
We ease our mind, with my killers on parole
Got my juveniles are quick to let it go
Rep your hood and let em know
Gotta get this money main
He ain't fronting, maine
I got my fresh jayz, and my boosie feet
I'm in the parking lot, I got my 40 glock
Don't want no trouble
But if it come I make the party stop
Ambra, what they gonn do now bra
I'm in too deep, 2 every hour
Steady game and power
I'm real, I never change
You fake, then you a lame
Need a roll of toilet tissue cause I'm shittin on them maine

[Chorus: x2]
I don't care what you rock dog, you ain't fresh like me
I don't care what trap dog, you ain't wet like me
I don't care where you from dog, you don't whip like me
You ain't thugging till the death like me

2 seater roof gone, rimmed up
Pull up at the club, all these hoes getting fucked
We them niggas who your baby daddy call the cops
You want a brick, well we're serve you in the parkin lot
Real diamonds on my wrist, I don't gotta flick
Legal got me plug so call me when you get a check
I'm swerving through, getting to the money
50 cal on my lap, thumbing through them hunneds
I fuck with real niggas, hood niggas
With my plug bitches
Hood bitches
We from the streets, rep that gutter shit
All we know is bricks, that butter shit

[Chorus: x2]
I don't care what you rock dog, you ain't fresh like me
I don't care what trap dog, you ain't wet like me
I don't care where you from dog, you don't whip like me
You ain't thugging till the death like me

You got a benz I got a benz, that ain't shit nigga
I'm a real nigga, you a fuck nigga
Hunned round draws we don't shoot pistols
Wasn't born in Atlanta but it's my city
You ain't rocking what I'm rockin, this exclusive game
You ain't got no hustle, I can get you game
I run the streets, I could make more than cocaine
Free lil boosie boo from the gutter maine
Riding to that baby mama go and do some thangs
When boosie left the streets the rap game changed
The world got too many snitches, streets ain't the same
Nigga you can't trust nobody in the dope game

[Chorus: x2]
I don't care what you rock dog, you ain't fresh like me
I don't care what trap dog, you ain't wet like me
I don't care where you from dog, you don't whip like me
You ain't thugging till the death like me</pre>
