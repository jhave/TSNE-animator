[Mia X]

I got the ghetto grooves guranteed to make your shoes move
Through the dance floor
What you came for?Actin' like ain't know
That I flows,everything over ?knocks?
With the peep by the pound
And the ice cream shop
They finally drop the first lady off that No Limit tape
And I'ma ???? flows baby,think I ain't!
You can't see even if you had a bird's eye view
Or bifocals, these mind vocals just goes
On and on, you know you can't resist
So let your head knock back and look foward to this, Miss
Biggest Momma with the ?rhyme-a? and Prada
Fly known rigotta and my ice just gotta
Light up the room like Vegas
Been by my papa,ever since my flight that China white
Peelin' wit' the steel,recognize the real
Better rimes and bring skills I will
Keep it locked,word to my moms dredlocks
Some nights I just wanna set the party on top
Wit' P and the Ill Na Na,unified hip hop
Mo' chedda as long as the party don't stop

Chorus:
We don't care if the party don't stop
Got nothing but time so let the beat knock pop
Bangin' to the east
Shakin' it to the west
Throw it up northside
And the south gonna handle the rest
(repeat)

[Master P]

There ain't No Limit to this game I spit
36's on 55,I got money to get
It's the Ill Na Na wit' the Big Momma
Now I'm the Big Poppa,I mean a Big Dada
I used to make my money hustlin' and bustin' wit' gats
Now-a-days I get money for bustin' rhymes and raps
I got the cocoa and cream,not the kind that steam
Cause it's crispy and clean
Cristale and green,uhhhhh!
600 wit' that 28 inch will
Word is 50 wit' no dollar bills
Pearl presidential wit' that big and ????
Tears on our backs but they still can't handle
Independent black owned and I'm 'bout it 'bout it
That's why No Limit is rowdy rowdy!

chorus:

[Foxy Brown]
Uhhh,you know dat na na don't fake none
Millions by the Mason
Shit,money I'ma take some
Ask P,he know that Fox gettin' nasty
Little sassy ass,'bout it 'bout it
Hoes know I don't play that free shit
Make 'em lick my shit hard
Then leave that nigga with his dick hard
Huhh,you got to work me to hurt me
And when I'm bored fuck around on how you jerk yours
From NY to NO
Niggas know they my hoes,bringin' my doe
Wanna floss wit' me in the front seat of your 3
Hunderd Benz-do,watch us work them ends though
Baddest bitch with that multi platnuim clit
Peep this,don't let a trick fuck you and I heard you ?licked?
Ice Cream Man

[Master P]
Wit' the Ill Na Na and this Big Momma
That's why the party don't stop
