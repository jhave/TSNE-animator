[Esoteric]
Aiyyo
One-two, it's Esoteric
Swoopin in, with my man Kabir
It's like that, more fuel for the flames
Check

Aiyyo the world's so wide
It's seemin like the stream-of-thought's at a low tide
I'm tryin to grow inside, recognize
Mankind needs an open mind
Ignorance and showin pride can't coincidence
People judge a Muslim because of his custom
Legislation makes laws, police adjust 'em
The media got people feelin needier
Gettin greedier, down {?} easier
A young man grab the glock and he sprays
Now he's locked in a cage, he's not talkin for days
I saw the rage in his eyes when I was dodgin the strays
Jobs offered him praise but honestly robbery pays
When you're caught in a maze the crack rock is the craze
People walkin as slaves until they're dropped in a grave
You gotta look within yourself and make a change
Use your brain to try to think long range

Mankind needs an open mind
Knowledge and wisdom gives sight to the blind

Mankind needs an open mind

[Kabir]
The days go by, I try to swallow my pride
And remain dignified, let my words and speech slide
to a place I can hide, at last hit my stride
In the lab with beats and rhymes we be turnin the tide
I can't dwell on death it just don't seem right
I'm a positive lad, that's in love with life
It's okay to be sad feel the stress strain and strife
But sooner or later you better work it out right
Cause time's too short to just concede defeat
We got to march on fort, not cave in or retreat
We got to use our force to slay all of the beasts
that oppress the people from the West to the East
Feast on my message rap, rhymes and rhythm
Analyze the evidence and make a decision
Educate yourself, then refine your vision
Stay humble in your quest for fame wealth and wisdom
