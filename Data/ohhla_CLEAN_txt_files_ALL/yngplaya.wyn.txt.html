[Lil Wayne]
He he hee
I'm a young playa nigga, (what)
I get the game from the big tymers, nigga (what, what)
Who else?  (Speak on it)  On the real nigga, on the real nigga
Respect the game
Cuz I got the game

[Lil Wayne]
Y'all know who I is
Weezy coming thru in the bubble eye Benz
See me front in back with the wood all around
Plus I got that *boom boom* surround sound
Don't hate on me boy if you do *pow* get down
Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground
But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man
We stuntas man
I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey
And watch how she *slurp* on my pipey like a Icee
I might be in a Range that night
I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight
I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right
But if I lose, its cool,  that's some change lil shite
That ain't nothing
I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting
Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming.

[Baby]
Slow yo roll lil one
You ain't glad its bought
And Ms. Pat and gray head over there
In the back card gambling
At the bar dranking
But go head, just be quiet with 'em lil one

[Lil Wayne]
Broads I use 'em
Hatas I bluse 'em
My whole front grill is full of confusion
Got dammit
Weezy pull up in a Porsche, expanded (expanded)
I was to the back, niggas couldn't stand it
Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished
I got it like that
Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches
"Million Dollar Man" baby Ted DeBiosi
Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier
Sammy, Mario, tody Taz, that's my posse
And what
You might see me dippin low in a Benz truck
Tell yo girl hello
I done did her, what you muggin me for
Keep playin with me, I'll put a slug in yo do

[Mannie]
Now looky here, young blood
Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt
Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass
Now keep doing what you doing
Go head

Y'all know me, young playa, stomp with the big dogs
Play with me boy I give you cancer like menthol
Cough cough cough up
Got a cat eye Benz on Brabus
They call us Uptown shiners
Original hot boy$ baby, big tymers
I spit game
Get in they head, they be like, "Quit Wayne!"
Half hour later, I'm in they split man
Hehehehe it be kicks man
Let me get real
I'll kill on the battlefield
Steal for the scrill
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill
I'm a little peepsqueal
But I'm a ape in that jungle
And if you get it twisted,
Nigga, I'm taking yo lover
I mean I'm raping yo lover
Leave her taste in my rubber
I'm a playa nigga, I'm a playa</pre>
