Uh... Tyga Montana got a white bitch name Hannah
She giggin' off my gramma' pop that tittie called that shit Janet

I'm on straight Goose Tropicana
Hoes like I'm Santa

Flippin' bitches like they all channels uh...

Got real Hawks in Atlanta
Scar yo face for that mansion uh...
Tell her bounce, she prancin'
What's that polka dots on yo panties?
Poo-Poo da boss, Tony Danza
No you lazy niggas can't stand me

We got 4 doors and more whores,

Fee raw ree red horse and act a ass do Eeyore
