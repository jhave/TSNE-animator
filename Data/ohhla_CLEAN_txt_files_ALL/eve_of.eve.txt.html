Eve of destruction rocks the nation
Eve of destruction rocks the nation

(scratches and beat comes in)

You niggaz capitalize on lies, surprise open your eyes
Baby girl from Illadel' hear to enhance your lives
Doubted my skills, bet you mad now, shoulda snatched me up
I'm in L.A. now with Dre now, ain't comin back cuz I'm stuck
Had enough of all the bullshit of sellin me dreams
Had enough of fake cats tryin to shine off these schemes
But I'm laughin last, down to get this cash with the Aftermath
You happy being local superstar showin ya ass
You talk the most shit, how you politickin moves an'
I crept to the top, shouldn't-a let me catch you snoozin
Me and my management team, laughin' at you while we cruisin
Cause we ain't got nuttin to do none of the choices you be choosin

[CHORUS 2X]
It's the eve of destruction, tracks I be fuckin
Cats be fascinated by the styles I be bustin
Got you niggaz open, got you niggaz lustin
Knockin emcees on they backs causin lyrical concussions

(*reggae melody*)
I wonder who, which one a dem a carry news
An' a gwan like set, they wan dis-dis ya crew  
But the lie, other emcees dem ready die
When we grab the microphone and praise his like Selassie

[Eve]
Me say me walk like walk like a champion, talk like a champion
Emcees try fi test but dem no ready fi di outcome
Guard your windows, close your doors
Fuck that, hide your pens and lock your jaws
Dig that?  My verbal skills should be against the laws
You wit that?  Now light a spliff for the hip-hop cause
Lemme hit that, smell the fear, you made me attack
You caused your own extermination not knowing how to act
I thought I warned you not to make me mad you just wouldn't listen
Now you hidin and duckin, prolongin your hip-hop lynchin
Talkin shit got in too deep and huh...
Caught you niggaz sleepin huh?
Feelin real fucked up cuz you couldn't catch me creepin huh?

[CHORUS]

[Eve]
You little bustas make me sick wit the dumb shit
Spreadin rumors like bitches
Can't turn my back on none a ya'll, probably wind up in stitches
Jealous itches y'all can't scratch, irritate your existence
Tryin to cheat your way in this race, knowin you can't go the distance
Runnin up against the thoroughbred outlastin you all
No matter, how long you train gon' set your self up to fall
Cause I got stamina, I go as long as you need
Coulda seen a million bitches rhyme but you'll remember me
I be the... new choice of the rap generation
You know my name nigga, basically you my creation
Not greater than the average man but I'm top choice
Kill competition when they listen just by the sound of my voice

[CHORUS] to fade out</pre>
