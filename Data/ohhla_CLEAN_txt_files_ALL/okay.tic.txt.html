(Ali) 
St. Lunatics and we here now, we never give up 
Swallowin Cris' 'til we spit up, put your shit up 'cause now 
We navigatin, wood grain, hood slang, collaboratin 
God over satan, no debatin, so I'm celebratin 
This new life, off the block buyin stock 
Divin off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock 
And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card 
Bitches goin nuts when the rims hit the boulevard 
Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin 
From the T.V.s, diamonds went from hard to see to 3-d 
Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD 
Puffin seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski 
DC to France, finance is too advanced 
Wit' plans to 'cause a trance, money stands yellin "romance!" 
I never stop comin, gunnin, runnin and sunnin 
With Cuda spinnin them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin and blunted 

(Chorus - Ali) 2x 
I'm like okaaaay, niggas brought they cars out 
Thick broads out, all the stars out 
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin 
"What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the Infinite?" 

(Murphy Lee) 
Five deep in a Yuko', we struggle by toes, we still ghetto 
Float St. Louis, fake insurance, with no petro 
Nuts are heavy, Teddy Peddy tell 'em to let go 
'Tics are ready, Kevin Law tell 'em I said so 
I let go, sixteen out of sixty-four 
And the forty-eight bars left'll have you keekin for mo' 
Women be like "who do y'all think y'all are?" 
I'm Mr. pull up in big trucks, I'm far from a star 
'Cause I'm the sun, the reason why the day gon' come 
One out of five reasons why they hatin on us 
Tracks is like a gas tank, I fill 'em on up 
And my shows is robbery style, they givin it up 
I'm like a Michael Jackson concert, a milli' and up 
And these haters are like a comedy, be buggin me up 
They women treat me like cows, they be pullin my stuff 
And to get that up outta me more, they be suckin me off 

(Chorus) 

(Kyjuan) 
Now you know Mo, I stay equipped with a zip 
And the soles of my Air Force One's on e'ry trip 
And on e'ry whip I choose those D's to roll 
(What them niggas 'round the corner gon' start shit for?) 
When they know, oh, he keep a stash in the Nav' 
Pop a half and take out your Ave. on my behalf 
My whole staff love to laugh and count the money 
On the couch, hands in our pants like Al Bundy 
I love smoke ganjä, Monday to Monday 
And e'ry other day a nigga fuckin with gun play 
It's ok, since all the dogs out 
All my broads out, gon' and bought the bar out
And we rollin, Henny holdin and blunt rollin 
Money foldin, been in more rings than Hulk Hogan 
It's official, Nelly Hummer clean as a whistle 
You boys signed to Fo' Reel, you doin your thug thizzle 

(Chorus) 

I'm like okaaaay </pre>
