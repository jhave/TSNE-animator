Song:   This Is Love
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Here's a few things that I like now
Making beats on my MPC
picking up an underground CD or mix tape
Diggin through record crates
Goldin stay looking for the perfect break to sample and truncate
raw raps on a raw track
Copping mad timberlands like the mall that you shop at
Combat fatigues a notebook full of rhyme schemes that I keep in my backpack
Anthem of a life rockin the mic
Spending a little time showing love to my wife
The way Christ loved us sacrificed his life
Bore them stripes restoring the life
Doing shows on the stage seeing souls getting saved
Hearing this track being played in your escalade
As you roll through the hood sitting on blades
Cats gonna bug when they hear they mom say

[Chorus]
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love
I like the hands up keep ya hands up
Party people in the front I need ya hands up
And when ya hands up leave your hands up
See there's a lot of thing I like but only one thing I love

I like Saturdays and just waking up late
I like things right away 'cause I don't like to wait
I like tasty cakes, and Philly cheese steaks
And the Tampa bay Bucs and Miami hurricanes (whuuuut...)
Now I like my shoes clean with a fresh pair of jeans
And some rice and some beans and a box of krispy kremes
I like Mt. Dew 'cause I like the caffeine
And the pistons and wolverines is my sports teams
I like the Double-Double at the In and Out Burger
but I don't like McDonalds they always mess up my order
I like my man Spongebob and Homestar Runner
I like flip flops and tank tops in the summer
I like to make goofy faces when I smile for the camera
I like to rock old school hip hop and mc hammer
I like Xbox clean socks I like Canada
But there's one thing I want and this is what I'm asking ya

[Repeat Chorus]

I love the way that God just takes a man
And then changes him gives him strength to stand
I love when the world says I ain't got a chance
See I'm loving that you're the one that tells me I can
I love the fact that you just loved me first
You erased my past and freed me from the curse
And even at the times when I just act my worse
I love that ya take me back that I don't deserve
I love every time I open your word
That I see in every line every chapter and verse
That your love made you die and that love that occurred
It left you crucified 'cause your love for the world
And I love how you just love me so much
I love how you provide just more than enough
And with the rhyme that I say now that I bust
See I like a lot of things but you're the one I love

[Repeat Chorus]</pre>
