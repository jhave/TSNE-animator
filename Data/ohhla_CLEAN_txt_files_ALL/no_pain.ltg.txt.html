Typed by: grahamninja21@yahoo.com

Forever to the east.. no pain
Fear no man feel no pain
Fear no man feel no pain
Fear no man feel no pain
Fear no man feel no pain
Fear no man feel no pain

{Mr Funkyman}
Look into my eyes hear my name (echo of chorus)
Mr funkyman show no shame (echo of chorus)

{Mr Funkyman}
Everybody walks like the man talks like the man
You can be a man but not Mr Funkyman
Cause a lot of people say Mr Funkyman is not human
Call me what you want I keep your system like booming
"I have arisen" live from the mental prison
I am trying to figure out who these nigga's think they dissin
You blow up and everybody wants to diss a brother
I swear if it anit one dam thing its another
But its cool cause I know how you feel
 "Niggas just mad cause they anit got no record deal-- Sah b" On the real
My name is Mr Funkyman and no there anit no other
Ask your mother

Chorus x4

{Sah b}
Once again I be the microphone damager
Fuck you yore record company you're production and your manager
You're better of getting a hysterectomy
Than trying to step to me
Don't even think about wetting me
We can go steal-to-steal grill-to-grill record deal to record deal the hill
to hill
Back at you felling no pain
And by no other name
Cause I am still remain the same
And it's a shame that suckers getting paid for fronting
Yo Mr Funkyman let them no a little something
Is there any crew you that can get with us
"Cause not don't even think about it-- Mr Funkyman"
I heard your trying to bite my style
But it anit worth your while
Cause I got new styles like ??
Sah b packed with dope rhymes and dope beats
Stepping out one
And get that ass done yeah

Chorus x4

{Mr Funkyman}
So as Mr Funkyman steps into the room
Its clear like a finger pointing to the moon
That you should never try to diss your style is corny
Nigga I will get all up in your ass like I am horney (ouch)
How you going jump up talking about what I stole
Bitch you better slow your role
Before yousell your soul
Getting all mad when you don't know the facts
But what you need to do is relax
"Yeah sit that ass down man"
To tell the truth I think you like the way I rock
How you going to diss me when your mum is on my jock
But you can bring your boys and I will eat them all
This ball beat them all I get you open like menthol
You know real titles have to be earned
That's why I am Mr Funkyman and you're just a herb
We can rumble like Rocky and Apollo creed
Because I never been afraid to bleed
So what you need no pain

Chorus to fade.</pre>
