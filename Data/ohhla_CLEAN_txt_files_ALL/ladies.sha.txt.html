Time to jam, I got a quarter grand ready to splurge
Suddenly I got the urge to watch some bodyslam
Ready to go clubs-hoppin, my pockets
Full of money and I'm feelin real funny
( ? ) figure eights in the place cold stun me
Then I got approached by this light skinned honey
Said, "Don't look surprised, see, I know who you are
Let's separate here and have a drink at the bar
My name's Sexy Betsy, you are a rap star
You got it goin on, I think you're gonna go real far"
Tried to flatter me, said my lips look sweet
And juicy, "and I bet it takes like a peach
What do you think?" I said, "Sex on the Beach"
A few more looks, I had her hooked like a leech
Five minutes we hung out, honey girl strung out
Now I coulda took honey girl home without a doubt
She start to stare, run my fingers all through her hair
You know what happened? A ( ? ) came out
I was surprised, didn't wanna believe
That my hand had to feel honey girl's hair weave
So I chilled, I didn't get ill or rowdy
Said, "See ya baby, I'm Audi like gowdy"
Thought it was real but it was fake, see, I was blind
You never know what you find
Dealin with

[ CHORUS ]
(Ladies)
Got to have you lady, you sexy baby
(Ladies)
Bamboo earrings and things like that don't phase me
(Ladies)
Yes, I'm speakin to the fly women of the world
Peep it out
(Ladies)
Gimme a lady anytime and keep the fly girls

I like ladies that's light skinned, brown skinned
The tone of skin to me makes no difference
I don't understand why some brothers frown
When they're approached by a woman who's dark or brown skinned
Some light skinned women think they're too good
Stay in the mirror all day and they think that they should
Find a man who's much more darker than them
Why choose your man by the color of skin?
I don't front, I tell straight facts
What I say has a very strong impact
I want you to know the eight shades of yellow
Eight shades of brown and it equals 16 shades of black
You need to wise up, cut out the bull crap
Whoever told you that need to be slapped
I don't smoke dust, not on a pipe or crack
The color of your skin to me doesn't mean jack
Because I know the right way to angle you
Most women are swift and changeable
Listen up laides, see, I got a thing for you
So now I'ma ( ? ) a few
Because I think it's bout time I let you know
I'm into women, but I'm not a superhoe
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without em

[ CHORUS ]

Break it down

( *sax solo* )

Get on the dancefloor, make sure you don't trip
Don't front now, I see you're pluckin those lips
Get a grip on a groove and don't slip
Shake it all around and roll your hips
Hourglass bodies that look sexy sassy
I'm the type that won't let a honey pass me
I'm not a dog, my name's not Lassie
Every once in a while I feel kinda nasty
Cool and calm, composure's kept
But some honeys think I'm only out to get my thing wet
My main goal is to control your soul
On the dancefloor cause like Keith, I'll make you sweat
Because you're so tender
Leavin me breathless, so this message I send ya
They're so mysterious, there's somethin about em
You can't live em and I can't live without

[ CHORUS ]

Yeah, uknowmsayin?
This is how I feel about you ladies in the '90s
cause y'all so sweet and tender
so I had to kick one out for you, yeah
This is Lakim Shabazz in full effect, 1990
and like L.L. said, 'small things are definitely behind me'
See ya</pre>
