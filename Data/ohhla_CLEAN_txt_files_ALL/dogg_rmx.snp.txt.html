When I step to the stage in my g-boy stance (what)
And say a few rhymes that make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove, I come from up above
You're trippin on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga dont beat her, cause if you beat em, ya dont need em
Yeah they gon have your baby,

I believe em, and dont mistreat em, I stay up on em (what)
But thats one to grow on nigga, let me flow on (cuzz)
Cause uh, you could rock to the rhythm you see (what)
But you could rock to the rhythm on me..(uh-huh) me.. (uh-huh) me.. 
But when you do your thang make sure you do your thang
On the hang, and everythang is everythang
Man, I'm on this paper chase
Like them whiteboy D.A.'s was on the case (uh-huh)
But you know I aint tryin to floss but 
Murder was the murder was the case that they lost 
(murda murda murda murda)

chorus

Snoop:
Now do anybody in the house remember

Now, when I grow up I wanna be like Snoop, mad pussy and women
As we do from the beginnin (uh-huh)
In and out of the Boz Hotel, they say your family dont know me
Hold on homie, thats phony, informal
Say, tell, L's in jail, vest before test,
no one in my click fell (what)
The females with the almighty fatherly
Cuz we thinkin bout peeps, what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind (say what)
Cause you feelin where we make it hizzot
But I'ma get back to the grizzats,
