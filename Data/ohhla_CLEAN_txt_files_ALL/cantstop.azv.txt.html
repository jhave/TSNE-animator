What's the use of me of me foolin myself?
No matter what I keep tellin myself...
What's the use of me of me foolin myself?
No matter what I keep tellin myself...
What's the use of me of me foolin myself?
No matter what I keep tellin myself...
What's the use of me of me foolin myself?
No matter what I keep tellin myself...

(I don't believe this... I'm makin all these moves.. for
WHATT???)

[Verse 1]
I do me for a G Note, niece, she's yellin Nemo
Mama bear, she there, losin hair cause of the chemo
Every door buzz, little cause see at the peek hole
Swearin he holdin heavy, hidin out from the RICO
Coke sold by Chico out the corner bodega
Him n Bobbito... la familia now finito!
It's deep tho, its like my soul was stole by the repo
Resowed in Carlito, and retold on Tivo
Ice cold wit a ego, dice rolled and somebody's Deebo'd
Trios expose dikes on the D' Low
It's love wit my amigos, other niggaz they freeload
Yeah he hold, but my homeys only unload torpedoes
So please yo, I'm from the killa cap of the kilos
Where niccaz clap, and fat bytches get yapped for
their cheetos, its re-al
But still blocks is hot like veal
So cock block, or cop shot, nothin stops the P.O.

[Verse 2]
Wifee want an abortion, her parents divorcin
Granted, I understand it, but my mans in a coffin
Who planned it? I guess they panicked, cause they left him in Boston
He died.... for a pie, identified by his porcelains
It's caution, Unc just got a chunk of some fortune
Bossin, I guess the paper supportin extortin
Tossin it to them dealers, takin it like Lakers did Portland
Cases is costin, so faces wont make it for talkin
It's basics, they mistake once they replace it for flossin
It soften, never high when dividin my portion
Why forever fly till I die, dry from exhaustion
Move accordin, like they keys on a organ
No sneezin or coffin, I weeze when I'm walkin, indeed
We under siege from those D's cause they stalkin
Cars is auctioned, homes is seized
OG's extortin the seeds, now its the new breed absorbin

[Verse 3]
The names is changed, the games the same
It's playin fair, but years of Nightmares, like Dana Dane
It ain't clear, but I'm right here still and sayin the same
Refusin to shed a tear, tho the pain done came
Provin I played the game, from cocain to fame
From rope chains, gazelli frames, I remain to blame
It's deep, but never speak certain names in vein
I know beef, and when it peak, it can strain the brain
No police, its just creep creep, bang for bang
No grief, brothers deceased, others arraigned and hang
None of us just eatin, maintain the strains
The streets is just the streets, when it rain it rain
