[Chorus]
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
The fox tried to eat gingerbread
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
The fox tried to eat gingerbread
Hahahaha

[Verse 1]
You all heard the story about me and the fox
I was on the run and he set me up
Needed his help, the snake that he was
The greedy motherfucker tried to eat me alive
In the belly of the beast, Gingy survived
Sat there, plotted, refused to die
Relive Jonah inside the whale
The hunger of this creature became a jail
Too strong, mind over matter, can't break me
Upset his stomach, no longer can he take me
Suffering food poison, regurgitate me
Now it's really on, I'ma make him hate me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Got my gun, blew a plug out his ass
I'ma kill him, make a rug out his ass
Please Gingy, I didn't want to do it to you
The feds made me cause they had a lot of dirt on me
Said that if I didn't they'd put a hurt on me
Can't do time, I'm not built like that
I said bitch niggas like you get killed like that
You're not a fox no more, nigga you're a rat
I'ma keep your fur, turn it to a mat
I cut his belly, left it wide open
Pull out his organs, dispose without a trace
Dragged the motherfucker to my fireplace

[Chorus]

Pop a cap in that nigga
Beat his ass with a candy cane
Put some Pez up in his head
Fuck that red ass fox
Nigga tried to trick me
Yeah that's right, now he's a murder case
That's what I was gonna say
Fuck him and his whole family
Fox family, fox five</pre>
