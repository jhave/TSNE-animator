[Verse One] [Phonte]
Another day up in these labels of rap
And you're a battle MC who swears that your style is flavorly phat
Can't wait to hit the studio disabling tracks
So everyone can hear your shit on they turntables and DATS
You put your, single out so now you layin' it back
Cause now everybody's sayin', "Yo son, your name on the map"
And everybody's actin' crazy in fact
Hoes be sweatin' your gear 
And askin' shit like, "What fragrance is that?"
But that's the life you live
Great sex with your admirers 
Cause your album's in the deck of everybody's Iowa
But prior to, all the props and all the street buzz
Nobody in your neighborhood could give a fuck who you was
Because
They don't love you 
They love what you stand for
The car you drive and the loot you got your hands on
That shit could end in a minute
Any minute
And then your driveway won't have all them Bentley's in it
And wine glass won't have all that Remy in it
No video shoots with Hype and P. Diddy in it
So don't get caught up in the fame and applause
And brainless awards 
Next year they ain't gonna want you no more
Check it out now

[Chorus]
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean
They play the fall guy for they claim to fame
It's just the same old shit, it's just the names that change
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean

[Gentleman talking]
Yes sir. Welcome to the Yama Rocka Lounge. I'm here to park your car
YEAH!

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
Ayo yo it's game time
Time to stop these niggas lame with the rhymes
They rhymes be full of one lines
And one line proves to be too many
And too many proves to be plenty for me to disregard 
Bout tired of givin' cats fake head bobs and nods
Listen to their squad's boys front to be hard
And hood D's
Held respect like wood leaves in the park
Shedding tears when it's after three
After me
Anything left is tragedy
Wipe out your team cause I stay past three
On the Richter
Only AIDS patients stay sicker
You must be drunk of the liquor
Cause Pooh is a chaser and I hate that pain in major
Give a fuck about y'all cause your label is major
And your image
Man, they got you lustin' the doe
We're gonna see where your love is when you're facin' the flo'
And somebody's four pound tucked, ready to blow
And you surrounded by faces that you don't really know
Got your life flashin' fast and you wish it would slow
That's why I love the beats and I lust the flow
So now you know 

[Chorus]
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean
They play the fall guy for they claim to fame
It's just the same old shit, it's just the names that change
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean

[Scratching]
"Braggin' and boastin', boastin' and braggin'" - The Pharcyde 'Y?'
"Cash in your check, cause it's the last one you get" - Gang Starr 'Here Today, Gone Tomorrow'
"The tables have turned and you ain't in effect" - Gang Starr 'Here Today, Gone Tomorrow'

[Phonte talking]
Ladies and gentlemen, now coming to the stage, the main event
Doing some of Billy Ocean's greatest hits. Percy Miracles and the Blue Vibrations

[Percy Miracles singing]
Get out of my dreams
Get into my car

[Chorus]
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean
They play the fall guy for they claim to fame
It's just the same old shit, it's just the names that change
Rappers always be braggin' and boastin' (boastin')
But then they fall off like Billy Ocean

[Outro] [Phonte talking]
Yeah, yeah yeah y'all. To all y'all rappers, thinkin' y'all hot right now
When you fall off, I'm sayin', this what you're gonna be doin'
You gonna be in a lounge in Vegas somewhere. Doin', doin' hit. You know what I'm sayin'?
Doin' the old cover joints. So always, always, always be thankful for what you got
Like that y'all. It's like this y'all. It's Little Brother, Sound Providers don't quit y'all
Like that y'all. It's like this y'all. It's Little Brother, Sound Providers don't quit y'all</pre>
