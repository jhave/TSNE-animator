Yeah

[Chorus - Jeremih]
Go hard, today
Can't worry about the past 'cause that ye-sterday
I'm a put it on the line 'cause it's my time
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Gotta stay on my grind 'cause it's my time (hey)
My time (hey), my time (hey)
If you're with me let me hear you say, (come on, come on)
My my, my my, if you're with me, let me hear you say
My my, my my, oh, it's my time

[Fabolous talking over Chorus]
The past is the past, you know
It's a new day bro
My day, we gotta do it now
Hey, hey
This what we've been waitin for right here y'all
This moment right here
It's my time, my time baby, come on
Loso

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Guess what time it is?  My, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's our time
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock (what?)
Yeah, me o'clock, everytime I check
Niggaz don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex (damn)
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex
Game's so bickery (uh huh), so full of trickery (uh huh)
Nursery rhyming, hickory, dickory
Blowin that sour, the hood call it pickery
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, +Victory+, yes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
My time's more like fly time
Don't call it gettin dressed, call it in the sky time
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it (yes)
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this (yes)
First I took the time out, then I put the time in (uh huh)
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing (the timing)
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds (yes)
In other words that's called perfect timing (woo)
I feel like a favor (uh huh), I feel like a savior (uh huh)
They clockin my neck, I feel like I'm Flavor (wow)
I go so hard, Loso God (God)
Dance, scream, fid-di-di-di-damn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Jeremih]
0-9, all mines
It's been a few years, now it's me, about time
You know I got committed with it since I've been up in the zone
Sign the dotted liiiine, now is on (now it's on)
So y'all better check your wrist piece (why?)
'Cause it's time to make history (yeah)
Just hop in here up on this hit streak
How the, how the, how the hell you gonna evict me? (evict me, yeah)
You know I'm here to stay, never cocky now
Big bottles we poppin now, no tellin where we stoppin now
And I represent the Chic-a-g-o
On the track with F-A-B-O, you know we

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs</pre>
