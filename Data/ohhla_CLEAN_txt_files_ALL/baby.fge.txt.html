I wanna thank y'all for coming to see the preacher's son tonight (thank you)
Fellas, hold on to your girl right now
Yeah right now we're gonna slow the whole dancefloor down
Oh yeah, take it back to the old school, let's go

Baby, let me holla at you
You know there's no greater love
Than a woman who loves a man
And a man who loves a woman, ah yeah

I wanna love ya
And I ain't talking trash neither, ey
This is something that I can feel deep in my soul, oh, oh
We gonna listen to some Marvin
We gonna listen to some Isley
We gonna listen to some Teddy Pendergrass (Pendergrass)
Ooh, once I got you in the mood
I wanna introduce myself to you
We gonna listen to Smokey
We gonna listen to Stevie
We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah

Doggy, and I ain't talking bout my pitbull neither
I'm talking about the first lady
That was there in the beginning when your daughter wasn't with it, oh yeah

I wanna love ya
And I ain't talking trash neither, ey
This is something that I can feel deep in my soul, oh, oh
We gonna listen to some Marvin (Marvin)
We gonna listen to some Isley (Isley)
We gonna listen to some Teddy Pendergrass (Pendergrass)
Ooh, once I got you in the mood
I wanna introduce myself to you
We gonna listen to Smokey
We gonna listen to Stevie
We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah

Yeah, I'm a young man with an old school, girl
But then you told me a good woman
Is worth more than diamonds and precious pearls
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So lay back, and let me massage you, everywhere now
I can feel them move with your body
Harder, harder, harder, harder, harder
You make me so hot

We gonna listen to some Marvin
We gonna listen to some Isley
We gonna listen to some Teddy Pendergrass (Pendergrass)
Ooh, once I got you in the mood
I wanna introduce myself to you
We gonna listen to Smokey
We gonna listen to Stevie
We gonna listen to Donny Hathaway
Ooh, would you please lay your body next to mine, ah yeah</pre>
