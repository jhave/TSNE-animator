[Malice]
I'm sayin life is crazy right
Shit is real wild
Like the realest shit ever, you know
Hold up, I'm comin, just let me bless this real quick, hold up
God, I ask that you continue to watch over us
I ask that you continue to bless us in the countless ways that you've done so
I ask that you walk with us on each and every encounter that we face
Cause life, as you know, can be a dirty game
But above all else right now God
I ask that may we not have to lose another one of our own to this game
May not another mother have to bury her son to this game
We've lost too many already
Lord, you know we're anything but heartless
I guess, what I'm saying right now Lord
Is that if these words hurt more than they help
I could only hope that you will have mercy upon our souls - Amen</pre>
