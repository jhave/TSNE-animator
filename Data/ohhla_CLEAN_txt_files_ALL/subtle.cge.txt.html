It's only sprinkling, I tell her nothing is ruined
We playin' the license plate game I'm loving what she keeps doin'
To my inner thigh, rocking the diamond earrings I gave her
She's smiling, looking angelic
All her friends secretly hate her
beauty, she knows she got it
Got me where she wants me, all erotic
Next to her hand the K is burning a hole in my pocket
I pull it over, get her a soda, I'm half gone
Hit the bathroom, stick the key in the jar to turn it back on
Look in the mirror, throw some water on my face, I'm snotty
Thinking of things I'm about to do to my girl's body
The rain is picking up now, my eyes are kinda lazy
The sky is hazy
She's like "you look pale," I said she was crazy
Pushed the pedal to the floor mat
Hydroplaned corrected it fast then
Slowed down past a car crash
She put her head on my shoulder, said she was getting
A little sleepy, don't worry, baby, we're minutes from heaven

I pick my face up with glass in it
Can't remember the last minute
Glove box, my girl's face mashed in it
I called her name out, she didn't respond
Pulled her shoulder back, touched her arm
Her entire fucking face is gone!
I see you breathing, I'm pleading with Jesus, leave her lifeless
Don't leave her like this
Reached for the birthday balloon of nitris
I'm trying to dial for help with hands I can't feel
Stuck in the driver's seat, my broken ribs gripping the steering wheel
She squeezed my hand, then let go
I should have been sitting shotty
And the rain wouldn't still be pouring all over the angel's body
I'm trying to crawl back in the K hole to get outta the car
But the K won't climb out of my nose and back in the jar
This isn't her I tell myself, at least she's happy
Wherever she is, her soulless eyes looking at me
I pump my fists to bleed out to catch her and let the worms play
And tell her I'm sorry I gave her death for her birthday</pre>
