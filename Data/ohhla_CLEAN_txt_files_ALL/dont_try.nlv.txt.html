{Tec-9 Talking}
We bout to fuck em up with this one baby (Fuck em up dog)
Say no mo, (Say no mo) *gun cocks* say no mo *gun cocks*

{Verse 1: Tec-9}
F-L to the E-X-I-S, Flexis nigga, Mother fucka whats next?
Yall niggaz wanna know what the truth is
It is what it is Blazin South, we handelin biz
Hold down blocks with shotty's spark it up in the dark
Keep bitches to riches, dump ya body in the rivah
Hustle all night my goal is to win the battle
Schemin on a chicken, pickin on a meal ticket
Dont make the Capital get wicked
Some of this shit is not even listed
Hennessy keeps me blisted
Worth a nigga layed fa fuckin with my Yola
Nigga out there bad sold a nigga Baking Soda
I guess he never heard about the backgrounds of Tec
Took a big chunk a meat out the head and neck
Reckless when I'm drunk, livin on the edge
But I pledge to keep you motha fuckas crunk
Sinista got the funk, and we got 5 albums
Plus a new release SHUT YA MOUTH!

{Hook: Tec-9 &amp; Lil Ya}
[Tec]    Dont try to come uptown if you aint about that drama
[Lil Ya] Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma
[Tec]    Bust a nigga head and make him come with me
        I told yall niggaz bout fuckin with UNLV
Dont you even try to come uptown if you aint about that drama
[Lil Ya] Nigga gon respect the 3rd or I'ma
[Tec]    Bust a nigga head and make him come with me
        I told yall niggaz bout fuckin with UNLV

{Verse 2: Lil Ya}
Yo, Its gon take more than a vest to protect ya chest
Fuck a Smith &amp; the Wess let the grenades do the rest
Behind the coke I'll kill you and whoever
Bustin at ya guts with my nickel plated devil
I draw my heat quick, cock the six, spank a bitch, scared as shit
Me and my dogs celebratin a lick
Throw bows at the foe's if they gettin away
Aint nuttin gon stop me from gettin the Yay
So often shootin guns I cant even pronounce
Jackin dealers hey you could say they pay me allow
Ya the bully on the block, plus I want what you got
Gimmie ya whip, stash, cash plus ya Cartier watch
Watch, house, wife, dogs and all ya betta up it
Ya head I'm bout to split you done played and got me pissed
Touched a nerve you done pissed my trigga finger off
Dont let me unleash the demon and call my nigga Flex fa ya'll
Haulin bodies, baggin, taggin bitch niggaz
You gotta be bout that if ya wanna be a rich nigga
