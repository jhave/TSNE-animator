(singing)
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said "You got me waiting"
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend?  Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
house, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said "It's over you waste of time BITCH"
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said "Stop, Rick", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out early, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
"Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?"
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

(singing)
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said "Being straight up, it's you I really wanted"
Though she fucked niggas with money like MAD
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
"But what if shorty finds out?"
Never be too clever
"Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together"
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
"We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later", 
Her girlfriend hot, then stopped living, Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm...

(singing)
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh, lalalala
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you hoe
Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said, you got me waiting
Sitting in my car, waiting for yoooooooooou-ooh-ooh
lalalala, lalalala, lalalala, lalalala</pre>
