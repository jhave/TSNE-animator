[Jay-Z]
R-O-C
Memph Bleek do it again
Jigga man, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
Missy, sho' nuff

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo check it now, yo
Yo Hov' chose I -- I ain't gonna lie
What I look like turnin down cho-cha?
Drove by, smoked the lye
Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn Bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, SHUT UP
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doin 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you like the way the white wifebeat fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not
(That's gangsta)

[Missy]
Oh is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your bitch?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, bitch

[Jay-Z]
Uh, yo don't get mad at me
I don't love 'em I fuck 'em
I don't chase 'em I duck 'em
I replace 'em with another one
You had to see she keep calling me BIG
(And another one!)
And my name is Jay-Z
She be all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
Got my feet up on you sofas, man
I mean a hostess for my open hand
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
I'mma pimp her, it's over man
When I twist her in the Gold sedan
Like I'm Goldie man, you've been chosen man
Jigga man, ice burg with the frozen hands
Wedding bands don't make it rosey man

[Missy]
Oh is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your bitch?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, bitch

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo.. how dumb the pimp?  I heard he trick
Bought a new five, maybe six
Copped that for his new down bitch
And I was diggin that down since '96
Memph-Man I'll take your bitch
Let her do her thing, give brain in the whip
And you know how it go when it come to the hoes
She can do the same thing to the click you know
Yo hoe chose, don't get mad at me
Got your wife callin me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese
My bad is that your freak
But you know how a thug do
When a nigga hit that, it's fuck you
Keep it snug, tre deuce in the boot
Niggas wanna act, fuck a slut too

[Missy]
Oh is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your bitch?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, bitch
Oh is that your bitch
Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick
Keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch?
Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs
Keep looking in his eyes
Oh is that your bitch?
You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill
Don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch?
Why she beeping him?
Keep praising him?
Cause that's Bleek and them, bitch</pre>
