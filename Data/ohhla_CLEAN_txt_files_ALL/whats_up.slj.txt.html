What's Happening with you Slim Baby
Aight It's the Nigga they call Souljah Slim
With 9  8s ya heard me
Back up in this bitch with dis man's ¿bounce? shit
For the real Souljahs and the real Souljettes
Shit Get Real

Chorus:
Now when i say What's Up y'all say what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening
Now the name of this shit is called what's up what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening

(Souljah Slim)

I told alot of talk that i retired from ¿bounce?
But that don't mean it stops like the nigga nigga
Fuckin holes pop
Open up shop 
Close down shop that's had it
Open from 9 'o clock
Non-stopping til the early morning
We got the niggas that playin cool
But there ain't nuthin wrong with representing where you from fool
Me, Myself I'm from Uptown 
Representing Projects
Where you from? Uptown
I hear ya shakin down
(¿....?.....¿......?......¿......?....¿.....?)
If you down with this shit 
Repeat after me and go
If you down with this shit Repeat

Chorus:(x2)
Now when i say What's Up y'all say what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening
Now the name of this shit is called what's up what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening

Now I'm not tryin to tell you nigga to put yo guns up 
Yo pussy guns
If a nigga runs up the Wrong way
Yeah kill 'em
Because we're tryin 2 have a good time
You know us niggas, we annoyed
Cause them niggas starting lies
And drinkin (¿?)
And fuck with the misses
They be makin ¿eddie? bounce
Like pussies that don't fuck with the bitches
That be ¿smell at ya?
Cause i'm lookin for a firebred
Off red and black
(¿.............?) holler at me
When I get off the Stage BOOM
Bring a lady friend
I got a ¿pile? for her too
But right now I'm tryin to get this bitch Outragous
Now I want them niggas that are fuckin hoes 
And twartin pussy like it's Contagious
It's like a nigga's used 2 bein 49
Big Man, a roller
Stringlinein Unknown
Then used to be at the clubs goin down
Where all the rappers get the mike and show they ground
Rest in peace Hit man, Pimp Daddy
And Daddy Jones
Kilo G Slim
And my nigga nigga
The Slum nigga
The Real nigga
He was ¿? from the front to the back, my nigga

Chorus:(fade out)
Now when i say What's Up y'all say what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening
Now the name of this shit is called what's up what's out
Now WHAT'S UP what's happening
WHAT'S UP what's happening
