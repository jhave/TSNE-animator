Verse 2 (Magic) :

I hear em scream bloody murder, hoping that they didn't see my face
Didn't want to kill em, but they had to be erased
With all that bullshit that they be speaking
Couldn't rest so I had to put them 6 feet deep
Thats how it is, I was raised by the thugs
They all had potential but they told me to sell drugs
It's World War 3 motherfucker, you fucking with Mac you fucking with me
His enemy's my enemy, you wouldn't wanna go against this squad
You betta run and hide cause somebody bout to die
If Mac say it's on then it's on, fuck sleep
We ride till the early fucking morning, looking for you bitch niggas
Yall started we gonna finish this shit
Take my picture and put it on a t-shirt bitch
I know you motherfuckers heard about me
The ones thats deceased are the ones that doupt me
You can call me Mr. 9th Ward

Chorus (Mac):

It's World War
Can't nobody run and hide
It's World War
Cuz everybody's gonna die
It's World War Nigga
Can't no nigga run from me they gun for me and come for me
Feel the Rath of a nigga who bust

It's World War
If you want it let's go get it get it
If it's what you need nigga we committed
If it's standing in your way nigga split it split it
And if it's real take it down with ya

Verse 3 (D.I.G.) :

Money and guns is what I'm known for keeping in my presence
These niggas better feel, what the fuck I'm tellin them 
I'm a young ghetto nigga rebellion
And I pull this from my weapon eat a nigga flesh every second

So feel that when I spit it's gonna be real shit

Run your mouth like a pussy I'ma fill it with dick

Fuck around with this war shit nigga your world is over
If it's what you need nigga come and get it get it
If you want beef nigga I'm commited and wit it
