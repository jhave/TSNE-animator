(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Uh-huh)
(Yo)

If you a rat or you a snitch
You shouldn't listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince
I'm sick with the spit
You pissed I get chips for this shit
This for my homies that be OT whip full of bricks
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride
I'm ahead of my time
I'm a threat to you guys, why?

I'm still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich
I'm fresh 'cus we don't sound like that other bullshit
My team hustle, no days off
And weigh so much salt? that you might have to take a snow day off
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you
See Wiz Khalifa's like a teacher I could show you to
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S
But like your under 21 you can't fuck with my bars
Ask about me the streets think I'm the youngest in charge
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads
And if it's on then I'm crushing them all
You niggas prolly right, when you say that I ain't fucking with' cha' 'y'all, dog

I'm on a paper chase, moving unit state to state
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating off a paper plate
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate
I see you playin with me, it's different, it's not a game
I'm moving heavy in the trenches
Best flow, back dow (door)
When I knock any nigga senseless
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to me

(Yeah I'm the prince)
(That's what it is man)
(Show and prove man)
(That's the name of the game man)
(Show and prove)
(And I got next)
(It's ya boy wiz khalifa, 412)</pre>
