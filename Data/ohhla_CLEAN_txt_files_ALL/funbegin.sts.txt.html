I like to party
I like to party
I like to party 
(Say what now?)		(repeated)

[ Daddy-O ]
I like to jam and party a lot
But I don't like jams where people get shot
But I do like jams that people have fun in
(Say what now?) So let the fun begin (fun, fun, fun)
Startin with the ladies who like to have fun
If the guy can't dance, then go, get another one
And get high on the drug called life
Nuff said from the Dad, so kick it, Delite

[ Delite ]
I'm kickin steps to a new program
Slip, slide in easy, and bam! slam the jam
I heard you liked to party, so what's the fuss about?
Go, go for yours, and turn the mutha out
I stand, this here will shift you into full gear
(In high gear) so tell the rest to stand clear
And bust the footnote: no time for dead bodies
No parkin on the dancefloor, cause I like to party

I like to party
(Say what now?)		(repeated)

(Take me to the next stage, baby)
(Take - me)

[ Daddy-O ]
Now when I'm at a party, I'm settin it off
Cold grab me a cutie, and I break north
Out to the dancefloor, Stetsa style
Break Stetsa fool and get Stetsa wild
3 o'clock in the morning I'm still here
Waitin for the Stet limo to appear
But Daddy-O'll get busy up until that time
Nuff said from the Dad, Dee, say your next rhyme

[ Delite ]
Lines around the corner, just to see the band
Bodies are packed like sardines in a can
I mean with the boom, said it kinda perfect
No doubt about it, yeah, I come to perk it
P-p-work it on up, what's up, it's time to move your butt
The rhythm thumps that keep you all hyped up
The ruff and the rugged, ain't nothin hip, but
It, so get up, it's time to strut

I like to party

(Take it to the bridge)

[ Daddy-O ]
Parties are made of people, and people make a party
And fights don't make it, cause fights'll ruin your body
When people choose to fight, the party ain't right
And it won't be right for the rest of the night
So take it from the Odad, party for fun
And take it for the Stet band, party for the next one
But don't party with a gun, that's dumb
Just as dumb as a soft MC tryin to get some

[ Delite ]
B-b-b-bass is boomin, on the mic we're stylin
Guys workin up a sweat, damn near buckwildin
You're cool, scopin out the girl that you like
Cause it's true: freaks still come out at night
And as you check your spot you know it's time to mingle
And get on down to the go-go single
We're makin it clear (yeah) from front to rear (a-ha)
Stetsasonic is the band of the year

I like to party
(Say what now?)		(repeated)
