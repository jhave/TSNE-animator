What they really want... {*8X*}

Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
Fuck with (fall to your death death) the niggaz with the guns
And you might get shot (get shot)
Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
You could (fall to your death death) be the first to feel the heat
To see how much we got (we got) {*2X*}

I still be the thuggish ruggish nigga
Dressed in all black khakis, fatigues, and boots
Still don't give a fuck about the law
Still run with a pump in my car and fuck who you are
Your fuckin with a couple of niggaz that's really insane
I'm talkin loco krayzie as hell
It ain't just a name it's the game
We done loosened up a couple strings
And shook a couple of screws loose in my brain
Besides that man ain't nothin changed
Look at me now
I'm still a thug
Nigga I still smoke bud
(You know) you know I still represent
St. Clair wig split shit nigga what
This is bone thug
Niggaz thinkin I told ya but we put it down like that
And whoever we got to fuck up to prove that
We do it and keep on movin
Guess who's back up in the house
Original cleveland criminals
Niggaz just send them subliminal messages like
"Murda, Mo Murda Murda!"
Never forgot where we come from
Watch how you move your tongue
Cause I got niggaz thats ready to jump off in your ass
And smash and crash
Protect my niggaz for combat
Leather Face at ya and on your ass like
I was a heat seeker creeper the reaper peep you
Sweep you off your feet in cleveland

[Layzie]
I be the smoothest little nigga you can meet me (me)
But nigga you fuck with me then I'm a fuck with you
Introduce you to this heat
I sweep the street
When I draw down let me hear ya say
"Fuck the Law!" now
Rawest niggaz in the town ready to thug and go down
Go pound for pound nigga that's the motto
Let me see you throw them things
And if it's real nigga keep it real
Show me your game I'm sure gonna claim
What the fuck is mine my nigga I'll take it
Grab a player hater by the neck
Choke him out and try to break it
Give me your money
Drop them keys
It's a jack move bitch
And since you haters ain't got no business
That's how we attack your shit
Nigga we'll smack your bitch in the middle of the grammy
And the media might ban me
Nigga this "Mo Thug Family" is for real

[Krayzie]
Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
Fuck with (fall to your death death) the niggaz with the guns
And you might get shot (get shot)
Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
You could (fall to your death death) be the first to feel the heat
To see how much we got (we got) {*2X*}

Pull it up sit up get up and count your money
Before it all gets spent up
And you wanna get rid of
A hood bitch with game and every bitch said I'm a good bitch
Fuckin with my wood grain
Everybody still playing that hood game quiet (quiet quiet...)
Especially when it's tired
My evironment ain't nothing but niggaz dying
In a chemical fed injection in Jasper, Texas
Split up these niggaz off in different sections
Don't hate my message
Destiny led to mimic chastity for my daughter
Wad up a niggaz sherm and come listen to the sermon
Swerving in my suburban lick it up with the bottle
But everybody know I got some problems
Had dreams of the Apollo
The fiends had faith in me
Suckas wouldn't run
A nigga not insane
Niggaz still with me bone
Some how they turn up
Run up and get your sign run blindly
Elevate through time nowhere to hide

[Flesh]
Our dogs finna haul off lead sawed off head
Nigga you drippin soakin with bloody body be beggin me
You know what you should've capped like 2-Pac with a glock
They're deadly better not upset my thug mentality sucka
You know you done fucked up don't you niggaz
Runnin up blastin big ass triggers
What the fuck you thought you saw with your head in the sky
Could it be a bird or maybe it's even a plane
For the untamed insane human only the fifth dog
Fuck you thought mothafuck fame
For the fact the shit is a fat game going
Remain number one in the land
Flesh strangle the gang
Bang bang bang I dropped five guards
In the name of the Lord I say
Now how many times will I have to slay today
Will I raise my guage
Oh God
How will I teach ya but it's these tactics that he daily practice
They gonna let you
Don't have it have it
Runnin up you sons of bastards blast it
We sons of assassins match it collecting more cash
That's true your feeling that
Niggaz said all my babies get a million
Struggle with a villain hit them with a venomous blow
I call on my mighty
Y'all can joke
Gonna surround my soul but go with the calico yo
We the tightest you know Mo the Mighty
Yes trues humbly united
My family never divided
Desperado, Thug Line, Mo Thug, Millennium, 7th Sign
For the FBI you wanna come test my Enterprise
Bitch you better go think twice and open up your mothafuckin eyes
These niggaz can't fuck with the fifth dog finna parlay
Everyday stormin your way you better lay low
So you might just duck when I buck guage
Can't you see my niggaz having a ball all day
Since we having a ball all day mothafuckers player hate

[Krayzie]
Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
Fuck with (fall to your death death) the niggaz with the guns
And you might get shot (get shot)
Get ya gun get ya gun did you kill them all..
You could (fall to your death death) be the first to feel the heat
To see how much we got (we got) {*4X*}</pre>
