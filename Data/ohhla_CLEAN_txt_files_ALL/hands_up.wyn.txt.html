{*lights lighter*} Yeah...

Uh, let's get fucked up
On the road to riches, you're just a speed bump
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down 'til it's just a tree stump
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm goin at'cha neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
and I stay burned out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights I lights up
The kush knocked out, Mike Tyson fights
I'm talkin 'bout ass and titties, Sex and the City
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for "Forget it"
I'm lovin my shine, sippin on fine wine
Up in some fine dime, then she give me Einstein
Young Money muddahfucker, yeah we picked a fine time
I'm a 17 nigga, bitch I don't mind dyin, man
I just ended up on, er'ry bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle, get a motherfuckin deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say, "Fuck y'all niggaz"
Breakin buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, +Gimme the Light+, no Sean Paul, nigga
Let nina bust in ya face like a porn star nigga
Yeah I keep the Brian Pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world moving in slo-mo
Man, I told Mack I was gon' do it
Above the law, but under the influence
Man, I was on the skateboard, kick push swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow
I had her, ass up in the air
I swear I got, I sweart I got the largest clip in the world
Right here in my gat, yah
And I wish a nigga play, I'ma bust a nigga ass
Hate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass
187, and a hockey mask, haha! 
YMCMB gonna ball, 'til we fall 
And this fuck all y'all, haha
Gonna ball til we fall, and this fuck all y'all
We straight, Sorry 4 the Wait
Yah!

Shout out to the big homie Gash, shout out to my nigga Minnish
Shout to my nigga Top Dog, my nigga Jay, yeah..
