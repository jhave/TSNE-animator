[Intro: sample of "Solid As A Rock" by Sizzla]
Can't keep a good man down
Always keep a smile when they want me to frown
Keep the vibes and I stood my ground
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin for a search
They found no weapon, just only a draw of herbs

[Jay-Z]
One, one, one-two... one-two!
Crown, crown, crown
Crown, bounce
Heh, yeah, huh, huh, huh, uh

You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you comin with me
These niggaz like rotary phones
It's a new day, hit up KD
Niggaz always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggaz shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'Bout 6 minutes, you gon' see it again!
...
'Bout 6 minutes, you gon' see me again
Yeah...

[Chorus: Travi$ Scott]
Shit on me
These niggaz tried to shit on me
I was left for dead
They tried to wipe me out of yo' history
Shit on me
These niggaz tried to shit on me
I was left for dead
They tried to wipe me out of they history!

[Jay-Z]
Fear is your only God
Get y'all to fear me is my only job
Hehe, hehe, crown
Crown, crown, crown
Crown, crown, uh

Bullet-proof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bullet-proof love, niggaz down since the yolk!
Bitch asked if I was God
Fuck I'm supposed to say no?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T.
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost
Bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit did
I wasn't supposed to live, hallelujah Hov!
Wasn't for the 'caine/Cain, wouldn't be able/Abel
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become your enemies
Niggaz' knives is double-edged, uh
...
Best friends become your enemies
Niggaz' knives are double-edged...

[Chorus]</pre>
