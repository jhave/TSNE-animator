Yeah...
No I won't call you master
Though to you I sold my
My microphone shines
I keep your children filled in
Colorful swirls are building
But not getting caught in a kind of killing
See paranoia will destroy ya
And I got a lot, maybe too much for ya
My veins are swelling, stress wracks my brain
The point where my head and neck connects is in flames
We've come a long way since the first mainframe
And there's more going on than computer games
We got inter-net, world wide web sites
Which you might get caught in if you don't keep your head right
Organize and educate the youth
But most would pass up revolution to loot
Won't fight for your rights but you'll die to look cute
Most would pass up revolution to loot

Ay yo it goes without saying whose delivery is nicest
So I'll say lady liberty represents Isis
Execs don't think midas will touch science
(well fool?)
My mind got me on the verge of violence
Or stopping this whole rap wrote in silence
But going against the negative grain is my defiance
The enlightened titan might win
I'll see the symbols at libraries and schools
Lodges, churches and temples
It be fighting for peace
Got me mad enough to shoot
But most would pass up revolution to loot
Won't fight for your rights but you'll die to look cute
Most would pass up revolution to loot

Ay yo times are critical, the screen reads unstable
My peeps are like 'release steam!' but I seem unable
I trip on microchips and ponder transponders
and feel the radio waves and satellites upon us
Zoom on the earth, zoom on California
Zoom on Los Angeles, zoom on me warning ya
If they shoot a slug and strike me like a baddamyst ?
Understand that government and industry's the catalyst
A battle was lost but quiet war still wages
Police engage us, like potential bigamists
Page is the limitless ?, cages for sentences
Till this anti-material particle finishes
With this unworkable body, oh lord
Rough child ? figured how to get the rich and poor
Extra promisory notes still but they can't afford
Then collect on collateral, financed your war
Feeling like the last poets --
"This is madness!"
Breaking down the me machine (?) related to a blackest
All ?, despite this movie liz-biz
Think for a minute kids, you know where Egypt is

(2x) 
I work for victory though
I'm taught by history
And ignorance as a status symbol makes no sense to me

Things I ??? I find shocking like Raiden ?
Voyage to self-discovery but no it's not maiden
It's just that it's never been made in this form
This storm I will weather till the weather gets warm
I work for victory though
I'm taught by history
And ignorance as a status symbol makes no sense to me
I speak especially to kids of the pyramids
Built with the symmetry
Raw gets the energy
Enemies throw me off the path that friendlies show me
I levitate and watch the demons gearing up below me
If you let out a bullet it may let out a virus
So ? paranoid, dilated our science

Kutmasta Kurt, and you just don't stop
Two More Men (?) Evidence, no you just don't stop
To the Ill Brother Crew, no you just don't stop
Of Mexican Descent Crew, you just don't stop
To the Swollen Members, no you just don't stop
Mad Aceyalone, no you just don't stop
To the Old World Chaos, you just don't stop
To the Liquid Crew, and the Barber Shop
It's like that
Dilated propaganda
Our science
Worldwide with this
Global dynamics... (repeat to fade)</pre>
