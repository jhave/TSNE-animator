(Gangsta Blac)
Peepin' down and in the cut
Comin' in with gangsta what?
To back it up this time I be cuz S.P.V. just ain't enough
Tuck it 'fore it's took away
Panic with no words to say
Silent then come violent, wildin', pokin' product round my way
Known for burnin' up the road
Peelin' til' I'm ridin' rims
In the cut like seat belts you can't find so don't fuck with him
Deep down in the dirty heard me?  Get me some and get me out
Ballin', fallin', callin', haulin' ass all through the North and South
Pack you up to sit you down
Quick enough to swipe a smile
Drano, cane-o, mastermind be truckin', gangstas speakin' now
Bumpin' just to pump it up
Really just to strut my stuff
Meditate to elevate my propaganda just enough
Wastin' with the ones who can't
Grew up seein' words they say
Put me with a pack of maniacs I might just choose to stay
In the cut forever be
Darker than it was before
This the shit that keep it twice as lit in and out that hoe
Nigga!!!

(Playa Fly)
Might as well tear it away and remember it like the Alamo
Mob with all your heart if you a part of this and mob some more
Take it from the floor, to the door, represent it straight
Strictly to the fullest cuz I rule this dirty ground of play
When nobody need it, no cases will get pleaded
No faces will get greeted, no wounds will get treated
More izzeye (eye) than shizzink (???)
More ???? than lizzean (lean)
Your brain just went blizank (blank) and you bet not blizzink (blink)
I thizink (think) go ???
I fight like a ????
Fly sky on that powder
And ain't had a wizzink (wink)
And Fly run the rizzink (rink), but D.K. went ???
No more means no more and this boat has been ???
If you some contact, Fizzo come and attack
With Fly my first family, while Fly aim for gizat (gat)
Look here Jack, no name callin' games
Or no cool chains
I run with Minnie Mae
And them M's in your fizace, your fizace, your fizace (face)</pre>
