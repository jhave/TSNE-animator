(Intro - Talking)
And now we will comence with a prayer 
WELCOME 
Hooked back up with tony C 
You know what im sayin Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
See theres a lot of quesions that muthafuckas need answered
youknowhatI'msayin?
They wanna know whats up with Bizzy and Bone Thugs 
(did y'all break up?) 
and all this and all that (whats goin on?)
I'ma simplify that shit
Feel me feel me

(Verse 1)
Standin in thick tops with two pairs of reeboks 
And we not leavin til them all clean where tha fiends at
Doin it for my babies and baby it aint no turnin back 
Burnin that cigarette
You know what these niggas can get
These, I done smoked soo much weed 
Bought 20 V's, hennessy 
And even the industry tried to play me like a crack fiend 
Eazy was my nigga but Eazy gave me all the liqour, I was only 16  
Ruthless cant tip me all of the demons missed me 
Two of the bones dissed me 
I dont give a fuck we got history 
Shit it aint no mystery 
Niggas is pissed off they say I aint showin up to shows
But the people dont know
I aint makin no money so what am I workin for 
Tell me what am I hurtin for
Baby what are we researchin for 
Restitution little foster kids give me contributions soo you can ring 
out the towel 
And watch its playin me now

(Chorus X4)
Roll, like can get rolled over come, come and get you some, 
de dum de dum de dum de dum de dont doubt me

(Verse 2)
Am I hate well I aint shot nobody yet how am I the bad guy 
Yall tellin mad lies
And this is for the strong black fathers
Gon get your dollars and take your kids to college 
Keep some extra for leather squallas 
My momma was a hustla, and you can call me pretty boy floyd 
Runnin when i hear the cop noise chillin coffee pops, they boys 
Thank you for the beatings im my own man elevate then a grown man 
I dont trust nobody, chemicals that was taped thru my nervous system
And sentimental survivors ducked down in churches protectin strays 
from mangin 
Did I forget to mention GOD never me and my wife drop daily 
On our knees forever little babies 
Remember remember the faith will get you through
Even though that hate was all we knew 
Still throwin food drives droppin little kids hollas
as we get rushed like Elian Gonzales screamin for momma

(Chorus X4)
Roll, like can get rolled over come, come and get you some, 
de dum de dum de dum de dum de dont doubt me

(Verse 3)
GOD first then we second for musics a blessin 
servin it from lyin then I aint bryon 
And I'm fryin and lessons of a ghetto kids
who feelin fiends cribs where everybody keeps dyin 
And everybodys takin nobody years in science
if signs exist in the times we tint
Fell in cryin to the bitch 
What the fuck am I supposed to do harm to the world is school 
With a tactic to lose, 
cause we been slaves ever since them niggas follow the rules
Minorites in hell majority in jail more rappers is actin
Never stood on no block I can tell raggin and force flaggin
Lil faggot you got some bail for my homies
Saddity you ain't nothin like Bizzy cause you phony I'm money
He dont want dymond dolla you talkin to nickys daddy
Have they momma or they fuckin fathers 
hello bother my peoples with daddy 
Well shit if people will tell me for fame 
Lame, read books and go get some game

(Chorus till end)
Roll, like can get rolled over come, come and get you some 
de dum de dum de dum de dum de dont doubt me</pre>
