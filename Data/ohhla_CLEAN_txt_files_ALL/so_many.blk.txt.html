I got young jawns givin' great head
I got old heads that break bread 
Wit' they legs spread on the daybed 
Chinese chicks on some Siamese shit
Two-a-time/One grind one ride the dick
I got college girls gon' wild
Runnin' out to the store 
For more condoms when they run out
Black chicks/White chicks
Fat chicks/Nice and thick
Rich chicks/Icy pricey bitch
Got broke jawns eatin' three wings and fried rice
Hustle to the coke/Gone in jeans and white Nikes
Got Puerto Rican stripper chicks lickin' dicks
Get the keys to ya whip
What's the reason you whipped?
Why you give me ya chips?
Is you stupid or what?/Naw!
I need the loot for the stuff
The coochie enough?/Naw!
I need a ride to the stu'
Scoop me or what?/Naw!
I got two like you with a Coupe and a truck, uh

[Chorus]

[Baby Blak] 
I got so many ladies I can't help but say no (No, no)

[Female singer]
Ooh, ooh, we love you, B. Blak 
Ooh, ooh, we love you, B. Blak

[Baby Blak]
I know, I know
I got so many ladies I can't help but say
Yo yo, y-yo, y-yo, y-yo, y-yo, y-yo, y-yo, y-yo yo yo

[Female singer]
Ooh, ooh, we love you, B. Blak 
Ooh, ooh, we love you, B. Blak

[Baby Blak]
I got jawns up at the bar with black &amp; tans that wanna fuck
Got chickens from the Northeast out to Man-i-yunk (Yep)
Got chickens out in France come and dance at the club
Get 'em home to get 'em out they pants and fuck
I got jawns in North and South Jersey
That put it in they mouth Herbie
I got a slick chick from New York
She kinda thick and like to puff Newports
Give head lick ass and love to suck on balls
I fuck wit'challs
Not the sick type that suck on Halls
Pussy too deep and you ain't got no walls
Gots Culver City women that be givin' house calls
Santa Monica/Sniffin' 'bout a ounce of the raw
I got bitches that cop trees
Bitches that pop E's
Bowlegged and they knock-kneed
I got bitches that rock weaves
Chickens with rock sleeves
In other words these chickens got sheaves
Huh?

[Chorus]

[Baby Blak]
Ayo
I got this Chicano chick with some big-ass lips
I got this Detroit chick with some big-ass twists
That wanna fuck e'erybody
And my cleavage in Cleveland
Wanna suck everybody/Wanna love everybody
I had chicks with the fake-ass titties and contacts
For the eight-fifty off the contract
For Quake City Slime Blak
For the foot-works and dime sack
Massaging my head and my back/I'm that
The essence of a pimp
Nigga, well, I'm that
Shit, I walks with a limp
Stroll like Sherman Hemsley
Got bitches smokin' sherm with gingy
Ale and Remy/Henny &amp; Coke
And yoke/With they nails up in me
Yeah, I trick on chicks on sale
A penny for your thought/I got a dime
Ten-piece/Let 'em shine 
Kiss me on my cheek/Say they miss me for a week
'Cause I was out in Cali with this big-butt freak
Like Scott told Kris when they was B.D.P
Niggas got me changing my name to B.B.B
Baby Blak Bonneville/'Cause I need three 
Two-packs of Blacks and W-E-E-D
Tongue-rings/Navel rings
Nipple rings/Belly-chains
Pussy rings/Tattoos
Mad dudes on the brain
Y'all could bust nuts in them guts
(Shit) I want the change
Head-rush off the dust
And I take they Range
Leave 'em stuck
Make 'em fuck off M.D.M.A.
Hoes with holes-in-one like LPGA's
Star 'bout to bruk out
They tellin' me to stay
Eyes rollin'/Shit, I'm like just an EL away

[Chorus]</pre>
