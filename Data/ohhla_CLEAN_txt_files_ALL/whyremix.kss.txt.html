[Intro - Anthony Hamilton]
All that I'm given
It's this pain that I'm living (The Remix, The Remix)
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that

[Styles P]
Why is garbage music selling a lot
Why is the music industry state of mind real far from Hip Hop
Why vote republican if you black
Why build more jails, less schools cause we under attack
Why I keep the fo' pound in the air
The revolution will not be televised if around here
Why keep my right fist in the sky
I let them know that "We Gonna Make It," don't plan our demise
Why you gotta teach your kids on your own
Cuz when you get in the zone, they bringing you in, you both getting cloned
Why we still gotta pray to Allah
It's Hip Hop, this the New World Order and they playin us hard
Why rappers getting protection
Why the country ain't flipped when they jerked the votes the last election
Why die for all my beliefs
I gotta look at my kids I rather smile then cry when he's sleep
That's why

[Chorus - Anthony Hamilton]
Why
Why they got me strugglin, why
All the brothas caught behind bars
Drained up in the system going crazy
I'm battling my pistol going why

[Common]
Why do they say I changed for a girl
Why you worried bout my clothes if my flow gonna change the world
Why you wait till you 30 then try to be hard
Why I gotta have religion if I believe in God
Why is Bush acting like he trying to get Osama
Why don't we impeach him and elect Obama
Why ain't Rick James remembered for classic hits
Why do we remember Rick for smackin a bitch
Why did Ricky Williams retire, they mad at Miami
Why did Justin sell Janet out and go to the Grammy's
Why you kill on every song, why you frown at discriminance
So many thrones, why we argue who is the King
Why it's over for gangsta, why it's over for bling
Why they hype Britney up, they know she can't sing
Why a whip and a chain the black american dream
Why I know it in my heart it remains unseen
Why

[Chorus}

[Nas]
Registered voter not blood of a panther
Why is the question what is the answer
Got a suggestion, here's an example
Won't we build our own airline, states, and highways
Fly to Africa, do some trades with Zimbabwe
Why did Malcolm's mission die with the man
Why we ain't pick it up where he left it and carry out his plan
Why the merger try to exclude L.A. Reid
He brought you Usher, Outkast top-selling CD's
Why do half America got AIDS
Why do schools care about your son's braids more than they care for his grades
Why they hate our white t-shirts and hats turned backwards
And why is Jesus Christ never played by black actors
And why there ain't a MC that can touch me nor budge me
And why is Nas the best thing in rap since Chuck D
And why this record ain't sell 5 mill yet
Jada's as real as it get
Put my money where my mouth is
And do something bout this

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yo by thugs I'm surrounded
Tell me why is it the money motivates me but the love keeps me grounded
Why my cases ain't get thrown out
Why team USA keep getting blown out
Why the Democratic part ain't getting with me
Why they still hanging black bodies in Mississippi
Yea, why did governor McGrevey get caught with a lizard
Why they take away Shyne's phone calls and visits
Why I been hot for 7 years
Why the new M5 come with 7 gears
Please tell me why y'all keep making that trash
Why they reinstating the draft, why is it so much hating you have
And why sell records and keep working
Why we go on stage with the bread with the feet working
It's real, why when I loved on die you miss them
Why it took for me to make "Why" for y'all to listen

[Chorus]</pre>
