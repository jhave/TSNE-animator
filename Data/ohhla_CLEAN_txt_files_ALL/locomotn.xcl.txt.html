All aboard! Chuchuga chuga
All aboard! Chuchuga chuga

All aboard, freedom train progress
All aboard as we pierce the darkness
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check
We on track for our freedom, 
Full steam we push the needles like that
Locomotion through the microphone cord
Moving pen has might over the sword
Freedom train we bust down the doors
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad
Motivate

And the tone pioneer on the loose
I used to shovel the coal now I lamp in the cabooze.
Like the golden goose I give life that makes cream
When I squat on the track we unique soldierly
Like I be the answer to what it all means
Don't quit your day job if you bet against the team
So lean your whack ass back
Cause ain't too many in the world throw a dart like Smooth Black

Demolition man the trailblazer
Leaving the future in the hands of enlightened consumers
My style be bendin mikes like the kamasutra
Full space and full time, diplomatic reducer
I'm boosting up the standards of the conscious myth

Don't be coming with info when you're lacking in the ???
We be deep in the underground, world we'll spin
All aboard, freedom train, everyone all in.

All aboard, freedom train progress
All aboard as we pierce the darkness
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check
We on track for our freedom, 
Full steam we push the needles like that
Locomotion through the microphone cord
Moving pen has might over the sword
Freedom train we bust down the doors
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad
Motivate

We on a mission to seek truth
Driven by the visions where we livin we acquire the sweet tooth
Trapped on tracks through the valley of death
With a fitted thinking cap like I'm Mitchellin Ness
Drop jewels and acknowledge the icons abolished
In the school of hard knocks and didn't make it to college
We go to war for the innocent victims
Reverse the theory
And run a train on the system
We ain't going for it
Freedom fighters unite
For the new Blackwatch
I'm supplying the sight
Use mind over matter,
The grind over chatter
Return to Mecca before you climb on the ladder
Pay homage and respect to the master molders
And we carry the torch for the hip hop culture
Spark with a million pens
March with a million men
It's the freedom train, everybody all in

All aboard, freedom train progress
All aboard as we pierce the darkness
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check
We on track for our freedom, 
Full steam we push the needles like that
Locomotion through the microphone cord
Moving pen has might over the sword
Freedom train we bust down the doors
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad
Motivate

I'm the conductor Daddy X
The instructor Brother J put my skills to the test
Bless the track with some of hip hops best
So I'm marinated, let my soul do the rest
And I'm microphone check, yes I'm microphone check
Yes I dropped out of school in search of independent music
Hip hop, punk rock, learn how to fuse it
Rebel music comes in many shapes and sizes
You know it's real when it bubbles up and rises
I'm self made, that means I'm self empowered
A visionary with years of stay power
I don't cower in a sticky situation
I hold firm ?? fold my occupation
Redefine the meaning of an artist ?? label
We all potters eating from the same table
Sub noise, got the greatest of all time
Cause Brother J is like I'm leading this crime
Respect to the Clan for letting Daddy X shine
Seeing god in all, recognizing mind
Revolution sands, we handcraft the design
To unify cultures, liberate your mind
We build our foundation one track at a time
Underground soldiers march down the line
Attention!

All aboard, freedom train progress
All aboard as we pierce the darkness
Bonafide soldiers build through mic check
We on track for our freedom, 
Full steam we push the needles like that
Locomotion through the microphone cord
Moving pen has might over the sword
Freedom train we bust down the doors
Every race, color, creed that bangs hip hop abroad
