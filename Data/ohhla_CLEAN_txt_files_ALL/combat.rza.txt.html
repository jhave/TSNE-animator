[sample]
The legendary number one headband
It's promise is power, omnipotence
Immortality, but at what cost?
One that is greater than any man can imagine
And heavier than any man can bare
No soul who has ever wore it's tattered grace
Has ever escaped the torment of it's infinite burden
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

[Intro: P. Dot w/ RZA laughing]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (Afro!)

[Chorus 2X: P. Dot (RZA)]
So many times I had sneak up on them quicker
With my finger on the trigger, like
Like I'm pulling out my sword
This is combat, man, this is war (Afro!)

[RZA]
Brain stained with the harbor, sword stained with the blood of martyrs
Revenge is a never ending story, Afro's the author
Trying to bother, the bare site of my father
So I'm living today, like there's tomorrow
Sword, inside my sheet, my heart is filled with beef
For all the dead souls, that I chopped into piece
Return, of the Afro sheen, fatal mean guillotine
Sword in my hand, I want the number one headband

[P. Dot]
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay

[Chorus 2X w/o RZA]

[Outro: P. Dot]
Ay, ay, ay</pre>
