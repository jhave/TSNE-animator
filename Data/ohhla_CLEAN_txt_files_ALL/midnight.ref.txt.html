[Estelle]
When I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I said it's on

I'm gonna call my baby, tell him that I'm coming
See I been gone for way too long, he needs some loving
See last night on the phone, he told me that he missed me (told me that he missed me)
and I listened to his song, it sounded kinda sexy

[Talib Kweli]
Check it out, I said, um, I said
My baby on her job, I know she's working hard
She independent and I love it yo, that's word to God
But when she get up, I know she ain't really got no fear
No I don't make it rain, but still I'm the one that got her wet
I need it all at once, I been on tour for months
Her body like a stage, as soon as I hit, I tore it up
She love how I perform, cause I get her hyped like her favorite song
We "Riders of the Storm", "Touch Me" baby like The Doors

[Chorus: Estelle]
Oooh, said I just can't wait
till the nighttime comes and I see my baby
Oooh, said I just can't wait
till the midnight hour when I see my
I'll be home tonight
I'll be by his side
Listen!

[Talib Kweli]
Can't wait till the night begin, can't wait to let her in
Ready to handle this, the candle's lit, the lights is dim
So dark the inner vision, and she might lose her and inhibitions
Hourglass figure make it last past ten, four hours last long, no intermission
I'll come every once in a while just to let her know her love in town
I'm here to stay so clear the way, I know she love the sound of that
I'll make her love come down to earth, that's worth another round
Can't take another clown, in love with the kid cause he underground

[Chorus]

[Estelle]
Somebody call my baby, say I'm on the way now (say I'm on my way)
See I been going crazy thinking bout you late night (thinking bout you late night)
The way my heart reacts, it lets me know I need him
See I been getting flashbacks, I just gotta see him (I just gotta see him)

[Talib Kweli]
Let me tell you what she did
Hopped out the taxicab, she almost didn't pay
Here let me get your bags, I got some things to say
I know you miss me girl, you know I miss you too
We kissing, taking turns, let's go to the room

[Chorus]

[Estelle]
When I get home, unplug the phone
Turn out the lights, I said it's on

[Talib Kweli]
He said when you get home, unplug the phone
The lights is off, you know it's on, know it's on

[Estelle]
Oooh, glad I made it home
Baby lock that door and be ready for me
Oooh, but it's been some months
and we don't have long but I'm here now
I made it home tonight
I'll be by his side
Don't worry bout the time
I made it home tonight
Listen, uh</pre>
