Yeah
Come on
Take a little trip with the Frost
We about to go lowridin

(A lowrider)

[ VERSE 1: Kid Frost ]
Oh yeah, another night on the boulevard
Cruisin hard, and everybody's lowridin
Take a little trip with the Frost
And you know what, man?
Everything is gonna be alright
Yeah, bumper to bumper's all eyes on me
Rollin a Chico G '63
Convertable rag-top, and the rag-top's down
On the killer Daytons with the big boom sound
Lift it front to back, pancake from the bottom up
And when we rollin on 3-0, vato, what's up?
Here comes the homeboys cruisin down the loma
Hittin the switches in a 39 bomba
Ha-ha-ha

(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip and see)		--&gt; War

Yeah, lowridin

All my homies roll lowriders
Hey
A lowrider is a little flier
Hey

Aiyo ALT, man
What you doin on the boulevard, loco?

[ VERSE 2: ALT ]
Cruisin, the bass escapes from the window
I'm rollin real slow and low, it's Sunday, I gotta go
Yo, you can hear the bass of the rap jams' old breaks
A fly-ass Impalla thump, paint got the gold flakes
Kickin back, and yo, I'm soarin like an eagle
Frost in a jeep, and Ralph M's in a Regal
We're lookin at the fine ladies bumpin the fresh tapes
Seein the sparks from my car when the frame scrapes
Girls from blocks and blocks, they come in flocks and flocks
Ready to box, cause my '64 rocks
We call it a caravan, and yes y'all, we're rollin hard
A single file line - on the boulevard

(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip)
(Take a little trip and see)		--&gt; War

All my homies roll lowriders
Hey
A lowrider is a little flier
Hey

Aiyo Mellow, man
What's that you're bumpin in your ride, man?
What's that you're bumpin in your ride, homes?
(Ain't got... baby)

[ VERSE 3: Mellow Man Ace ]
I been chasin hotties as a hobby
Mellow's on the bully and I'm out here gettin irie
Oh baby, that's the things that I be doin
I think I like to do it more than I like screwin
So get me in your car, honey, I wanna cruise it
I got a jimmy hat in my pocket, I wanna use it
So take me through the canyon of love, I wanna getcha
Yo baby, it don't matter if I just metcha
Just say yeah, cause you got the Jim hard
But that's the price I pay for bein on the boulevard
Honeys out here teasin, some be out here pleasin
But some just rub the Jimbrowski for easin
On the boulevard
Yeah
Up on the boulevard
You knoww what I'm sayin
When you're out there cruisin
Girlies wanna be usin
Jimbrowkisssssss....

All my homies roll lowriders
A lowrider is a little flier

And you know it's fly, ha-ha-ha</pre>
