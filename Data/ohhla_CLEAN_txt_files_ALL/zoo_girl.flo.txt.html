I got the girl that I need, but you're the girl that I want
I want the girl that do everything, but I got the girl that don't
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (Ahhh) Cause your on Zoosk girl (Ahhh)
And I can have ya screamin', (oooOOOOoooOOH)

Hey Lil' Pinky, Thumbin' up "Good"
I'm feelin' myself like we do in the, Look
Miss Thing, You visiting, Signaling, Spotlight, They all come for this hook
That body language, I Understand it, want us to be on, this Good
You keep on dropin' it, I'll keep you up
Guilty, my wallet baby I got Ups
How you get down, It's like a Flo Party, Doin' this all over like Tevo
I get around, I know you're down, So what are you Virgo or Vegro?
Feelin' your flames, I know you're a fire, I can't get rid of this ego
Screen shorty, you done made me a believer, I'm so addicted to you... When I see you..

I got the girl that I need, but you're the girl that I want
I want the girl that do everything, but I got the girl that don't
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (Ahhh) Cause your on Zoosk girl (Ahhh)
And I can have ya screamin', (oooOOOOoooOOH)
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
(oooOOOOoooOOH)

(Hey, Hey) No wasting my time, She gotta be Zoosk, Walkin' it, Talkin' it, know she the truth
All the way down with a freak attitude, Whether you're loose when she walk in the room
Swingin' them hips like you ain't got a groove, Hell of a giver, she sweet as perfume
Fully equipt with that body in tune, Lil' mama is drippin', she hotter than June
I gotta have her no way can I rest
Make her my diva, want only the best
Babies no teaser, I look to impress
Good Ladies they help me get rid of my stress
No top for close, No bottom the dress, Only one goal, that's showing her flesh
Shortys the fly'est chick in the nest, She gotta be Zooskin', nothing less..

I got the girl that I need, but you're the girl that I want
I want the girl that do everything, but I got the girl that don't
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (Ahhh) Cause your on Zoosk girl (Ahhh)
And I can have ya screamin', (oooOOOOoooOOH)
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
(oooOOOOoooOOH)

From the A.M to the P.M, From the night until the morning
I get up and I come up anytime she calls me
Because I give in to my lady anyway she want it
Licky Up and Licky down, Now let's, let's get it started

From the A.M to the P.M, From the night until the morning
I get up and I come up anytime he calls me
Because I give in to my baby anyway he wants it
Lick Me Up and Lick Me down, Now let's, let's get it started

I got the girl that I need, but you're the girl that I want
I want the girl that do everything, but I got the girl that don't
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (Ahhh) Cause your on Zoosk girl (Ahhh)
And I can have ya screamin', (oooOOOOoooOOH)
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
So I can get you, you, and you girl, (oooOOOOoooOOH), Cause you're a Zoosk, Zoosk, Zoosker
(oooOOOOoooOOH)</pre>
