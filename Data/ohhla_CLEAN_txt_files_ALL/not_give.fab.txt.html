I'm here to shake up the world
What what what what what
What what what what what
Right, right - ghetto

I'm something like a phenomenon
But still dumpin whenever the dramas on
Ya'll hustlas can't eat fit meals and it feels
Something like when it's Ramadan
Hope you chumps been walkin wit armor on
I'm who they dumpin two colahamels{?} on
Oh somethings turning his mama on
I love to see rumps in Farragama thongs
Bet it look dope when you got pajamas on
Jump in, lets hit the Bahamas ma
And it's crunk whenever I'm on a song, bumpin like bump bu-bump
I'm particulary picky
When it come to licky licky
Have em slidin off them vickies quickly (o.k.)
Under the du-rag thick 360
It's the hypno and sticky icky (I said o.k.)

[Chorus]
Fly enough to do better but pimp enough to not give a fuck
Dumb enough to do better and gangsta enough to not give a fuck
Im hustlin enough to know better but ballin enough to not give a fuck
Im old enough to know better but young enough to not give a fuck

Dud-duh-duh-duh-dammit man
I'm in a throwback so old it'll grandma glance
And everybody know
everybody go, so please call a stretch ambulance
these dudes don't stand a chance
when I pull up like the pamper brand
those under lambo slants?
wit a mad dam from france
wit a ass so big you couldn't hide it in hammer pants
who else be in new york wit Miami tans
got everybody doin the street family dance
I'm sure this hammer can, make you save that gangsta role for the camera man
this is f-a-b you prefably don't wanna "f" wit me
(please believe it)
I'm definantly as responsible for gettin the city high, clef would be
(believe it please)

[Chorus]

I'm introduced to yo women friends (hello)
Cuz I buy double deuces to rent a benz (ooh)
Like them bootz made by timberland
Not half them were mine, since I got drafted and signed
Ya'll players get used to the scrimmagin
Not one of them jesus' got lemon gems?
You knowYa'll lips gonna get loose like ya feminine
I prove lettin with the semi can
Boost my adrenaline
You'll never have use with that hand again
Half of my roots is Dominican (faboloso)
Me gusta le bejamins
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him
I'm turning stones like medusa had glimpse of them
But right now you can lie and gossip to
And later on be the guy who the mobs? look to
And right now you can try and prosecute
But later on you gon die in the hospital

[Chorus]</pre>
