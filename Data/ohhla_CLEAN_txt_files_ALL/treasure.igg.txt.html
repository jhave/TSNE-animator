Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Cutest hoes in my southern flow
Looks so good and I'm flying here
Soaring high like a eagle hoe
Baddest bitch in my hemisphere
Drugs the camp and I'll let you know
Saved every song so you can hear
I'm the leader of my circle I'm the head of my peers
I'm the leader of the ladies let's get this clear
That's how we rock
10 million sold when I drop
10 million flows, think she hot
10 million hoes in my drop
10 million pounds watch my clock
10 million years at the top
My time will start today nicki paved the way
Came to far to leave now I can't stop uh

[Chorus]
Get your styrofoam cups raise em high
Let em know it's team iggy bitch till you die
Gets your tats, get your shirts let the world see
who running this let em know you belong to me
La la lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
you you can't mess with my team I got vacants on my chain
I I I I live the dream I got vacants on my chain
[x2]
Wa wa wa walk with the queen I got vacants on my chain
La la lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
you you can't mess with my team I got vacants on my chain

Drop top that mercedes man
Peez weed gets crazy
Drop thousands on my baby
I been living as of lately
At the palms I drop 180
And my ghost a do 180
Heres 180 heres 180
They shut em down computer baby
Cause I'm tryna get paid
Hey neil I swear they can't fade
Hey george we got it all made
Hey shouts to all my gays
Hey shout to all my bitches and all my fans that's just misunderstood
I work for y'all they can't hate us yo it's all good

Gets your tats, get your shirts let the world see
who running this let em know you belong to me
La la lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
you you can't mess with my dream I got vacants on my chain
I I I I live the dream I got vacants on my chain
wa wa wa walk with the queen I got vacants on my chain
La la lock ups make em lean I got vacants on my chain
you you can't mess with my dream I got vacants on my chain</pre>
