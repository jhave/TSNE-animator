[Chorus]
I've found a place to live
I got it the hard way
Of living in the chance, to give
I got it the long way

Nobody here can tear me loose
They tell me there's no escape on Heartache Avenue

(Yo, Eskis, Boi)
I'm living at 22 Heartache Avenue
Come and see me tonight I got something for you
I've been hurt so I don't wanna commit to you
You're hesitating
What's that, a no or a yes, stop gazing
Come to my palace, its amazing
Once you come you won't wanna leave
You can stay
You can start by having a chat and then a glass of brandy
Then I will start playing mind games
I know about girls when I play mind games
She's playing hard to get
That's one of my games, I'm good at it
My brain is shaped on mind games since I'm 19, 0 1 7 9 days
Its 0 4 R 6, ride by days now fast lane days are here
I like this
My heart is broken but my mind is moving
Got my music career I'm movin'
Alright

[Chorus]
I've found a place to live
I got it the hard way
Of living in the chance, to give
I got it the long way

Nobody here can tear me loose
They tell me there's no escape on Heartache Avenue

[Listen]
You got some funny ways about you
Can't live with you, I can't live without you
Love me too but I'm doubting you do the same way 'cause I'm crazy about you
It's as if you don't care
Blowing hot and cold air
We talk but you don't ever sound there
Tell you how I feel but you don't ever wanna hear
I'm getting mixed messages, funny text messages
Could have left it, should have left it
I'm feeling sharp pains in my left tit
Goes to show that I'm a skill for you more than a bit
And give and take I know we both do shit.
I don't want a piece
I want the whole of the cake
Just think about what a great couple we make
My mind's made up
Mind you, I know that I'm on the Heartache Avenue waiting for my heart to break.

[Chorus]
I've found a place to live
I got it the hard way
Of living in the chance, to give
I got it the long way

Nobody here can tear me loose
They tell me there's no escape on Heartache Avenue

[Raisin]
Don't get it you see
These days I wear my heart on my sleeve
I just wanna be free and do the birds and the bees with whoever I please
You wanna meet me at the yard?
I'll be there in a minute
If you're willing to give me something that I wanna get
I don't care for a second
We can go upstairs, you do my pairs
You pop... like weapons
No one's looking to settle down yet
I left my heart on my jacket downstairs in my crib
I guess right here I'm ruthless
I'm shooting Cupid now
This heart, it's you it's about, I am drawing it down
I'm pulling down skirts and I'm down low
Wanna get down with some girls that don't like my attitude now
I turn my back to 'em
I ain't chattin' to 'em
If you wanna talk to me meet me at the avenue

[Chorus]
I've found a place to live
I got it the hard way
Of living in the chance, to give
I got it the long way

Nobody here can tear me loose
They tell me there's no escape on Heartache Avenue</pre>
