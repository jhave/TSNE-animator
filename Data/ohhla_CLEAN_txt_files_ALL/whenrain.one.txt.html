[Chorus]
When you hear the rain fallin
Callin your name
Whether broke or you're rich
In a ditch or the same
So watch who you fuck wit
Or who you might talk to
You never know 
When your words might come and huant you
[2x]

[Mr. Lil One]
It started back on Halloween 1984
When I was just a little mothafucka up in your door
Walkin through your hoods 
Like I woke up in the woods
With my mask and my horns
Ready to take you for your goods
Sympothetical never could of been
Cause the level I was in was full of hatered
Never kept me sacred
Thinkin how you wish 
While you're sleepin wit the fish
Life's a bitch homie
There's the real and there's the phony
They go through many changes
Go through many stages
Still remain raw when the law put me in cages
Many faces livin by the sword
They try to plead their cases
Cause they say they found the lord
Jesus, I got so many reasons
Fools tryin to read ya, full of amnesia
Fakin all the funk wit the Bible in thier palms
But these bitch made punks all belong up in a trunk
Full of rigomortis, show em where my sword is
Tell me if you feel me
Other wise kill me
Take me from this Earth
Since the first day of birth
I felt that I was cursed
It's time to ride a hearse

[Chorus]</pre>
