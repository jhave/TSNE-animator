Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Bass
Who the one from the pine, whaddup yall?
I'm the one from the grind, How low yall
Low below the Dixie line, fuck with me,
I'll show ya how to pull the quarter pound off the rippy, off the rippy
I'm catfish bitch
I am back in this
These steak knife (who?) pump action
Nadda nothin buddy don't even try to bother (holler) him
I told you I'm catfish, I'm quick to swaller (swaller) him
Young gangsters bustin wanna act bad (bad)
Worse than gun shells like Bush in Baghdad
My bazooka got the chopper in Zone
Bake Chili muffins like a motherfuckin hoe
Glass breakin I have your mother duckin low
Back down haha now that's a motherfuckin joke
Southern boys got hot butter for your soul
Cracker barrel bullet dynamite so lets go

[Chorus]
My rattlin trunk, got them bobble heads lookin
Rear view mirrors got the world sittin crooked
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
These twelve inch speakers, these six inch tweaters
I'm playin those haters
I got that gator
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin

Give me the keywood, these kicks are tempting
I'm blowin this shit up like bottles of Jim Beam
Knockers drop me, models are modeling
I can't get a seat so make me start wobbling
You want it bad well then I give you my pickle
I took off the chain now I can't pedal my bicycle
Ain't got no pedro, still get it crunk though
Leavin my tire marks and hip hop centerfolds
Oh!
I know that amplifiers heated up
Oh!
I know the DJ wanna speed it up
My shits snappin, it ain't snap music
But you can lean back and throw it up, come on
These Alabama boys connect with Atlanta boys
Raised up by gun lovers who load up bananas boy
Drivin them jettys and throwin Ds on them cadillacs
Speakers and tweeters beatin my whip got that battle back

[Chorus]
My rattlin trunk, got them bobble heads lookin
Rear view mirrors got the world sittin crooked
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
These twelve inch speakers, these six inch tweaters
I'm playin those haters
I got that gator
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin

Yeah I'm Southern
I'm crazy, I'm drivin, Chevy's daily
Hollar at g, burnin tires(Burnin tires),
I'm trashy (I'm trashy), on fire
Yeah
I'll stick em good, I'll show em up
I'll show em hood, I don't give a fuck
I'm from the trailer park
I help king
I don't get any part
So I just better leave
Daling daling dalinga ring ring
Cellular blowing up they wanna dinga ling
I'm a limousine
The pimple of the leading team
We number one of all 7 of dicks of my f-family

[Chorus]
My rattlin trunk, got them bobble heads lookin
Rear view mirrors got the world sittin crooked
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
These twelve inch speakers, these six inch tweaters
I'm playin those haters
I got that gator
I am kick kickin kick kick kick kickin
Kick kickin kick kick kick kickin</pre>
