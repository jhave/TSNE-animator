This is station KMLN
And we're sitting here with rap star Master P
Leader of The Real Untouchables
Master P, where are you from?

[Master P]
The ghetto

[Sonya C]
Now that you are living in Beverly Hills
Has anything changed?

[Master P]
Well...not really

[Sonya C]
Master P, would you like to say anything to the people
Who think that you couldn't make it?

[Master P]
Yeah, fuck em'

[Sonya C]
So Master P, what's life to you?

[Master P]
Life to me ain't nothing but bitches and money

[Master P and DJ scratching]
Life..life...life...life
Life...ain't...nothing...but...b-bitch...bitches and money

[Hook]
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money (Bitches and money)
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money (Bitches and money)

[Verse 1]
It all started way back in the day
When this bitch named Brenda used to give a nigga hay
So just listen to the words I say
And if you a man you've experienced foul play
You know the hoes, the ones that act funny
That don't say shit till ya whip out some money
Then a bitch start jockin'
Next thing ya know ya at the hotel rockin'
I can't have a bitch cause we didn't have no money you was a trip
So you makin' that mail, it's kind of risky
You thinkin' fuck she thinkin' rags to the riches
So this the shit you gotta beat
Meet a freak before ya fall for another man's freal
But if ya laugh, ain't a damn thing funny
Cause ya like P, life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the K-I-N-G, don't avenge me
Don't think cause I'm stingy
I want cash, I don't flash
Ask my bitch, fuck the dash
Rollin' in the street in a fresh ass Rolls
Checkin' out the bitches and the funky hoes
Ooh who is this behind the tinted glass
A bitch named Gina wanna give me some ass
Well next week call the honey
Cause life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My Vette, clean as shit
I see some hoes lookin' they wanna ride in it
Bitches think a nigga can tap for some ass
Open like a fuckin' convertible runs off of gas
So open on up and start pumpin'
Cause that don't be workin' hoes get something for nothin'
Man life ain't nothin' but bitches and money

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I love money...and bitches too
The ones as sweet as honey
But when she fucks up, she's gotta go
Don't let her stay but the cash flow
I could give a damn about a stupid ho
Bitch ya can't make me rich this I know
This is behind me
I need big dollars and fuckin' thick bitch behind me
And I'ma get them to thinkin' hope
But I ain't fuckin' with em' if they broke
Cause money attracts money
And when ya ain't got none all ya days are funny
Just like my boys said
When ya got a pocket full of money
Everything is funny
Ain't that the truth Ruth
With a pocket full of dough fuck a bitch, hella fun
And afterwards she will cease
All I care about is bitches and money

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
I think it's all types of games bein' played
But to a bitch these days the looks ain't shit
Unless these niggas pay
Look here bro' ya gotta suffer
Cause a motherfucker with trues and Vogues got all the hoes
Don't even cuss, she think a nigga is hustle
The more ya make the more she take
Bring her to dinner think of desert
Come up with an empty plate
This to them young hoes
There's money, meals, and haves
This another way ya feel up Mike and Thomas and rock Ruth
So don't take it personal hoes just keep runnin'
And to the fellas out there, you know how it goes
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money</pre>
