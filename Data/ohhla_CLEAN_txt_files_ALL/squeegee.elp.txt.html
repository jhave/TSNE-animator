Yo, 1985 got red top live and it was
Ten to the decibel, my lifelong prize, so I was
Part of the pack, pardon that, that's fact
I stole, part of a track and started to rap (map the growth)

Try to explain, okay, the Koch era frame
Hardly a game, no marketing just art in the train
Station Exchange, the flickered lights start to change
Same in the brain when I watched the walls spark names
Parked in the car with pa dukes at four deuce
There was a, Double rumble study kung fu loop
But we had, at the car wash that cost less cash, a blast
I'd imagine that the water was rising fast
Quarter in hand at the light for the squeegee man
Adult life squeegee man shot, cops hand
That's a lot of bad conversion, that's certain
Homeless hustle lost to the dark of the blue curtain
And it was fourth grade, I got high top played
Sported the black and red Jordan bootleg craze
And when the big kids zeroed in I'd wince
I haven't let my mother buy me bootleg since
(cuz' it was)

1985 got red top live and it was
ten to the decibel, my lifelong pride, so I was
part of the pack, pardon that, that's fact
I stole, part of a track and started to rap (map the growth)

1985 got red top live and it was
ten to the decibel, my lifelong pride, so I was
part of the pack, pardon that, that's fact
I stole, part of a track and started to rap (map the growth)

Get live y'all (live y'all) live y'all (live y'all)
live y'all (live y'all) live y'all (to the NYC)
Get live y'all (live y'all) live y'all (live y'all)
live y'all (live y'all) live y'all (live live live)
Get five ya'll (five y'all) five ya'll (five y'all)
five ya'll (five ya'll, to the Krazy Kings)
Get five ya'll (five y'all) five ya'll (five y'all)
five ya'll (five y'all) five five five

Trace back, trace the faces with the same life song
Different borough, same place, Eddie Murph got Raw
After class, got harassed, bully hurt us all
He tried to, run my Nintendo game in Fulton Mall
A fighter, that's what you made, now I fight for fun
I fight for acme lab rat experiment son
Pulsate like a Theremin rigged to big drums
Seen, Halloween battles in Brooklyn, eggs and shaving cream
We're gonna spray it on your whole damn team and then
Make the dash laughing bout the whole damn thing
We won, we can laugh about that, cause that's fun
In the 80's Deceps took fame (good run)
I took a name too, and so it begun
And wrote raps in my room, sipping Capri suns
In fact, studied the cadences of Kool Moe Dee and Rick
Put my name into their rhymes and then practiced it
Put my brain pattern on fly and I mastered it
Dad played jazz when he drank, it's no accident
Hands on the piano and make my foot tap to it
Different path, same love, Dad, thanks for passing it
