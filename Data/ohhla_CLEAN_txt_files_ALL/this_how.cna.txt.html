Song:   This is How We Roll
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Wheels is shinin.. deals we signin.. money's pilin..
Low, this is how we roll

[John Cena]
Catch me in the black 'llac truck with the pickup back
The game weak, I'ma pick up slack
Hands high like a stick-up jack, fuck your boring rap
This East to West coast hittin like Warren Sapp
I'm fully focused, I walk with a purpose
Y'all are fuckin clowns, you belong in a circus
This is big bid'ness, we don't stop 'til the money home
Block shakin more buzz than a honeycomb
And I'm a savage in the booth
I'm on some movement shit, about to rally up the youth
Number one seed daddy walkin through the playoffs
You better quit rappin 'fore I start makin layoffs
Fuck a day off, I'm movin heavy for the payoff
You don't ride to this?  We don't need you, stay off
Hate on this?  I don't care what you said
Y'all can choke on a shit sandwich with no bread

[Chorus]

[Tha Trademarc]
I don't smile as such, buddy, ain't much funny
You touchy girlie rappers claimin that you fuckin gully
I live poor but look rich, I hit raw, you look bitch
You love me, that's why you got your style from me
Most sayin Marc Predka's overconfident
It's only cause they jeally that my profile is prominent
The dominant factor is the money I'm after
Your opinion ain't mean shit buddy - I ain't ask ya
It's gon' be what it's gon' be
It is what it is and was what it was so watch ya wordplay
Trademarc lay you where the buzzards and birds play
I write rhymes 'til ya boy is heard mayne
Cause alls I got, is my voice and word
Sophisticated rapper the dapper lover the don
It's on baby pah yeah word is bond
Cut the check and I'll rock, every word of the song - what now?

[Chorus]

[John Cena]
Yeah, yeah... yeah
I got that velcro flow, I'll make you stick to this
So many zeroes, my monetary is ridiculous
A glass of Chardonnay doesn't whine like you
I'm an Altered Beast with Einstein's IQ
Plus I shine bright too and I ride right through
In a leaned out, old school, skylight blue
I don't think there's a player nice
Keep your Cristal, I'm shoot Jagermeister
Foot to the floor and you ain't you keep the pace
Throw me a whore and call me Kobe cause you know that I'ma beat the case
I buy some land, and never even see the place
Vegeterian chicks, go on givin meat a taste
Throw away money like I hate on loot
Copped your CD it sounds great on mute
Words turn 'em to dust makin MC's disintergrate
My name get traffic like the California interstate, what?

[Chorus]</pre>
