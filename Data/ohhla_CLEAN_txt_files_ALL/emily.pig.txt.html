I met you at the age of 21
Lookin so fine like a young ripe plum
I was the gardener, you were the nun
I was maverick, you were the girl on top gun
I pursued you with young freshman eyes
Stomach too small for what the eyes realized
Thought I can handle it, I took you by the hand
And I asked you to marry me, I knelt on the sand
You said yes, never a second guess
Wait a few years to have babies was the plan
Made my dream's hope, got a 8 to 4
Workin' as a stock clerk at Nabisco
But I loved you, I put you first above all
Raised you high, so that you would never fall
We got more close sexually, daily, slipped up
And got you pregnant with a baby
Upset your parents, didn't tell mine
I told you it would be okay in time

I looked in your eyes, pretend to grin
Said that I love you and your my best friend
Told you to trust me until the end
'Til death do us part, that was the start
But I'm leaving, (I told you I would never lie)
I'm sorry but I'm leaving, (But I'm not that type of guy)
I'm sorry my dear...

I had to have a meeting with your dad
I was very nervous, he was very sad
You were going joggin, I was very glad
I knew what I did and I knew what I had
It was your attention, I had time to stall
I told him I'd get a second job at the mall
He said okay but filled with disbelief
I said good-bye, filled with relief
Cuz I knew I didn't want to, knew I didn't plan this
Knew I had to give all of my goals just to stand this
And that really sucked, I was so young
All I ever wanted was to rap and have fun
Now I had to work, then I really thought about it
Did I really have to? Or would he have thought about it?
I thought I had to do it for myself
It was my life, it belonged to no one else
So I planned to leave a thief in the night
Disappear with a trace, let them know I felt like

I looked in your eyes, pretend to grin
Said that I love you and your my best friend
Told you to trust me until the end
'Til death do us part, that was the start
But I'm leaving, (I told you I would never lie)
I'm sorry but I'm leaving, (But I'm not that type of guy)
I'm sorry my dear...

Four years past, I'm still spending my wills
Still making demos, looking for a record deal
You found my act, was bumped into my friend
Sent me a letter told me silence had to end
You had a daughter, named her Emily
And everytime she looked at you felt like me
She was asking questions, "Where is my dad?
And what did he do mommy to make you so mad?"
You said I had to come and finally meet my girl
I said that I would if, only I could
Showed up at the door it was answered by her
I knew by her eyes that I was her father
I knelt to your level, said, "Who are you?"
You said, "Emily", I said, "How cute"
I walked you in, holding your hand
You showed me your bedroom, I took us slow and
You said "Daddy, where have you been?
I hope you never ever have to leave again"

I looked in your eyes, pretend to grin
Said that I love you and your my best friend
Told you to trust me until the end
'Til death do us part, that was the start
But I'm leaving
I'm sorry but I'm leaving
I'm sorry my dear...</pre>
