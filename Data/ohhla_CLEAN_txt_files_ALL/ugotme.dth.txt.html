[Coo Coo Cal]
You got me fucked up, ha
to whom it may concern
Snitches wit thee intensions to get burned
It's my turn to earn this cake
Any nigga that's outta line, we set em straight
Pull out that (?) fill em wit hoes, and let em bake
Straight pissed-off, ya'll I wanna pull out the Beam today
When my folks, they calm, layin in the lawn, nigga like a green berre'
And uza hoe bitch
To fuck wit the clique I roll wit
And why they call me "Crazy", cuz mutha fucka they can't control this
And I'ma stand on it
Fuck it, I even dance on it
And if it got somethin to do with stratch,
I watch my back and get my hands on it
Ya'll got me all fucked up, ha, from head-to-toe
No! My clique ain't physically fit fo war nigga, but nigga we ready to go
Blows to the dome nigga
Fo's wit the chrome nigga
Hoes wanna run wit a nigga
Toes gotta leave me alone nigga
Figga nigga got fame and now I'm stuck up
Well that shit is false
In the name of the man on the cross
You got me fucked up

Chorus:1x
You got me fucked up (I'm sick of niggaz)
So while you niggaz in the world always twistin shit up, on me
You got me fucked up (I'm sick of bitches)
And while you bitches in the world always twistin shit up, on meee!
You got me fucked up (I'm sick of hoes)
And while you hoes in this world always twistin shit up, on meeeeeee!
You got me fucked up (I'm sick of niggaz)
You got me fucked up thinkin you can all run game, on meee!

[Kela]
Three strikes your out bitch
Don't really think you wanna doubt this
Mistress, thats droppin off to your dome make a nigga all steal this
Don't snitches, that's poppin off at the mouth you know they get dealt wit
Infinite 4-5, it'll show you hoes not to fuck wit this

Runnin this, my clique will stick his bitch, and oh we too cold
Puttin mutha fuckaz up on they back, cuz bitch you thought you was too bold
But fo' sho, we takin on shows

Hoes don't hate, just keep ya mouth closed
May our haters down is what we came here fo
Betta thank twice before you step to dis
One up once and get done wit, squit

Makin niggaz mad cuz we have their shit
Can nobody hold us down
Unexplained a nigga on the clown

Nigga don't clown, 'fo you get beatdown
On the real, in the Mil

Smacked the last thang, I know you got me fucked up

Chorus:1x

[Mr. Do It 2 Death]
I wrote dis'here, what you niggaz know

They gon' play my position, shit, I'm totin' dis here
I got it locked, this here mine ya'll, don't get it confused
Half of these niggaz watchin me flow, wishin they could dance in my shoes
I try to tell em shit, "These ain't your size partna!"
You can mug all night in the club, I don't give a fuck, my guys got cha
You got some (?) like Do It 2 Death up in ya, they beat it up out cha
My album green in the streets
Read the billboard, read it and weap
Niggaz say I'm irigant, hoes say I act like I'm all that
Tell 'em "Ain't shit changed" and
"Who really gives a fuck except my drawback"
Ya'll thought I was leakin, bitch-nigga ya'll caught in a fog
I'm still (?) ya'll walkin a dog
Nigga I can personify the shit I spit, I ain't just flossin at ya'll
One thangs fo' sho, don't let me score I'm caught in a ball
Niggaz say they wanna see me make it,
knowin that they really wanna see me fall
Nigga I'ma cross this line, whether I run, walk or crawl

Chorus:1x
