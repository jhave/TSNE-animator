[Intro]
Yo man.. Hey.. Think about it 
I went so.. I got so far up man 
Nearly I hit this Platoe 
Then I started focusing on partying and shit 
Then started popping those dam percocets
With drinking and fuck my whole shit up

[Mad Child]
It's the dawning of a new era
Tattooed broken tooth and new era 
I ain't where I'm supposed to be its a true terror
I ain't tripping I ain't cripping but I'm blue mirror 
Mirror mirror on the wall do you remember me?
Was the fairest of them all then I dropped the ball 
And I was holding flats sometimes I feel like there's nobody that can hold me back
And sometimes I feel like its a wrap I'm living in a trap
I'm giving all I got but they ain't giving nothing back 
I'm battling depression in my head 
I'm trying but ill prolly be aggressive till I'm dead 
And everybody knows of my addictive personality
I chased my dream but I'm not living in reality
Cards are stacked against me too much time lost
God please help me.. why? cause I'm lost

[Chrous x2]
It's pretty crazy when your dream were so close 
You could touch em now they seem like old ghosts 
Now my memories are haunted hope that they remember me 
And maybe they still want it 

[Mad Child]
Look.. I ain't got alot of time left
Got a team but they don't seem to take no fucking giant steps 
I try to tell em I could use a little help  
That's exactly what they give me gotta do it all myself 
Most rap performers are just transformers  
Pretend to be crazy I pretend to be normal 
When listing to mad they immediately struck  
Then immediately after he realized hes really fucked 
Look.. I don't got no disguise concentrating on my art 
Mentally demented I'm a monster in the dark 
Little monster drinking monster walking in the park  
With my dogs talking awkwardly but obviously sharp 
There asking me to make a club song on dubstep  
It's where the money at but that shit made me upset 
Maybe I am focused on my pride a little to tough 
Or maybe I just love hip-hop a little too much 

[Chrous x2]
It's pretty crazy when your dream were so close

[Mad Child]
Yo.. I got a dark past hoping it'll disappear 
But with the internet they still see it crystal clear 
I need more time walking on the right path  
Cause I've been fighting with myself it's time to fight back 
I've done damaged to my brain I've done damage to my teeth  
All this damage on the surface just imagine underneath 
And life can be a beach with a beach chair  
Damaged goods broken down need to be repaired  
Hard for me to transcribe the pain inside 
Doing drugs 5 years till it drained me dry  
And if I knew back then what I know now  
I would've saved up cash would've slowed down 
Would've spread love would've gave back  
Would've help show kids that theres a right track  
I would've kept writing kept making music 
Kept battle axe kept executive producing  
But now I'm back and I'm still alive  
So I will give it all I got till they feel my vibe 
I'm hoping and I pray they understand me  
Cause if they don't fuck its too late to make a plan B

[Chrous x2]
It's pretty crazy when your dream were so close 
You could touch em now they seem like old ghosts 
Now my memories are haunted hope that they remember me 
And maybe they still want it

[Outro]
Still gotta open window 
I'm gonna do one more big lap 
Before I'm gonna call it a wrap 
I know I still got what it takes
Fuck these little posers

I almost made it to the top.. Then it had to stop</pre>
