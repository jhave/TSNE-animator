[Chorus] [Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate their status
[Eyedea]
Cause before we touch the mic you actually were believin'
That bullshit you do is called MCin'
[Blueprint]
That ain't MCin'!
[Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate their status
[Blueprint]
Cause after we rock the mic you cats will stop believin'
That that bullshit you do should even be called MCin'

[Verse One] [Eyedea]
Ayo peep it
I don't brag and boast for pure recreation
If I say I'll serve a rapper, I'm just givin' you useful information
You already proved that you're fake
Chokin' in a vocal booth, pokin' holes in your swollen throat
Hopelessly redoing your takes
I'll whip that crew into shape
Embarrass you so bad that arrogance you had
Will turn into a voice, tellin' you to move outta state
Wait, let me guess
You're the dopest out of everyone you know
And got the balls to think you can fuck with a pro
I don't think so
You need to re-evaluate what you're doin', Blueprint
And Eye-dea re-define this shit called rhymin' stupid
High and drenched felines, that why I don't make battle music
Cause I don't need to write songs about battlin' bitch
I do it
So tell your camp, if anyone got beef
They can pick a place to meet and I'll greet them with defeat
But, if not
Tell them to keep comin' to the shows
Wavin' their hands, yellin' "Ho" like the fans we all know
Yo

[Chorus] [Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate their status
[Blueprint]
Because before we hit the stage you were actually believin'
What you did prior to this was MCin'
[Eyedea]
That ain't MCin'!
[Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate their status
[Eyedea]
Cause after we rip the mic you kids will stop believin'
That the bullshit you and your boys do on the weekend is MCin'

[Verse Two] [Blueprint]
I got the feelin'
I've already hear your verse
So any turn that you take will only be a turn for the worse
That's the truth and I know it hurts
You're so bad, I'll have the last laugh even when I rhyme first
I hear the frontin'
I hear loud talkin'
I see the posin'
And I hear the dogs barkin'
But listen dog nuts, you ain't a hard target
Cause every bar you rhyme is just a nail in your coffin
Every battle is another chance to see a cat lose to me
I don't write battle raps
I write eulogies
For herbs that got nerve that think they can't be wack
Cause they undefeated in the mirror, battlin' fantasy cats
I rep
Grown band, get man handle rap
You rep open toed sandals and fanny packs
Beat Blueprint or Eyedea?
Can't see that
We'll give you a free ale plus your sanity back
Bitch

[Chorus] [Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate they status
[Eyedea]
Cause before we hit your circle you weakling were believin'
What you did before we got there was MCin'
[Blueprint]
That ain't MCin'!
[Both]
You gotta realize you're fuckin' with the baddest
Make these so called rappers reevaluate they status
[Blueprint]
Cause after we rock the mic you cats will stop believin'
That the bullshit you do should even be called MCin'

[Verse Three] [Eyedea]
So
Have you figured out what the fuck you doin' wrong yet?
[Blueprint]
Cats with no stage presence shouldn't rock a long set
[Eyedea]
If you're comin' to my show, you better have a strong neck
[Blueprint]
Cause heads nod way out of control when we're on deck
[Eyedea]
Man, I couldn't keep myself awake for the five minutes your song stretch
[Blueprint]
They can't move a crowd cause they lack the arm strength
The kinda cats that I'd rather keep at arm's length
Frontin' like they hard when we know that they harmless
[Eyedea]
These MC's
They be the first to get scared
While we kickin' verses, they weep, squeezin' a teddy bear
The Orphanage turned your concept of a rap career
From a pretty day dream into your worse nightmare
[Blueprint]
Ah yes, right there
The feelin' of perfection, quite rare
Fully loaded mic bullies, Blueprint, Eyedea
I can smell victory in the night's air
