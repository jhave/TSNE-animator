...Sound like my mic is right

UGH~!!

I-I am not a human, shout to all my moon men
Yeah they call me Tune', got them bitches tuned in
It's a crazy world, so I stay in mine
and niggaz don't cross the line, niggaz stay in line
like welfare; I'm St. Elsewhere
Hotter than the devil - nigga, hell yeah!
Rock-a-bye baby, homocide baby
That's more tear drops, call me crybaby
whatchu tal'n bout? Tell it to my nine
Cut yo' tongue out, mail it to your moms
I'm a young god, swagger unflawed
Bitch I'm in the building, you in the front yard
Life's a bitch - naw, better yet a dumb broad
and I bet I can fuck the World and make it cum hard
Yeah, you boys is washed up
and I'm shittin on 'em like "Two Girls and One Cup", huh!
Weezy Baby a/k/a bring the money home
Pull out a AK and pop you in ya funny bone
Laugh now, die later motherfucker
Youse a bitch like Zeta Phi Beta, motherfucker, huh!

[Chorus 2X: Lil Wayne]
Yeaaah, I call it how I see ya
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea

[Lil Wayne]
Man I'm so tired of ballin, I sleep a lot now
I'll let my goons rush ya/Russia, like Moscow
Gun at ya eyebrow... -- pow pow!
Man I ball hard, even with five fouls
Yeah we in this bitch, like tampons
Dump ya in the woods, now getcho' camp on
Choke hold around this shit cause I'm so hands-on
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on
Back against the wall and my two feet is what I stand on
Diva in the room, she blowin me just like a band horn
Got her on her knees, the same knees that she be prayin on
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, "YOU CAN JOIN"
Yeah, what y'all wanna do? I'm all ears
Smokin on that head band, call that shit that Paul Pierce
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years
Ball/bald like Solange, India.Arie, Britney Spears

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uh, yeah..
I aaaaaaam, spendin much more than I'm makin 
on these cars and these vacations, is that too much information?
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racing
with a windshield full of tickets 'cause I live right by the station
I am, tryna figure out why you so mad at me?
Yes, I'm with Young Money, tell the magazine stop askin me
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head
and a flag the color red like a fuckin low battery 
{..OKAY} Nigga peep the shit I'm wylin on
I be witcho' baby momma, you be witcho' child at home
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of styrofoam
Big cheese, big bread, call that shit a calzooone
{..OKAY} I will break your fuckin collar bone
Us against the World, better pick which  fuckin side you on
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady puttin mileage on
and we about to kill 'em, C4 Mr. Carter's hoooome~!

[Lil Wayne]
Yeaaah, c-call it how I see ya
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya
We some asshole niggas, c-call us diarrhea
The money keep growin, yep! It's growin like a Chia, ha-ah!
Yeaaah, I call it how I see ya
Y'all some pussy ass niggas, we should call you Gonorrhea
Uh, you keep talkin that shit, I'ma see ya
