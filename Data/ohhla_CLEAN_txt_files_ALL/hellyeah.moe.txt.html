Hell yeah, I'm back...

[Hook - 2x]
(hell yeah) I get money (hell yeah), I get do'
(hell yeah) I wreck the club (hell yeah), I wreck the show
(hell yeah) I wreck shop (hell yeah), tops drop
(hell yeah) body rock (hell yeah), it don't stop

[Big Moe]
Hell yeah Moe thoed, yeah I get do'
Screwed Up Click, Southside still hold
And we won't fold, let the story be told
Put it down for Fat Pat, Screw and Mafio
Hell yeah I'm a G, raised in these streets
You could be the drank man, stacking P-I-N-T's
So if I fall off, and times get hard
Moe gon go back, and attack the boulevard
Hell yeah I sip fo's, might pop a X-O
Might let the sherm burn, but I'm still in control
I keep my clothes on, Moe-Yo won't get naked
Unless I'm with a fine hoe, then fa sho I'm gon wreck it
Hell yeah I'm gon protect it, I'm never naked headed
My life is too precious, I can't get infected
Hell yeah I'm still chunky, hell yeah they still love me
Hell yeah 'm sitting on three's, everything's still lovely

[Hook]
(hell yeah) I get money (hell yeah), I get do'
(hell yeah) I wreck the club (hell yeah), I wreck the show
(hell yeah) I wreck shop (hell yeah), tops drop
(hell yeah) body rock (hell yeah), it don't stop
(hell yeah) I get paid (hell yeah), I get leid
(hell yeah) my candy sprayed (hell yeah), I chop blaze
(hell yeah) I get bops (hell yeah), my glock's cocked
(hell yeah) the Wreckshop, it won't stop

[D-Wreck]
Hell yeah I pull stars, hell yeah menage tois
Hell yeah I caught that charge, but I'm back on the charts
Hell yeah Wreck a rider, Wall Street insider
Pyrex cooker, sense on me provider
Hell yeah I cheated, on both of the broads
And I delete the next X, if she can't keep it hard
She asked me was the rumor true, was I really over there
Looked her in her eyes and I told here, hell yeah
Hell yeah I'm a thug, hell yeah I do drugs
Hell yeah, you can catch me opening tulips in the club
Hell yeah Bush tripping, hell yeah I miss Clinton
In them days I bled the block, wrecked the shop and was winning
Hell yeah she wanna do me, just because she saw the movie
But I ain't gon lie, I love my boppers and my groupies
Hell yeah I'm a G, with a college degree
Put the knowledge with the streets, no one in hell is stopping me

[Hook]
(hell yeah) I get money (hell yeah), I get do'
(hell yeah) I wreck the club (hell yeah), I wreck the show

[Tyte Eyez]
Hell yeah I grip grain, hell yeah I move them thangs
Hell yeah I come from rangs, stacking change, know I'm saying
Hell yeah I'm out that boot, hell yeah and I will shoot
If a nigga disrespect me, or my family or my loot
Hell yeah I fucked your boo, fucked her in her dome too
Hell yeah I miss that P-A-T, that Mafio and Screw
Hell yeah I live lavage, pimping pens got me established
Hell yeah I got a stack of talents, touring while in Paris
Fool around coming down, smoking pounds in my Coupe
With your dime on my side, to setting up that berry blue
Hell yeah it's very true, that she did the whole crew
Hell yeah and we fucked her, all in the same room
Hell yeah we kicked her out, right before we checked out
And we did the same shit, when we hit the next spot
Hell yeah you know Tyte Eyez, gon tell it like it go
Hell yeah motherfucking, still all about my do'

[Hook]
(hell yeah) I get money (hell yeah), I get do'
(hell yeah) I wreck the club (hell yeah), I wreck the show
(hell yeah) I wreck shop (hell yeah), tops drop
(hell yeah) body rock (hell yeah), it don't stop
(hell yeah) I get paid (hell yeah), I get leid
(hell yeah) my candy sprayed (hell yeah), I chop blaze
(hell yeah) I get bops (hell yeah), my glock's cocked
(hell yeah) the Wreckshop, it won't stop</pre>
