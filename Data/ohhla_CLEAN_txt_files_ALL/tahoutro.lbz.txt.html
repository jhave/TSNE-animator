Okay
Me Freaky Tah going up for me
Met two shorties yeah no doubt
Took out the weed passed to the house
Told my niggas to get the hell out
Bout to get busy yeah no doubt
Bone one to death then eat the other out
Get real freaky put my tongue in her mouth 
Put my tongue in her mouth how I do
Me Freaky Tah nothing to
Spig Nice, Cheeks, and Pretty Lou.
Microphone checka for the 1 &amp; 2
Walked away and god rule
Freaky Tah walk through your avenue
What the fuck do you think I'm gonna do
Smoke my weed, and I drink warm brew
You know I do what I do, hahh no clue
On my own my man.
Niggaz run when I'm bad to the bone my man
Cats better leave me alone my man
Freaky Tah in his own rap zone my man
One shot till come through your whole block my man,
don't stop my man
Yo I'm still runnin from the cop my man
Why I do what I do my man?
Freaky Tah for my L-B to my man
One time for your brain
Nigga bring the thunder and rain
It's no shame to my game
Freaky Tah is my motherfuckin name
If you don't know now you do
Word to mother if you come through try you
Pass by you look you in your eye true
Freaky Tah this is how I do
One time
Want it nah nah nah nah nah nah na na now now now
I I I IIIII I did it for you what you see is what you do now</pre>
