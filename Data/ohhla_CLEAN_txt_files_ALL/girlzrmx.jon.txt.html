[Lil' Jon]
Uh-uh, Lil' Jon and them Eastside Boyz (Yeah)

For the remix baby

[Lil' Jon]
It's some girls in this house
It's some girls in this house
If you see 'em point 'em out
If you see 'em point 'em out

[Chyna Whyte]
There's some thugs in this house
There's some thugs in this house
With that bling in they mouth
Bling-bling in they mouth

[Too $hort]
I like them girls with that long, long hair
I like them girls that don't care if you a player
I like them girls that'll let ya feel they ass
At the club with her empty champaigne glass
I like them girls that'll tell you what they think
Feelin' freaky after 2 or 3 drinks
I like them girls that be choosin' on a baller
Let you holler when she see you pop yo collar
I like them girls that don't like to have sex
Unless a player got a diamond Rolex
I like them girls that'll let ya move around
Catch a plane and meet a player outta town
I like them girls that like to stay up real late
Even though she gotta be at work at 8
I like to ride her like that 1980 Caddy
Real nasty cause she hate her baby daddy
I like them girls

[Jazzy Phe]
Some call 'em hoochies
Some call 'em breezies
Some call 'em chickens
But we call 'em girls and that's how it goes
