Yea, that nigga half dead in this mother fucker
With my nigga chill
We Going get you

[Chorus 2x]
You know I got get cha cause I got get cha
going to get cha, gotta git cha cause I got get cha

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Nigga I see you sleeping, so I'm creeping
On your Dayton's cause you aint an G, like me young h.d 
That little gangsta coming from the l.b.c
And he be straight jacking constantly
I just took an coupe with the must to be (That's right)
That nigga was trying to flow
So I grabbed on his ass and his ass got toss, he loss
His strap and his mother fucking jewels
I looked in the rear view and said, O weezel
I left the nigga lye straight in the street
Hitting corners, straight mashing stuffing my heat in the seat
We just banging and I'm hanging corners on his hundred stock torrents
On the mission trying to get to the spot
Cause I can up with some switches and the shit is hot

[Chorus 4x]

[Chill]
Going get cha, rock me ha ya, ready to hit cha
Mother fuckers best run and duck 
That nigga named chill is straight crazy as fuck
Yea, I'm in the backing mother fuckers on they pockets
False move take em off like an rocket
Blowing nigga out of his socks
Creeping off with the cooks and four four glock
Cock, niggas might be up the block 
But I'm ready to serve these punk ass fools like rocks (Got em fat)Im still on 
a mission, ski mask on you still know that you kissing
Yall niggas better listen, I got the four four cannon
Ready for some tripping, you probably trying to get me 
But this nigga never slipping from the c.p.t

[Chorus 4x]

[Chill]
H.D put me down on the lick

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
I rock house with an safe and a grip

[Chill]
He know the chill got heat for days 
Didn't give an damm about slay
Down to ground, we don't fuck around

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
So meat me on the East part of town
Cause nigga it's going down
Right now as I speak
Bring your bullet proof and your largest heat
And we can't be beat

[Chill]
Don't worry about nottiy
I got the four four and the slaw off fire
And it about to get hot then the on the beach

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Let's break off piece and than each
And when it fun straight get pay
Loc me and you will straight have it made

[Chill]
You hit the part loc, I hit the back

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
You get ends and I get the sack

[Chorus 8x]</pre>
