[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Young Money, they go
Sittin on the toilet, smokin on some medicated
Countin' loose thousands, I'm living good, they agravated
Two things on my mind, one is to keep stylin
And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm counting
Call me J20, I flow like a fountain
And I swear I beat the beat up till that bitch start ouching
Keep them bitches' asses bouncin', man we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
Im a uptown flamethrower young money firestarter
Had to sign on Wayne, I'm from the same place as "Tha Carter" Ha-Harlem
And I aint like none of these other niggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs.
Young Money cloud gang so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's fuckin with us?
you might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them bitches
I slut them bitches, then back to the door, I fuck them bitches

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Times aint the same, shit been going bad
But nigga we good, nigga we gooder than the motherfucka
Than the motherfucka, this for my motherfuckas
We run this motherfucka
So fuck them niggas and fuck them hoes
Money talks, we say hello
and I'm so, I'm so
I'm so Young Moolah baby

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Ok it's too much paper and not enough hands to count it
Paper coming in money never going out where
Its young money yeah I hear a lot of niggas doubting
This here is god's work, ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin money while you niggas makin petty quotes
You can make it rain, we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper, money control my whereabouts
About a year from now I'm tryin to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
Bitch shotgun, probably be your wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that 
Rap real estate and work, I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming bitch
Like Pain, Wayne and Mack Maine, I got money bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Young Money I'm the boss, you don't wanna come across
Money do summersaults, bentley on young adults
stuntin on them hoes, it ain't me, its the money folk
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bolt
What it is though, I know what it aint
Yall go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and runnin, join the campaign

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Times ain't the same, shit been goin bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, cuz it ain't what it was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
and a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict
And I'm lookin at the game, I roll my eyes
I looked at the clock and the hands were tied because

[Chorus]</pre>
