I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasn't good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough

I tried to find my way through life, but life did not find me.
Pieces of a broken man, enslaved in chains and can't be free.
Seems my whole life's been a lie
All this pain, held deep inside
It seems I fail, the more I try
Like this is hell, I don't know why
All my life I've been denied
You can't count these tears I cried
I just want to run and hide
but giving up conflicts with pride
I just want to touch the sky
Get away, I'm so high
Reach my dreams before I die
Spread my wings so I can fly...

They say a man is always measured by the things he has
but is tempted by the things in life he'll never have
I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasn't good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough
I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasn't good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough

They say one's eyes become the windows of the soul
And they say the past will follow you wherever you may go
Sometimes you gotta run away, forget the past and take control
Or you'll never find peace of mind, or the perfect place to grow
You see your whole world is a stage, and your whole life is a show
Gotta find a way to bottle all that rage, deep inside where no one knows
Friend or foe, I suppose the wind blows cold when you standin outside and you lookin in froes
and your soul never felt so low as you watch the door close on the path you choose.

They say a man is always measured by the things he has
but is tempted by the things in life he'll never have
I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasn't good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough
I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasn't good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough
I'm sorry... woohoo
I'm sorry... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I'm sorry... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... for you
I said I'm sorry... woohoo
I wasnt good enough... good enough</pre>
