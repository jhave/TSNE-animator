She self made too, therefore she winning (Yeaaah-ee)

Taking over the world (YEA-ey-ey-ey-ey-ei-ee)
C'mon baby girl let's spend this money (Yeah-EAH! Oooh-ooh-whoo)

[Chorus: Rick Ross] + (T-Pain)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)

My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (She bad bad bad, she bad bad bad)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (She bad bad bad, she bad ohh-oh-ooh-wooo-ooh)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin (Oooh, she ride it for me)

[Wale]
You got some nice pineapples, for real
Haha... Wale though, double M, remix

Be like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me, I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it dooown, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that look at it that shit I got you poking now
Numbers we ain't throwing dooown, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Ok I'm far too drunk I'm not driving (what's up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up but don't coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don't think that you own me
You my bag of my money, you my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you yelling fuck me
I be on some other shiiiit
Maybach O up in this biiitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures - I'm bout it, bout it I pull the trigger
Y'all be so lame
We killin the game; I dance in the bank
We so mafioso you ain't never know though
Never gonna know so, no never no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus] - 1X

[Yo Gotti]
(I'm YO GOTTI~!)
My bitch amazing, show stopper
Work at the titty club, pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 O'clock until 6:45
Mr 60 minutes, Mrs Chanel and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffle bag of money, she beyond that
And I'm beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I'd rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say can I get some head she say let me get my scrungie
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick she a junkie
She say "Tunechi this your pussy", I say "tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy, listerine
She coming I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard
Yeah.. Young Moolah Baby~!

[Chorus] - 1X

[French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad looking like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out, fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that AHH leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to business'
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is

[Black Cobain]
Rollin up some killer, ridin through my city
Bumping Bag of Money got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap she would hold that - she don't even smoke but she'll roll that
For me she drinking Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that's all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks

[Chorus] 

[Interlude: Rick Ross] + (T-Pain)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the mo-MENT!)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it (Ooh, when she on it)
White Ferrari and she got me doin' donuts, hol' up (Oooh-ooh-whoo)
