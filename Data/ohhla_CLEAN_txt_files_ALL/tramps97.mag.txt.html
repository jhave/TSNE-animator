[C.Gee]	Uhh!
[Keith] I get swift with the hype, the lyrical

[Kool Keith]
Supersonic hyper doper switch when I come with
lyrical I swing with, non-stop, heads bop
Niggaz drop, to the floor, the scene I get mean
Lyrical dream -- with the brother in the backseat
when I come with the bad beat
Smack unique shit, when I come legit black hit
One two, fast or slow, check as I go
Sing-Sing, swing-swing, on the go-go tip
Lyrics {scratch} like, when I crush you
rush you, lyrics I come, they bust through
The man in the backseat switchin
Check out as I lyrical dish em, switchin up and down
Hyper type of, funky shit, unique sweet
Complete the unique, style, lyrically the baddest
but not like Gladys Knight and the Pips
Unique sweet, comin down
walkin down your motherfuckin street, with heat
Yes non-stopper, I rocka
chick-check one-two, lyrical I step through
lyrical piles and polygons
That's the psygon, unique, SUPERIOR delivery
(that's right, that's right)
Exquisite expansion range
Top notch, when I come like, Mayor Ed Koch
You be walkin through sayin

I'm talkin to, you (Doctor Ock)
One two, bring the whole motherfuckin groove (Doctor Ock)
and let's do the do, one two (Doctor Ock)
Check in, went it with the shit, non-stop legit
Lyve it up, live it up
Yo, motherfuckers throw your hands up
and give it up, when I say

Turntables, J.C. play, one-two, time is up
