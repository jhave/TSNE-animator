(Intro: Too $hort)
Yeah man we just sittin' back, chillin'
Bunch of players listenin' to the seventh deadly sin
Short dawg is doin' his thing with my nigga Ice-T
Don't fake the funk

(Ice-T)
Ice-T baby, this goes out to all you haters out there
Actin' like a brother done did somethin' wrong
cause he got his game tight
Don't hate the player, hate the game

(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

(Ice-T)
Sometimes I get illy, cock back the nine-milli
I choose not to bust, smack your punk-ass silly
Just bought a crib, it cost two-point-five milli
Swimming pool in my livin' room, I guess I'ma willy
I don't get high, so I don't split the phillies
Niggas say they gonna kill me and I say: "Oh really?"
Hit my Kawazakie I pull off on a willy
This is straight-lace pimpin', I know you hoes feel me
I come through - make your whole club petrol
You might as well let go, I blast, make the whole cub echo
You don't really wannna test an L.A. vet though
Most of my crews' on Death Row - the REAL!!
Quick with the trigger, nice with the steel
Step into the kill zone caps get peeled
You WHACK!! you lookin' for a record deal
Bow down, on second thought punk bitch kneel

(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

(Ice-T)
Don't hate, cause my game's much, tighter than yours
My girls, finer than yours
My jewels shine, brighter than yours
You look me dead in my face 
then you act like you don't see me
You wanna be me, you hate my motherfuckin' guts
Lickin' nuts - what's the deal?
It's a level playin' field, my games' against yours, hustlin' wars
Roll the dice, risk your motherfuckin' life
Bank rolls and low hoes, anything goes
Ridin' rolls in a week, clap a nigga who speaks
I'm suceedin', in tryin' to keep from bleedin' in the lane
Crystal Meth, F.C.C., and Crack, Cocaine
Got a nigga tryin' to figure out the best route
I got cops in my rear view too, but I'll shoot
Every bitch I meet is fuckin' up to somethin'
Take a nigga to the crib lay him down and start dumpin'
Gat pumpin', they'll kill your ass for a G
Hate the game motherfucker don't hate me

(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

(Ice-T)
Yo, my name will sell better than rap like the ?Acropalis?
Suckers might as well step back, there ain't no stoppin' this
Whack magazines who tried and tried to toppen this
I still got more Lexus' and gators on my shoppin' list
Make a fist, take your best shot, bet you drop it kid
Hit more licks than you and never caught a bid
Make the whole world go crazy, they said about the pig
Bald-headed hoes step back, bitch go and cop a wig
When I do a show, best believe it drop
Every night I got my straps, best believe they cocked
Some bitch talks crazy, then that bitch gets socked
If a man steps up, then he too gets dropped
Fuck the cops, I'm still foldin' fat knots
Catch me on the weekend, floatin' my yacht
Say Ice kick some game and I'll teach you a lot
Knock your bitch no matter how hard your block

(Chorus: Ice-T)
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk
Don't hate the player, hate the game
Niggas, sharpen your aim
Every baller on the streets is searchin' fortune and fame
Some come up, some get done up, except the twist
If you out for mega cheddar, you got to go high risk

(Outro: Ice-T)
I don't know why a player wanna hate T
I didn't choose the game, the game chose me</pre>
