[Bizzy]
Shit

[Layzie]
Nigga, it's the niggas night out tonight, nigga
(Howling)

[Krayzie]
Keep hittin' that reefer, sendin' me straight to heaven
Keep rollin', smokin', and chokin'

[All]
Buddah lovaz
Gotta learn to smoke the buddah

[Bizzy]
I'm so glad you showed me, Krayzie, Layzie, Wish, Flesh

[Krayzie]
Reefer really makes me happy

[Krayzie] (Layzie)
Hydro, me just can't let a me high go
Me smokin' upon that hydro
Me just can't let a me high go

[Layzie, Flesh, Krayzie]
Smo-, smo-, smokin' that hydro
won't, won't let a me high go
Water the reefer, me slaughter
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack
A sack, a sack, a sack
It grew in the water, the reefer, me slaughter
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack, a sack, a sack
It grew in the water . . . 
Straight to Ziwiski to get me a sack, a sack, sack

[Layzie]
I'm takin' a hit of the bud, gotta give love to my thugs
Smokin, not chokin', now what?

[Krayzie]
I'm fucked up
That hydro really got me buzzed, me buzzed

[Bizzy]
Keep rollin', (smokin',) and chokin'
Nothin' but the Bone in me

[Bizzy]
Me puttin' me casing up into me trunk
Box of blunts, come get drunk
Me puttin' me casing up into me trunk
Sack of skunk, come get drunk

[Krayzie]
It's sneakin' upon me
Wine
Follow me down the nine-nine
and you will find all of me kind every time

[Layzie]
Drinkin' me wine, double your crime
When a me roll down the nine-nine
A stream of bullets and unload
With a me right way down your . . . 

[Krayzie] 
Buddah
Choke up with a me buddah
Smoke jump outta me buddah

[Flesh]
Hittin' that hydro, lettin' me school ya

[Bizzy]
Oh, that buddah in your lungs and up
That buddah fool ya

[All]
It's nothin' but the Bone in me
Hey, keep hittin' that reefer sendin' me straight to heaven

[Bizzy]
If ya got a bag of tweed, well, blaze it with me, fool

[Krayzie]
Thuggin' with me trues, swiggin' on brews
Steady be losin' me balance

[Layzie]
It's a Bone thang how a nigga like me smoke and maintain

[Krayzie]
Maintain, maintain

[Bizzy and Flesh]
How a nigga like me smoke and maintain

[Krayzie]
Remain the same
