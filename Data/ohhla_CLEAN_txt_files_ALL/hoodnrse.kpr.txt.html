(Priest as kids)
You cheated
Hood Nurseries
You cheated
I ain't playing with you no more
Can't run that far
What you mean you can't run that far?
Nah let's play another game, stick your feet in
Hood Nursery, let's count, I'm about to count
I got my feet in
Uh!, buzzing
Ok, let me count
It goes

[Killah Priest]
It goes eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch a dealer with his blow
If he squeals we let 'em go
Tax his silly, penny blow
Niggas, spics, grab your nines
Cops is rolling down our lines
Sell your blow, get off the track
Hide your doe and flush your crack
Change your clothes, dump your gats
Stay on your toes, watch your back
And the officer picked this thug right over here
One grenade, two bananas, three hammers, four
Five vests, six bullets, now we want war
In the inner city bang-bang, he laid behind the fence
Trying to blow his nine at sixteen Crips
"I'm hit, I'm hit" he yell to his clique
But they're busy running so they finish off the clip
Red rag, blue rag, one two three
Pants sag, du-rag, guns on me
Doe-ray-me, old lady
Give me that money and then we're free

(Priest as kids)
You ain't, hey I don't wanna play no more
You caught me man, you was me first
Man I don't care
Yo, nah man, let's play another game
Ok, my feet is in, my feet is in
Yo, we ain't gotta play with the feet
Put your hands in, put your hands in
I got another game, here it goes

[Killah Priest]
Mirror, mirror on the wall; who was the livest of them all?
What's this dude doing in my hood?
Who did he shoot? Who was his war?
Bodies laying, shotty's spraying
Daddy is drinking, mommy is praying
Caddy's, Lincolns, I'm up in the A.M.
Streets is mayhem, cops is aiming at our playgrounds
Looks like a grave now
I'm out in a Greyhound
Gotta escape this life in the cages
My hood is outrageous
It's all about papers, going out of state 'cause
Cop, thieves and hustlers, welfare in numbers
That's all we play, that's all we know
That's all we have, now it's your gun...

(Hook) Priest
Hood Nurseries
Hood Nurseries
Hood Nurseries
Hood Nurseries

(Priest as kids)
Nah I'm not playing with you no more
Ahhaha, yeah, yo we gotta make it out of this hood man
These games are kinda making me scary

[Killah Priest]
Paddywagon, paddywagon police man
Coming down our block we ran fast as we can
This young man lived in the slums
Tired of living poor till he picked up his gun
And went "click-clack" "Rat-at-tat"
Hit the copper's dome
Now the officer is laying in the tombstone

Yo, I got another game, yo
Yo, listen y'all ever play 
Da-da-don't-shoot?
Da-da-don't-shoot
Let's play
Well let's do it
Play again
We start of by playing freeze tag
Hood Nursery
But in the end you'll get a toe-tag
Let Priest tell it
No you it, no you it
Why is that cop looking at us like that?
I don't know
We can't play these games no more
We getting older y'all
We getting older
We can't play these games no more
Let's just stop</pre>
