[Lil' Wayne]
Big Tymers, nigga (Big Tymers, nigga)
I got that work, nigga (I got that work, nigga)
Look, look, listen:

This is where them niggas die fast
Sell bricks and buy bags
They dodge class to hit the block and go find cash
If you try to pass - take my advice: drive fast
'Cause, my man, ain't no escapin' when shots blast
You wonder why the cops keep circlin'
Niggas murderin'
I ain't never saw 'em before
Tonight we twurkin' 'em
Niggas wearin' masks like glasses
Niggas got on tank tops and a pair of Reebok classics
Pants to my knees 'cause the glock make it slouch
I can't talk right now - I got three rocks in my mouth
And, wodie, when we enter-- niggas freeze up like it's winter
And if a nigga whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner
Seventeen representer - you don't like it, do somethin'
And I'll bet you'll see a nigga outside 'bout two-somethin'
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits 'cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents

(Hook - 2x [Lil' Wayne + Baby])
[Wayne] Nigga, we done moved more coke
[Baby]  than a nigga could know
[Wayne] More money, more cars
[Baby]  than a nigga could show
[Wayne] And more ice - cheap price
[Baby]  than a nigga could score
[Wayne] And hit blocks with glocks
        Make 'em get on the floor

[Baby]
Nigga wakin' up to alley cats and rats
Project bitches that tote gats
Niggas kickin' the dope, but the crack done smack back
Lil' niggas runnin' through the hallways
While other niggas playin' ball - made a court in the driveway
Things ain't the same where I use to play
It's guns and broads
New cars, neighborhood superstars
And hoes smokin' cigars
Lil' ones sittin' on the car
Watchin' the bus hollerin',
"Them people comin!" when that blue car pull up
I'm tired of catchin' cuts, and bendin' corners
I got that work - got youngsters on all four corners
You got the quarters, and you got them halves
I got the quarter ki's, and Fresh got the slabs
Ten a ki is the price if you want a brick
And if you don't know that, nigga - tax the bitch

(Hook - 2x [Lil' Wayne + Baby])
[Wayne] Nigga, we done moved more coke
[Baby]  than a nigga could know
[Wayne] More money, more cars
[Baby]  than a nigga could show
[Wayne] And more ice - cheap price
[Baby]  than a nigga could score
[Wayne] We hit blocks with glocks
        Make 'em get on the floor
[Baby]  For sure, wodie

[Mannie Fresh]
It's the return of the click-clackin'
Downtown pistol packin'
Y'all remember me from back in the '89 era
When killers use to wear mascara
And run through the court causin' terror
Random riot gunshots
Government-issued glocks
That's bakin' soda added with that odor - now you got clatch pots
Niggas went from (?) to frozen cups
To catchin' cuts, to big ole nuts
Shorty, I been on missions
Jackin' niggas for Balley competitions
Stickin' guns in bustas' backs
Everybody, come out your Polos and your Zodiacs
But that was back in the days
See, niggas done changed they ways
Went from snug-nose-38's to hand grenades
Now it's a must that niggas bust back when they get cussed at
Or fussed at
Nine-millimeters, glocks, pumps, riot guns, niggas can trust that

(Hook - 4x [Lil' Wayne + Baby])
[Wayne] Nigga, we done sold more coke
[Baby]  than a nigga could know
[Wayne] More money, more cars
[Baby]  than a nigga could show
[Wayne] More ice - cheap price
[Baby]  than a nigga could score
[Wayne] We hit blocks with glocks
        Make 'em get on the floor
[Baby]  For sure, lil' one

[Wayne] What!

[Baby {talking}]
Y'all got to understand
We got this shit on lock, wodie
If you ain't makin' money you ain't doin' what you suppose to
I understand niggas kickin' in doors for twenty-inch momo's
Whatever it take, lil' daddy
And it don't matter
If I get caught up in a struggle, I got to take mines
If you get caught up, you better believe it..
that that iron gon' get your mind right, dog
We hustlin' for sure, fa
Bling-blingin' without a doubt
Like new cars, and pretty broads
And neighborhood superstars
Money
Bitches
Rags to riches</pre>
