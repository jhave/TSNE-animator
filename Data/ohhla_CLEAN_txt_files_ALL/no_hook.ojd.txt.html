Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
I'm a dumb fling

[Chorus]
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
I'm a dumb fling

[Verse 1]
Dingalinga ling, still selling things
Major in the hood, all the hoes wanna dingaling
I be king kong, baby come and see me swing
And you on the mollies, and I got the beams
Have you on a steam like you in a rolly ring
That's about money so I got on set rings
OG cali gab blowing on some steam
Baby colour green is on colour green
I be getting thug, call me Charlie Sheen
On the ball molly, selling fish scale clean
Caught your baby momma, hit her with theBilly Jean
Add texico 20 thousand in my jeans
While bee and willy still serving all of me
Bun dollar clean roll, that's the whole team
Dre caught the money, heavy in the game
Came here you want fresh, all about the chain

[Chorus]
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
I'm a dumb fling
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
I'm a dumb fling

[Verse 2]
20 in the jeans, 20 mil on the bling
All set do some stretches, see it on a beamer
Walk the day morning house same size of Rino
Feel like spurgeos, 50 racks on finger
Then got some chickens, ain't call them Jerry Springer
Well known in the hood, all the hoes you want my penis
That jewish did me 40, venus and serena
Killed you BM and you should call me captain weiner
Blowing on the cash, filled up on the diesel
These black and white diamonds I be looking like the Beatles
Versace hit the toe, help me looking like a cheetah
But I also rock MJ and I rarely do a diva
Ye they all black strapes, I ain't calling as a beeper
Screaming old new face, 'cause they G might be the people
Ye they all black strapes, I ain't calling as a beeper
Screaming old new face, 'cause they G might be the people

[Chorus]
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
I'm a dumb fling
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring
Dingalinga ling, ol bela ring</pre>
