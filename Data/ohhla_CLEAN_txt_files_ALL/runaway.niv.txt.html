Run away, Run away, Run away (Where you goin girl?)
Run away, Run away, Run away (You can't run away from my love)
Run away, Run away, Run away (Where you goin girl?)
Run away, Run away, Run away (You can't run away from a thug)

[Verse One]
I was gonna take my life where I wanted to go
Which was with your life, more then you'll ever know
Now I can't do that no ?withal? has been bound
Cause when I was ready you were no where around

[Chorus]
Said I wanna be with you
Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you run not true
And you never had plans to stay
Or is it cause you had a girl
On the other side of town
Made plans to be with you
Why the hell are you not around?

[Verse Two]
Said I was special, special to the world
And made you special cus I was your girl
Now I can't do that no ?withal? has been bound
Thought I was special, where are you now?

Chorus: + [Pusha T]
Said I wanna be with you
Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you run not true
And you never had plans to stay
Or is it cause you had a girl [Maybe]
On the other side of town [I ain't runnin' away]
Made plans to be with you [They call me pusha]
Why the hell are you not around?

[Verse Three: Pusha T]
Look I never asked for the game to start (nah)
You pursued and just gave your heart
Pusha played his part, yes
You know I showed you things
From rodeo strolls to Louie gummy soles
Said I got an angel flow
So I gave your neck angel blow to match me
Now we both heavenly, OH
Pink's your color but it make it {pussy}
Show part ring say love but we only lovers
Our commitment empty to put it simply
Just need you shotgun to sit on findi
Might get windy top list eight fifty
Rims match yo eighties the early twenties
Everything shiny still grimey and a thug
I know it make you like to stand by me in the club
Hugs and kisses every young girls wishes
Kiss and enjoy the fame and your title as my mistress, misses

[Nivea]
And when my dad called, you said I was yours
And when I was ready, you heart had open doors
So I gave up the biggest smile
For your voice ?it sound?
But I guess I'm mad cause you're not around

Chorus: x2
Said I wanna be with you
Why you have to go and run away
Is it cause you run not true
And you never had plans to stay
Or is it cause you had a girl
On the other side of town
Made plans to be with you
Why the hell are you not around?

Run away, Run away, Run away (Where you goin girl?)
Run away, Run away, Run away (You can't run away from my love)
Run away, Run away, Run away (Where you goin girl?)
Run away, Run away, Run away (You can't run away from a thug)
Run away, Run away, Run away</pre>
