Yo, for real
Y'all living in a dream world
Rexdale
It's a reality world right here, for real
Yeah

[First Verse]
Yo I'm stuck in this organized crime life
Shook slingers get robbed blind
Soldier ain't afraid to do time
We run the range like a militant co-thug
Meanwhile on the streets, what I kill is just throw slugs
Supplying the corner, so them dealers can sell drugs
Now you see my block get hot
Rob or shoot and get shot
Police wanna know our names yo, that's why we stay low
I'm caught up between my music and street life
My blood is like my heart dear God
And my gat is my wife
This world is spinning into sicker times, thawing like ice
Hated female probation officers, they boook us for spite
I'm living fouler, ever since Squiggs lost his life
Hard cold stone, don't give fuck you get blown
Never talk my shit on phone ever since I came home
You puff your glass jaw, I puff my marley sit on the rail
You tell your untruth, I tell reality from Rexdale

[CHORUS 1]
Material world - got me addicted
Drug money corners - got me addicted
Them sawed down barrels - got me addicted
Guarding my heart - but still I'm addicted

[Second Verse]
Yo I got hit, ever since worse
No I never did snatch purse, example
My palm grips the pearl handle
Too many flaws in the way, that makes us disturbed
Like pulling out, broad daylight like I got some nerve
The only thing now, this music got my face baited
This leaves me more risk round snitches and hipocrites
Place under warrents, they want me on the cell block
Trying to give me fourteen years and keep me on lock
Surround my house, front and back in the night light wishing to book me
Two in the morning but they can't find me, trying to look me
Ain't nothing much to say, after the street already hook me
I guess I'm addicted like my mind has took me - took me
We be dealing with this physical, some lie regardless
Sometimes the bigger the grains who hit hardest
I never boast about it, be smart like the smartest
I wipe it off, I loaded it with leather gloves regardless

CHORUS 1

[CHORUS 2]
My Rexdale blocks - got me addicted
All them work nights - got me addicted
Undeath fast money - got me addicted
Guarding my heart - but still I'm addicted

[Third Verse]
I'm from the Rex-village, dollar signs who's quick to stick it
Run up in your house to be specific
Ain't nothing perfect or terrific, so lay down quick
Special delivery of open burn wound inflicted
I guess they like the way we dip it
Gangster walks, the way we talk
And the way we lie they down on they sidewalk
Face down on the rich block, mask up right to my eyelids
Stick and move quick, on the run like a fugitive
Stay communicated from back roads to pay phones
I never talk too long, I switch clothes
No time for normal wasting, wash vinegar inside your basement 

CHORUS 1 &amp; 2

[Outro]
Know what I mean for real
Rexdale, know what I mean
Where ever you from
Got you addicted
All my peeps locked down
Hold it down, know what I mean
Keep the faith for real
All my peoples on the block, hustling
Peoples working, doing what ever you got to do
Doing what you got to do to survive
Keep doing you thing
