Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Pulled up on some niggas stuntin
I had to hop out, show em' I was really 'bout that money
Heard he was, he was talkin, he ain't really want it
I'm from a place, you want a problem niggas? Get it jumpin
I mix some chronic up with hash up up in a joint I'm stuffin
Am jumpin my car, jumpin my car, to the floor I'm gunnin
And I'll be shitting since before I could afford the pluming
You niggas keep on talking classics, I got more that's coming
Order something uh

Yea I rode em all neighborhood
In all of Memphis
Evergreen
Hollywood
Walkers in brown
You know what, let's get it

Pushing through my city like I'm getting heavy on that dough
With a white girl with me in a 2 seater, white girl full of coke
Straight from Memphis 10, ain't no hater gon stop me
Juicy J, been paid, got a Phantom in my pockets

I'm high as fuck, can't even see
Nigga fuck your baby momma, that bitch with me
Say I'm gonna get her high, she gon fuck for free
Makes you look much better when you on your knees
Put her on the cabbage, I don't do the baggage
Smoking all this green, rocking all these karats
Ridin round, getting high and a bad habit
Make weed disappear, then you believe in magic

Ridin round ya hollaback
No words man
Try get some pussy tonight
Dig?
Now the niggas still call my phone man
It's gon always be about cash
Good talk uhm
Yep
Ain't chasin no hoe man
Real talk
I'm on that paper chase
Ans when you niggas can do that shit you won't
But uh I got too much tied up
So, on that note
Ain't gon never stop making money
I know a lot of niggas be like damn
Nigga still at it
Told you niggas
Never
There will always be cash
And always drugs
Strip clubs that'll never close
So yall nigga know what it is</pre>
