[Intro]
The three Shugs
MC, ghetto nigga, P-I-M-P, ya heard?
We 'bout to get it in ya
Yo Shug you there my nigga?

[Big Shug]
One two, one two yeah
It's all good nigga, yeah, yeah {*scratched: "one"*}

Whassup Duke, it's Big Shug again
Here to make money, fuck makin friends
Punches to the face, feel no ways
Call on your team, my 9 sprays
In this game, I'm pretty accurate
Immaculate, leave no mess
In through the back, out through the chest
Fuck you nigga, fuck family stress
Don't front, and I'll let you live
Don't lie, and I'll let you live
But your girl still swallow my kids
That's just the way it is, f'real
Who wish to du-el, for jew-els
Step up and get that ass kicked like a mu-el
I been there and done that
So all you got left to do, is run that

{*beat changes*} {*scratched: "two"*}

I run up in the spot, cock, two glocks
I yell out, gimme the ki's, or the combo
P.O. back know
I squeeze off I let off, I plug him in the big toe
Now he tellin me the combo slow
I open up the safe, a whole lot of dough
I put it in the bag, quick I got to go
I hear sirens so I run mad low
Through the bushes to the getaway car
I put the pedal to the metal, to get mad far
I try to be discrete
But to the kids, I'm legendary in the streets
Shuggy Shug, I'ma put the guns down
I got a plane ticket, so it's first class outta town
My hustle remains strong
Live the life of money and women, and fly rap songs

{*beat changes*} {*scratched: "three"*}

Watch out, for Big Shug Daddy
Chicks sweat me, for the rims on my Caddy
I've been pimpin chickens for years
With no fears, cause I got the fly wears
Like diamonds rings and fur coats and things
All the riches, that the good pimpin brings
I check trap, attack weak rap
Player haters, stay mad at that
I need a franchise chick
One who dreams of mansions, not five dollar dicks
If you ready to work, then I'm ready to talk
Here's your chance, to start on the sidewalk
Live the life, of a high-priced mobster
Five pounds of shrimp, and ten pounds of lobster
And a bottle of Mo', to go
If anybody ask, you Shug Daddy's hoe
So get in where you fit in
I know you smitten, by this fly pimp shit I'm spittin
So get money; no bullshittin
And when you come home we'll try five new positions
