[SIX PAC]
Well now I'm creepin' on your ass like a motherfuckin' frogman
Six Pac's the maniac from Franklin
Uzi, A-K, Tec-9 millimeter
Blastin' out the sunroof, drunk on Margarita
Slobs ain't shit, we're gorgeous, ready for the raid
Let 'em on pull up and watch me spray
The F is for death and when I take that first
They fuck with 1-0-3
You know ain't no more Snoops left
Shit, it's an everyday thang and we gangbang
Watts Franklin Square Crip no one can't hang fool
You get your motherfuckin' cap peeled
Ain't no joke and I'm smokin' all Slobs that stinks
You thought ya - slow me down when you put me in the wheel chair
But that's OK cause I still claimin' Squares
Three Crips and a bomb with the F-M is on
Cixx Pac, Big Freeze and my nigga young Keystone

[SCARFACE]
G-Bone pass the Glock cause this Slob is set trippin'
In my party while we crippin'
You know this nigga slippin'
Tell all the Cripalette to get into the ??
You gon' tear it get this motherfucker and trap Slobs in
I can't stand a nigga wearin' red shit, dead shit
Cause then I gotta grab my gun and shoot him in the head and shit
Because I'm livin' in a blue pearl, blue world
It ain't no bitch pussy better than a Crip girl
Cause Slob niggas listen up, pay attention, I'm Scarface from Atlantic
In case I didn't mention, the crazy Lil' Hawk
Just wanna make a bitch and got a gun to the Slob head
Playin' Russian roulette, so bet
Now check but do it for your set
If you down with the Slob killer Cuz
You say what the hell
Off-brandies really can't stand - me
So I'm surroundin' about the Crips in Compton ?? this
I kick kack I see cool in the cut
I catch the Slob I'ma shoot his ass and his nuts
Y'all niggas want problems come to my place
And just remember the name: Atlantic's Scarface
 
[BIG FREEZE]
Sort of like a dump truck
But I don't dump no dirt
I'm dump the funk you shoot my trunk to put you Slobs to work
You Snoop niggas just tryin' to dis to count you up in the street
You couldn't fade me, yo I'm crazy if you caught me in my sleeping then
Daze me and amaze me that you're Rip for tryin' to Crip the 44 in your face
And have you pushin' up daisies
When push comin' short I get psycho
So when you fuckin' with the Locs you got to deal with the pistol
The nick name: Freeze
I represent: Watts
And if I catch you slippin' best believe what you get got
It's some of this lead when I catch you on chin
Over than a green as I bank once again
And when you're knees buckle pump
Nigga you be seen it starts I'm layin' in the cut to fuck you up
Like the red card
Check this out, I'm Franklin Crip - ride
You see me every - night
If you got beef with me well nigga you know we can fire up
I got my Locs who serve 'em Snoops with a fat sack
I keep the pistol in my pocket cause I watch my own damn back
When I ??? him
It's Freeze so you won't be fade him
The top to get the drop and where I stay
It's the stadium
Nuthin' beats the feelin of your grill when I'm stealin'
They don't believe I'm crazy so I guess I got to kill you
Push from the shoulder I get wicked
I'm at the top of the crack
Finna kick you with the Crip, yes
Slob motherfuckers get stole on inner face
Get with them one of this
This Unabomber I caught you in the way
Hey you should I told you 'bout Locs like me
America's sarcastic belegerent and skip if
You got a bullet proof
?? and I keep the plan see
We raise up the ghetto
A menace to society

[G-BONE]
Cuz I gotta grab the strap, pull the trigger and blast
This Snoop's in my hood and I don't give a fuckin' past
So we got to get gaffle, scuffle and buck it up
Slob slippin' on this side straight get shut the fuck up
This is B-K to the motherfuckin' heart
I'm from Atlantic Drive but got love for Kelly Park
Cause we put in work and take this Slob out without a doubt
Pop pop, biggety bang Cuz, duck, run and hide out
Cover up, duck and run - but don't slip
Cause I'm precised when it come to empty clips
Click - Tec 9 throw that ass up
Down on their ground Slobs shut the fuck up
He lost his life cause he was slippin', flossin' and frontin'
The S on his chest like he was Super Slob or somethin'
S-L-O-B K-I double L-A
That Slob is dead so he can't come to retaliate
Fuck them Slob niggas let 'em come cack and trip
I got a Tec 9 with 2-30 round clips
On safe thinkin' Slob niggas hate me
Cause I see dumpin' on his ass diggety daily
Buck them Slob niggas
Fuck them 'Brand niggas
Fuck them Snoops niggas and them Die-'Ru niggas
This is the motherfuckin' A-D double C
B-Dog killer Cuz, you should've been a L-O-C
 
[TROLL]
Die-'Rus better shake the spot when I'm high
Got a 17 shot
With infra-blue in a Glock
In a drop top deuce, gettin' loose on you Snoop fools
But it ain't no rules in this game givin' Slobs blue
Killin' up shit for the Crips on the East Side
Fuck a B-Side, cause C-Side is where the two C's Ride
The best, not forget about the Crip's on the west
Cause they steady puttin' motherfuckin' Slob to rest
In their casket
That shit is drastic, you slippin' hectic like Magic
You vanish when they cap in your back bitch
From this East Side gangsta call me Troll Loc
Dead rags gettin' tear with the red throw
Jaws brokes, Slobs shot out from the shoulders
Punk I told you
So step and I'm gonna fold you
Bustin' caps on these Slobs at night
Cause it's East Side Kelly Park Crip 4 Life

[RIDER-J]
Now once again my friend it's time to up the C in
Servin' motherfuckers
Lives was end
We on mission - shit
This is a hard test
We takin' no flees, no burgers on ass ain't no joke
This shit for real so don't be hard
You not a Slob but still
It's like a dream
That's come true
And caught in the zone
Boom, you're through cause I'm serious
I make your life end
And before you know your life's been at
You started this shit
Made your own rule but you're just too stupid
Sucker you a Snoop, you in a zone
And watch we call Atlantic
Cause when you see it's comin' know
Don't panic
I want you
I want your all damn life
And now I'm fill up to ends
Even smoke your wife but not your kids
Cause there too young to know
But you fucked up Cuzz
You gotta go</pre>
