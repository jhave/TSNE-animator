[Lil' Flip]
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Hook - Lil' Flip] (2x)
Why you actin' like a hoe?
Nigga say it to my face
You rather rap it in a flow
Why you ain't say it to my face?
Now I know your ass a hoe
You shoulda said it to my face
Man that nigga gotta go, oh oh!

[Lil' Flip]
You run your mouth to them hoes (hoes)
Why you ain't say it to my face?
You ain't playin' wit a kid
I'mma put you in yo place
I got niggas on my team, who ain't scared to catch a case
Catch yo bitch while she's shoppin'
And put that pistol by her waist
Push her in your car, then take her to your place
Bitch where the jewelry at? (yeah, where the safe at?)
Hurry open up the safe
When it comes to gettin' bread, I'm ahead in the race
Infrared to his head, it's just another murder case
The game really over when you see that yellow tape
Pop the Lucky Nites niggas, let's celebrate
These niggas love to hate, but I'm aight wit that!
These M-16's will push your whole temple back
Nigga remember that, I am not a game
I guarantee, y'all niggas coppin' my chain
Cause y'all jackin' my style, you can't fuck with my flow (flow)
And she a dyke bitch, you can't fuck with my hoe
I'm still pumpin' that dro
I'm still thuggin' fo sho
You hear that knock nigga? Courtesy of Z-Ro
Don't be no hero, just play your part nigga
You beef with me then that mean you ain't smart nigga

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
Look, a lot of y'all rappers turn up so bold but can't nobody touch me (can't nobody touch me)
But in the real we infiltrate penetrate muthafucka (muthafucka)
So one might get cool wit you just to do your ass end (your ass end)
I be openin' up in your whip and it's comin' through your glass in (your glass in)
Whether you standin' in my upper arm from the side of my forearm (forearm)
I can walk without security cause ain't nobody gon' do Ro no harm
Before I go fuck all yall, I feel I own ya that much
And if you wonder what it is that makes me act this way nigga that's nuts
We got fat nuts, you know the kind your baby momma like
Anythin' I say behind your back I'm willin' to say it to your face twice
Fuck Lil' Flip, Fuck Z-Ro, I don't be listenin' to they shit
May the same ones that at our shows recite our lyrics think that they shit
I'm just waitin' to hear somebody slander my name in a song
Same day it come out I pull a 2-8 gun out and I'll that bitch when I leave your home
Murder ain't crazy, just necessary sometime
I call a 14-40 and then you check out that's when I put my gun down

[Hook] (4x)</pre>
