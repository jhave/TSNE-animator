Ahhh-hahh!
Let me get some volume, on my headphones, bwoy
Let me get some volume, can I get some volume
on my headphones, bwoy
Now raise up the funk, bwoy - ha ha, bwoy
Raise it up Mack, raise it up Mack
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
You touch that line bwoy, the mainline

Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Bring it back and catch wreck on the mainline
Here we go with all the funk boy, to the mainline

Helllohh - is this mic here on?
Cause I'm gone, cause now and forever are disbanded
The "Poetic Justice", more than Janet Jackson
Mack's in, the sun that caught the planet
Realer than real, as Mack gets the steel
Funk appeal in my rhymes is gonna make a mill'
Fat shit is what you feel, (?)
I'm catchin hiccups and lyrics get caught in my esophagus
I'm bringin all the rap to the mainline
Some'll bring my funk on point like a porcupine
My sensei, say, the way, to make 'em pay
is treat the motherfucker like a (?)
I pack my funk harder than a (?) do
To continue, you're soup on the menu bwoy
I can run any type of line
Send your smoke signals high, code red yo for mankind

Now we are on the mainline, gettin all wreck for the mainline
Hahh, bwoy, the mainline bwoy, on the mainline bringin all the funk
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Bout to catch wreck for the mainline
Buggin on the funk boy, to the mainline

MC's now realizin code red
My mac-11 dinosaur is gonna fill ya full of lead (wake 'em up Mack)
Some of y'all are better off dead
Cause it's gonna get hotter than the center of (?)
Maaaaan, you're stupid out the frame
to think to get sane, and gonna cause some pain
I'm the most incredible man ever seen
While ya might stand the (?) do your typical and ran
King Craig Mack now runs rap land
Makin you (?), and me as Japan
Uhh, shucks, wait a minute
I feel like gettin music introduced (?) MC
See, you can't see me
The funk I'll tell you what's big, I'm thicker than a oak tree
And smalltime my fists come equipped
for a lip with tighter grip than glue from a ship
And even if you're still brave believe
that Craig Mack's comin down with funk up the sleeve

It's the Mack on the mainline, all the wreck on the mainline
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Watch me catch wreck on the mainline
Bringin all the funk boy, to the main
On the mainline, bringin all the funk
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Watch me catch wreck on the mainline
Hahh bwoy, on the mainline, bringin all the funk

My rhymers come hotter than a wok
MC's bein tasty is not my fault (no it's not)
More danger for metropolis we're droppin this
funk weight that's greater than George Poppadopalous
Now even fools are better
Rap's new trendsetter, at makin MC's wetter
So plug in the mainline 'til ninety-nine
for funk the genuine now vote for mine (vote for Mack)
My voice be gettin hoarser and hoarser
From the way they take a picture MC (?) than a flyin saucer
Believe the hype
The Mack one that's tight but then I might (?) set rhyme I write
I come for you niggaz in the grill
Just for thrills, Craig Mack, king of chill

It's the Mack bwoy, on the mainline
Catchin mad mad wreck on the mainline
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Watch me catch wreck on the mainline
Bringin all the funk bwoy
On the mainline, bringin all the funk
Now we about to bring all the funk to the mainline
Mack on the mainline
Get wreck on the mainline
On the mainline bringin all the funk bwoy
