[Too $hort]
Daaaamn!
Can't believe these hoes out here givin away the pussy for the low-low
Shit!  Bitches fuckin everythang, everybody, everyday
Damn girl!  Better get you some management

All this time you been trickin for the low-low?
You coulda been gettin rich, you just don't know
Girl you worked all night for that chump change?
Let them ballers write you off as a fun thang?
Take my hand - I got a quick plan
I know you dream about marryin a rich man
See his wife in the Benz with the cute babies?
The hype'll make your friends and you crazy
Cause you know about his two ladies
But he ain't fuckin wit'chu baby
Come holla at your Uncle $hort
I'll have you playin these niggaz like a sport (HA HA!)

[Chorus]
All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo hoe?

[Too $hort]
My name is Too $hort, I'm known for pimpin women
And last night, I did it again
New money, new bitches
Why they actin crazy, who is it?
I never heard of Too $hort - then you must be a square
Fuck around and get slapped when you fucks with a player
Real women get much respect
Golddiggers and groupies, don't fuck with it
I'd rather get a real hoe
Put the bitch to work and get some real dough
I don't wanna spend a night for cash
What'chu been doin all day wit your triflin ass? (Bitch!)

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
I made too many songs, to name the tracks
Not enough walls, to hang the plaques
Say hater, what you aimin at?
You ain't no G, you can't be claimin that
Your girl said she had to find a trick
Cause she don't like you, OR your tiny dick
I don't really care, what she's sayin
As long as this song, is what she's playin
I know she better slow that roll
I ain't said a word and yo' hoe just chose
You know I gotta take her from you
And after today, you couldn't make her want you (HA HA HA)

[Chorus]

[New Chorus]
I just don't know what bitches see, why all these hoes want chicken feed
Ain't none of these hoes worth 50 cents, so break these ladies all you pimps
Never have this much fun anywhere, to go back home I just don't care
Me leave this game no I don't dare - why you hobo hoe?

[Too $hort ]
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, bitch I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, you know I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, bitch I'm fuckin wit'chu too
Fo' sho'!!
