[Chorus]
My pockets put a couple bands on my wrist
Got my own shit ain't gotta put on for the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they like the team I'm with
These niggas think I'm losin but I'm really off the shits
I be off the shits, I really be off the shits
I be off the shits, I really be off the shits
A lot of niggas losing but they don't be off the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they don't be off the shits

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Niggas fuck with that lean shit, I really be off of that lean shit
I could say what I rap cuz niggas know I be with that street shit
Couple of them flex got me pouring up that reject
Got me up high on the moon, tweakin like I'm ET
Call one of them hittas up, put me one of them hittas up
Then slide to the factory make all the bitches come cheif with us
Got all the purp sip all the syrup, got me movin slow as her
Be cool before you be allowed to share
I won but you see a lot of Durk
They copy me don't copy me, a lot of niggas be mockin me
I'm on one ain't no stopping me
It's been one cuz we got the streets
Lebron you could bring the heat
I'm on one ain't no stoppin me
It's been one cuz we got the streets
Lebron, you could bring the heat

[Chorus]
My pockets put a couple bands on my wrist
Got my own shit ain't gotta put on for the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they like the team I'm with
These niggas think I'm losin but I'm really off the shits
I be off the shits I really be off the shits
I be off the shits I really be off the shits
A lot of niggas losing cuz they don't be off the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they don't be off the shits

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
Stop playing boy I'm off the shits ask all of chiraq I'm on that viking shit
OTF, O block, Lamron, 3hunna stop playin boy we been in this shit
Off one off two off two off three all niggas straight doing all hits
Kick a nigga door face on the floor, everybody on the block just tryna hit licks
Got the shit and my couple louis belts hold me up lil nigga catch how we do this
I'm for flattin out fam like a bitch
Never trust a bitch so she gonna do dicks, OTF to the grave boy I gotta get paid for that bama go hard like apes
Kush too strong, kush my face, can't be broke so the paper I chase
Run up in the spot we gon' take the whole safe, don't come back cuz the shit ain't safe
Knock a nigga down have my mans steal the case, tough gettin around the block with an eighth
On the block yeah you know I gotta move weight
My name hold weight so theres guns in this place
My name hold weight so theres guns in this place

[Chorus]
My pockets put a couple bands on my wrist
Got my own shit ain't gotta put on for the shits
A lot of bitches choosing cuz they like the team I'm with
These niggas think I'm losin but I'm really off the shits
I be off the shits I really be off the shits
I be off the shits I really be off the shits
A lot of niggas losin cuz they don't be off the shits
A lot of bitches choosin cuz they don't be off the shits</pre>
