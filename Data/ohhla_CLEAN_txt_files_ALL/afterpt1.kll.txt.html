Hickory dickory dock (dock)
Get back on yo' block (block)
When that clock strikes midnight (best ta)
Get the fuck off the block
Hickory dickory dock (dock)
Get back on yo' block (block)
When that clock strikes midnight (best ta)
Get the fuck off the block

[Beretta 9]
Yo in this corner it's the K.O. kid
I'm that talked-about boxer, but yet I take heads
Dark optimus, kid don't talk with this
You get SLAPPED like the half accomplices
Talk about 'em, there was like six of 'em
They was armed, but it was just me, Beretta 9 Killa-Arm
First battalion, first recon, first infantry
That last nigga or Red Dawn
Y'all niggaz want war, I can ensure war
I was built for that kid, my middle name's War
Slash mercenish, you might get hurt on this
Merked on this track, they'll be no comin back on this...</pre>
