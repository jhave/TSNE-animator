(Sample x2, Chopped &amp; Screwed)
I pop-I popped that nigga 
Keepin that strap cause I got my reasons
It's about huntin season
Smoked, popped, and ya can't stop bleedin

(Verse 1, Twista)
Kick fly Chi shit, you better act like it
Let the venom get in 'em and then I holla
Nah nigga nah, die nigga die
Comin ta get 'em like a hollow 
I hit him up when I smoke the fie, nigga fie
Catch you open on the song
And tap into the tone like I been smokin on the bong
Bustin at'cha dome
Takin you out before you even clutchin at'cha chrome
We like rushin up in ya home
And I got my niggas showin love
Bitches holla "get money" when they peepin us, roll up on them dubs
Blowin ya brains when we throwin them thangs
Betta go get'cha guh', cause niggas in my city pluck
Act like I'm invisible when I bust this
Go be lucious, creepin on 'em like a dark Cutlass
Buck us, but we Lou Do' smokin Dutches
Leave my enemy prayin to Churches on crutches
Hard hitters, check out the town that God give us
Brotha come with it are tryin'a be legit
But gotta put the trip on the nigga to talk shit
2000 we murderin, bustin some niggas dicks
Steady give it to 'em til they sick
Flow'll leave 'em swole, totally control 'em, to the kick
You ain't even gotta hold 'em, betta act like you know 'em
When you fuck it wit act like it clique (Clique)
Or the Mac might just spit
Say you got my dogs faded? Then put it on yo family
There the first, cause I know you mad me
Real niggas say I'm cold, but the playa haters can't stand me
Cause you know I gotta come raw
Steady smokin that green, scope with the beam
What was seen, what was saw
Comin like a strap, at the dresser drawer
It's over with, shut the shit down motherfuckas
And that's law

(Verse 2, Yung Buk)
If a nigga think I'm wild, then I be wild
And make 'em scream out "Uh-oh"
See me through the blunt smoke
If a nigga think I'm foul, then I be foul
And bustin at the crowd and the door
For the love of the dough
Know it took a long time for this song
Kick a long rhyme, but this song got my mind in the zone
And these hoes on my line, get the tone
Cause everytime I rhyme on the song, see the rhyme get 'em gone
Nigga Wild-Wild is the home, holla "south-side" in the song
I'ma ride for my own, and you niggas can't get it
For the red-cap and the fitted, niggas like to bang in this city
Let it hang if you wit it, sippin on Tang' in the fifty
Really ain't a thang, if you wit it
Biiitch, act like it (Act like it)</pre>
