[Lil' Nation]
Get up, best to follow the Nation
We are - the Capital Punishment Organization
Alias - we never needed one you know
We are the fortress of the empire C.P.O.
Here it is, yes, a rhythm message to the brothers
and others - who think about killin another
Who abuse the excuse for doin it, because they havin it rough
but ain't no reason valid enough
Listen up, while I tell you a story, devoid of glory
Might even be a little bit gory
cause the way that it happened I won't consider it braggedy
A drive-by shootin that ended up a tragedy
He was shot, layin in the street dead, reasons unknown
Another homey gone, never have his own throne
cause an ignorant brother pulled the trigger
He wasn't even a brother, he was a nigga
Another one dead, shot in the head, a sister
Wonder in retrospect - what if the bullet had missed her?
A victim caught up, in the storm of the stereotypical
Another brother shot condition listed as critical
Band together to override
In order to let slide the ramifications of the dark tide
Seperatin the men from the boys, is the policy of a foe
A boy makes too much noise y'know
Let me put this, in proper perspective
Killin that noise is my prime objective
And when I say noise, I mean the loudest of all
I mean the brothers killin brothers, so foe build the wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}

Some try to escape the reality of it all (by doin what.. what..)
by cold drinkin 8-ball
Mind's in a zone below my own
They thinkin on a lower level, cause they in leagues with the devil
Neville Brothers say tell it like it is, so I will, it's a fact
The bigger the headache, the bigger the peer
So expose who oppose because the brains they lack
who distribute the powder white while they killin the color black
Religion, not a smidgen in they mental vision
They choose to live in red - devil makin decisions for em
cause they never knew the meaning of piety
Members only of the dead society
The cluckers the smokers the rock rushers the pipe chokers death
That's what they boast while they walk around comatose
And we'll be the ones to bury em one and all
Teach the religion of the wall
Bet, the jury of fury yes, the rebels of hip-hop will build
They want us to yield, but we'll not, we're visionaires
They buried my commentary in cemetaries
They knew my sermon of freedom was preliminary
to educated the uneducated, who stood in the crowd and waited
for doers of oppression to fall
This is the movement, the foe and the C.P.O.
had chosen to call the war against low-livin - the wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}

We on a mission, that is to reposition the coefficient
So listen, cause I will be dissin throughout the coalition
those, who propose to live the life we label atrocious
So as I convert em to C.P.OSis - thus,
I reiterate - before you mitigate a cause to effect the situation
Fade to Lil' Nation
Sellin narcotics so as they increase
mental disillusioned seek to perpetuate the confusion
Scope the negative, to focus on the regulators of crime
This is the premise of a rebel rhyme
The culture with turbulence it's a problem of continous buggin
I go to the wall so I can plug in
the power, this is the hour to push the button
Cause nothin can stop the flow or the purpose of the C.P.O.
The sinners the killers who be runnin it, can suffer a lifetime
The agony of Capital Punishment
And the dope dealers, I push and I push but you never budge
I send you to court - you own the judge and the jury
that acquitted you, they lied cause I know you a pusher
If not for dope, then you pushin for genocide
But I'll ride you, lost I will find you
Blind I will guide you, forget I'll remind you
Your diabolical schemes to reign supreme as the enemy
is about to fall to the strength of, the wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}

The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}
The wall.. {*echoes*}

The wall.. {*echoes*}</pre>
