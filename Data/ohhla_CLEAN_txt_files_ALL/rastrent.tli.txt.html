[Intro]
Jahhhhh! Rastafarianism

Bada-ding-ding-ding-ding WHOAHHHH~!
Who demmmmm?
You no want test, me champion sound

[The Lonely Island]
Oh fire 'pon Babylon (Babylon)
And fire 'pon a batty boy (batty boy, batty boy)
Rudebwoy livin in the shanty dorms
My roommate Nick is an ignorant baldhead!
Now chant down Babylon, midterm essays
Then puff from de chalice I fi make from a Sprite can
Last week I read a book about Selassie I
Then told my bumba claat parents I was switching religions
Excuse I! Oh hot stepper
You do so many dutty crimes (Nyabinghi!)
And plus you're fully skylarking all the time
Udda look ya now

Have you ever noticed, how baldheads suck?
Bada-ding-ding-ding-ding-dong-ding-ding-dong DUCK
Excuse I for my skanking, give thanks and praise
Me toil part time at jah Cold Stone Creamery

[Interlude - echoes]
In a dub style!
Roller skates
A DVD of "Cool Runnings"
"Murder She Wrote"
Yagga-yagga-yagga yowwww!

Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent
Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent

[The Lonely Island]
Are you there Jah? It's me, Ras Trent
Please guide me 'pon your bike path of righteousness
Oh stanahoy, stanahoy, stanahoy, stanahoy Jaaaah!
Fussing and fighting and Zion and roots

Me night nurse never want to plant de corn
Skiddily WHOAHHH!
Diddily, skittily, bittily bittly WHOAHHH!
