Check it out one time
"We skate on suckers who perpetrate..."
State to state, state to state

[Dug Infinite]
Now you got to tell me right now, is you man or meese?
Is it man or beast, cause I plan to release
the rent essentials, what's my name, confidential
Na nah don't tell a soul but I sold my credentials
Skipper off my team, everybody Top Gun
Fortify the army, you can't beat us with a pop gun
I stop one allowed with one thought on my mind
Number ten is a hero take that one and make him zero
That's law, word to Shapiro, Infinite's a colonel
Now put that in your journal better yet in your eternal
We heavy like a sledgehammer, with Know the Ledge grammar
A bad mamma jamma all the way to Alabama
Chi-Town, where we don't fight over coasts
Cause the one that's in the middle is the one that see the most
No time for that (word) we burn cells, no time for fat
Let's say you like brain cells, we like state to state

"We skate on suckers who perpetrate
 And lay down law from state to state" --&gt; Run-D.M.C.

[Common]
I, gain... ground
Through my, pain... I came to bring it
I brought it, to the forefront, work in the back
Beauty Shop with the storefront
Hyde Park beeper chicks with the hardcore cunts
Didn't grow up ghetto where I'm tryin to get to is the same as you
I ain't a player, but I'm in the game with you
It's people in my city, that's just as lame as you
Laid the framework now at the door my name work
Free drinks attention paid, that's how the game work
My flow became land, with mathematics
I reign supreme like the Rainman
Piss in unknown spots, givin dap with the same hand
Raps overlaps and fill gaps in the rap industry
For those whose tired of the same similies
Hood stories, and songs to homies in penetentiaries
Chances I take over breaks, to make shit interesting
My city'll hold it down like bends in intersections
Wanted to say Fuck the Police, I ain't had no protection
Got the License to Ill, the real one got suspended in time
Brother you'll see it ain't all about the promo
_Source_ rating groupies and album photos
A stick man with a message and a mag should be my logo
Think I'll start sportin that instead of Polo, uhh... yo

"We skate on suckers who perpetrate
 And lay down law from state to state"

[No I.D.]
... I decipher data
Computer program the ill chatter
Brain stimulize sparks everytime I reply
My telescopic type topics smash your planet when I drop it
Eighty-eight popped it and locked it
Ninety-seven time to rock it, grown man status
I'm pushin three-zero, I plan to be the baddest
like hip-hop hero in the game MC
And makin sure that what you seein opens up your mind
When I kick the hard to find, strategic, rhyme design
Supersede your average line, intertwine when I combine
Elevatin mankind, attract a scholar
I convert poetry to dollars, a risk taker
Money maker got no collar, this one nigga asked me
Well who you be?  I be a store ownin real-estate flippin MC
Just makin beats on the side
Another way to survive, I turn around artists
Portfolio diversified, it's obvious
I ain't your average hip-hopper
to get up on the microphone and can't come proper
I be the MC to keep the clubs cold jumpin
I be the MC that's sayin somethin never nothin
