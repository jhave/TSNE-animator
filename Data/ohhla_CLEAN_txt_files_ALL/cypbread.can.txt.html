[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, 5-9, Canibus
Uhh, uhh-uh-uh, uhh-uh-uh uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh uh (yeah)
Wooooo!

[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"]
Rap's my bread and butter
Rap's my bread and butter
All I do is pick the pen up
Get to writin niggaz hear me
Get to fightin when I see 'em
Get to fightin them cause I'm a

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Emcee, the truest breed, I'ma live on
So whatever this rap sends me, I'ma perform
You can get an idea of how ill I be when I spit
Light three bombs, you'd be like, he hard
No longer do I do what I do for TV
Do this for my hood, I ain't rich but I'm good
All I see is essence what the lines do is definitely
time to expand my horizons so rep this with me
Firin, pick you apart, make you gone-o
Nobody fucks with me, my spit change to pyro
My bitch ain't Cubano, nope, she's Serbian
And I hope, you know that I murder with caves like Osam-o
I'm the reason they choosin to put they dukes up
I'm the same reason they move in them bulletproof trucks
Me and Canibus ain't invent it, we just depend on it
to eat and if you be in the streets you know how we spit it
Cause

[Chorus: Canibus]
Rap's my bread and butter
Rap's my bread and butter
All I do is pick up the pen, tattoo the rhyme
to your face, written in skin, let's begin

[Canibus]
Rap bread and butter, gutter, broken language the hustler
Starboard rudder, the Coast Guard cutter
I'm the studio night owl, stress give me white eyebrows
Who the fuck I got to fight with now?
Yeah, conspicuous characters creep through America
with a killer chemical in a canister called Canibus
Crazy as crystal communicate correct signal
I call it lyrical, they call it criminal
Call the commissioner, I'ma crucify the christian Caligula
like they crucified MC Christopher
I cast the Canibus symbol in the crowd
If there's beef on the ground, I'ma to carve the cow
Now, smuggle contraband through the canal
I check my clip on my chamber, sharpshooter style
La costra nostra, deep like Deepak Chopra
I kick your door down in loafers
Forty-five in the holster, AK in the baby stroller
Babies with baking soda, my lady in the Rover
A midget with dreadlocks down to his toes
With flows I expose what nobody knows

[Outro: Canibus]
Rap's my bread and butter
Rap's my bread and butter
Rap, bread, butter, what the, fuck we gotta
do to get recognition for lyricism brother?!
Rap's my bread and butter
Rap's my bread and butter...</pre>
