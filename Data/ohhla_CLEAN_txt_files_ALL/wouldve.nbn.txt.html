Song:   Would've Done The Same For Me
Typed by: itsfinest@aol.com

We're in the time where many doors are too hard to enter in
And many people really ain't worth the mentionin
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
Thats why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If theres tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now thats deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didnt think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if youre down and my pics on youre wall
Just pop in this song and wont let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

[Naughty by Nature]  (Coffee Brown)
Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

With the kindness of people and most dont even know
'Cause this wilderness was'nt designed to see us grow
My thugs through the years who've always been true
Just know that I take the bullet for you
Life ain't livin without givin, worth fryin for lyin
Ain't jack for free, but I'm supplyin if you're tryin
Have friends before the Benz, respect before a Lexus
Mama's(Mama's) gave us life, but brotha's have to protect us(Protect us)
Some wonder why I still got love
Why I still live in the hood, and why I still share grub
Why I play with the kids, lose money on clubs
To keep my people off the streets and away from the slugs
Sometimes rats run traps while our sista's get named
Sometimes bitches do thangs, and our queens get blamed
But I'm puttin things on blast for my women and G's
'Cause you woulda done the same for me

Where's my ladies who support and understand when
Yeah I'm tired but I still gotta visit the pen
I appreciate you love the love I show them
Woulda want the same thing if I had to go in
Lost the love of my life over stress and strife
If I couldn't care for me, I couldn't care for a wife
So I looked at the Lord and what he said was right
"Theres obstacles but everything is gonna be alright"
If you feelin what I'm feelin, lay back and give me love
So when you see me on the streets or clubs give me hug
To understand unity, you gotta understand we
You and I, you and them, them and me, see
Y'all did for me, now I'll bow for the royalty
Just to know y'all is the love the loyalty
Behind every strong man theres a strong lady with 'em
Behind me I seem to have a whole nation of women

Why do I shout out all my women and adore my queens?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I destroy anything that stops my teams dreams?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my people is and tell 'em what I see to be?
(Ooooooooohhhhhhhhh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
