[Chorus]
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki

[Birdman]
Yeah, hustlin on my city streets
Tryna get a whole ki (I bought my frist ki, my first ki)
In 93 and we was gettin 'em like for 25
Columbian connect, homey we was gettin fly
We on the grind and our nuts got bigga
And every day we in the muthafuckin hood our guns got bigga
Stuntin on them niggas, gettin money stayin fly every day a nigga spendin
Ridin 25s and we blazin gettin high, nigga showin off his ride
Crusin through the beach nigga rollin in them bimmers
Them people pull me over hatin cause they can't see us
Know I got the money (laws won't leave me alone)
Now they actin funny cuz they know a nigga strong
Money long and we comin

I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha (cooked it up myself and started ...)
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha (cooked it up myself and started ...)

[Lil Wayne]
I ain't have to touch a piece of work since '94
I lost my daddy in '96 and started makin moves
In '98 (i got a brand new lexus coupe)
(now them laws won't leave me alone)
They pull me over, lock me up, I bail out on my own
I call my poppa on the phone, tell him cook up a zone
I leave a house with a pocket full of stones
Got them hoes slangin, hidin packs in they titties
Them small chest bitches gotta put it in they butt
(20s in them they can't fuck wit us)
I got so many hoes
(it's to the flow or I don't see, don't know)
(now they won't leave me alone)
Man I got so much dough
(it's to the flow or I don't see, don't know)
(now they won't leave me alone)
Weezy baby d boy

[Chorus:]
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha (cooked it up myself and started ...)
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha
I bought my first ki
Bought my bought my first ki
I bought my first ki from my baby momma brotha (cooked it up myself and started ...)

[Birdman]
And I ain't touch a mothafuckin ki since '04
And thats the word that we servin, look thats all we know
Them niggas talkin shit but we the niggas wit the cash flo'
(i still smoke that weed, smoke that smoke that smoke that weed)
And i'm back on the beach and we blowin out the whole beat
My ak mack eleven represent the 3
Gangsta like a mothafucka me and my homies

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, my nigga rabbit was a og
My momma husband thats what show me (my first ki)
Yup, then you know I had to be a hustla
I started sellin hubbers</pre>
