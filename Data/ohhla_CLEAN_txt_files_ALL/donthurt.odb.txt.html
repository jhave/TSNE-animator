[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, stepping fresh out the clean, through the fog
I be that Ol' stinkin' Dirt McGirt dog, with a hurtin' for ya
That nigga liftin' ya skirt, learned it in the dark
Hurtin' bitches feelings on purpose, I'm a dog
Biting, no -- I don't bite, see
I just like to nibble on ya nipple, a little
It's not a riddle, or game, with dope
I just wanna stroke or poke, you in the right place
As if your pussy got a nice face
You need to stop fucking with lightweights
See my Roc chain is heavy, cock game, is ready
To shoot, oh bitch, go get cute
Cuz you can easily get treated like a prostitute
Please believe me, I like it raw, because I'm so freaky
Dirty, but a nigga still shining when you see me
You know that nigga, A, Son
Never been tooken out, Dame, good looking out
Hoes holla!

[Chorus: Rhymefest (girl) {Ol' Dirty Bastard}]
I'mma keep it real, don't hurt me
A nigga like me, love the ill punani, cuz I'm dirty
Please don't flirt with the Dirt McGirt
When I'm done, liftin' ya skirt, then this mic get hurt, u know
(Don't hurt me, Dirty) {Okay}
(I promise, I won't you, Dirty) {You sure?}
(Don't hurt me, again) {Okay} (Don't, don't, don't hurt me again)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Aiyo, my album gets crazy, but I'm still on the low
Your style is flashy, and you don't got no hoes
Don't front, I spit classics, you know how it go
On my leisure, Lisa give me so much throat
Well I need ya, bitch, betta have my dough
And Indonesia, in the Dutch, already rolled
Don't let 'em fool ya, tell you, Ol' Dirty's a joke
Somebody school her, tell her Ol' Dirty's a pro
First it's marriage.... then it's babies....
You know, Dirt love the babies.... (aiyo, bounce with me now)
It's game time, baby, ball with me now, I'm in your court, now
In your grand marquee, on tour with me now
With the Benz, laid back, in the hood with me now
Momma said she wanna go with me, cuz I make her feel good
When she go away with me, Ol' Dirty, nigga!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (girl)]
(Don't hurt me, again, don't, don't, don't hurt me again)
Yeah, I'm back, what you thought?
(Don't hurt me, again, don't, don't, don't hurt me again)
Shake ya ass to this!</pre>
