[Intro]
I speak on behalf of the people
Hope, Faith
We all got a story, this is me

[Verse 1]
Okay, please forgive me father all the sinning I done did
All the dirt I had to do
All the trouble I've been in
Went through trials and tribulations every day to make some ends
I'm a walkin' testimony still I stand yet again
You don't know shit that I been through all this pain ain't that the truth
So much tears that I done cried feeling like I ain't got shit to lose
Why my granny passed away why my daughter didn't stay
Wish they both was here today oh Lord in Jesus name
I done been through hell and back momma dodgin' heart attacks
Ain't no A/C in the house just a broken thermostat
Bill collectors on my line please don't fuckin' call me back
Got me stressin' about this shit ain't no way I could relax
I was only eighteen ain't no money comin' fast
Had no choice but turn to God take some trouble of her back
Everything just goin' wrong feel like nothin' goin' right
I just seen my homie Dale and he die within the night
Boy these streets ain't nothin' nice had to make way out the hood
Don't nobody give a damn had to make sure we was good
Just like that before you knew it I had got my record deal
When you make it from the bottom just imagine how it feel
Lord knows them niggas hate everybody had a doubt
Who this nigga think he is that little black boy from the south
They was laughin' at me then ain't no laughin' at me now
And for those who don't believe ask em now who run the town
Ain't no way I'm givin' up ain't no way I'm givin' in
I done lost it all before can't go through this shit again no (no)
Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do forgive me for my sins for the known for the unknown amen

[Verse 2]
Let me get it back to legit to quit porsche got two percented tint
Bitch I made so many hits look how quickly they forget
Go ahead and count me out you can talk behind my back
Don't give a fuck about what you say so you think my music wack
That ain't what my banker said couple million wired in
Hope I see a hundred more that's before retirement
Motivation on you hoes ain't no waitin' on the dough
Heard they prayin' that I fail tell them Ace will never fold
I'm a walkin' testimony and I mean just what I say
Looked my daughter in her eyes right before she passed away
Watched them doctors pull the plug don't wanna live another day
This was all in God's fate could not be no other way
How I did it, I kept my faith
They tried to break me but there ain't no way
I kept my focus whipped up the potion
And when you make it out the struggle you the chosen
I seen the light oh glory glory trials and tribulations my life is a story
And everything I did to make it made me who I am today
We the Best is in my blood ain't no father around to thank
I'm a lion in this field and my heart is made of steel
Catch me speedin' to the top hollerin' God take the wheel
Have mercy and even though we all are not perfect

Forgive me</pre>
