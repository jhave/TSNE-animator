Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Intro: Fabolous]
Young F-A, yeah
Cass, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Pretty girls with them Rolexes
No time for a hoe flexin'
Pokin' out of that wife beater
Big cups she's so Texas
Big booty that get attention
Like a rap star in a gold necklace
That ass need management
And a bodyguard that wear four X's
Bad boy, need a bad bitch
Cassellina need Fab...
Me and you make hot shit
You the gaseline, I'm the matchstick
Like woof
We gon' burn this bitch down
She turnt up, and can't nobody turn this bitch down

[Verse 2: Cassie]
You want it, I need it
You got it, I'm fiendin'
A sauna, I'm hot as a phoenix
You fuck me, fuck me like you mean it
Spank me you know I've been a bad girl
But every bad boy needs a bad girl
I look in the mirror, like they don't do it like that girl
Heard she nothing like me, La Perla on in a white tee
Red bone, so feisty
Hope you're 'round wherever I be
I promise if I never did, it's time to tell ya

[Chorus x2: Cassie]
I love it
I love it
I love it
I love I love it

[Verse 3: Cassie]
You say you want a taste, I'm bout it
I steer him through the state, air mile
Another round to go, here now
Just to make sure that he throw it down
He threw it down on me
Wait a minute baby, let me break it down on you
Heard she nothing like me, La Perla on in a white tee
Red bone, so feisty
Hope you're 'round wherever I be
I promise if I never did, it's time to tell ya

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4: Cassie]
Yeah, crop top with her abs showing
Drop top with her hair blowing
Ratchet shit start coming on
She stop, pop, then get low and
Look back, and smile at it
I'm on that like my name tatted
PR, DR, mama thinking my name's daddy
But no way, Jose, I'll feed you a bottle of rose
And spank that for being bad
Them words they tell you don't say
Talking to me in Spanish
I'll tell you what my plan is
Bust one, smoke one, when the smoke clears I vanish
Gone

[Outro: Fabolous]
What's up Cassie?
It's time to put the haters to sleep
Rockabye baby
I love it

[Chorus x2]</pre>
