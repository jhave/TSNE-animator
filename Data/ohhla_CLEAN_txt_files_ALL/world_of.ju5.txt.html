Typed by: krandles@hotmail.com

Well, here's a little something for my people in the house
I'm gonna tell you what my crew is all about
We like raw rhythm fusion, real rhyme producin'
songs for the world's men, women and children
Armed and equipped with much confidence
and this is how we're gonna make our living
Some are known for bein' biters
non-creative and wack rhyme-writers
Yo, they soup you up but can't rock the jam
known to the world as a one-hit band
Easy come, easy go, yo you had your turn
temporary niggas touchin' up your perm
You see a rapper is a kid that brags and acts big
A rhymer is a nigga that can handle his biz
Yo, A rapper is a kid that's tryin' to be the shit
An entertainer ain't tryin' cause he already is

[Chorus]
Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
where life imitate art and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
where lights, camera, action is the language

[repeat Chorus]

We was rockin a jam the other night
J5 was on the mic so the people was hype
Yo, we like to rock the party with adrenalin and passion
the crowd started screamin "Action Satisfaction"
Numark dropped the beat and the heat from the fire
We brought the energy and streetcar named desire

We was flippin, they was trippin, how we was old schoolin'
needle to the groove, hands in the air movin'
and we said to the crowd "This is the place to be,
whether you paid a fee or you got in free"

So when you step through the door, the music gets loud
Manuever through the crowd to get a better view now

[Chorus]

To be an MC, you got to be so fresh
to have style and finesse way above the rest
With the strong delivery, vocal chemistry
street poetry in tune with the beat
So if you think you got the skills come take a test
microphone check if you truly are blessed
If you can flow like water and can comprehend
you need longevity in this game to win
Now if you want to be the best you got to move and motivate
Watch the money that you make in the industry stakes

Cause some of these people ain't got no class
and some of these folks'll make you beat they ass
If you can believe then you can achieve
get the loot, live the dream, be on top of the scene
To keep the people in it, and accumulate fans
to be dope in the studio and slam at the jams, so

[Chorus]

Welcome party people, while we got your attention
There's a few things we'd like to mention
The name is Jurassic, but they call us J5
we rock bonafide fly rhymes fortified
We got 2 DJs controlling the beat and
vocal harmonies make it sound so sweet
We're the four horsemen, with words to caution
expressed and flipped in an orderly fashion
With the rhymin', designin' the music on time and
the fellas saying "ho" and the ladies losin' they mind and
the breakin', the scratchin', this thing called rappin'
the cultivated music that keeps your hands clappin
The passion, reaction, the street satisfaction
Brothers using no tactics to make it happen
the rhythm, the spirit, you love it when you hear it
Nowadays when you're samplin' shit, you gotta clear it

[Chorus] 1.75X
