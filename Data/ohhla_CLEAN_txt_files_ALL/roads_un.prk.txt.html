Song:   Roads Untraveled
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Mike Shinoda]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
Cause beyond every bend, is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain I've known
Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
Cause the love, that you lost, wasn't worth, what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

[Chorus]
Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh
Woah-oo-oh-oh
Woah-oo-ohh

[Mike Shinoda]
Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love, never end, and if you, need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

[Chorus]</pre>
