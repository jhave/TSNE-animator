"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"
"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"

Yo, how much pain can one-man take
A woman and child step over crack valves
Blood in the streets, thugs and the creeps
Dilapidated playgrounds where kids play
Broke swings and glass
Dirt for grass, they run and they laugh
Benz parked by the projects, Idle objects
Kids stare hypnotized by the chrome glare
You got dope fiends nodding on the fences
Young brother smoke a blunt
Selling two for fives on the benches
Syringes all through the gutters and haze waters
Police holding parts of these streets to blaze on us
Drunks slain on the pavement hand in a fifth
This ghetto life we living in, God damn it's a bitch
My brothers locked up in jail, box in a cell
[Told in touch] to the world is what I write in the mail
Streets is infested with drugs, crips and bloods
And every corner there's a thug but ain't no motherfucking love
Word up

"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"
"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"

Yo gray skies cover my city
Black clouds and rain drops
Well, when the pain stop?
You got run down apartment rentals
No heat, it's cold in these streets
Gets hungry, no food to eat
Hear babies crying, young black men's dying
Single mothers giving up in the world, keep trying
Gun shots ricochet on bricks from the building
It's sick, and this ain't no place to raise children
They rather go to war and buy guns for six billion
Keep us in the hood right next to all the killing
Murals painted on the walls, ghetto gravesites
[Only tell precise], like it's coming to life
when you walk past, say a prayer
pour out ya beer
reminisce all the time when ya nigga was here
son you never feel the pain till the shit hits home
son you never feel the pain till it's one of your own
where's the love?

Yo I wanna say rest in peace to my nigga Jam Master Jay man
Word up, it's all love my nigga
To all my niggas in the streets, the fallen soldiers
Keep ya guns up niggas, word up
See y'all niggas soon, man, I'm out

"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"
"Love is the center, together we can work it out
If we ever needed love, we need it right now, right now"</pre>
