[Young Dro]
[Bridge]
Dro dats all nigga
Car dont come out till fall nigga
Whip a nigga ass with a tall nigga
Nigga we aint stuntin yo balls nigga

Fuck you boy you lame as hell
And them niggas came with you they lame as well
Get the fuck up out my face I got cane to sell
Remy in my cup I'm drunk as hell
Y'all pussy niggas just rapping wrong
In Texas get head thats astrodome
Beef with me justs asinine
Ima show you niggas how to maximize
Young Dro push a nigga he stay on the ground
Nigga get in the ring its K.O. time
I love ham and cheese its mayo time
I look good bitch you aint got to say I'm fine

[Chorus]
I get so much money man these niggas cant beleive me
Pocket BK double whopper so you know its cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Everytime I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me, polo polo freeze me [4x]

[Gucci Mane]
20 on the watch I'm shittin' on 'em
Canary yellow chain I piss on 'em
Shawty my way she spittin on it
Told Dro this how I'm gettin on it
Drop a 12 so cold
And she comin' up poor
Copped a sub-zero
Cuz I'm oh so cold
4-58 pass there he go
And I hit one button and da bitch get lost
Car dont come out till June nigga
2012 not soon nigga
Get out da way make room nigga
And da rims and da guts maroon nigga
Big tools my whole presume
Will wet a nigga chest like a water balloon
So you better off soon wit yo auto soon
Order 20 more thou'let da bottles resume
ITS GUCCI!

[Chorus]
I get so much money man these niggas cant beleive me
Pocket BK double whopper so you know its cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Everytime I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me
Polo polo freeze me [4x]

[T.I.]
Free me see me throw da dueces hatin'
Useless do sit keep da truth amazin'
Dont trip wont slip no whoopsie daisy
See da King fallen off u halucinatin'
You wanna talk about paper lets do it baby

Got sum true freaks wit me so cute in da face
They lil bad ass call 'em my bossie babies

On da phone wit my nigga lil turkey sayin dat...

[Chorus]
I get so much money man these niggas cant beleive me
Pocket BK double whopper so you know its cheesy
And I be so fresh I got these bitches want to see me
Everytime I hear them haters talking I say freeze me
Oh you need to freeze me
Polo polo freeze me [4x]
