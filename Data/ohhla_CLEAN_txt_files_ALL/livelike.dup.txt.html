[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yeeah, uh uh, it's a new year!
0-0-4, let's go, uh huh

[Chorus (1): J.D.]
I'm so cool, ready to explode, let the whole world know
Ain't nobody live like me
Stay above the rim like Kobe, in that purple and gold
And ain't nobody live like me
I'm so cool, ready to explode, let the whole world know
Ain't nobody live like me
Stop talking and grab the control, it's Live 0-0-4
And ain't nobody live like me

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
When I step back, everybody be knowing
I'm fresh to death and got that pigeon toe going
I'm, I'll school you like you want next
Cause I'm hitting all nets
I ain't scared of y'all
I'm ahead of y'all
Y'all trying to do what I do
I did that when I was hurting them in high school
6'8" same number as the great MJ
"Have you seen him play?"
Is what the streets is askin, I do it with so much passion
One hand dunks and pass, I dribble in all fashions
I got a jumper like 33
I'm The Answer, Franchise, and The Truth, you heard of me?
And I'm taking it to anyone
Mind set on LeBron, do you dig where I'm coming from?
Enough talk, let's take it to the floor
It's Live 0-0-4, yo yo, yo yo, YO!

[Chorus (2): J.D.]
I'm so cool, ready to explode, let the whole world know
Ain't nobody live like me
Stay above the rim like T-Mac, in that blue and black
And ain't nobody live like me
I'm so cool, ready to explode, let the whole world know
Ain't nobody live like me
Stop talking and grab the control, it's Live 0-0-4
And ain't nobody live like me

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
I'm looking like, "stupid" when you guard me cause it ain't no stopping me
You feel like you in Rucker Park when you watching me
When I got the rock, everybody stand up
Cause I'm gone jam no matter what hand up
Right or left hand up, slide in the air
Respect the throwbacks cause this my year, let's get this clear
The number on the back of this jersey is the name you gone hear all (huh)
I bring it to the game what the game ain't seen
Nod all eyes in the hood, I'm a stay on the scene I can play for any team
You know I'm just trying to be one of the best of all time
You heard about me, I'm on your son's bag and on the wall of your daughter
Only eighteen and my jump shot is prodigal
Enough talk, let's take it to the floor
Live 0-0-4, oh!
Are you ready?

[Chorus (1): J.D.]
