[Verse 1]
Tell me what you want I'm down with double R
Everybody know pirate is out this world
This is for the cats fighting fevers
Keep fight till the club closes
And if your them girls that get down
I'm on fire so all ya getting burned down
A lot of them reveal to see
And I let them do what they want
The one's that stay I front them
Suit and a flag and I take a few with me
I ain't no saint that's why I wake them up
I like her so much that with Nore I sing to her
I hold her and caress her... I'm a complete man
That's why girls don't leave me alone
And I give them what they ask for
And this is what they decide

And I grab her right by the ass that make her mess up
Catch me in my P.R stance I'm like take that
Handout my pistol like take that

[Verse 3]
Tell me if you like the way that I seduce you
When pirate gets you high and get you loose ma'
Everybody knows that my music gets inside you
When you see what I have its gon' scare you
Cause you never seen what I brought you
If you ask questions ma' you'll get put on
What I'm worth a bill real big ma'
Come wit me girl cause I'mma calm you down
And please I ain't looking for no love ma
I'm arrogant for me this is regular
I don't advise throw myself without permission
I catch you chicken and like a chicken I fuck you
I don't know about you but I sing it like it should be sung
Now you gon' see how pirate gonna make you fall

Let's go hang out I feel like driving around
