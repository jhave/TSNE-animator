[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Wu-Tang for life nigga (House Gang, nigga what's up?)
I ain't gon' never lay my flag down (Carlton Fisk, the criminal)
Fuck what ya'll niggas is sayin', ya hear me? (D.C., Donnie Cash, La Banga)
We gave ya'll niggas life man, watch ya mothafuckin' mouth (Raider Ruckus)
The general, yo (W.T.C., nigga)

[Inspectah Deck]
I'm the gladiator, General Max
Resident patient, stay sick, that's a medical fact
That's my House Gang set in' it back, settin' the track
Only hood you be in, got a sweater attached
I'm in the pits with the bulls and wolves
Clip fulls in tools, strip fools, cliques, groups, and crews
Sip Bulls, spit blues for dues
Split grooves, who's you
Ain't no stoppin', this dude's the truth
Like number 34, Paul Pierce, I ball fierce
Push your wig back, then roll up in pallbears
For years, I swung hard as Tyson's cross
Tore the roof off in white tee's, Nikes, and shorts
Fuck mic's in The Source, I'm tryin' to live like a crime boss
Mansion, garage, five bikes, and a Porsche
It's the high price of power, and your life's the cost
So it's pressure on you birds like them dike's up north
Only seen with the flyest of queens in two seaters
Size double duece on the shoes with tube speakers
East side, duckin the 5
In these mean streets we beast U.D.'s, man it's nothin' to ride
If it's war, I'm leavin' nothin' alive
It's on to the grave, then I'mma catch your ass on the other side
So run and hide, and pray to God stay low
Before we step through you niggas like the Stargate hole
It's the H.G.'s, U.D.Z's we king size
Box you up like a order of five wings and fries nigga (You ain't heard nigga)
Box you up like a order of five wings and fries nigga

[Chorus 2X: Inspectah Deck]
They all talkin' gangsta (But ain't nobody scared)
They neck is full of diamonds (But don't nobody care)
They claim they got millions (But ain't no millionare)
They say they in the hood (But you neva see 'em there)

[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, we in the mothafuckin' Killa Hills 10304
House Gang, 2-4 war
Undadogz, Urban Icons
Ya dig, come see us</pre>
