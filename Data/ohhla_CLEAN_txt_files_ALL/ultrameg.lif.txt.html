14 16" splitscreens all showing what you're viewing
What you doing? Withering away!
Black friday
Sale prices by Dionysus
The God of wine just bought a spine
Rise up from your couch
Get it now, go out
Follow the warm glow
(We sense you)
Open the door
(Who sent you?)
Our advertising so we know why you're here
Winter wear
Summer wear
In board gear
Outboard gear
We've got Korgs here next to the cords there
Split peas and greens
Slacks with seams
Right next to your kid's dreams 
Stationary
Gonne elope?
Buy a diamond ring and envelopes
Just delete hesitation
Implant impulse
In skulls
Roam the aisles till it feels worthwhile
Now bring forth your selection
Choose your weapon
Currency, credit card, mega card
It's never hard
We aim to please
Did you notice, we also have...?
Oh, you have?
Let me grab a bigger bag
Now walk through the scanners
Keep us in your daily planner
We're a Master Store
But really mainly just Master!

Buy more
Save more
We're your saviour
Get 6 if you trade 4
Chance of a lifetime
Hop in the right line
$12.99 to hear a hype rhyme
Buy more
Save more
We're your saviour
Get 6 if you trade 4
Win a trip
Win a a whip
We don't give a shit
Welcome to the realms of the infinite!</pre>
