[Verse One] [Kanye West]
Ayo, rippin' you niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine they the greesiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
You gotta know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to run when my niggas be rollin'
Holdin' your gun, especially if you owe 'em
Watchin' yo back, especially in the mornin'
Now niggas give you a pound and tell you, "Be safe."
Like you carryin' a million dollars in a briefcase
Now you're all paranoid like, "Is this shit laced?"
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
As long as you sure
My point is mainly that
We maniacs 
Maniacs nigga what

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse Two] [Rhymefest]
Nothin' nice when you fightin' for your life
With the ruger, did he shoot him?
Did you see it? Was it right?
Did he deserve that? (naw)
Ask 'em maine
Did he know he turned his son to a bastard maine?
If I see him on the street, I'ma blast him maine
Have a ? and a ? in the casket maine
This guy saw me on the strip, tried to out the thang
I told 'em, "Slow up. This wasn't even about you maine."
He must of thought I was scared though
Unprepared though
Oh no
Here come my guys hoppin' out the Volvo
Fo' fo' out in the clear
One shot hit 'em in the ear
Open the trunk, put 'em in here
What it is stick? Put it in gear
You need to know you can't fuck with my blood
We
Throw you in the trunk
Get you drugged
Take you to your own grave
That's the shit you dug
Now it take at least six niggas to pick you up
C'mon

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

[Verse Three] [Rhymefest]
Got my money and my loot now
Tell the truth now
Don't make me grab the .380
Don't wanna shoot ya
You got a little girl? 
Think about her future
You need an outfit
These slugs should suit ya
Like 5-0 my nigga, I hot pursuit ya
Bullets trimmin' the side of your head like crew cut
Used to be po'
Never could afford new stuff
Even so
We grabbed ski masks to do stuff
All on ten
Niggas was high and juiced up
While you livin' with your girlfriend like a moocher
Get your own shit, be about grown shit
When the chrome spit, you can hear a bone split
I don't give a fuck 'bout who you gon' get
After you dead, killin' him is just a bonus
Ding ding ding
You my millionth customer
Yo K? Why these niggas always think they can fuck with us

[Chorus]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watch me put the low down

Down down 
Down down
Down down</pre>
