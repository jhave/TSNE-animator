[Intro: Bizzy]
Cause I would ride for you, and I would fly for you
I'm right beside you, 'side you, 'side you
I will ride for you, and I will fly for you
Right beside ya.. I love you Jesus

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
I will ride for you, I will fly for you, I'd even die for you
I'm right beside ya, 'side ya, I'm right beside ya
Cause I will ride for you, even fly for you, even die for you
I'm right beside ya, 'side ya, 'side ya...

[Bizzy Bone]
Been destituted through duty, and told you we're dead
I've been arrested, put in cuffs and given the blanket to bed
I've been surrounded by the spirits and the screams in my ears
So many tears, and so many fears, for so many years
So many years, as the numbers are revolvin
Problem solvin in this crack pot, the spirit's evolvin
Prophet don't ever leave me, we are stuck in this world
We can make it if we watch it while we castin our pearls
Like hands and knees, where the struggle we face
The struggle we taste, a waste of the love in this place
What a disgrace, beg the Lord forgiveness and salvation
Emancipation Proclamation, revelation for sure
In the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, amen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam...

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Cause I would ride for you, I would fly for you
I would die for you, I'm right beside you
Cause I would ride for you, I would fly for you, I'd even die for you
I'm right beside ya, 'side ya, 'side ya...

[Bizzy Bone]
And I see that it's problematic, the static is comin non-physical
Melody over felony, baby boy, I know it's spiritual
I forgive you cause I know that this was out of control
Out of your mind, out of your body, away from your soul
The tote baby is heavy, the level of your waters' maximum
Baby don't drown, it's so profound so be watchin your actions
Everybody's changin rearrangin they actin strange
and I'ma keep it real life and not real trife, I don't even play no games
And, I remain with the spirit, pick it up to hear
Tell 'em to drink but don't be a drunk, you better be careful in here
So many tears, wishin I could help from the side
The spiritual cot, feelin like you love me not
You'd love me to rot, pop snap crackle and drop
Give me the strength to stomach down the salami
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam...
In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, amen
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam, play it again Sam 

[Chorus: Bizzy Bone]
Cause I will ride for you, I'd die for you
I'm right beside you.. play it again Sam 

[Bizzy Bone]
Father, we loners in this world, you're the greatest I know
It's so many po-po, settin us up, ready to go go
Some say it's a miracle, some, don't wanna buy it
And some say it's imperial, baby don't even try it
Still cryin, and I'm feelin like we constantly dyin
Pick it up, the resurrection baby, my name's Bryon
Through the fire, through the wire, God almighty the Lord
Ain't no adultery, cerebrums keep your flame in the swords
Praise the Lord, Father God, Baby Jesus, His Son
I don't have to worry about the money, we only gon' need the one
It's one true God, we children and we come in as babes
And of course don't start {?} crazed and they're jealous and I feel abraised
Seized up, and are tazed, and they both get shaved
Feelin the heart, of the soldier, child of God, made Jesus
Laid back, I'm anxious, and the danger it's around
Better be quiet, I gotta pay attention to when I hit that sound 

[Outro: Bizzy]
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam, play it again Sam
Yeah, yeah, play it again Sam, play it again Sam
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam
Play it again Sam...
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen
In the name of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, amen
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam, play it again Sam, play it again Sam
I would ride for you, I'd die for you
I'm right beside you, play it again, play it again boy
Said I'd ride for you, I'd even die for you
Play it again Sam, play it again Sam, play it again Sam
Play it again and again and again and again and again and again and again...
Play it again and again and again, play it again Sam
And again and again and again and again and again and again and again
Play it again Sam, and again and again and again and again and again...
Play it again Sam, and again and again and again and again and again...
