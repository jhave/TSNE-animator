[Verse 1]
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh

[Chorus]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

[Verse 2]
G'head crack a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

[Interlude]
I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before

[Verse 3]
My god sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

[Chorus]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it

Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo

[Outro]
Oooh hoooooo
Oooh hoooooo
Oooh hoooooo

And I can't, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, noooooooo
No, no I can't stop

Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit it
Oooh hooo, oooh hooo, ooooooooh hooooo
Ooh hoo
Ooooooh... ooooooh hooooo</pre>
