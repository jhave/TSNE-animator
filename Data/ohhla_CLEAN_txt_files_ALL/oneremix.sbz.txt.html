Typed by: Cno Evil

[Chorus 2X: Shabazz the Disciple]
The one who has walked with kings, walks alone
Escaped from the castle, and the desert, became his throne
The one with the hair like wool, and brass tone
Who's always driven forward, by a God, who's unknown

[Shabazz the Disciple]
I stand alone against an empire
With the forces of nature in my favor, brimstone and fire
Behold a hail and all matter of plagues
Kneel before the throne of Allah, and you'll be saved
The prince of my pavillion, appointed shepherd of Ishmael's children
To lead them out of bondage, begin the healing
They shut the door to make a beggar of a king
But watch me scale the wall, and conquer all them underlings
The raven dropped a black feather at your threshold
Cherebums surround the castle, to raise the death toll
You treat your men like they cattle, drib under your lashes
Your final hour when you're cremated, the'll dance on your ashes
My hand's a knob like a slaves, and my back is scarred
But in my heart, burns the spirit of the living God
You thought your place was in the palace halls
Mounted yourself to the sun on golden wings, like you couldn't fall
The most high, I'll smoke your kingdom with all manner of plagues
But still pharaoh's heart was hardened
No matter how many times you get down on your knees and you pray
Your sins'll still never be pardoned

[Chorus 2X]

[Shabazz the Disciple]
All hail to the Christ of this rap shit, your lord or host
They all made in my image and likeness, immortal ghost
The angelic narrator, writing down what God reveals me
Spit in the street tongue, so masses feel me
Thug Eloheim with the halo and the golden wings
Anointed one, who dwells amongst the chosen kings
Allah sent me to your penticle, of royalty
To dwell amongst his mighty enemy, and test my loyalty
You tempt the service with your worldly treasures
Trying to detour them from the path of the gate, to flames beyond measures
Painted deliberetly, the Ramseys betrayed Jehovah
CEO is pharaoh, my staff turned into a cobra
Never before has hip hop ever bare witness to a thug
With such a heavenly tone, spitting relentless
Driven onward, through the cruise of the desert, scorching surface
Where holy men and prophets approach, for God's purpose
Beating down to the dust, for which I came
The one who has arrisen from the sabocal of his slain
It was you who helped me endure all those years of misfortune
And you who shake the rain from the heavens to hail extortion
And you who has whipened them tears when the angels cried
And you who helped me when the industry pierced my side
And you who gave David the rock, to slay Goliath
And you who saved those three men from the burning fire
And you who in the den, saved them from hungry lions
And you who raised the flag of triumph, for his Messiah
The time is now, when the angels sound the trumpets loud
They kendle my anger, behold like cometh with cloud </pre>
