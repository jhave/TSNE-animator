[Chorus: Akon] + (Ashanti)
The way that you're walkin, the way that you're talkin - talkin
You're the one I wanna spend this night with
Tryna get in them drawers and bang it out 'til the mornin  the mornin
(Ahhhhhhh) I can already tell you want it
Cause you're shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin that (body on me)
Keep on shakin it all for me, givin it all to me
Rubbin that (body on me)

[Nelly]
I'm lovin that! Uh, uh
Hey how you doin mama? I need to know your name
You givin me the eye eye, I'm givin you the same
It just hit me right now, what we should do today
Go tell your friends bye-bye, and let's go hop a plane
It's no mistaken, the attraction's ironic
I wanna make you someone more than just a bone in my closet
I wanna win that, type of relationship
Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done tripped
You say you short this month, and you're late on your rent
He took your car, what you mean? Hold this
Yea-yayyy, sing, whoahhhh
You see, lil' mama outta control, and I'm just sayin

[Chorus]

[Nelly]
I'm lovin that!
Shorty movin closer, and closer
And slower, and lower, yeah
I think she know she makin me hard
Got every man in the buildin like, "Oh my God"
She, slicker than lodi-dodi, she work her body body
When you done hurr at the party, meet me down there in the lobby
And I'll be waitin on ya, ain't no debatin on ya
I got a seat for ya, we can let the top back and goooooo
We don't have to stop girl, noooooo
I got a lil' somethin I wanna showwwwww
Believe me, you're strong
Lil' mama please don't make me wait too long (yea-yayyy)

[Chorus]

[Ashanti]
Now I see you're lookin at my body babe
And now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you could you promise me
that you could make it feel like it never did
Cause I see you (I see you) and you see me (you see me)
Now if I please you (I please you) could you please me (you please me)
Now I ain't the one in no relationship
And I ain't tryna be the other chick
I know you want it
