[Crooked I]
Laidback shit
It's Crooked, nigga~!

Yo, everywhere I travel, them Dre haters babble
Them niggaz is afraid, they bleed Minute Maid
Producers so comfortable livin in his shadow
They sip lemonade, chillin in the shade (Hehehe..)
Who's responsible for the sickest instrumentals made? (Dre!)
Who made Ren a +Villian+ and Eminem a +Renegade+? (Dre!)
Now niggaz gettin paid, menaces in the stage
Hittin listeners with explicit sentences in the page (Dre!)
Since N.W.A, we've been that deep
I'm a part of that family, even if I'm the black sheep
'Cause I was signed to the giant of the West coast
The company Dre bulit - yeah nigga, Death Row!
And whoever bought the catalog, get at 'er dog
Don't try to drop my old shit unless I said so! (SAID SO!)
I write rhymes like a helluva thesis 
While Focus... move keyboard keys with telekinesis
It's for the Doc... Th-th-the Doc

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius] {sung in tune of "One Nation Under the Groove"}
Ready or not, here we come
This here's for alllll the ones who don't believe
This time out, we'll show and prove
Nothing can stop us now (now, now, now), ooh-oooohhh-whoa

[Jay Rock]
Dre... brought you 6-4's
808, black khaki suits, Raider caps and AKs'
Dre, put it down for N.W.A
Back in '92, tell me who fuckin with Dre?
Who made it cool to shoot a cop? 
One-eighty-seven on an undercover, remember the record? It was hot!
I was like six, in the bricks, when "The Chronic" dropped
Shit sold out in every momma and poppa shop
Dre, yeah that nigga killin 'em
Sold a lot of records worldwide, who serious?
Dre, I know them haters ain't hearin this
One of the bests on the beats - period!
Dre, who put Compton on the map?
Yeah, and responsible for this gangsta rap
My nigga Dre, been through tribulations and trials
Look at him now, you see the +Aftermath+

[Chorus]

[KIDA]
Yeah, yeah
Man, get it out, we all know that Diggy-Doc started this
The evolution of gangsta rap at its best, kid
And Doc Dre is considered the +Blueprint+
Compton, way before Jay thought of doin it
I never puff but I knew dude's on it
Couple spins later, felt high listenin to "The Chronic"
Far from a dumb, but the gangstas are feelin him
It's Inglewood city, but N.W.A is still in him
Six-fo's switch flat, bumpin Dre in the back
Eighth grade, King Starter jacket, yeah I had that
Gave Snoop came back, put Em on his back
Who was movin units like that? Where these labels at?
Death Row artist, coulda been that, but I passed
Yeah the +Truth Hurts+, so I'm guessin I'm the +Aftermath+
Who else but Doc told you to say EFF whoever
Front if you want, but for "Detox" I'll wait forever!
