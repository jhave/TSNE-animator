[Intro: Masta Killa]
Time to ride..
Yo... yeah..
Lord, when you droppin'?

[Chorus 2X: Masta Killa]
No said date, no said date, no said date
No said date, no said date (Lord, when you dropping?)
No said date, no said date

[Masta Killa]
They said the God wasn't never comin' home
Grandma in a nursin' home, my mind is blown
I'm known to walk alone, but the fam
It's deep, yeah we all love heat
These military arm' marine, sub machine gun
Legend of Brooklyn, master craftsman
Lord, when you droppin'?" No said date
Thought premeditated, well calculated
The air's been tested, the people can't wait
So, ahh -- we agreed to send one, to swim from lost and found
See truth be the life preserve, we can't drown
Drunk with the victory, the Wu cavalry
Bomb the seminar, the last "hoo-ra" for chivalry
Classical, Yo-Yo Ma, laced in the bulletproof fabric
Crafted and mastered in space
What better place of birth than the Earth
When a star is born, but the path was narrow
Float across the Verrazano, stack ya ammo
Hit 'em while we got the muscle, in the streets we hustle
For survival, what the God reign, build me a brain
Support it with a physical frame, imperial Asiatic material
Scratch the serial, smoking him, he gonna need a miracle
repare for burial, it's time, .45 to your head, drop your nine
We came to collect, the debt is overdue yo
Set to connect with Deck, we pushin' through
Yvette with the red Corvette from Lafayette
Pussy stay wet and she hold Tec
Respect to the six, she sexy wit a switch
Gun never stick when 'victions for the brick
Shots lick

[Chorus 2X]

[Masta Killa]
Heh, yo, this is No Said Date
Peace, I'm Jamel Arief, pleasure to meet you
Not to affend you, somethin' for the mental
Straight from the Shaolin Temple, so simple
Ain't enough ink for the thoughts I think
They travel so rapid, it's hard to grasp it
No assumption, Kay Slay get the shit thumpin'
Darts stay lethal, blaze one for the people
They travelled so far to witness
The killin' of a mastermind line-for-line
Half-time, center stage, 50 yard line
Long time, man for dead
Should've been, put one in his head
Before the poison spread to the body
Partly done, 'nough said... {*echoes*}</pre>
