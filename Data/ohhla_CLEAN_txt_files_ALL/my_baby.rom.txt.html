[Lil' Romeo]
They call me Lil' P I represent the CP3
Calliope ya heard me? Straight from New Orleans
I got an uncle named Silkk and an uncle named C
I been dribblin the ball since the age of 3
I got game like Kobe dunkin like Poppa P
Cause I'm in the zone, ain't no stoppin me
Cause you can jump a baby hummer, girls be jockin me
P. Miller wear No Limit Gear from head to feet
It's like that Whodi? (You got me crazy)
It's like that Whodi? (I want to be your lady)
It's like that Whodi? (Why won't you be my baby)
It's like that Whodi? (Can't no girl fade me)
Meet me at the skatin rink

[Chorus]

[Lil' Romeo]
Eleven years old, makin A's and B's
And these little mami's can't keep they hands off me
When you see me in the street, holla "What's up Doc?"
I got a Bugs Bunny chain with a matchin watch
I make ya'll jump like Kris Kross, bounce like Bow
I'm the next generation I came to lock it down
I'm a little boy but I live a big man's life
Got girls passin notes tryin to be my wife
Got grown women, wantin to be in my life
By the time I'm 18 I'm not gon' be nothin nice
I'm that R-O, M-E-O
After high school, I'm goin' straight to the pros (bounce, bounce)

[Chorus]

[Ms. Peaches]
Soldier boy I want you to myself, I don't want them girls around
You're the flyest thing up in here boy and that's why it's goin down
I heard they call you Romeo, well I'm you're Juliet
You must be good at hide and seek, cause boy your hard to get

[Chorus]

[Various people]
Romeo! (fire boys make them elbows swing)
Romeo! (fire boys make them elbows swing
fire girls make them elbows swing)
Fire boys make them elbows swing, Fire girls make them elbows swing
Fire boys make them elbows swing, Fire girls make them elbows swing
Fire boys make them elbows swing, Fire girls make them elbows swing
Romeo boy do that thing, Romeo boy do that thing
Romeo boy do that thing, Romeo boy do that thing
This is for the fire girls that ???
This is for the fire boys that ??? (break it down)
This is for the fire girls that bout it bout it

(haha)

That's all folks! </pre>
