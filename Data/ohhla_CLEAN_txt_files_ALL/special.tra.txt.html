[Hook - Shyna]
You're so, so special
You're so, so special
You're so, so special
You're so, so special

[Verse 1 - Trae]
I woke up early this morning
But all I can think about is what keep me going
And it ain't no denying the fact I gotta ride for the ones who love be showing
July the 3rd you gave birth to the man I'am today
And I probably go insane if life ever took you away
I remember like yesterday you use to be my best friend
No matter what I did you're be right by my side in the end
If you need it I got it ain't no question about it
We struggled all off our life but now it's time I get you about it
Mama I promise to god I ain't never leaving your side
And everytime I see your face you give me the smiling inside
You mean the world to me and ain't nobody gon' jeopardize that
You the main reason I'm alive I can't never forget that
Debra Denise who ever thought that we will get to see this day
Your son been grinding it for years and now we finally on his way
To be something that'll make your proud
I bet we never seen it coming
Plus I got a chance to showing
To a very special woman
Love you ma

[Hook: Shyna]
You're so, so special
You're so, so special

[Verse 2 - Trae]
D'Neeko Deshawn Thompson your daddy be thinking bout you
Like everyday all I know is that I never wanna be without you
Since July the 23rd the day you came to this earth
I finally got a son on my own only the lord know what you worth
I might like get to be around you 50 percent of my time
You better believe every percent of my time you be on my mind
Lil' daddy you some special just like the day that I met you
I'm a be there whenever you call and the time that I'm gon' regret you
I was the first to see you smile and you don't know how much it meant
Can't let nobody take you from me cuz I know you heaven sent
Everytime you make a sound I laugh and look you in your eye
And your ways seem like you fly
And that's a trip it ain't no lie
I can you see rapping like daddy or maybe even playing sports
Either way you gon' be pimp if they don't like it take us to court
Meanwhile I thought I let you know that your daddy appreciate you
From turning my dark to light and it was a blessing I couldn't creat you
