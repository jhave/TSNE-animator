Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Hold up, hold up, hold up
It's the prince of New York, DJ Self, and guess what?
I'm a grow my beard
Not like Santa, like Freeway!
North Philly, West Philly, South Philly
German Town, Campton, what's poppin'?
Brooklyn, what up?
Queens, what up?
Bronx, what up?
Harlem, Staten Island, what up?
Jersey, what up?
You know when New York and Philly connect, it's crazy
Happy holidays to you and yours
Black Santa, nigga
Freeway, I see ya!
Philly Free!</pre>
