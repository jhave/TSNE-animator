You gonna dissect man (roll this shit)
Oh oh oh for the homies, who that?
Yeah, it's Kurupt fool
Live, Dogg Pound
And let all y'all know(know know), we live
Yeah Lurupt the raw dogg
Dogg Pound Gangsta for life
And my own thing, Antra
Check this out, (check it out)

[Kurupt]
One, two to the three
K to the U- R- U- P to the T
Dips and toe back whips
I ain't for competing
I own banks in sweden
I keeps a low profile, I don't floss
Top dogg, fool I'm the boss
Speculative decisions, I'm giving out executive positions
Making my own executive decisions
O.G. lie the only way is supposed to be lie
Simply, its all in me
So when you think about Kurupt just think about Bentleys

[Chorus]
Who do you be, tell me tell me
(that's a nigga
who do you be, tell me tell me
(steady cruisin' with your mind on the cash,
 everything is tight so what you think be the past)

[Kurupt]
Feel the flames, separate terrains
We on the same track on separate trains
I'm all about coasting, locomotion
Sip get lit smooth
Move in slow motion, smooth as lotion
Headed to where the g's reside, ready to ride
I'm a fix it all, twist it all by showing all y'all what's the meaning of all
I'm hyper like a sniper on dope and dynamite
I ignite the stage, like rage, or sawed off gauge
Now all y'all off the stage you be the first one, verse one
Nigga disperse one, and I'm a show you how you get the job done
You cant buy it, the sound encourages riots

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
Yo, I feel a whoo, bars with that whoop de whoop
Coming swoop, chill with Kurupt and the crew
In the back of the pad, but don't get mad, don't get upset
If I have to jab and jet, I gots to go put in, I get it all good in
So don't tweak come back next week,
but when she came back she met a hard fact
Dude that ain't where Kurupt stay at

[Chorus to end]</pre>
