(There's far too many of you dying) --&gt; Marvin Gaye

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
June twenty-eight was the date
Thirty-eight to the chest plate
Mommy dear's cryin at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that every day's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember, G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
Never missin out on a hood fight
Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
It's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt

[ VERSE 2: Bushwick Bill ]
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin was reported on the evenin news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother just can't win
When the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends
Uh, and Bushwick can't sleep
When everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin next to me has snapped a flick
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin all the singin I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into its final song
Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block
And that's deep

[ VERSE 4: Big Mike ]
A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music, so they had to dance
Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it
Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
We used to kick it on the ave at night
Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the clone
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So long, remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive, real partners come together
And you know that</pre>
