Uh huh, wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Uh huh, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It's naughty, very naughty necrophilia
Without a care I'm compassionate about killing her
I'd have my way with what's left of the will in her
Cosmopolitans, and cocaine, and an occasional pill in her
When she spoke I saw a spark, but it was dark so
I drove her home when she died, sexy suicide
Sweet nothings for the numb, you feel where I'm coming from?
Have no fear, everything's fine, my girl parties all the time
Did you hear what I said? With this ring I thee wed
A body in my bed, she was cool when I met her
But I think I like her better dead

The production is progressive, but the reason is retro
The chords are cold-blooded murder, I named it neo-necro
I whispered in her ear to hear an echo, echo-co-co
I keep her - it's cheaper - I love too much to let go
We discussed over dinner how she would die before the day was done
So I've caught her just in time to have a little fun
And you could use a little sun
So scream and holler, run and play
Wish you could die another day
I'm glad to say that I've
Done what I could to revive
My softer side survived
Damn, that shit was all right, when she was alive
Ha ha ha...</pre>
