(Ice Cube)
Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing
To serve needs to my ding-a-ling
I'm a man who loves the one-night stand
Cause after I do ya
Huh I never knew ya
Cause to kick it man it gives me the fits
They wanna lay with they nose under your armpits
Ice Cube won't wait so give it up cow
After we do it you can go home now
I'm a brother with a big long...

(Yo-Yo)
First of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo
When down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no
Yo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in
Niggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in
No, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore
And if that's what you're here for
Exit through the door
There's more
To see of me but you're blind so
Women like me are fading brothers in the 9-0

(Ice Cube)
Ay what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo
I know you like to rap and like to flow so
But when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world
Stay down and play the playground you little girl

(Yo-Yo)
What you're saying I don't consider it as rapping
Cause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening
It never fails I'll always get respect
And you lose so take a rain check

(Ice Cube)
Hell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second
If it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant
And barefoot complaining that your back is aching
Shaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon

(Yo-Yo)
Well you're mistaken
It's not going that far
I make brothers like you play the back yard
You used to flow with the title but I took it
Bring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it

(Ice Cube)
Damn it look it
Cause you're talking a lot of bull

(Yo-Yo)
Well I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull

(Ice Cube)
This is a man's world thank you very much

(Yo-Yo)
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

<break>

(Ice Cube)
Ah Miss Yo-Yo so what gives
I hear females always talkin about women's lib
Well get your own crib
And stay there
Instead of having more babies for the welfare
Cause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger
The name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga
For you to look at when your hair get nappy
So take a piece of the pole and be happy

(Yo-Yo)
Hell no because to me you're not a thriller
You come in the room with your three-inch killer
Thinking you can do damage to my backbone
Leave your child in the yard until it's full-grown
I'm a put it like this my man
Without us your hand would be your best friend
So give us credit like you know you should
If I don't look good you don't look good

(Ice Cube)
I doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant

(Yo-Yo)
But you don't know how funky that I can get

(Ice Cube)
This is a man's world thank you very much

(Yo-Yo)
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

<break>

(Ice Cube)
Man women I put a lot of fear in em
Cause I had it up to here with em
Drink a beer with em
No way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day
Yeah if you know what I mean baby

(Yo-Yo-)
Well I guess now that I think about it I think maybe
If you was more of a man instead of faking it
Women deserve the credit when they're making it

(Ice Cube)
Yeah so what's the problem

(Yo-Yo)
Well I think we solved it
I know they know the best male from who's doggin it

(Ice Cube)
Yeah I admit you can flow

(Yo-Yo)
Well that's true

(Ice Cube)
But you see I'm a pro with the bank too

(Yo-Yo)
Yeah I can see you got it good

(Ice Cube)
Oh that I know

(Yo-Yo)
But you see you're not better than Yo-Yo
The brand-new intelligent black lady

(Ice Cube)
You're kinda dope but you still can't fade me

(Yo-Yo)
So what up then

(Ice Cube)
Girl what you tryin to do

(Yo-Yo)
To prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through

(Ice Cube)
This is a man's world thank you very much

(Yo-Yo)
But it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch

(Ice Cube)
Or a big butt...
