Girls shakin that ass boy (Yeah)
Shakin that ass all in yo lil young face nigga
(Yall know it's on)
Them girls say, "Troy bring another
Pop That Pussy for us"
(Get 'em out them thongs)
D.S.G.G. where y'all at?
(Ain't nothing but some money in here)
Them Down South Georgia Girls
(Yall know it's on)
Get this money right (Get that money right)
Get 'em out them thongs

[Chorus] 2x
She on her hands and her knees and she workin that ass
She on her hands and her knees and she twerkin that
ass
She on her hands and her knees and she shakin that ass
Straight poppin that ass, I mean she droppin that ass

[Verse 1]
Step off in the strip club dead fresh
Right in time for the amateur contest
Go to the DJ give him bout 500 hundred
I got some mo hoe I wanna see how bad you want it
Who is this caramel from the A-T-L?
You know the business, my dick is hard as hell
What you wanna do? Where the V?
Where the after P? What you drinkin B?
Why don't you come and dance for me?
Take it to the ground don't be dancin all nonchalant
You don't wanna dance
You don't wanna hit my fuckin blunt
What you really want is the money, you can tell me
I'm the consumer, what you got to sell me?
I'd rather pay, 'fore you call me everyday
Talking out the way because I won't say
Where I'm at, or what I do
A matter fact Ms. Bree fuck you

[Chorus] 2x

In the V.I.P wit this new chick
They say they call her White, White Chocolate
Greased up from her motherfuckin toes up
Went to poppin that ass, had to tell her hold up
Droppin hundreds, gettin blunted
Cause she super stunted
PT tryin to cut
White Chocolate what's up?
I got the pent house, me and my nigga Red Mouth
Round up yo homegirls and then we all can ride out
Limo at the do', don't go if you playin hoe
Take it to the flo', let me know that you is fo' sho'
I ain't wit the games, spendin change I'm a balla
I'm a act a bitch when I know I ain't gone call her
To all the, niggaz in the club spendin cash
She on hands and knees, she shakin that ass
And shakin it fast, and shakin it faster
Make that ass clap for the motherfuckin Pastor

[Chorus] 2x

Aye yo this joint right here is for all my ladies
(Yall know it's on)
Across the motherfuckin nation
We do this big baby (Get 'em out them thongs)
All the DJ's in the strip club representing
that P-Troy shit (They know it's on)
What's up baby we doing this thang big
(Get 'em out them thongs)
What's up Cacky Lac, what's up Charlotte
Ga in this motherfucker, Ga in this motherfucker
Gentlemen's club, Boom Boom Room, Boom Boom Room
All the strip clubs drop this motherfuckin blaze
Crank this shit up, Let's get paid
It's going down in a major way
What's up TD, what's up Royal, what's up Drama Boy
Where they at? Let's ride y'all, let's ride
Man it's 4 o'clock in the motherfucking morning
It's 4 o'clock in the damn morning
I'm drunk as hell, let's go
Take me home</pre>
