[Juvenile]
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
They calling me back telling they want another chance
Nigga gonna go ask the girl, am I right
Nigga gonna go ask the girl, am I right
Nigga gonna go ask the girl, am I right

I met a freak from uptown
Talking saying I was young
And she could give me spun for tounge
Welcome to the home of the G-ing men
Had to figure out my uptown friends
Welcome to the home of the G-ing men
Had to figure out my uptown friends

[Juvenile]
Thought I was a dummy
Thought I was a young fool
And then they didn't believe it was little Juv
Then the thing I did made you change your mind
Like freak named Sharon
Said she was big and fun
But guess what yo, I geed her
I see you murder too much energy
So does Gia
I see you murder too much energy
So does Gia
I see you murder too much energy
So does Gia
I say to my nigga house and he Gia
Went back uptown, burned like a heater

[Juvenile]
For one evening
A quarter after three
Twinkle my goal
And put on some clothes
And that might have been for real
Now don't be sweatin
Just give him the praise
Arguing cause I'm thuggin again
I make a visit every day
And I be swurving
And fellas that he bout
After I smoke the weed
That I need
And weaking cause I'm pleading one more right now
I see all them ladies
Over and over again
You can bet that my magnolia
Is like I told ya
To keep the G in me

[Juvenile]
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
Pick a little rocker, she's a nasty little girl
Pick a little rocker, she's a nasty little girl
I had dump in this playa world
Drop your draws and come over here stick ya
And she could jack me a little quicker
Drop your draws and come over here stick ya
And she could jack me a little quicker

[Juvenile]
Oh no baby, oh no baby
Trying to jump around, but they just can't fake me
Oh no baby, oh no baby
Trying to jump around, but they just can't fake me
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
Talking for the freaks and the girls getting they're blocks up
They calling me back telling they want another chance
Come back and let me rape ya
They calling me back telling they want another chance
Come back and let me rape ya</pre>
