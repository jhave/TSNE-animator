[Verse 1]
I'm doper than a Bobby Brown piss test
Bitches blow me till they ain't got no spit left
Do it movin' cause slow niggaz get left
Get left and miss the game like a sick ref
A quick left and a overhand right
A fat .44, some doja and a mic
Are my weapons, of mass destruction
And detectives know not to ask me nothin'
I'm silent, I might speak to garlic
Drink dirty martinis with the Spanish olive
Garlic and cheese on my french bread
Swallow it please when I get head
I'm pimp fed, girls feed me well
Never would they let the world see me fail
They bring me mail, like I'm a mailbox
A pimp with no gators, Air Force and Shell Tops

[Beat Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Back in the day I used to need the knots
Posted at the spot I used to bleed the block
Servin' weed and rocks often even hop
Never leavin' the spot, wouldn't even leave for cot
If I needed some cot I made hutch come through
Go deep when she bend over, hut 1-2
What you wan do with rude boy like me
Quick to come through with crew so hyphy
If she don't like me she must be a lesbo
I get it nightly, man that's my schedule
Dre Bledsoe, I'm the quarterback
Whatever cost the most, I'm a order that
Across the border strapped my essas
Come through with fluff from Peru
I come from a crew
Of cutthoats, bank robbers, and dope dealers
It's business with us nigga get out yo feelin's
Get out yo scrillin's, live like a king
Take the top off the Heem, pop you a thing
I don't buss them in half, it leave a nasty taste
I swallow them hole, and get the Thizz face
It's laced, with nothin' but game
I steal them from niggaz, that be cuffin' they dame
I'm fuckin' his main, while he gettin' his grind on
Get bossed, get costed, get paid than I'm gone
My tone, is loud sometimes
I scream at a bitch, like she a crowd sometimes
Tell her a thousand times, hoe goe make it happen
It consequences, if she don't make it happen
I'm trying to find them bitches, that's dough paper havin'
Only into one thing that's more paper havin'
You no paper havin', niggaz is bootsy
All at the function in that Chinamen Gucci
Tryin' to coochie, you wine and dine chicks
Goin' for it, fallin' for mind tricks
I tryin' to find chicks, that know the requirements
And works towards a pimp's early retirement
