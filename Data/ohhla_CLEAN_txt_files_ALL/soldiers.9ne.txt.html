(Tech N9ne)
H.I.G.H.L.A.N.D. Highland nigga
Heartless Insane Ghetto Hoodlum Livin' And Never Dyin'
That's what I'm talkin' about
Rogue dawgs, when I call my Rogue dawgs
Rogue Dawg, niggaz
Fa the nine-eight
We'll have to crash 'em like this nigga, yeah

[chorus]
My nigga my nigga we soldiers at war
Killin' off our enemies 'til it ain't no more
Laws we break yo' shit we'll take
Murder fo them bustas and hatas it ain't no escape
Rogue Dawg fo life!

(Don Juan)
It's the beginin of the endin fo yo ass
You broke ass niggaz hit the strip we need mo cash
This midwest side hittin' like a M-1 time to get some
Payback fo you bustas that laid back
My gats ain't met yo next so fuck yo vest we dumpin'
Killin' all that punk shit that you heart be pumpin'
See somethin' I take it cuttin' through the red tape
Yo legs break tryin' to catch up who who led the race
It's 5-7 Highas heaven causin' insanity
Whatcha handin' me we'll have you bitch ass postin' the vanity ??s
Gotta recoop fuckin' with these troops
Soon as we see you Load up and we shoot on site
We turnin' out the lights my appetite for destruction
Got me in the mood for bustin' dumpin' accross the Missou
And get to huntin' for Kevin East the oo-oo
And nigga you knew the Rogue Dawgs rule!
Your so called truths get battered and bruised
Stackin' you fools so deadly it don't matter the tools
I'm afta my dues prove if you snooze you looze
Prepare for war when you fuckin' wit my crew
Rogue for life!

[chorus]

(Scoob Nitty)
265 lbs. all nigga
And I'm good wit these dawgs nigga
Got steel plated balls nigga
Representin' 57th street
Me and my Dawgs bringin' the heat
Born and raised to be a villain on these Kansas City streets
Best retreat when you hear my dogs barkin
Snarlin' got that blood boilin'
Midwest side carved in hangin' out the chevy now we blastin' and laughin'
Made to hit me smashin' on them bastards
Don't be talkin' when they ask you shit got drastic on that bastard
Left him fo the cats that sent them straight to hell
Just like hosts of veil another soldier's tale
Nigga the life of a coward was taken when we bailed

(L.V.)
Look I swore to die for bloodline more heartless than my father brought (nigga)
Load the cartridges with hollow point hard ones
When Rogue dawgs call it's an all out war move
56 marks it 'cause 56 swore to
Heartless insaine ghetto hoodlum livin and never dyin'
Midwest side until my last breath on highland
Why should I lie? I live an die for my side
Ride the city 'til they roll with diddy one last time
Let this N9ne yell out fuckem
Fuck 'em if he's gon walk he's nothin'
Fuck where he's from he'll even run when I'm comin'
Rogue dawg fo life no fear of death no mo
I swore to live a life a soldier at war
Rogue dawg fo life!

[Chorus]

(Don Juan)
Are you afraid of the unknown brains get blown
Expose chrome to your dome 'til you stiff as stone
With the phone neva suck it I'm goin'
In the pockets and blowin muthafuckas to smitherines
You knowin' that it ain't no niggaz stickin' me like K-do
Be warned I'm able to explode like a volcano
On y'all we told y'all we Rogue Dawgs
We know y'all this one is Hong Kong
Fo' you bustas and hatas we (gotta make that paper)
Can't break us then take us I'll peel you like a potato
Nigga wait a minute got me bustin' like a lieutenant
My intent is to eliminate you cynics
Rogue Fo' Life!!

(Tech N9ne)
These young niggaz always yellin' about ridin'
But these bustas ain't no muthafuckin' ridas
I pumpst a cock up in they bitch and then I'm slidin'
These wannabe hustlas can't compare to midwest sidas
I'm rollin' deep wit my troopas fixin'ta expose the chrome
Detrimental to domes though ozone
Thousands of bodies bein' found around me
Bottles of bud and double-U-double E-D
N9ne milla rhyme killa
Fuck wit me I'll take that bust of myron D
And throw 'em to mah Dawgs in the red sea
Now lets see if he can swim back to shore
Chunks missin' yellin' I don't wanna mess wit tech no more
I know you don't Tech N9ne I never say it again nigga
I know you won't never will these niggaz lit on my friend
And mista scare crow bitch nigga you ain't got to lie
You just a scared ho Nigga this is highland 'til we die
We got the triple life coast to roll wit Rogue Dawg shit
Bitches and niggaz all on the balls when it hit
I neva could understand how a nigga could come so whack
What? Oh I ain't talkin about me I'm talkin' about them other cats
Troopa!

[Chorus]

My nigga my nigga we soldiers at war
Killin' off our enemies 'til it ain't no more!</pre>
