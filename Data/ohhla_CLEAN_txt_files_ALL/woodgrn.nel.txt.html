Come over baby, come over here, sit down sit down

And I wanna share them with you right now, y'knahmsayin?
Now later but now you understand me baby?
Umm, I wanna talk to you cause I..
I wanna change your whole way of thinking baby y'knahmsayin?
Not-not for my benefit baby, but for your benefit
YaseewhatI'msayin baby?

[Nelly]
Yo, I wanna explain somethin to all the, squares out there
Uhh, they may not know what 24, woodgrain and leather with a hole is
24 inches or twenty-four inch rims in diameter
Woodgrain is the type of material that goes like on the dashboard or your doors
Leather is like your seats
And the hole is what they call a sunroof
Or maybe a three-way power hole

[Chorus: Nelly]
We ride - 24's or better, woodgrain or leather, with a hole
That's all I know, I knowwwww
Plus - 15's in the trunk (trunk) system ain't no punk (punk)
Listen to it bump (boom boom) and there she blows
(There she blows!)
She bloo-oo-ooows

[Nelly]
I like to slide through the park (park) slightly after dark (dark)
Grab my lighter spark (woo!) up my, hydroohhhhhh
-- You know when I'm ridin I like to lay back and (hydroohhhhhh)

My foot slightly on the gas (gas) my system on blast (blast)
I'm spikin on some - (ooh!) and yeah, she knowwwws

-- She knows
Who got the fire (fire) her word desire (desire)
I'm not for hire (oh no) but you, can goooooooo
-- You know you more than welcome to go ma (can goooo)
-- C'mon
Straight back to my place (my place) haste make waste (waste)
And you don't have to wait (no you don't girl) oh no you donnnnn't

[Chorus]

The block beaters (and) riding around with all those treeeeees

Now what I want you to do right here is I want you to
Unravel that cigarallo or, open up that wrapper
Pull out them Zigs and the Zags and the Zags and the Zigs
And I want you to, take your time and be one with the road
