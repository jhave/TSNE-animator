[Esham]
Way back in the day,in 1987
People used to say I wouldn't make it to heaven
1987 was the year of the trick
Muthafuckas talkin shit cause they was illegit
I used to hang out at the park and kick it with the fellas
Behind my back they talkin shit just because their jealous
Niggas used to diss me sayin I was a sucka
But that girl you all in love with....I fucked her
Nigga be dissin me but he can't see
He takin care of a bitch who baby look like me
But I can't tell him nothin,he'll think that I'm jealous
I got more bitches holdin on my dick than Perry Ellis
Nigga didn't know what I was all about
I got cold dissed when I was down and out
Before you called me a sucka and now you wanna be down
When I was broke you wasn't comin around
Now people give me my props all over town
But niggas like you still dyin to be down

[chorus]

Dyin to be down means simply this
You don't jock a nigga that you already dissed
And when you start jockin him then he's knowin
You're nothin but a sucka punk ass hoe and
A pussy ass nigga jumpin on the bandwagon
You'll get kicked in your ass like the last dragon
D-y-i-n-g to be d-o-w-n my friend
No way that we could ever be cool
I'm takin all punk ass niggas to school
But, school is out and there's no doubt in my mind
You wouldn't set me up or drop a dime
Once a punk ass nigga always one
And you been a punk ass nigga in more ways than one
Except you keep comin around cuz niggas like you ain't down
You're dyin to be down

[chorus]
How can I be down is all I hear
But fuck Esham was the slogan last year
Now you got a new one,thinkin you gon' do one
Go put a dick in your booty and screw one
Cause you can't screw me
I don't care if you boo me
But in my face I won't allow you to do me
To be down or not to be down is the question
You'll never be down so don't come around
Dreamin to be down
Schemin to be down
Like Captain Kirk I'll be beamin your black ass down
Ain't no ifs,ands or buts or maybes
You're like a dog with rabies who tried to play me
But you can't fade me so how that sound
You're just another punk nigga...dyin to be down</pre>
