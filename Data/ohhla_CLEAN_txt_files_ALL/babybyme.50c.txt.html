Have a baby 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire 
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire

[Chorus: Ne-Yo] 
I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see waht I mean, come come come

[Verse One: 50 Cent] 
First it's her neck, yeah then her back 
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that 
Girl I perform for ya, like a porno star 
Till ya had enough then I just need a little bit more 
New music new move new position 
New erotic sounds is goin down now listen 
I can hear your heartbeat, you're sweatin I can paint a perfect picture 
I get deeper and deeper,  I told ya I'll get ya 
I work that murk that just the way ya like it baby 
Turn a quickie into an all nighter maybe 
Your sex drive it match my sex drive 
Then we be movin as fast as a NASCAR ride 
Switch gears slow down, go down whoa now 
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate 
I'll use my tongue baby, I'll leave you sprung baby 
I'll have ya head spinnin sayin 50 so crazy 

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Girl I want you to give me what you got and give me more
Girl you can start on top or on fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennesey thug
Passion, ya laughin, I can make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty, that's what I'ma get ya
Yeah, I need you to be what I need, more than liquor or weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin this so you know what I need 
I'd be a part-time or full-time lovers, a meant-to-be lover 
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutta 
Girl you could get it however you wan' get it 
I'm feelin you, still feelin you right now, get it

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thang (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, owww (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean
