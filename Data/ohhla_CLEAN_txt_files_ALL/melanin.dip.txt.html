Should I do what they gave me, took it and never admit
I invented the flow, yup, they different between us
Emergency come, like a different nigga
Different strokes, for different folks, shit I ain't tryin'
To come up short, let on, let it all
Or will it just blow, like it did to coke
Not me, some of us get rich, but now you dissin', the rich niggaz is broke
The government, shit they make us sniff' coke
Instead of embracin' us, fuck savin' us, thinking what's ya throat
I'm hearin' ya guns in ya hood, what the fuck you think
How can one another --- get ya stoned and then some weed
Just go, eight children broke, the statistics, every three hours
A brother is smoked, a baby is killed, a sister is raped
Somebody mother, strangled under that dope
Just get up and say, here, get up and pray
Tomorrow and promise, so I live for the day, just for hip hop
I need all, but tell ya rappers to come back, yea
We work too hard, to give us away, evicted my age
I can't grow up, like Eazy-E, a victim of AIDS
Being black is crime, I done worked, a nine to five
For three years, and they still, ain't give me a raise
Shit give me a gauge, fuck a mininum wage
Get in a helicopter, look down, shit we live in a maze
The day go fast, when ya broke, but it seems like
The minute you pay, the sun, never set
I don't sleep, cuz sleep is the cousin of death
So I wake up, my brother, my cousins, and uncle's that's def, yes

*talking*

After the war, there's casualties, I stood the art
They give us roaches and batteries, and blow you apart
Peon, procrastinate, to assassinate under the smart
Be brave, in the Wizard of Oz, they build you a heart, get some courage
Or get you the light, most flow in the dark, won't get discouraged
I'm on the one way trip to heaven, forget the luggage
Just in pain, it's making me weak, it's making me sluggish
Besides me, hogging up my THC
In my hood, everybody got a PHD
I count on my fingers, how many niggaz got a GED
My life done work more, than TV, and the DVD
Fuck a CD, I wanna be free, money for free
I'm like a cat, caught in the tree, ok, I need help
Why do I do for others, when I know, that you ain't do shit for me
You be there when you need me, they collapse
Under the real woods, in me, if I need, another match
I chuckled, pool game, goodie mob, goodie help
Coke kid, frankly, GNC, respect yes
My brother Kenny, I will pay you back, forever you help me
I got the many mentions, it's yours, nigga the key to the drawers
So I work out, try to keep my endurance
We lips, looked out, when that nigga needed insurance
Lift it, G to E-N-T, Miss Pam, fuck feedin missy
I can cut down, for going to college, believing in me
I love you girl, you mean the world to me</pre>
