[Verse 1]
She love the way I walk, she love the way I smell
Whats that colonge he got on platinum Chanel
My pimpin from paper powerful I can never fail
Its product in private over pussy I shall prevail
Look here partna all I do is holla and then she yell
You get dollas they pay for rooms in Ramada hotel
I call her Monica she call me President-chi-el
She a dyme when I flip up its either head or tail
You need to watch yo gal just like you watch yo mail
She steady givin head shots and homie you can't tell
She my personal head doctor she proper as hell
Keep it on the D L
She neva kiss and tell

[Hook]
Drop the top for the sex appeal
Three screens, leather, wood its all over the wheel
Twenty inch chrome rubbers go along wit the grill
The smallest thing in my jeans is a benjamin bill

[Verse 2]
I gotta broad name Jenny, she love to wear that Fendy
My little mama Donna love wearin Dolce Gabbana
I gotta cutie wit some good coochie who love dat Gucci
Got one wit a big booty dat don't wear nothin but Louie
Coco love dat Minolo
Nicky she love dat Vicky
Tammy don't wear no panties, Annie is so sidity
Keisha got some big titties but ha attitude is shitty
Mary pretty but act like Carrie from Sex in the City
Mona smoke marijuana
Missy like sippin Crissy
Dora got an explorer
Tricy wear Bc Bg
Got one in ATL big, fine, thick as hell
Got one in BKNY dat only wear DKNY
An Norma Jean (Norma Jean) in New Orleans
One in H-Town wit ha face down Yow mean?
Have you ever seen a nigga ride this clean?
On the leather rip the wood grain diamond pinky ring
Melanie caught a felony
Trina caught a misdimeanor
An since they skipped they court date "Man I ain't seen her"
Got a bad ass white bitch she drive a black beemer
I don't give that cracka nothin and she givin all her cream up
I'MA PIMP!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now when I'm ridin down the avenue these bitches give me attitude
They screamin "Ray we mad at you," pimping's in my veins hoe
Hit dat track, catch a date, bring my scraps, don't be late
To slap you I won't hesitate, pimping's in my veins hoe
Ridin down the avenue these bitches give me attitude
They screamin "Ray we mad at you," pimping's in my veins hoe
Hit dat track, catch a date, bring my scraps, don't be late
To slap you I won't hesitate, pimping's in my veins hoe

[Hook]

Shake somethin

[Repeat]
