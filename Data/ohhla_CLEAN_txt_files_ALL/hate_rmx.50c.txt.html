[50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh..

Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, "Check check out +My Melody+"
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggaz had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (The Game)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[The Game]
I told Dre from the gate "I'd carry the heat for ya"
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin "Free Yayo!"
So niggaz better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C.
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Lloyd Banks)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

[Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggaz do a lot of slick talkin
in the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an Auggie shirt and my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin; holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Tony Yayo)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin +Easy Jesus+, rockin a leases
My momma wit me when she found my pieces
I look back on life, thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout I'm born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent] + (Young Buck)
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP)
(And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me)</pre>
