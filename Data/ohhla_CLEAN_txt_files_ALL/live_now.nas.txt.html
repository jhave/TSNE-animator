[Chorus]
Live now niggaz, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

[Chorus]

[Scarlett]
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now

[Chorus: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

[Scarlett]
Son, come close, lemme talk to you
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it
Look out for little me, one</pre>
