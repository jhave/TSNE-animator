[Intro]
Man
I've got so much love inside of me
It's like I'm gonna burst
So I just wanna let a few people know
That I love them too

[Verse 1]
Here's a shout out, to my good friend Bryan
Best guy you'll ever meet in your life and I ain't lyin'
A shout out to my homeboy Jonsie
I consider you practically a brother to me
And a shout out, to my friend Donny Rose
He's a local superstar, a man that everybody knows
And a shout out, to my boy G-Money
I don't think there's a person alive that is as funny
A shout out, to my man Pierre
Who wrote the tag Zero One across the city every where
And a shout out, to my old pal Jib
This friendship's been going on since we were little kids
And a big shout out to my girlfriend Jamie
Cuz' every time I'm with you, trust me baby it's amazing
A shout out to everybody with their hands up
Let's stay positive and make this whole world stand up

[Chorus]
To all those of you who have left an impact
On the person I am, and the place where I'm at
I do appreciate it and I'll let you know that
I want y'all to feel me while I'm touchin' you back
I'm touchin' you back
I'm touchin' you back
I'm touchin' you back
Yeah I want y'all to feel me while I'm touchin' you back

[Verse 2]
Here's a shout out to my man the Owl of Snow
One of the greatest true artists, you'll probably ever know
And a shout out, to my homey D-Ray
Who's got the talent and the heart to take his music all the way
And a shout out to my deejay Sawtay
For always feeding us when we rehearse at your place
And shout outs, to the rest of the crew
Harper, Charlie, and Bath, I ain't forget about you
And a shout out, to some producers I've worked with
Classified, DJ Kemo, and Mercilless
And a shout out to everyone from Heads Connect
We ain't never gonna stop 'til Canada gets some respect
And a shout out, to all the towns we've performed at
and woken up drunk outside on someone's doorstep
Shout outs to those trying to make a difference
It's time to spread noise 'til the whole world listens

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Here's a shout out, to my girl Becki
We'll see you down under on an Australian beach
And a shout out to Nick and Matt Doylie
Who helped us get to Asia, where they treated us like royalty
Shout outs to Jayar and Shakir
In Daytona Beach we probably each drank a hundred beers
And a shout out to those cats in Mexico
Who when I almost got deported talked my ass out of a hole
And a shout out to all my ex girlfriends
For better or worse, you helped me be a better man
And a shout out to all the die hard fans
Writing me emails from California to Japan
Shout outs to Gary for being the one
Who taught me how to throw a football back when I was young
And a shout out, to my dad Oliver
I'm really glad that I have you as a Father
And a shout out with all respect to my Mother
You're my best friend, and you know I'll always love ya
Shout outs to everybody in my heart
Every single one of you, represents a different part

[Chorus]
To all those of you who have left an impact
On the person I am, and the place where I'm at
I do appreciate it and I'll let you know that
I want y'all to feel me while I'm touchin' you back
