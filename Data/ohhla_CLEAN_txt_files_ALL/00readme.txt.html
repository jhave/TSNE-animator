There are two different versions of The Genius' LP _Words From the
Genius_.  Each has fifteen songs, but the first song on each album is
different, as is the track order -- hence the reason for sixteen songs
in this folder despite there only being fifteen songs on your album.
Here is the order of songs on the original version, and on the reissue:
