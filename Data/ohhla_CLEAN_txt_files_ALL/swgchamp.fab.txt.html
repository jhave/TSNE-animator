Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[repeat 3X]
Now I don't jerk off in public, but I been out-doin my self
Undisputed swag champ, that big H be my belt

[Fabolous]
Fresh pair of them Jordan 3's, all black G Vanci
That snapback with that snake skin, you niggaz gotta see Don C
Motherfucker we rollin, some brown skin girls, and some Beyonces
Ball like this, you gon see the kind of hate LeBron see
Pop a band, throw a bill up, them strippers call me Chauncey
Look so cool, in my leather jacket, they should be callin me Fonzi
But I ain't got my collar up, I just got my dollars up
Big fish see little fish, and you little niggaz get swallowed up
Shouldn't of been in this shark tank, ain't my fault if I eat them
Why would I wanna join them, when I always knew I could beat them
Keep a foot on they neck, fresh pair of them weak Timb's
Ain't no love in hip-hop, but still let you eat 'em
Came for the competition, but there wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring but you'll never touch the crown

[Chorus]
Swag champ I got the belt, swag champ I got the belt
When it's done come talk to me; you'll see I got the B
B is for them big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't got to spend they own money

I said

[repeat Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Now I ain't come here to be playing, showtime expect me out
That hotel, that newest shit, ya I see em tryna check me out
That new chain just came in, guess what, my neck be out
Funny I be goin innn, everytime they let me out
Ran thru that Louis store, once I blow that, check me out
Threw me 2 tees, felt like they was tryin to take me out
No discrimination, I will still sweat your sexy out
Like them with that Keisha ass, but gotta have that Becky mouth
Rep my town but I'm hardly here, gotta go in when I party here
Drinks so strong, I can barely lift 'em; weed so loud, I could hardly hear
Love the way that track suit lay on those shell toes
Money talks, you ain't got it, convo, hell noo
Stick to bein you boy, stay on yo', Velcro
Hate to see yall been backwards, Rondo, elbow
Came for the competition but it wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring, but you'll never touch the crown

[Chorus]
