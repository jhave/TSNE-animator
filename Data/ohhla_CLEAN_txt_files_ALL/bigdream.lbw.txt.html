"It's not - It's not me exactly, who touches people
It's what I represent, the possibility that dreams long ago
May still come true, even if they - even-even-even if they look lost forever"

[Bow Wow]
I had a homey named Tony, sixteen, six two
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time, he was in love with the block
All the stuff that came wit it, the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slang and all the funds
He just got a letter of contempt from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love him and they wish he was there
He had +it made+ like +Special Ed+, about to get the bread
But chose, to do, sumthin' dumb instead
Go to war with the crew on the other side of town
and was mo' ready, and Tony got laid down
He ain't even have a chance
Died before the ambulance, even got to him
So many went through him
I hate to tell the story, but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid

[Chorus]
When you got big dreams, don't listen to what nobody say
and don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
Don't listen to what nobody say and don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky ("even-even if they look lost forever")

I knew this girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer
and everybody fell in love with her when they seen her
Baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal
Eighteen, and life looked so-so real
She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
and all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga, do for a nigga
Pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
One night he came, picked her up told her, "let's ride!"
That's the same night that he watched her die!
They was tryna hit a lick, but the lick hit back
Put a end to the deal, and all of that
She ain't even have to be there, he know it wha'nt right
Now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life
and the part I don't like, he ain't even get graze
but homegirl, Gina, is layin' in the grave

[Chorus]

I got a few relatives given family drama
Always got they hands out when they see me and my momma
One coulda been a doctor, the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen, he was cookin' sumthin' else
Now his life in the drain, a triflin' shame
He all washed up, wife took e'rything
No car, no mo', no HOUSE
and everywhere he go, he stole, so they throwed him out
I was growin' up, lookin' up to be like them
Now I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the Bent
I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty
I be DAMNED if I let another man support me, now
Uncle Junebug's sick, skinny as hell
He got AIDS in his body from the needles he shared
E'rytime he get his welfare checks, he don't care
You wanna see him go to the crack house, he there

[Chorus]

When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams ("even-even if they look lost forever")
When you got big dreams
When you got big dreams, keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the waste side, reach for the sky
("even-even-even if they look lost forever")</pre>
