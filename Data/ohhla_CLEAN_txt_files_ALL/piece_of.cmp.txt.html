Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I know your patience short of that bull
But let me holla at you for a minute
Picture us on sunset
With that passengers side with you in it
Hair blowing in the wind
Carefree from your issues
The ex man he a fool
I know he mad that he dissed you
Now you moved on to the next chapter
Trynna figure out what's next
One hood girl with an education
She made it out the projects
Can't steer her wrong
Cause she got her own
And she all about that check
And I fuck with that
Oh, yeah I fuck with that
So what you say?
You can come my way
It will be okay
Your delay, we can make that play
I can tell you wanna stay
But that's on you
I'm a hunnit band move
I know you think that's cool
But you got your own
So you not impressed
Oh, we can't lose

I know you know I know
I know you know I know
I know you know I know
I know you know I know

And she gone stride to be the best
That's what I love her for
And she gone hold a nigga down
What would I do without her?
College girl with ambitions
Boy that's out this world
She be workin' hard
Yeah, you that girl
Don't let them tell you different
Go out and make that paper
And she gone get her own
Don't need no savior
If it's workin' from 9 to 5
Or dancin' on that pool

I won't judge her
I won't judge her
I won't judge her, no

Let that money stay
You deserve it girl
And at night you in them books
Oh, you perfect girl
In this crazy world they wanna see you fail
But her head on straight
So she will prevail
You can't tell

I know you know I know
I know you know I know
I know you know I know
I know you know I know</pre>
