Album:  J.A.C. EP 
Song:   Trials and Tribulations 
Typed by: bodyrott@fut.net 
 
Crib notes fell out of your pocket, speedwalking from lost battles 
Your soul fled the spot, but physical caught in shackles 
Poison in your apple, turn your princess to my mistress 
Verbal fitness landing where my fist is 
Your only witness was blinded with alert 
With the verse I make the world orbit in reverse 
You run fast when your eyes catch me taking off my pen cap 
Drill a hole in your middle and place your skin on a coat rack 
Release spit fire, unleash causes decease 
Cut out your own Adam's Apple and feed it to Eve 
As MC, Im reaching higher than THC 
Blood levels in devils and crack fiends on drug scenes 
Chattering knees slowly collapse as you rest 
You freezing at 90 degrees, but see me in sweat 
Your skills are in debt by my presence you start stuttering 
Use your last breath and say Instingt while muttering 
 
* Hook * (X2) 
I try, but I fail, and times will prevail 
all my problems through the Trials and Tribulations 
Situations tell the tail, but I'm tipping the scale, 
bidding farewell to all the Trials and Tribulations 
 
My manifestation be the cause of cancellation, underachievers be facing 
The penetration, while the impatient begins their pacing 
On a daily basis, "Style", I'm hearing basics, "While" 
You keep rehearsing your versatile sound, 
I'm stomping through the underground 
At profound speeds, 
leaving the quaterbacks receiving sacks when the present MC lacks 
The opportunity to lock shit down like Steve Sax, 
your third eye gets cataracts when my forth eye attacks 
"Your counteracts" Cause you're bound to be wack, 
and I'm talently stacked 
Imitations be changing when I challenge three packs 
"The wannabee macks" 
Split chromosones while my ribosomes 
Attack immune systems with tighter grips to hold their own 
Radiation's be blazing, damaging ozones 
And I'm not just saying I'm the illest, I'll carve it in stone 
To prolong my stay at home, then my dome 
Leaves my follicles thrown, 
when my knowledge is grown from parts unknown, the...
Spectators be impressed, therfore my celly gets stressed 
With reputations like Elliot Ness, 
relieved by bunning the non-delicate cess, 
travelling throughout my chest 
Unravelling talent within 
Distracting my vision 
Taking control of my system, not double digits, 
I kicked 187 words of wisdom 
So check the message I'm listing 
Styles are persistent, 
lines keep a crowd vibrating during the intermission 
While the other acts are switching 
My coalition will cold crush ya', microphone touchers 
Kicking straight lyrics while you're bisexual like Usher 
Then we'll rush ya', eliminating wackness from the T dot 
And my rhymes are so sick my mic needs a Hepatitis B shot...cause
