Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
I'mma mack, on this ho, one time
Mack on this motherfucking ho one time
I'mma mack, on this ho, one time
Mack on this motherfucking ho one time, ay
If you a pimp, break a bitch
See, I'mma mack, on this ho, one time
If you a pimp, break a bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
I see you looking, what you looking at?
All out of pocket, ho, I'm taking that
You know the life? Bitch, I'm living that
Now do that 100 yard dash and run that money back
I see potential, yeah, you full of that
Be my employee of the week, make a hundred racks
I'm in the Benz, fuck a 'Lac
Space age pimpin', know you heard of that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Ah! She want a nigga like a Birkin purse
Fuck it like it's my last pussy on the universe
Give you that work, she give me checks like it's every first
Of the month, I got liquor for these bitches' thirst
Put you on stars, you'll be shinin' in your turf
My nigga told me bout ya, had to see what you was worth
That pussy come a dime a dozen, you'll be mine, you know it
Why he got you working? I could benefit you further
You know that Lambo, broke-poof, lame niggas, ain't no
Competition when I'm spittin' game that could break hoes
Hoes gotta bow in my presence for survival
Mindfreak, no Criss Angel up in this flow
Real magic, make a dollar touch to her ankles
My bitch'll take a train, bus for this dick though
Fall asleep when I bust, blowin' kush bowls
Got another bitch comin', so hit the back door, bitch, you know

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: YG]
I'm a mack, baby, spin that crack, baby
Too much money, I'll never fuck a fat lady
Now, that's a fact, baby, sit on my lap, baby
You know the motto: bust a nut then take a nap, baby
You know the motto: if you come through, fuck a nigga
She keep bringing up her boyfriend, I'm like "fuck yo' nigga"
(Hold up!) Ooh, you nasty
Do I like it from the back? That's what she asked me (yep)
What you know about suntans from Blood niggas?
Dressed in all black like Catholic nun niggas
What you know about that Porsche plus that hundred racks?
My old bitch mad, she ain't getting none of that!
Dick don't fail me now, I gotta turn this bitch out
Cause, if I beat that pussy up...
She gon' give me everything in her bank account (400!)

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lil Twist]
If you a pimp, break a bitch
See, I'mma mack on this motherfucking ho one time, ay [x2]
See, I'mma mack on this motherfucking ho one time</pre>
