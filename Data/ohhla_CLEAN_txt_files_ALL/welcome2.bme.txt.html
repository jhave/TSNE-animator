[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah (yeah)
Told you we'd be back (told you we'd be back)
Welcome to hell (welcome to hell)

[Eminem]
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirtin a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off!
Other words, I ain't put a dent in the game 
compared to the damage I have yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt
I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
Long as I got two balls to palm
I'll be the bomb, you just a false alarm
Get scant little pissants 
and see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet 
with a tornado's the kind of brain storm I get
So when wind starts blowin shit
Talk about goin in? Goin insane's more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it 
like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast or miss it
Yeah go ahead little prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick ass explicit 
flow don't ask how much of his passion is it
that goes in it, just know that all he knows is that 
it's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity unmatched, it has to be
stopped but it can't be, but man I can't just keep 
doin 'em like that or no one'll rap with me (yeah)
Except one, you ask who is it?

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches?
With the ratchet, the Book of Mathew
A book of matches lightin 'em under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, ask you to spit it
And you got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gon' laugh when you goin to the bathroom wit it
Now with what would you come against us? Better be
somethin, with a Bigfoot pedigree
Easily these are the reasons 
that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds them MC's that wanna be them 
what means that they wanna breathe our air
With these ideas
Anybody thinkin the game don't need, the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like sayin that the bad boy Piston team didn't need Isaiah

[Eminem]
Shit piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MC's, I swear
Better beware there's too much at stake/steak 
and to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and eat shit stains 
out my underwear that, I don't even wear

[Royce Da 5'9"]
It's gotta be no fair
It's like hittin the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy yo' hair
Classic, smash it, smother it
Read it and weep then perhaps you will have no rebuttal in
fact you seein me in this rappin 
is like sayin Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan

[Eminem]
Back to bash your skull again
Push a bitch out the Aspen and tell her 
"Get the fuck outta Dodge" (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than, color books that ain't colored in
Second and third fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than 
Bad and Evil, also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time 
but I bet that neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fuckin shit up on a dime, so tellin us to pipe down's
like talkin to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fightin it while he's watchin internet porn 
'bout to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is 
David Carradine jackin his penis in front of his tripod
Chokin his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm sayin I +Die Hard+!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
When you listenin to my bars
Nothin but the F-I-R,-E comin out your iPod
We come up in the place 
chicks heads start spinnin like motherfuckin white walls

[Eminem + Royce]
Got your mother suckin my balls 
while we fuck each other, we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm sor-ry
The 5'9" and the Fire Marshall 
We, spit with an intensity to shut shit DOWN in the industry
Two different entities with a propensity 
to put these N-U-T's up inside of your fuckin, mouth!

[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, aw shit, stop it (stop it)
Yo, welcome to the CD (welcome to the CD)</pre>
