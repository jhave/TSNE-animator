Song:   Where U From
Typed by: fywhla@yahoo.com

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
(Nigga where you from?) It's Dogg Pound all day
Where niggaz ain't afraid of lettin' them guns spray
And if you think I'm jokin', why don't ya come pay a visit
And if you got a problem nigga come get with us
We ain't no studio gangstas, nigga we active
Jump in a 'Llac ready to serve ya'll bastards
We don't give a fuck who the hell we smashin'
Strapped with the AK's ready for action

[Bad Azz]
What's up world, it's Bad Azz back with the boys
I done upgraded my toys, really organized my noise
Set a stable foundation, call it Double Dollar Sign
Still mega grind, I just revised my shine
It's a red glare, you can't see with the naked eye
You need - blind faith, you gotta see it with your mind
You gotta G it while it's time, see it when it come
We gon' be on line, boy you shoulda brought a gun
We got the money and the name, the weapons and the gang
that'll come and just level your spot like ain't a thang
Every block that we rock, pop like indo lane
Eastside Long Beach at the top of the game
And that's Dogg Pound City, they all down with me
Lowlifin' tryin' to get a little suck on the titty
It get any more shitty I get grimey and gritty
They gon' have to send the whole police department to get me

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
(Where you from?) It's Dogg Pound all day
Where niggaz ain't afraid of lettin' them guns spray
And if you think I'm jokin', why don't ya come pay a visit
And if you got a problem nigga come get with us
We ain't no studio gangstas, nigga we active
Jump in a 'Llac ready to serve ya'll bastards
We don't give a fuck who the hell we smashin'
Strapped with the AK's ready for action

[Daz Dillinger]
You know it's mandatory, I'm livin' legend, the whole story
Some die for the fame and glory, this is our territory
Back up, prepare for the whole mission
Run with a pack of doggs that carry a tradition
I'm Daz, you know I'm raised off chronic
West Coast for life, you know I'm raised off hydraulics
2007, Dogg Pound still ballin'
Outta control, back up nigga or the guns will blow
You know we all in the family tree of D.P.
Nigga With a Attitude, a motherfuckin' G
In some gangsta fatigues, diamonds shinin' so bright
Hold the glock so right, end your whole night
Where I'm from, the notorious Dogg Pound
Leave 'em where they found not makin' a sound
I'm D-A to the Z, that trillion dollar G
It ain't easy bein' a gangsta nigga but I gotta be me

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
(Where I'm from?) It's Dogg Pound all day
Where niggaz ain't afraid of lettin' them guns spray
And if you think I'm jokin', why don't ya come pay a visit
And if you got a problem nigga come get with us
We ain't no studio gangstas, nigga we active
Jump in a 'Llac ready to serve ya'll bastards
We don't give a fuck who the hell we smashin'
Strapped with the AK's ready for action

[Kurupt]
The mission just started, the fire's on my waist
This nigga talkin' shit and there's one in my face
Look motherfucker, my faces is crumblin'
Troublesome, I'ma stop and let them hot rocks humble 'em
Halogen - sick aim, dump, crumble 'em
A childhood star like Matt Damon and Kiefer Sutherland
Automatic sparatic, high winds for the rumblin'
I'll rumble 'em, nigga I was born for the thunderin'
Dogg Pound motherfuckin' Gangstaville
Swoopin' up the homie in my Snoop DeVille
Riders on a mission 'bout the G's and spread
Take it to the head nigga, live what you said
You's a hustler, a gangsta, a mack, a pimp
You's a hoe nigga, you remind me of my bitch
I'ma tell his homeboys just like I told him
When I was young on the block with the glock and the schwin

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger]
(You know where I'm from nigga) It's Dogg Pound all day
Where niggaz ain't afraid of lettin' them guns spray
And if you think I'm jokin', why don't ya come pay a visit
And if you got a problem nigga come get with us
We ain't no studio gangstas, nigga we active
Jump in a 'Llac ready to serve ya'll bastards
We don't give a fuck who the hell we smashin'
