[Intro (?uestlove &amp; Chrisette Michele)]
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying; yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
I walked up and asked what's wrong, 
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So I told her I got something you've been waiting for
I got something you've been waiting for 

[Chorus (Chrisette Michele &amp; Black Thought)]
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying; I walked up and asked what's wrong 
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position 
We getting paper like John Travolta get it 
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it 
You know me and my whole squad we so committed 
We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it 
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it 
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga 

[Black Thought]
Well I'm a downtown shooter who that? 
The crown ruler is back 
He kind of grew into the shape of a mack 
Look how I do it, yo I'm taking you back 
This how you rise down to the foundation, how sacred is that? 
I'm from the number one place on the map 
The generational gap with yet another sensational track 
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button 
It's as simple as just making it hap 
To all the frauds stop faking, relax 
And to the broads if you caking 
Then clap then shake it without breaking your back 
I know the world been waiting for that 
You been aching for that cuz what they playing on the station is wack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad, so fresh 
You know its Black Thought and your boy the bro ?uest, but 

[Chorus (Chrisette Michele &amp; Black Thought)]

[Wale]
Hip-Hop ain't dead cuz the pulse is in us 
I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it 
We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen 
And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden with it 
Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics 
But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning 
So good rappers ain't eating they Olsen twining 
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar 
With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it. 
They Mark McGuire with the written, I'm Rodriguez 
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting 
This is the trial and error era no co-defendant 
I push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it 
I said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us 
I don't know you niggas, hit the road my nigga 

[Chorus (Chrisette Michele &amp; Black Thought)]

[Black Thought]
Where my grimy figures at? look lively addressing the captain 
Show me where your first impression is at 
And where your dedication to the true profession is at 
How you laugh answer me, "What kind of question is that?"
I'll show you where my rare essence is at, the adolescence of rap 
The real muscle in the message of that 
My name trouble I'm a blessing to rap 
And you can check my stats cuz worldwide they attesting to that 
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps 
How I'm like Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesc and them cats 
Am I the unsung hero? oh yes if you asking anybody that's aware of the classics 
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress 
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad, so fresh 
You know its Black Thought and your boy the bro ?uest, but

[Chorus (Chrisette Michele)]</pre>
