Dawg you gotta feel me on this one 
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit 
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga 
Geezy, Juve and Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg 

[Verse 1]
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this 
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch 
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip 
I slip a clip in every rip , cas hatas likely to trip 
Come home to my future wife and every nite she'll flip 
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit 
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when I'm pissed 
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit 
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly 
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me 
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court 
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start 
Its like i'm livin happy now 
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now 
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts 
and puff a cooler bust me up 
And say a prayer for everyday 
just so I get through the stuff but I be like 

(Chorus) - 2x 
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man 
and when u feel like everythang is goin wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN 

[Verse 2]
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up 
And usually I'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up 
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts 
And i get hit up with all kinda stress 
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough 
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball 
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow 
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall 
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution 
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion 
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it 
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me 
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit 
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest 
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do 
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through 

(Chorus) - 2x 

[Verse 3]
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic 
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became 
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game 
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change 
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change 
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants 
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man 
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it 
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit 
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeced at last 
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path 
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me 
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me 
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone 
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown 
so I'll be good on my own but I be like 

(Chorus) fading.......Believe Dat </pre>
