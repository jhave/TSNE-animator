[Intro]
Niggas is farting...
Here's... use the spray nigga

[Verse 1: Big Mibbs]
I'm a tall ass nigga, 6'1 160
Fresh out the pack like somebody just un-zipped me
I'm with the crew so you know I got that skunk with me
I'm Ashin Kusher but you know there ain't no punk in me
Shout out to Twitter, I follow a bunch of dumb beezies
Figured if I want to get her it'd be dumb easy
Send her a direct message, "Hey baby come see me"
I like my eggs scrambled, I like my girls easy
For now, till then I'm a let that money pile
Can't wait for you to say that I've been acting funny style
Cause I'm a late bloomer, still growin' like a tumor
You know a nigga made it when your hearing gay rumors
Fuck the cop, the deputy and the state trooper
I'm in the game for longevity, not a chain stupid
Type of nigga that be ridin' in the rain roofless
Told ya'll man that he's a lame, and your the same useless

[Chorus]
If I don't like it then that shit is useless
Talk is cheap man that shit is useless
You chasing hoes man that shit is useless
You trying to wife her man her pussy useless
Damn, man that shit is useless
A couple gram but that shit is useless
Ain't talkin' cash man that shit is useless
Say you the man but that shit is useless

[Verse 2: Like]
Do it how it supposed to be
Now these girls notice me
Now I'm baggin chicks, I use to bag groceries
Use to rap locally, now we travel globally
All around the world off some shit I just wrote in 3 minutes
All truth no pre-tending
And since she's shallow, I'm a go deep in it
These rap dudes is funny boy, I'm peep in it
Look, I fathered your style, you are my dependent
Flow sick, need a free clinic
Beast in it, please quit it
Murdered this shit before the beat finished
Hang yourself, get the nuisance
Cause even explaining myself is useless

[Verse 3: Be Young]
She got your nose wide open
Sneeze and it feels like the doors wide open
Seen her on Povich, showin' off ass
She got the beamer towed and that was just last week
She got them fast feet, you trying to get with her
She got you going out, you always get dinner
Say she from above, I say the bitch Hitler
She got the Laker game, but fuck with all the Clippers
And I bet she drink all the liquor
Everytime we go out, the bitch fallin' quicker
Pain in the ass, shit that we call a splinter
Don't get mad when you see me and I call her useless

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Asher Roth]
You the rotten keg tapper
No name havin' lookin' raggot lame rapper
You nut hugger, butt buddy, fudge packer
(Okay enough of that)
My real friends call me Asher, [laughter]
What kind of name is that, bro dude? It's so stupid
I bet your in a frat or two
What are you Jewish?
Are you good in math, play flute, row crew?
Shit, if you can't be used well then I guess your useless
Ulysses S. Grant, we should start a Revolution
Or a Civil War, whatever your into kids
Down for whatever let's just go ahead and do it
Do it out loud, talk dog fuckin' prove it
Shoot horse the hoot, give the boot like it was soccer
Now they ask what happen to you, silk the shocker
Yeah it's true, I went and moved to Philly, Kevin Stocker
New kid on the block, they say I'm off my John Rocker
Hey and nowadays I'm the young grasshopper
Cool Calm Collect having fun with Cindy Lauper
Never Dennis Hopper with Keanu Reeves
More like Bill and Ted since I started smoking weed
Now all we do is time travel in phone booths
Go to '82, head it back to the old school
When there was no rules, bullshit heroics
(WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?)
Guess that we're The Last Poets
Is there no hope, that this generation blow it?
All about the dough, the glow and the moet
At least some more Bone Thugs or some fuckin' Big Pun
Give it up, where all of these kids are plain dumb
That shit is useless

[Chorus]</pre>
