[Chorus: Quavo]
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Migo he my Holmes, Jesu he my Holmes
Hector he my Holmes, Pedro thats my Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Juan that's my Holmes, Migo them my Holmes
Hector that's my Holmes, Pedro that's my Holmes

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Multi Multi Multi yes I'm Mr. Black Amigo
Coca Coca Coca cheap, prices on the kilos
Me and my partner Chico used to sleep in them Abandos
All white squares, now we get em by the hundos
Scooter met Hector and he made the world respect me
Oh no Chee Chee Chee, hell no he ain't gonna fuck the street
Used to live by the [?] on a small street
Jugged my money up and bought a house next to Gucci

[Chorus: Quavo]

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Take it to the bando, sweatin tryna get that paper
Pull up in that grand black Audi Oakland Raider
I got Molly, I got OxyContin rollin like Bugattis
I got Hatians with the mid, they a fly it cross the islands
Toka brought rubba, thanks to Pedro, Hector, Sosa
Gotta watch out for them niggas with the venom like komodo
I got 50 bricks stashed in that 2012 Toyota
Gotta velcro seal the gas so that 12 won't smell that odor (HOLMES!)

[Chorus: Quavo]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Yeah you know I fuck with Shawty Lo
Shout out to goin home
Rest in piece that nigga Slim, he was straight from [?]
You know Guwap drop a Duwap, but kush still is my cologne
I turned a duecy to a tracy, with no scraping the side I'm scraping
I'm a gambling dark skin breaker (breaker)
Wappa, nigga I'm a thinker (thinker)
Shelf [?] (SHKRRT)
The best nigga in it, get it, need to gimme the belt
That's a Holmes lookin at me, wanna get something that fuck your chest
HOLMES!

[Chorus: Quavo]

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Ricardo them my holmes
Hit em when I call up blowin zones
Takin trips, around the globe
Take a whole bag we a cook alone (cookin)
Hector, Freethrow, Carlito them my Migos
Float me with Burritos in exchange he get Tortitos
I'm a Holmes, got a big ass home
Been sippin on Act for way to long (Lean)
Need Pt's for home
Migo gang, haha I feel like Don Corleone
I'm a godfather of my city (MIGO!)
Put a scar on your face Al Capone (Glah Glah Glaow)

[Chorus: Quavo]</pre>
