[Jeezy talking]
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
All's well that ends well
Outside watering their lawn and shit
Birds are chirping, dogs are barking
It's beautiful
That may be your hood but this is my hood...

[Verse 1]
Got the red dogs trippin' and these niggaz still snitchin
The old lady across the street still bitchin
It's 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep
The third time she's called the police this week
Lookin' at my Franck Muller, it's about that time
Your folks just left so I'm on my grind
Said you wanna two-fifty cause you need that nine
I want that bread but I don't need that dime
Charger fresh out the shop with that suicide doors
Swear I died and came back alive
With 22 inches all under the frame
Keep my pocket full of bread, you niggaz know the name

[Chorus]
Jeezy like to drink
Jeezy like to smoke
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke
Jeezy at the trap
Jeezy like to grind
Jeezy bout his paper
Cuz Jeezy like to shine

[Verse 2]
Sold those squares yeah I cooked them o's
Guilty as charged yeah I rock them shows
I can't even lie yeah i fucked them hoes
Trapped all day spent it all on clothes
Shop all day till the mall is clothed
Come back to the trap get my pockets swoll
Fruitopia, smoke blueberry
Mix it with the purp, we call it cranberry
The Bin Laden clips yeah they came with the chopper
Got a slick mouth I hope you came with a doctor
The boy stacks cheese like it came with the whopper
Stay fly like I came in a chopper

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ain't shit shakin but the leaves in the trees
Between me and you I got a deal on the ki's
Six in one run, laid a mil on the trees
Hit the broad every night, keep a plug on the white
Mr. 17-5, you niggaz know the name
Why y'all playin y'all know it ain't a game
This is me motherfucker, why would I ever change
120 carats, you niggaz see the chain
I'm a bathing ape fanatic
Red monkey junkie
Glass pots on the stove got the kitchen smellin funky
Sold a million records but I still flip them blocks
On the TV every day but I'm still pop them glocks

[Chorus]</pre>
