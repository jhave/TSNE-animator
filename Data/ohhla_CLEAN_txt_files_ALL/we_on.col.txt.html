Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Aye nigga I'm the best man
As if my best friend was getting married
Even with my eyes closed I'm something like a visionary
Paint you a perfect picture, nigga this is pictionary
Man they goin' have to put my picture in the dictionary
Right next to real then put your picture right next to fictionary
Claiming that you trill but you want bitches, all you niggas scary
Don't try to hide from it, oh boy we see you
Claim you goin' ride, oh no we don't believe you
Help wanted, classified, you need more people
Hating mind, I'm greater sign, hey we are no equal
My life is like a movie you like 3 or 4 previews
This the city where they glad to see your soul leave you
You're body laid back like neil so evil
Cole world baby 3 below zero
Getcha life snatched and your vehicle repo
I bring it to you live you gon' see it no TiVo

[Chorus]
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
We on

[Verse 2]
Look man I'm tryna count money like a CFO you see us ho
Doing shows with hoes speaking languages that we don't know
Look here man, if love is blind then these bitches can't see no mo'
They fucking with the boy like a pedophile
If she won't go then we goin' roll cause J. Cole got a mean old flow
I looked up to some niggas but they ain't fuckin with me no more
Chip on my shoulder like I just left the casino oh
Nigga I been broke so don't hate me cause you don't see no dough
Hip-Hop was like Santa Claus cause no body believed no more
And then I came around, now nigga watch me paint the town
A lil black, a lil brown, a lil white, we a mess
This is Carolina repping you can check-in, be our guest
Me I'm blessed, shout to Khaled while I'm howlin' we da best
All these corny rap niggas tryna be my BFF
Nigga please, go head with that old bullshit you rhymin'
See this that good music, so we ain't got shit in common nigga

[Chorus]
We on (nigga)
We on (cole world)
We on (cole world nigga)
We on
We on

Hey we on
We on
Hey we on
Man we on
Hey</pre>
