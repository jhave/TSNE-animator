[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
L'union fait la force R.I.P Jimmy O 
From the ashes we shall rise 
FanFan Young clef to my country of Haiti 

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado) 
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through 
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today 
Even when the earth quakes

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Like I said on BET from the hood to the projects to the mansion 
So you got no excuse stop blamin the recession 
Go hard, for Haiti send a text on your phone, Y-E-L-E, 501501 
Every block, every school, dream initiation 
So build the world make it a better place
like Michael Jackson we don't wanna see another 9-11 happen 
Wish I had talked to them teenagers when them RPG's go in 
Head on with the navy seals I would've told them there's a better way 

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado) 
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through 
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today 
Even when the earth quakes 
We gotta hold on, be strong  
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms 
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight 
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!! 
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today 
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!

[Verse Two: Mavado] 
To all my thugs that's gone, memories live on 
I guess, see you at the crossroad!!!! 
So many cry when we die and they wonder if we're in the sky 
See you at the crossroad!!!! 
I see you in my dream, that night, that crime scene 
But don't worry, see you at the crossroad!!!! 
Remember we still a team and I know you can hear me now 
See you at the crossroad!!!! 

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado) 
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through 
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today 
Even when the earth quakes 
We gotta hold on, be strong  
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms 
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight 
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!! 
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today 
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
(She wants to know) She wanna know how long I been playin 
(As long as my mama) As long as my mama she been prayin 
(She bought me a guitar) She bought me a guitar at eleven 
She ain't want me be usin Mac 11's 
(When I said) So when I said daddy was gone 'til November 
(I knew) I knew that he wouldn't be back in November 
Cause I could've been the one in the bank with a shank 
With a pump and a ski mask 
But my bank is the stage, my 12 gauge a black act  

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Mavado) 
Hold on, be strong, no matter what your goin through 
You know it's 'gon be ok (OK!) today 
Even when the earth quakes 
We gotta hold on, be strong  
I know that you don't think that I can read your palms 
But I see the dawn (The dawn) beyond (Beyond!)
Beyond I can see the sunlight 
And if the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!! 
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today 
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!
If the raaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn!!!! falls down!!!! 
It ain't nothin but a blessed day today 
The suuuuuuuuunnnnnnn!!!!! will shiiiiiinnnnnnnnnineeee!!!!
After the rain dries!!!!!</pre>
