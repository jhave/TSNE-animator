It ain't a thang in this world thats gonna knock me off my feet
As I unleash total chaos into the streets
For I observe these dirty words whispering' through your mouth
So I now I take it you the big dog about the south
Oh really now, though whose to say that we won't never make it
Or even get the chance to tell the world just how we made it
Cause know that we gonna keep it crunk, no matter what 
Now who the fuck, just al nut, it's a must for you to get crushed
So don't rush to get dat' change
You'd besta wake on up and take a look inside this frame
For everything ain't everything when times are gettin' rough
To pressure is your conscience in this game you callin' bluff
Now nigga what, yeah

Oh, a lot of hatin' went on doing this thang here
Folks just swore we wasn't finna' put it down for the A-town
You know what I'm saying? I ain't gotta call no names
Cause you know who you are
You know what I'm sayin'
All I got to say to all of y'all is...
You can't keep nobody from the Attic down
Know what I'm sayin', and thats on the floor

Yea, it's me, remember me from back in the day
The same ol' nigga you thought wouldn't get paid
Look at me now nigga, shit done changed
Ain't no mo' gettin' wet in the rain
Hennessey and dank to kill all my pain
Sho' nuff' you can hear, but you can't feel me man
And it's a damn shame, we go through what we do
Playa hatin' while I'm chillin' on the avenue
Can't hold no nigga down from the Attic Crew
Thats for trill on the blow, straight from me to you
Better listen up now, cause ain't no tellin' whats next
The dem' between real and the ones that flex
All in your face grinnin' when you cash that check
But when they get down and dirty it's like "fuck dat' bitch"
Ass nigga, so how you figga' I was wrong
Got a baby, and a crib to keep clothes on
Long time ago, way before the grind
Trouble had become a friend of mine
You off up in my head, its just a matter of time
Before I rip shit apart and let Sean Paul shine
Like dem' folks open face off in yo' grill
I ain't tryin' to be greedy, I'm just tryin' to live
Now that the picture clear, and you know what I mean
Being broke all again slick it's just a dream</pre>
