[singing by India]
Sabes bien que fue un enga~o  
lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
asi mismo me enga~aste		(~ substituted for the spanish n)

			what you did to me was a sin
			that's the way you betrayed me....

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Honey I keep you hot and wet, just flooded with ice
And you can spend all day and chill, all night
Come sleep with the king, peep what I bring
Every few weeks it's a bigger size ring
Carats ain't nuttin when the cabbage ain't nuttin
I got habits like goin to Paris I ain't frontin
You can never need for nuttin, only one pipe
Would you like to go to dinner, wit Jordan and his wife?
Am I moving fast?  It could happen real soon
Thousand dollar shoes, dance in ballrooms
You know the dress, that got the party impressed
You'll only wear it one time, cause the world is mine
I try to address it, but you never get the message
You the water in my life and I'm trapped in the desert
I never seen a honey sweeter, won't stop
till I get her cause I need her, my senorita

Chorus: Puff Daddy (singing)

Mami ven aqui, I wanna be your
papi chulo can't you see? (mi amor)
Baby I need you conmigo
Your style is my steelo te necesito aqui
(te necesito yo a ti, te amo)
	Baby come to me (2X)

Verse Two: Puff Daddy

Her name is Carmen, she live down in Spanish Harlem
And I think I have the key to her secret garden
When I seen her, I used to want to beg her pardon
But I was scared, I ain't really have the heart
And when she walked by, I would panic, even though
I was cool with her pops Lou, the mechanic
Went to school with her brother, that's right
I never could build up the words to express how I loved her
Long hair, pretty face, slim waist
The kind that you marry and take to another place	[India sings again]
and exchange vows, spend thous
Make love in a hot tub, where there's a hot towel
She'll be loyal without being spoiled
You can shuck all you want but she's still gonna ignore you
Makes no sense to say mira
Cause bet she won't turn him around, she's my senorita

Chorus

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

I rock regular clothes, as well as Gucci too
And if you don't believe me, ask Groovy Loo
You're beautiful, so I stay true to you
I think you oughta see things like Bermuda boo
No cooperation, got me walkin around pacin
Patient, waitin for my day of penetration
Your relationships is bullshit, your man is a prick
with a little bit of bricks and a whip baby
Please, I got plenty of V's
What you want the pink C-2, or the yellow 3-2-5
That's when I opened my eyes
I was dreamin, damn it was all a surprise
But it felt real, I hopped up in a wet chill
Yet still gotta keep this one concealed
Even though I never got a chance to meet her
I still need her, cause she's my senorita
