"The name of the game is.."

[Talib Kweli]
Persistance, dedication
Consistant, motivation, resistance to stagnation
of information, distribute it free to the entire population
No hesitation, makin it public
No privitazation from corporations
Today in order to be sane you gotta go crazy so remain
on top of the game, and master your universe like you was He-Man
See me and Hi Tek knock you out de frame
while I'm stimulatin de brain
in de "Train of Thought" that's the name
of the Reflection Eternal LP man!
Ain't nuttin new except organic produce that means that's free range
You might see me on MTV, BET, or still up on the D-train
It's just everybody else be seemin strange in they approach
I see these guys and read they eyes
Need to disguise and so I cloak
into a cloud of smoke, I brown a roach
to keep myself from soundin loc'
Destroy they hopes of hatin
Don't move aboard before they rock the boat
Yo it's not the dope, 
these snakes will come in peace to slit your throat
Give you compliments, with a promise yet
to get me heated and provoke me
to be rockin shit, shove apocalypse
down your esophagus so swallow that
Guess what you could be coppin that
N'kiru Books for fifteen dollars flat
Cats who spit knowledge on tracks
and get bumped out the back of Impalas and Cadillacs
All my live Cincinatti Bearcats holla back
Tomorrow they gonna wanna borrow raps like 
"C'mon black, I'll pay you back"
I ain't no lyrical ATM even though I'm nice and I'm a mack
Better believe that, leave that crack alone
And you see that there microphone
ain't no place to work your self-esteem issues
Do that shit when you alone!
Nigga you is grown, why is you still suckin on that pacifier
Quickly call that ass a liar, exposin you's my last desire
Olympic skills so pass the fire
I roll with niggaz that match attire
Black aware, that's filled with gas
but rollin on, flat ass tires
Yeahehehe, yo hehehe, yo, yo.. yo yo
Yo I got a special guest
Lil' Baby Tone Tone, tell 'em what's up
{?? indecipherable ??} Yo, true
Yo we bout to be, tell 'em peace out Tone
{Peace out} Yeah word word Baby Tone, what?
{Yeah what?}</pre>
