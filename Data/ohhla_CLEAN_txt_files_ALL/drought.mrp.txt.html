[Hook - 2x]
It's a drought, but we got dope
We got dope, we got dope
It's a drought, but we got dope
Then it's gon cost you mo'

[Master P]
First you mix the dope, then you cook the dope
And if you ain't a fiend, you don't smoke the dope
This ain't a movie, and you ain't Scarface
So don't bring no hoe around you, that love white cake
C-Murder facing life, and never gave a name
And you niggaz turn on each other, for a couple of them thangs
I must address this shit, cause it's a serious fucking issue
How you gon accept a badge, 'fore the police come get you
We don't fuck with y'all kind, whodi why you snitching
This ain't baseball, so stop pitching
And making collect calls, to the police
Get your jersey retired, whodi you don't know me
I should of stayed in school, could of been a doctor
But I'm riding Third Ward boys, trying to lose them helicopters
But I ain't with being broke, got the scale in my coat
We gon get through this man, meet me by the sto'
And I don't know, what they told you boy
I got that A1, whole baking soda boy
You could add the B12, put it in a bag
Take it to the hood, I bet it go fast

[Hook - 2x]

[Desperado]
I take razors to the plate, chop up the yay
Till they call the corner store, the Hard Rock Cafe
So I kick in the door, cause they heard I supply bricks
I got 10 they find more, I could hide 6

[Yukon]
You think quick, when there's money on the line
That's when I come through, and get em every time
Fine line 'tween the vision my chain, like it's straw
And the nose of a fiend, and they sniffing that caine

[Desperado]
You snort raw, I got Peruvian pure
My connect not dimmy, but he giving me more
How you a hustler dog, since you with the top off
Best taking flicks, so you tripping making drop off's

[Yukon]
The game clear, when I'm spitting these bars
It's that of a real nigga, when I sit through a charge
We got work man, tell me what you want
Yeah he supplying shit, I can get it in a month
Put the pieces in place

[Desperado]
Then we find the yay

[Yukon]
No shorts on the strip

[Desperado]
All the money be straight

[Yukon]
Don't hate if you broke, must of woke up late

[Desperado]
Cause we be up when the sun rise, dope don't wait

[Hook - 2x]

[Master P]
Now the FED's came through, took some niggaz off the block
Rat-a-tat-tat, this shit won't stop
Now how many niggaz, got to die in this game
'Fore we all realize, we gotta get out of this thang
And if you make it to money, get your life straight
Find another way out, before it's too late
Ain't nothing wrong, with making it out of the hood
It's enough for in the game, where the playas play for good
And these cats, be barking
Keep your eyes on these niggaz, that you know that be talking

(*talking*)
You heard me, fuck
Get against the car</pre>
