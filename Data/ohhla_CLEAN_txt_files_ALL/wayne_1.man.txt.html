Shh...Say Fabe...Say Fabe
Look, Fresh done went to the bathroom
This your boy Weezy baby
Ya already know
He ain't want me rappin on his album
Cause I be talkin bout that gun slangin, that murderin
Them bitches, bitches havin kids, bitches fuckin bitches
Bitches fuckin other bitches' bitches
and the other bitch getting mad and stab that bitch in the club
and he gotta drag that bitch out
Look, he ain't want none on that on his album
He wanna write about lovin and huggin people
And Hey lady you look so fine
And I mean...you know what I'm saying
I ain't trying to downgrade nobody, nah nuttin like that
But this nigga need some spittin on here
So I can come on this motherfucker and flame it out
So somebody could cut this motherfucker on
He comin?, Cut my shit on
Yeah uhh..Yeah uhh
Weezy F-Baby
Fresh, uhh tell him call me when its gangsta
Yeah, Birdman Jr
Fresh yeah, call me when its gangsta man
Yeah

[Lil Wayne]
I'm on fire, Shorty so raw
I just may be Columbian so I'm higher
Washed up niggaz, I will tumble ya, double-dry ya
I bubble gum and spit jumbalya
I'm fresh up out the kitchen with that Richard Pryor
Yeah I keep your stomach rumble quiet
Holla, Prior to me getting money, I was gettin money
See, everytime I hit the pen, I bungee like a spungee
I ain't playin like Tony Dungy
Sayin all ya'll is lunchmeat to the hungry
Better watch your pot roast when I'm on me, I'm nothing nice
like something like running through blazing pistols with a fucking knife
I'm fresh to death, I need a fucking life
She say her man wrong, so she gonna suck me right
I'm like fucking right, I got my two-shooter, that mean I'm fucking twice

[Lil Wayne]
Bang Bang
Whoo..it was hard
Look at our journey
But I got here, I made it on the album people
It's Weezy
Thank you Fresh

[Mannie Fresh]
Look, Wayne
I told you brah
No merkin, No murderin
No bitches stabbin bitches
No bulletwounds
None of that kinda shit
No fuckin body with over 12 tattoos and all that shit on this motherfuckin album
This is some beautiful wholesome loving kind type stuff
If you can't go by them rules, get the fuck on dude
Now Fabe, play something beautiful for the ladies</pre>
