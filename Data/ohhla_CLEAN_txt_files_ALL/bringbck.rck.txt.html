[Pete Rock &amp; Joe Scudda]
Yeah...it's JR....LB's Pete Rock....here we go...yeah Little Brother...Scudda

[Joe Scudda]
Whatup? Hello smooth type fellow
go hard on the paint like a young Carmello
You boys are sweet like J-E double L-O
things gon' fall off now homie hell no
Before that you catch a fist &amp; a elbow
my timbs do work I can't do dirt in shelltoes
Raps for sale though, but I'm tryna act cop me a Lac
laid back with a bitch on Melrose
So get your hatin' on, cause beating me
your chances are thin like the ice I see you skatin' on
My work's strong something you couldn't make it on
your best idea is something still way beyond
Told y'all cats I'm something like a star
this that shit you gone be bumping out ya car
Hands up double-fisted posted at the bar
it's your man J-O-E &amp; the PR

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
If the words didn't rhyme would it still be rap?
If the needle didn't grind could DJ's scratch?
If you didn't have no verses would you need my tracks?
Pete Rock &amp; Little Brother gone bring y'all back
If the words didn't rhyme would it still be rap?
If the needle didn't grind could DJ's scratch?
If you didn't have no verses would you need my tracks?
Pete Rock &amp; Little Brother gone bring y'all back

[Phonte]
I'm gettin' bu-coo props from these niggas
who do watch Phon-tigger when here in the booth
Cause nowadays the truth just may get you shot
5 things to the brain get you 2Pac'd
But Imma get off the mic before it get to hot
cause when you speak of LB you speak of all stars
Shit's weak &amp; we probably callin' out yours
now on my feet before I lived on all fours
Cause I ain't come to get drunk off ambition
and get stuck, If you gotta problem my instinct
Instructs me to quit fucking around
and bring it to a nigga live in the flesh like Nip/Tuck
Drop 16 then I'm bouncing nigga
we don't care about that money you was counting nigga
Don't know me well, Phonte is like Josie Wells
for all you "Brokeback Mountain" niggas, ya know

[Chorus] - 2X

[Big Pooh]
I got one brother doing time in the pen
Little Brother pen to it's time reaching in
I gotta reach within to get myself to the pen
I told my brother that he responded with a grin
I knew from that look I had to take it to the chin
a fresh sign of hope to us niggas in the pen
My pen brought light to mommy at wits end
and niggas tryna say that my shit ain't crisp
These niggas I don't miss, I just get better
Pooh the trendsetter better scream my name
Justified when I take that aim, it's no shame
I tell you right now that the kid don't stop
Pooh &amp; Pete Rock rock harder than the first one
took time so you niggas had to thirst one
Now we back part 2 no frills
the pen much greater than the sword that's real

[Chorus] - 2X

[Scratching]
