Y'know, but they like, they're on some stuff like talkin 'bout
El think he's a man, he thinks he knows, this dude's this great asshole
The dude could be an asshole, y'knahmsayin?
He doin his thing! They tryin to be him, but you know
I was tryin to pick my sneaks out anyway
And these kids tried to step back up to me

And they just keep walkin up to just keep sayin this stuff to me

Maybe we'll lose our minds
And we can rock this Def Jux music
It's the end of times
