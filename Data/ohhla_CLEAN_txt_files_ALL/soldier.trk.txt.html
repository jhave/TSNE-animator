C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon look, look...

(Verse 1 - Turk)
Verse one is about this chick named Karen
She wanted to be down, I told her first she gotta run Aaron
Take this work downtown to this nigga named Gary
Bring me back what I need, and I'ma make it happen
I'ma give you the world, keep you shop everyday
On tha real like a man, girl please believe me
I don't play
Look here I'm a man by my words
Nigga try to jack you I leave his brains in the curb
You get my back, I get yours that's how we play it
Got the got the job done before you get pay
I know you done heard you gotta work before you eat
Either you do it or don't it's all cool with me
Cause I'm straight look here you try to get where I'm at
Do it right the first time, and I'ma holla back
Wanna be in that limelight it's what you gotta do
But Look I ain't making you, it's all on you

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down
She'll drive from state to state,and bring her nigga the pound
She'll let you use her house, so you can hide the work
A real soldierette'll hold the thangs off in here purse

(Verse 2 - Turk)
Verse two is about this hot girl named Tasha
Great big fine with ass, just like her momma
Tasha wanted to be a superstar I heard
Willin' to do anything now tell me is that nerve
All that shit not even cost for
Wodie she trippin
All that just to be a rapper
Wodie she trippin
Better open your eyes before it's to late
You better dream quickly with that look in your face
Then what'cho gonna do, better listen to my advice
I'm only gonna speak once, lil' momma not twice
Nigga don't give a fuck about you but say they do
Fall for it if you want, Boo it's on you
Look is what you do make you think that your green is grass
Playin' to the end look that how you do his ass
Don't be a duck, just to get what you want
If is for you, It's gonna happen you just wait till it come

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down
She'll drive from state to state,and bring her nigga the pound
She'll let you use her house, so you can hide tha work
A real soldierette'll hold the thang off in here purse

(Verse 3 - Turk)
Verse three I'ma get it all with Kitty
A good cool trick who we use the house when we needed
Only thing she wanted is alittle bit attention
To get our shine on, and our name to be mention
We'll we do that for you look that ain't 'bout nothin
Gotta keep your mouth close and don't say nothin
Let us run shoot all day and all night
Mind your own business and it gonna be alright
We gonna play it down tha middle do a favor for a favor
You get what you want as long as I get my paper
This gotta be my hustla spot and only my shop
All that other traffic you got, Kitty it gotta stop
If they ain't breaking you off like him breaking you off
Let 'em know they gotta go respect your call
These days niggas not giving us nothin' free
I know the game cold, but look that's how it be

(Chorus - repeat 2X)
A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down
She'll drive from state to state,and bring her nigga the pound
She'll let you use her house, so you can hide tha work
A real soldierette'll hold the thang off in here purse
