Killa, Killa, Killa, DipSet Bitch, DipSet Bitch, DipSet Bitch
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-damn

[Verse 1]
Them niggaz pumpin dimes, trunk pumpin mine
I really make cake, you could call me Duncan Hines
Had a drunken mind, club wobbled out
Next stop, start trouble inside the waffle house
Mmm, click the nine, yup skip the line
Looked at home boy yo, your bitch is mine
Had a little knife, tried to flick his shine
Had a big gat, click clack, hit recline
Don't ever complain, over no dumb dame
See you big money, I'll turn 'em to chump change
Let my muscles show, cause I'm like Russell Crowe
Beautiful mind, took his bitch, hustle hoe
That was her boo, yes sir true
But I collect the chicken, call me Purdue
His ex wife, a new sex life
But ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check it, go get ya wet wipes

[Hook]
Go get ya wet wipes, go get ya wet wipes
Go get ya wet wipes, go get ya wet wipes
I see your head lights, they lookin dead nice
They got me sayin
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-damn

[Verse 2]
They all comical, Killa Killa phenomenal
Honored the honesty mommy illage villa I promise you
I come once a year, I'm like the carnival
They all talk about me, call him Donahue
It's the don in you, nope it's the Kris in me
The '06 Ricky D, less glitter b
Yes Sicily ricery, don't mean shit to me
Get with me physically, mentally, literally
My henchmen, they lynch men
They apply the appliances the wrench-men
That's sense ten, I've been attendin
Plaintiff, defendant, sentence, independence
But it was said right, I was dead nice
And I'm dead wrong, but you'll die dead right
This red ice, chicken wings red rice
But baby girl, go get ya wet wipes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggaz know the deal, pop the golden seal
Candy apple rain drops, Soul For Real
No singer b, sling Heavy D
Ready rock, killa cop, steady b
Stay steady please, say I bet he squeeze
I ain't on it tonight, I need head for sheez
I don't care if your Japanese, Lebanese
Chinese, Siamese, just be from the seven seas
I was wrapin a L, I got trapped in a smell
Perfume, bag, hat, all matchin Chenelle
Ohh you a baler boo, how tall are you
5'6" 150, I need all of you
She had a candy chocha, como te llamo Josa
Lets meet her family, let me hit, Sammy Sosa
I know you first class, I'm a jet flight
No take off, first get ya wet wipes
