[Intro]
Yeah... Oh! Yeah Yeah...Oh..
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me, High!
I smell something in the air that's making me, HIGH!!

[Verse 1]
Ok here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the tobasco
You motherfucker's must just not know the tic-tac-so
Time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pickaxe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with sixpack, with exact doe
Knives, strangling wives with dick-lasso
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to poison girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my lil vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so
Bout time you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke

[Chorus]
It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are getting fulfilled, Ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama
And be calmer, bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know that can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order
Beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which state they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a lint drum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning her, bullets are, so unbelievable its a
Titanium cranium that's full of surprises
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (high)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking

[Chorus]</pre>
