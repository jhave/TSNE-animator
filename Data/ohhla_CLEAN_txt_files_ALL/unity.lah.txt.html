   Uh, U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity
   U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from infinity to infinity
			                   (Who you calling a bitch?)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black woman from     (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from       (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (Yeah me bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye and said "Who you calling a bitch?"

					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black woman from     (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)
					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from       (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?)

					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black woman from     (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)
					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from       (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you call yourself
a "Gangsta Bitch" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this work getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right? Bucking with nobody
She got to wear that for life (Who you calling a bitch?)

					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black woman from     (You got to let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)
					   (Here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity   (You gotta let him know)
					   (You go, come on here we go)
   U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from       (You must let him know)
               infinity to infinity        (You ain't a bitch or a ho)</pre>
