[Verse 1] P.S.D.:
I told they: Good is pee´as
We just don´t give a shit ´bout that huch
If you ain´t blowin´ don´t touch
Orum, capulatin´, Playa-Hatas get baddered
Get a suck ass to the pisa and the rest don´t matter
Hoochie, Kochie, came down for Uchie, tryin´ to clown y´all
Get sourround in Hammer
Southpark re-see downer
N... 2Deep and Manish come about them pantses
On the table, on the frigidy, on the couch, on the canvas
Uhmm...
Assholes and ellbows - Tell hoes it´s pimpy
Gon´ play a huch till I die, so go arach from respect me
Crew thanger, Hoo Banger, Bad braw breathness
And devide hoes like the Looies - Playa shit forever
I took a flight to Ohio
High - oh
Selver header, young sister, but a hoe
Chick is grabbed to a liver
Give a fuck
Live it up
Lil Huch don´t hide it devide it
Make a wooooord

[Verse 2] Mac Lee:
Ohh
Best my touch upon the scrill´ 
Fo´ real 
Servin´ comebacks
Because they seem to love it
Oh, feel nickle thang, relate it
Captain saver
Never huch and trust homie
Shake and fake some phonies
Got the Poni-es
Whizzahs!
On the po-one
H-Spotter
Then I got her
All up in her face
She´s straight lace
It´s paper chase and taxes to the thirdy
And dressed to impress if the tram-bitch worthy
Don´t "Sir" me
No, Biatch
Please...
I´ma trees with my cuddies
If it ain´t hoes then it´s money
Act funny if you wanna
Up in the corner to the Country-Club, Cressside Californiaaaaa
I told you, though, you hit it hoe,
The cloud,
If your lungs stick
Coo´ thang niggers ain´t down with that dumb shit
Not one bitch but two hoes
Big banks and new clothes
It´s tha path I choose, fo´ real, no so choose yours!

[Verse 3] Jay Tee:
Up in a big, blown caddy nine-lighter seville
We ridd´n right on the side and playa fo´ real
I got´s to skill
So tear it off, kick down, break bread
P.S.D., Mac Lee, Jay Tee - shake phaaat
International player try´na pass go
Bitch give me your cashflow and everythin I ask fo´
I make the grass grow greener
Just a little cleaner then the average
V-Town savage
This can be lavage
Plushed out ice-cold
8.1 ain´t the nice pay - the prize is sold
So let you pin the loadem in a moudy
Gett´n rowdy
Cousin´ rockets
Three motherfuckers about they pay talkin´ shit all day
As up fo´ sho´ we gon´ stay´a
Go to bay´a
Been take a brought down on our way´a... Hmmm

[Outro] Jay Tee
Yeah, you know
A motherfucker gon´ get payed, partner
The gorgers
So we hit the strip
The dick gon´ grind
And the mouthpiece will shine
So chock this up as a confirm for kill
By 3 real motherfuckin´ players</pre>
