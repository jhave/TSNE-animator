[Chorus] (repeat 4x)
Nigga, I always keep my composure
Often full of that doja
Universal soldier
I'm ready for war

These niggas really got me trippin' with that bullshit
My daddy, taught me no playin' in the pulpit
So for the bullshit, I brought my goon squad
Pass me my ammunition, and praise God
Against all odds, I'll make these mothafuckas pay
Lord give me the strength, to knock these niggas out my way
Everyday I been prayin' for my chance
A mean ass mug in a soldier stance
I ain't come to dance, I came to crank this mothafucka up
He think he the man you tell that nigga I said what
Pastor nigga

[Chorus] (repeat 3x)

These niggas really got me trippin' on they videos
They hard as hell, on the camera when I know they hoes
They got their chest swole and then a bad bitch
But where I'm from  y'all both will get yo ass kicked
I'm talkin' mad shit, and I'mma back it up
I got my AR-15 in the back of truck
Put on my hard hat baby
If they take me its worst cause I'mma hunt you baby
'Til his whole world is cursed
Ain't no reverse, it's not over
The blessings of Jehovah
Off in the, 600 drop with the all chrome motor
And it's mine, paid out what you talkin' about
I take a puff of my doja and I regain my composure

[Chorus] (repeat 4x)</pre>
