[VERSE 1  JR.GONG]
You Nah Mean
Mi dip out a whole fourteen
Nah Mean
And reload man extra magazine
Nah Mean
A wounded them housing scheme
Nah Mean
Nuff a dem a move sideways and lean
Nah Mean
Can't come bout when man deh in
Nah Mean
We nuh like dem colonial regime
Nah Mean
Ethiopian nuh like Mussoline
Nah Mean
Mi Queen hafi rock and come in
Nah Mean
And jump pon mi big trampoline
Nah Mean
And boost up her self-esteem
Nah Mean
Nuff a wonder how man kitchen so clean
Nah Mean
And which recipe dat a steam
Nah Mean
The lyrics dem a flow like a stream
Nah Mean
Mek you feel like you living in a dream
Nah Mean
It come to the crop man a cream
Nah Mean
It come to discipline man a Dean
Nah Mean
Mi tougher than a Hummer limousine
Nah Mean
We stepping we fresh and we clean
Nah Mean
I burn the stinkest of green
Nah Mean
Better listen up careful and keen
Nah Mean
A Puppa Nas a rock and come in
Nah Mean

[VERSE 2 NAS]
We celebrate like I finished probation
Boy Boy
Notty Head with no chaser
Boy Boy
From the mouth I can spit out a razor
Boy Boy
Open up your facial like your boy Roy
In his prime
Eat food 
Dinnertime
Jr. Gong pass the Guinness
Handle business
Black Velvet sippers
Females never bid us farewell
They with us
Cause we arrive on the scene
Just like a high beam
Nah Mean
Don't let us have to make the 9 scream
Nah Mean
At your racial
Policing Regime
Nah Mean
Spiritual like a Elohim
Nah Mean
In a casino or a yacht
Wherever I'm seen
My brothers and sisters are never forgot
Nah Mean
Don't wanna hear another soldier drop
Nah Mean
Another dope addict get shot with the morphine
And Feds are indicting my block
Nah Mean
They're wearing Red from they shoes to they top
Nah Mean
I'm wishing that all the violence would stop
Nah Mean

[VERSE 3 JR GONG]
We nuh like the sound of siren
Nah Mean
And some bwoy soft like ice cream
Nah Mean
From a bwoy mek the Feds intervene
Nah Mean
We send a bwoy go tek intravene
Nah Mean
Parabellum dem a itch up inna spleen
Nah Mean
Inna Queens
Gunman reign Supreme
Nah Mean
Kingstonians are real blood fiends
Nah Mean
The world is a big crime scene
Nah Mean

[CHORUS/BRIDGE]
Yo Yo Mr. President
What you doing for my residence?
Yo Mr. Minister
Why you being sinister?
Yo Yo Mr. President
What you doing for my residence?
Yo Mr. Minister
Why you being sinister?

[VERSE 4 JR GONG]
Se Man a di real Buffalo inna Rastafari Regime
Bush Bungalow is where mi dwell with mi Queen
Trash to the bone down inna camouflage green
Nuff a dem that can't go the places we been
Nuff a dem that can't see the sights whe we seen
That's why them face all a twist up and a lean
Nah Mean
Dem better mine we kick it off clean
Nah Mean
Man a Gangster just like Gambine
Dat Mean
Dem can't serve Congo Dread court supine
Nah Mean
A who you want come in convene
Nah Mean
Attorney have to rock and come in
Nah Mean
Mi pocket dem green like spurlene
Nah Mean
Mi regular fly out and fly in
Nah Mean
The stadium pack like sardine
Nah Mean
Can't catch mi speed a fassy hole need caffeine
Nah Mean
Run out a breath and antihistamine
Nah Mean
Wash over gold dem come in like Listerine
Nah Mean
You think a lie we badder than Al Pacine
Nah Mean

[VERSE 5 NAS]
It's Genocide
It's a Genocide
It's a Genocide
It's Genocide
5th Floor cooking raw 
Had my own supply
Cause of capitalist ways
That was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays</pre>
