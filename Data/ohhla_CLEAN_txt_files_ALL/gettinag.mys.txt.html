I'm feelin aggressive
Can't eat, can't sleep
I'm tired of this hemp
Sick of this hemp
Can't eat, can't sleep
I'm tired of this hemp
Sick of this hemp
Can't eat, can't sleep
I'm gettin aggressive
That's why I'm feelin aggressive
This gon ?
Sick of this hemp
Tired of this hemp
I'm feelin aggressive
Ooh that's why I'm feelin aggressive
This gon ?
Sick of this hemp
Tired of this hemp

Shift heels move ? you got this many cats
It's a news column can't eat can't sleep
Don't look don't talk
Tired of this hemp, sick of this hemp
Can't eat, can't sleep
Tired of this hemp, cross ? make your whole world ??
Gettin aggressive
Ooh that's why I'm gettin aggressive
This gon' ?
I'm sick of this hemp
Tired of this hemp
Feelin' aggressive
Ooh that's why I'm gettin' aggressive

Ooh that's why I'm gettin aggressive

Come around and show your face if you wanna
If you wanna, I'm tired of this hemp

It's off at your hip whenever I throw

Just don't taste, sick of this hemp, tired of this hemp
I'm feelin aggressive, that's why I'm gettin' aggressive
Just don't taste, sick of this hemp, feelin aggressive
In the story that's it lights out shot close</pre>
