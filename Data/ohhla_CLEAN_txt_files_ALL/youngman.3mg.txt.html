[Chorus]
When I was a young man growing up I could see I would be the one
One of many headed towards the sun
Cause the suns burning in our heart
 
[Verse One] [Eligh]
At one time
Color inside the lines were all the rules I had to take
Sitting Indian style, colorful carpet under my shade
Once I learned what I loved I knew I controlled my own plate
Third grade started falling for the dames
Started calling out names
Fourth through eighth were just a bunch of innocent childish games
Everyday in between been breaking on a balance beam
Taking me on a roller coaster faster than the speed of light
Sending up prayers hoping God catches them swift and slight
Giving me heavy handed insight on my chosen life
Serving up cyclones injecting what I've learned into rhyme
Yet everyday is just a march on a dime through time

[Chorus]
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one
One of many headed towards the sun
Cause the sun  is burning in our heart
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one

[Scarub]
Born alone die alone
Between the end and the beginning
Life plays out like the scales of a xylophone
Already knew right from wrong
So my tendencies to fail were less
Knew I was blessed and pushed right along
From an early age they thought I was different
Had a more mature approach about me
They labeled me gifted
Yeah, I got a pocket piece
But rarely keep a close watch of the times
Rather explore my mind and what's caught up in it
I ain't crazy y'all just scared
And that's the truth
Seems like the ones who make it through the same ones breaking the rules
I ain't one for authority and I ain't no menace
Was put here with a task to finish
Let's get to business

[Chorus]
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one
One of many headed towards the sun
Cause the sun  is burning in our heart
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one

[MURS]
One of these dudes was not like the others
But I never ran for cover
Cause I knew I never was
In the hood they used to point and say, "There go weird cuz."
With my dreadlocks high on an underground buzz
Backpack on
Headphones on 10
And not much changed
We became grown men
I'm still hella weird
Just tighter with my raps
And they still grindin'
Ridin' in the trap
But the bond that we got goes beyond all that
Of that obstacles that you face when you're young, black
We do a different dance but it's too the same drum
Trying not to get burnt by the flames of the sun

[Chorus]
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one
One of many headed towards the sun
Cause the sun  is burning in our heart
When I was a young man growing up
I could see
I would be the one</pre>
