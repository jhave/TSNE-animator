Huh
Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista  still

[Verse 1]
Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O.  get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car?

[Hook]
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)

23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know

Do you? (Do you?   Do you?  Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you?  Do you?

[Verse 2]
In the mood, like yes y'all
Rather be, let it test y'all
Light the B if it's special
Can I undress to relax   y'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough

Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?

An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a 50ball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cuz' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do u?
