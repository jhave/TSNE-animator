I've been evicted, erase me from the face of the planet
Cause your world got my outlook damaged
My minds stuck inside a cycle of depression
The reflection
Can you feel me?
Look in the mirror, tell me do you see clearly?
They have it shattered and cracked, it's so crazy
My minds stuck inside a cycle of depression
The reflection

Listen, I can make the crows talk
And have you jumping out a twenty story building
and come crashing on the sidewalk
You can see it in my eyes cause I never blink
And I can read it on your mind every time you think
I'm the sick side of circlin' spells
And I'm surrounded for the secrets of
All the writings on the walls in the cave described us
To decapitate the heads of the people who broke trust
Beyond the nonbelievin'
Unforgiven by the sacraments of sin
All the way from the beginnin'
I keep spinnin'
Good versus evil, who's winnin'?
My mind state takin' a beatin' and still grinnin'
Underground and I'm buried alive
I'm resurrected and reflected through the Juggalo eyes
This ain't no fuckin disguise
This is the way that I look
And it will all be explained in the book (in the book)

Chorus

I want you to touch the mirror, saying Twiztid inside your mind 17 times
Would you survive in a world that's full of hate?
Or would you live and love then die and be buried and then disintegrate?
I want you to envision in the battle ground
With a light from heaven if I give'em hell of the sound
Painted in the wind like the stench of the dead
Angels with broken wings and devils with severed heads
I want you to believe in the realm of the dark
Where souls are rotten like teeth and withered like tree barks
Screams can be heard, only faint in the sky
Demons with false tongues and bright yellow eyes
With his flesh being torn, by haunts and ghosts
With a flock of ??????? and unicorns
The monster in the medicine cabinet grows clear
Is it me or my reflection that I'm seeing in the mirror

In the book (in the book)
They'll all be explained in the book (in the book)
