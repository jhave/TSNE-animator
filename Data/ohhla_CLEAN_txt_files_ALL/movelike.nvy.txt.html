[Intro: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Shakedown! The Co-Op!

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Move like a G supposed to, lame niggas don't hear me
Fo' life I'm a be a soldier, stack chips on the daily
Shorty get low on the flo', hands in the air right near me
And when we come around, through yo' town, it's goin down, goin down

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah! Been toatin (Yeah!)
Hot! Cafe! Been smokin
Knee deep in that water, been soakin
Like my team be off Ex they been rollin
Your jewels is wet, mine been frozen
What I be sailin big look, Atlantic Ocean
Niggas speak my name like I wouldn't toast him
Got my dick in his mouth, been chokin
They love my style yep, I own them
Do the shit for rap, I been holdin
I be nice to y'all niggas when R goes in
Cafe, wake 'em up, when they dozin
You a gangsta huh? Led it golden
Nigga fuck the rap, let the fo' fo' ring!
The boss is back, tell 'em I just flown in
And I'm glidin bitch look, G folds in (What else?)

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Move like a G supposed to, lame niggas don't hear me
Fo' life I'm a be a soldier, stack chips on the daily
Shorty get low on the flo', hands in the air right near me
And when we come around, through yo' town, it's goin down, goin down

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Move like a G supposed to
The toaster will hit him in his face while he drink his Mamosa
Tell us who's close to that? The ghost is back
Shotty on the shoulder strapped hauntin niggas
And I don't fuck around when the four in niggas
I'm a ground ball, yeah I be tauntin niggas
I'm a shoot 'em up, stomp 'em out, Yonkers nigga
And anybody I beef with I conquer nigga
Quick fast on him if he got cash on him
Got a young bot that's thirsty to blast on him
Old school P got his gloves and his mask on him
I don't need a gun give him somethin to smash on him
You got a little hawk I see somethin to slash
I'm a be his teacher yeah if he got his math
I got ideas big plans drive in the big van
Want him in your town is I be big man, what

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Move like a G supposed to, lame niggas don't hear me
Fo' life I'm a be a soldier, stack chips on the daily
Shorty get low on the flo', hands in the air right near me
And when we come around, through yo' town, it's goin down, goin down

[Verse 3: Uncle Murda]
I got the whole B.K. pickin they llamas up (BANG!!!)
They like it's on, Murda throwin the diamond up (I'm throwin it up!!!)
Don't ask me if I'm beefin with them little guys (Don't ask me that!)
That's old news I got a bigger fish to fry
R.O.C. still runnin this rap shit
Everybody done fell off I don't know what happened
I'm G.M.G. and R.O.C.
Can't front I got New York hittin back the police
Look you don't need drugs my music get you higher
I make you feel Marlo from The Wire
Get all your goons get your guns and go fire
Make all them other dudes who be hustlin retire
It's gettin hot, summertime comin up
Murda got a record deal these niggas done fucked up
I'm a boost the crime rate (WHAT!)
So if you don't really want beef with me, you better stay out my way

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Move like a G supposed to, lame niggas don't hear me
Fo' life I'm a be a soldier, stack chips on the daily
Shorty get low on the flo', hands in the air right near me
And when we come around, through yo' town, it's goin down, goin down

[Outro: DJ Envy]
