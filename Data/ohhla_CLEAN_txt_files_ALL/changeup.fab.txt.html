[Akon] Konvict

[Fabolous]
We never change over here
Street Fame, Konvict

[Chorus 1: Akon]
If I'm your man, then you're my man
And we ain't gotta worry 'bout where we stand
But you crossed the man, you forced my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan
Cause I will not change up.. change up.. nooooooo
Said I will not change up.. change up.. nooooooo

[Chorus 2: Akon]
Now I don't know if I should hug him or slug him now
And I don't know if I should cap him or dap him now
But I know that it's feelin funny now
Maybe it's cause I'm gettin this money now
You see things ain't the same
I said things ain't the same (nah)
No, things ain't the same (nah)
And I know I ain't changed

[Fabolous]
Yo, I make the money, but don't let it make me
So even if I go broke nigga you couldn't break me
Watch how long it take me to jump back on my feet
Peep, quick is when the barrels jump back on the heat
Y'all don't wanna see me jump back in the street
So be happy that I rock them slumped back in the seats
Being broke is a joke, I never found it funny
That's why I count my blessings as much as I count my money

[Chorus 1]

[Fabolous]
Some niggaz change when they get change, funny when they get money
Switch when they get rich, strayed when they got paid
Ha~! But I stresses you to holla
Cause they never made bullet proof vest-es out of dollars
We never change, this is us every day
I call them boys up, they gon' bust every 'K
They ride high like them cust' Chevrolets
Like O-Wax for Kaine, lookin for his cousin killers
I got a dozen peelers for niggaz who doesn't feel us
I changed for a reason but homey it wasn't scrilla
They can't say that nuttin changed but my clothes
Oh, I'm lyin, I do change up my hoes
I pitch game you should see the change-up I throws
And gotta get 'em a ring to get 'em to swing
I'm a team player, if I win then we won
And they gon' put us all in the Hall of Fame when we done

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]

[Fabolous]
Money can't buy happiness but it's a damn good down payment
I don't talk much, feel like I'm around agents
... the game ain't what it used to be
I'm the same but these lames ain't used to me
Them other niggaz, be full of theyselves
Get money and disappear, try to pull a Chappelle
Well - I ain't hidin I'm ridin; I ain't duckin I'm buckin
I ain't hangin I'm bangin; I ain't willin I've done it

[Chorus 1] + [Chorus 2]</pre>
