Never thought about the other side, oh no
It was always let's go try to pull some hoes
And I pulled 'em like a towtruck, since I was a young buck
Guaranteed the hoes always got fucked
With a one-two and all that good shit
I never flipped or tripped or got pussy whipped
Cause I'm the K-K-K-K-Kid Rock motherfucker
You want a piece of me, you're just another sucker
But oh well you don't bother me none
Cause me and your girl have lots of fun
You know the one that looks like a model
Sucks on my nuts like a baby on a milk bottle
Not cause I make her, I wouldn't make her
But cause I mack her right she loves me all night

With a one-two, and all that good shit
With a one-two, I take another sip
With a one-two, and I'll rock this party
With a one-two, ya better ask somebody

Get down girl and read my mind
And you'll see that it's focused on your behind
You got a lot of class and don't mind me askin'
But can I go up in your fat ass and
Just pump, pump, pump, what's next
Check your money it's scum, and it's time to jet
You bet she'll be into it more
On the bed, the steps and the kitchen floor
You like the way the K-I did it like I said I would
Could, should I do it good
In your neighborhood on your fuckin' block
Cause I'm the coo-ool, the Kid Rock

Kid Rock, Kid, Kid Rock
Kid, Kid Rock, Kid Rock, Kid Rock, make it nasty

Hoes talk the same shit, 'ya dress like a slob'
But bitches still give a good blow job
Up come my drawers and it's goodbye
The Kid Rock's just got to fly
Cause it's 1-9-9-0, time to fuck hoes
But before ya goin' put Jimmy in a lambskin
And we could bump all night you bet
So get set to jet and go get wet
Come on outta your girdle and slacks
And I'll shine that booty like turtle wax

With a one-two, and all that good shit
With a one-two, I take another sip
With a one-two, and I'll rock this party
With a one-two, ya better ask somebody
