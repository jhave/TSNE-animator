[Verse: Curren$y]
When I wrote this I was floating
Envisioning myself on the interstate ridin' and obviously smoking
Luxury sedan with the moonroof open
Inspiration for little niggas to zoom in and get focused
These girls just wanna go zoomin' in that Porsche 924 Turbo
Got it from an auction, celebrity owner
Might have been Sylvester Stallone, you never know, bruh
At least that's what I'm gonna tell these hoes, bruh
Season 5, that's what I call my newest flow
These spiders have yet to successfully clone my Season 4
Shut my sliding door, lighters up, let's go
Then light another chronic TKO
I gonna send my down bitch to the store
You know what I like
When you get back, I have four rolled
Fo sho, ugh

[Chorus: x2]
Smoking a jernt in a yella cab
Leaving Saks 5th Ave, hella bags
Bitch hella bad
I'm a tell that driver to go hella fast
Back to the crib, fly as a helipad
Yeah, bitch yeah</pre>
