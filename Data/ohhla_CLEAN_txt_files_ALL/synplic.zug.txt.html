[Anybody Killa]
Is my mind explicit cause I hang with a sinner
Hand in hand with the Hatchet but it's nothin' familiar
Non believers keep walking till we finally arrive
Black smoke around the family with the red in our eyes
Cold chills from the death, holding onto the past
With a pistol to the temple cause your life movin' fast
Devastated by the anger that you need to escape
Right hand on the book, flip the page, choose your fate

[Syn]
Kiss the dead on the red moon night
Will they cry, well I think they just might
Torturing, what's a frozen tear
This ain't hell, but I'd rather be there
Spiderweb, makes it hard to move
Death awaits, yet I have nothing to prove
Twisted soul, in my mental game
Murder comes and goes with no kind of blame

[Syn]
Power drains as the dark becomes light
Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight
What will ever become of this book that I hold
Will the fire burn us like they told, Synplicity

[Jamie Madrox]
Rain drops fall from the dark night sky
Bodies crawl from garbage cans and alley ways alike
You can find me there in the shadows without a doubt
Time for my people and me to come about
Children of the river and the misunderstood
Downtrodden and forgotten but still it's all good
Now what you throw away is ours to keep
You know the children need a pillow when they go to fuckin' sleep

[Syn]
Your disease, it's quite infectious
Once I know you're the object of my lust
Acid rain, come on and stick out your tongue
There's enough for each and every single one
Right or left, c-c-come follow me
Pyramids, l-lobotomy is necessary
Crystal ball, it's just Synplicity
Kings and queens, just show us where we should be, you motherfuckers

[Syn]
Power drains as the dark becomes light
Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight
What will ever become of this book that I hold
Will the fire burn us like they told, Synplicity

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I was runnin' with a Hatchet down the block
My leg got popped when I copped a dub at the dope spot
Everybody out to get me everywhere I go
Is it a sin to get your dick sucked by a ho, fuck no
What about the fact that I bring the dope guns
Stay outta my way and don't make me have to use one
Can't help the feeling, my head overloads
Pull the trigger and unload

[Syn]
Power drains as the dark becomes light
Trapped motionless cause the chords are too tight
What will ever become of this book that I hold
Will the fire burn us like they told, Synplicity
