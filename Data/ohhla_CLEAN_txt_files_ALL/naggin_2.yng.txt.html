What it is...
Most us women, we just good at what we do...
But what y'all need to remember is... Don't do what we do..
Ya do what we tell ya to do... C'mon..

Every now and then you get mad
You treat me bad and it makes me sad
Always in the street chasin ass
That's why a bitch be naggin'

When you get here I'll be gone
I've always known... I should'a left yo ass alone
That's why a bitch be...
When you get here I'll be gone
I've always known... I should'a left yo ass alone
That's why a bitch be...

This is for them niggaz who be swearin they catchin no feelin's cuz
Don't get ya self caught up in'a mess
Cuz half of them poppin the rest of them flesh ya'll
Better pay attention for I'ma put y'all up on a lil pimp and listen
When they flip the script ya try it to the hip and take ya to they whip
I'ma tell ya what I can't stand
Its when I end up with a half ass man
Gotta be like momma, hold his hand
Treat ya like shit cuz that's all ya understand
All ya care bout is hoes and them clothes and them shows
Cummin home 3 and 4 every nite
And got 'nan other time talkin to me outta line
When ya boy'z 'round ya always wanna shine

Every now and then you get mad
You treat me bad and it makes me sad
Always in the street chasin ass
That's why a bitch be naggin'

When you get here I'll be gone
I've always known... I should'a left yo ass alone
That's why a bitch be...
When you get here I'll be gone
I've always known... I should'a left yo ass alone
That's why a bitch be...

Suckin up on nothin... we know that hood stop frontin
Now it's a damn shame that you demented me trick...
Ain't never had no luv for no bitch..

But now I'm on my way up out the door

You shoulda thought about that before I gotta leave you alone
And I'ma take everything in the home...
