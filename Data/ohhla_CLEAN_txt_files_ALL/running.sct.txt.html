Song:   Running Outta Money
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

I ain't runnin' out of money no more
Found a hustle, nigga
Fuck the police!
Road runner

If a nigga get caught
Ain't nothin'
I be hustlin', I got money
The rap niggaz broke fake hustling
The rappers running, out of money
Real dope boy nigga I ain't frontin'
I turn nothin' into somethin'

I could see you haters' faces as we started
But I'm jigging, never running out of money

I see you hatin', but I love it
I'm just a hustler, and you ain't nothin'
You had a bud, but it's gone
You had some money, but it's gone
You ridin foreign, but it's a rental
Black Migo my niggaz winning jug house
It's my summer
Fuck a label I only sign with stunna

If a nigga get caught, ain't nothin'
I'll be hustlin', I got money
The rap niggaz broke fake hustling
The rappers runnin' out of money
Real dope boy nigga I ain't frontin'
I turn nothin' into somethin'
I could see you haters' faces as we started
But I'm jigging never running out of money

I get money selling dope
Brick man long way from foe
M&amp;M's, we call them millions
I done stack my money way past the ceiling
I'm one the ground I'm all shine
I know you rob, but you ain't never took mine
I've got a bank, but it won't fold
One hundred thousand in my hand whipping dope

If a nigga get caught ain't nothin'
I'll be hustlin', I got money
The rap niggaz broke fake hustlers
The rappers running out of money
Real dope nigga boy I ain't frontin'
I turn nothin' into somethin'
I could see you haters' faces as we started
But I'm jigging never running out of money

I got a deal, that's what they say
But I got deals on a yey
Cocaina, remix
Nobody trust Scooter he took slick
Ben Franklins, fuck a bitch
Fresh out of jail, lookin' like a lick
My bmg chain cost 2 bricks
And I got 60, 000 wrapped round my wrist

If a nigga get caught ain't nothin'
I'll be hustlin', I got money
The rap niggaz broke fake hustling
The rappers running out of money
Real dope boy nigga I ain't frontin'
I turn nothin' into somethin'

I could see you haters' faces as we started
But I'm jigging never running out of money</pre>
