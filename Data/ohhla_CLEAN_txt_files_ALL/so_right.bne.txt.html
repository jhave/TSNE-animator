[Krayzie Bone]
Yo, I think it's really time we let these niggas know
What's goin' on with Bone Thugs, mayne
Yeah, 'cause...

[Felecia and Krayzie Bone (Krayzie Bone)]
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
(With what we been goin' through)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
(Just where we're headin' to)
They don't know, they don't know, they don't know
(Come follow me now)

[Krayzie Bone]
They wanna' know if Bone Thugs +Sound the Same+
'Cause one of us left, but four of us remainin' the same
It'll be like  just pick up the album, mayne
I bet they'll refrain from all of their claims
You know we still the shit  hey, hey!
Light it up, light it up
I feel good, I feel good
Nigga, from my vibe, I feel good all over!
Been through rough times and they been mighty hard
We been ridin' in the dark
'Til I look in the light and my find spot!
We climbed so far, them haters was tryna bring me on down
But really, nobody can stop us with everything we know now!
Sucka-free, we see underneath all you fake thugs
From all these wack rappers, we come back to save ya'
None of you backstabbers will never-ever fade us
Man, I'm so glad we back in action  nigga, say what?

[Chorus 4x's: Felicia (Krayzie Bone)]
So good, so right
(If you really, really good to get just money, money)
Just me with you tonight

[Layzie Bone]
Who would've imagined, so many problems
Even the karma, I must admit
We been through so much crazy shit
That it's still in my mind, unsure and futhermore
Shit hurt, Bone Brothers did it with Bizzy
Supposed to be a new beginning
But, I'm screaming out, "Where is he?"
Yes, I miss him  how could I not?
When I know Bone is all he got
One day, we might get it together  fulfill the whole plot
I ain't gotta mention how I feel about that other thug
Flesh Bone  here you go, some lock-down love!
You know what really make me feel good
Krayzie Bone, Wish Bone  really keep it all hood!
That's right! We still pursuing our dream
There ain't no "I" in our team
That's why we doin' our thang!
We gettin' money, money

[Chorus 4x's: Felicia (Krayzie Bone) {Layzie Bone}]
So good
{Money, money}
So right
(If you really, really good to get just money, money)
To be with you tonight
{Money, money}

[Wish Bone]
They used to look and see a thug
Now, they look and see a paid thug
First niggas find and make this paper
Through the neighborhood!
Yes, we blessed  we know this!
So I drop to my knees and let 'em know who we rollin' with
Every night  make money, watch paper!
Grind now, fuck later!
If you miss it, gotta' battle back!
Get that money, money  need that!
Gimme some, I'll take that!
Since a youngster, knew about them greenbacks!
'Cause it ain't fo' all the money
Fuck what they sayin'  chase money!
Do without it, live without it!
I can't do that!
Live life  I like!
I need every penny
Pennies times this life  better give it to me, to me!

[Chorus 4x's: Felicia (Krayzie Bone)]
So good, so right
(If you really really good to get just money, money)
Just me with you tonight

[Outro - Part 1: Krayzie Bone]
Light it up, light it up
I feel good, I feel good
Nigga, from my vibe, I feel good all over!
Light it up, light it up
I feel good, I feel good
Nigga, from my vibe, I feel good all over!

[Outro - Part 2: Felecia (Layzie Bone)]
(Money, money)
So good
(Money, money)
So right
To be with you tonight</pre>
