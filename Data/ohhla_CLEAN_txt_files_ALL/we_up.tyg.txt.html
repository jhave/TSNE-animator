Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
All my niggaz that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggaz that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

[Verse]
Uh, just made 50 in a tri-state
I spend it all cause when you young you can't pace
I bet I double up, '99 Mase
My ex said "I be missing you" Miss faith
It takes 2, like Rob bass
All of them pretty, but a rock in a hard place
Meet a lot of girls, state to state
Some one nighters, some I might date
I'm a fat boy, slim skinny tatted face
Brown Louie hard case, make your jewelry sleep safe
On my king shit, like the middle east
And the swagga stink like Kimchi
I'm the sh-t ? for the money bags
Like ? throwing dead presidents
It's all good that you're living nice
But when I get it all my niggaz we gonna do it right

[Chorus]
All my niggaz that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggaz that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

And all my 9 to 5 niggaz we up tonight
And all my unemployed homies we up tonight
Always doing wrong trying to make it right
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

[Verse]
Like a new born in the cradle, uh
Feet first like a baby born backwards (we up, we up)
Tell the bank tell em time to re-up, re-up
Damn, everything I see calling ?
So many niggaz copying my style
Coming to america through a cloud
Just left Switz sold out crowds
Uh, Vietnamese chicks with the big smile
Pekingese puppy rapped in a beach towel
Killing me softly like Lauren Hill
Built for love but love won't keep it real
Can't waste time we up and dollar bills to my soul
In god we trust
I love mama when the keys but she down to fuck
Tell the bartender to fill me up, fill me up

[Chorus:]
All my niggaz that be hustling we up tonight
And all my niggaz that struggle we up tonight
And all the girls around the world going out tonight
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

And all my 9 to 5 niggaz we up tonight
And all my unemployed homies we up tonight
Always doing wrong trying to make it right
Take a shot make toast we up for life, and we up

Yeah, we up, yeah, we up, ow, we up
We up, yeah, oh, we up, ah, we up, we up

[Chorus]</pre>
