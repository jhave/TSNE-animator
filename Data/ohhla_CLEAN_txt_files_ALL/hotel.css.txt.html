[Intro - R. Kelly]
Ladies and gentlemen! (uh)
You are listenin to the sounds of Swizz Beatz (uh)
We got Cassidy in here, Kels!
We in our throwbacks (uh), this is for the ladies
We got room keys (Whoooo!)

[Chorus - R. Kelly] w/ {Swizz Beatz in background}
Girl you wanna come to my hotel
Baby I will leave you my room key
I'm feelin the way, you carry yo self girl
And I wanna get wit you, cause you's a cutie
So if you wanna come to my hotel
All you gotta do is holla at me
We still havin a after-party
Checkin out six in the mornin
(Six in the mornin, six in the mornin, six in the mornin)
Checkin out six in the mornin
(Six in the mornin, six in the mornin, ...the mornin)

[Verse 1 - Cassidy] + (Swizz Beatz)
(Talk to 'em Cass) I be stayin in a ho-tel, not the mo-tel
Or the Holiday Inn (Say whaaa?!)
If that girl, don't participate
Well then I'm gon' take her friend (Say whaaa?!)
But if, mami is wit it then, mami could get it if
Mami a rider, I'ma slide up inside the bomb
I got a suite, you could creep on through
I know you tryin to get yo freak on too (c'mon)

[Bridge - Cassidy] + (R. Kelly)
I do it all for the (ladies) yeah I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies) keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on (ladies) hot tub for (ladies)
Pop bub for the (ladies) I got love for my (ladies)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Cassidy] + (Swizz Beatz)
We the new car-tel, R. Kel
And the kid Cassidy (Say whaaa?!)
Girl if ya man, start actin up
Ask for him, or ask for me (Say whaaa?!)
Cause see, we could go get it crackin, but you know what'll happen
We be under the covers, makin love to each other
I got a double bed, one to sleep on
The other to get my freak on (frk-frk-frk-frk-frk)

[Bridge - Cassidy] + (R. Kelly)
It's all for (ladies) yeah I ball for the (ladies)
Hit the mall for the (ladies) keep it fly for the (ladies)
Keep my eye on (ladies) hot tub for (ladies)
Pop bub for the (ladies) I got love for my (ladies)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Cassidy]
We goin Chi-Town step it out, to the club lettin out
Then we gon' sex it out, til we all checkin out
I got my chicks, I'm gon' bring to the telly
We bout to do the damn thing, sing to 'em Kelly

[R. Kelly] w/ {Swizz Beatz in background}
It's alright (It's alright)
If you wanna come wit me

Baby in my hotel suite
And it's ok (It's ok)
If you wanna party night, til day
I will do anything ya say
Just come - to - my - hotel

[Chorus]
