[KiD CuDi]
You sit and think about how you can hit the scene
Take one look inside your mirror clear to see
You need to find yourself as honest as can be
There must be fifty ways to make a record
Now don't get wrapped into, the hype and what they think
This shit ain't rocket science,
and the scene changes with beats
And now you ask yourself, how you want to be seen
There must be fifty ways to make a record
He's up inside the clubs
they like to lean and rock
Oh, stands around and looks intrigued by what he saw
Now he askes me, how he can make hit songs to reach the top...
There must be fifty ways to make a record...
Fifty ways to make a record...

[KiD CuDi]
You got talent and, your soul cannot be bought
He looked and smiled at me and told me, "Thanks a lot."
See I could use your help...
And would you please explain about the fifty ways...
It's kind of easy, if you have a open mind
This game is more than spending money and fucking dimes
It's all within your words some shit that outlives time
There must be fifty ways to make a record...
Fifty ways to make a record...</pre>
