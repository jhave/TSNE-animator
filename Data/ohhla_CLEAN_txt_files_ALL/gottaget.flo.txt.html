Gotta get that money dancer

She's a nasty dancer
Dancing for money
Do what you wanna do
Gotta get that money dancer
She's a freaky dancer
Dancing she loves it
Do what you gotta do
Gotta get that money dancer

She's a nasty dancer

Do what you wanna do
Gotta get that money dancer
She's a freaky dancer
Dancing she loves it

Hey I want one of them nasty girls
All over my body like a back seat girl
Upfront when you give it and attract me girl
First let me say you're my blackberry pearl

Hold up shawty shouting out for the world
Going out to the stage all the freaks won't hurt
Money in her waist when you're gonna get served
Don't trip when you tickle I'm a let you feel her curves

Take off her clothes get loose for that dough

Shown up the ? she poppin' that reload
Never know an excuse for a girl in freak mode

Yep she the real deal
Yep she my holla girl
Yep from the head to tail
Yep shawty outta here
