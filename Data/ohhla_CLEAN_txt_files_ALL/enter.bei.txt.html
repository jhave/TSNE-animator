[Chorus: Mike Posner]
I only hit the club if I want to cause I be bringing bitches to the crib
I think you should tell me what you gone do cause these other hoes will tell me what it is
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it

Open your mouth and I'll pour in alcohol
She think I love her, I'm thinking not at all
Cocked up, he top was off
We party mazel-tov
Rosé sipping, Hennessy tipping

[Chorus]

Rosé sipping, Hennessy tipping
Made a few dollars but ain't shit different
Rosé sipping, Hennessy tipping
Made a few bucks shit, maybe shit different
I only hit the club if I want to cause I be bringing bitches to the crib
I think you should tell me what you gone do cause these other hoes will tell me what it is
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it

I walk up in the party, fucked up
Say I'm geeked up, bitch I ain't geeked up
20 [?] bitches get walking in the Waffle House
Give a fuck about a mother fucker
Swag

I took to [?] to the session cause my money been inventing
But she gone tell me what it is
I got tatted on my neck and sagging in my skinnies
But Mike Posner still wearing Diggy's
(Whatever)

[Chorus]

That's what it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it
What it is (what it is)
What it is (what it is)
These other hoes will tell me what is it</pre>
