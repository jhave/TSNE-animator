[Intro]
You're my lady always been so true
This is why, I sing this song for you
And you're my lady, always in my life
And I wanna thank you, for being down to ride

[Verse 1]
Forever yours forever mine our love will always
Shine no matter the situation you where always
By my side never the less you brought the
Best of me, the years that I' lived
Only love that I got my right hand by best friend
Who must of sent Such an angel to this world
That is cold you belong in the heavens not this
Ignorant world you're my girl my all best thing
A man could ever have
Im glad that your mine and I'm proud to be your man
Understand that theres no other if there is just
A few staying true like you never breaking
No rule lord forgive me for the things I have done
To you if you werent up in my life I wouldn't know
What to do wont complain about no money didn't
Faze when I was broke all we needed was each other
Love to strong to let go
If I die tonight all I wanna let you know
Remenise on what we had hold me thight
And don't let go girl

[Chorus]
Oh girl you're the one for me
Never ever let me down 
You will always be around 
Girl I have to thank you baby
Always standing by my side 
So don't you ever leave my life

[Verse 2]
Even through these hard times we continue to face
It's like deep inside of me you could never be Replaced
Like when we struggle we get tested in faith
But you been strong and stood by me every step-a-the-way
I thank the lord for the day he brought you into my life
Changed my world -my destiny - and gave me new life
So if you got somebody special - that's always been true
Show love and take note in everything that they do
I could neva take for granted what she's done for me
Even when we desagree she still stands by me
Late night - road trips- showin' mad support
The typa-girl-that every homie should be keepin' close
Cuz your that typa-a-girl that neva let me down
Encouraged me to see the light when no one else would come
Around, down when I had money- and down when I was broke
So if I die tonight hold me tight and don't let go!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I guess that you can say I owe my life to you the
Only dream that really matters is to be with you cuzz
Even though we argue and we fight some times
Youll always be my queen untill the end of times
Im giving love to the one that always stood by my side
If you ever need me baby for you I give my life
You been so true thats why its you these feelings I wont
Hide my love goes out to you girl I never leave your side yeah

[Chorus]</pre>
