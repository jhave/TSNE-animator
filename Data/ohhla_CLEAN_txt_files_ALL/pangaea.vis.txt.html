[CHORUS]
We started as one, then we drifted
separated as continents that shifted
all the pieces fit can't you see the
togetherness Visionaries Pangaea

(KeyKool)
It all began together
before we ever ran together
before we ever took a stand together
we understand that whether or not
we tether a knot for humanity
we must stand to weather the hatred. separation
it's easier to make than break it we're breakin'
stereotypes with the yes yall on the mic
get yourself right we're not all alike
but fall right into place face adversity
appreciate diversity nursery to university
past any degree see universally
dispersing the verse commercially or underground
one love bound by culture and sound
been around the world and no denying
we're all under the same sun so keep shining

(LMNO)
The planet's so small with all the origins
which ever one you're in we get the light pouring in
we pass segregation with unification
savages invading civilizations
riddle the nation with belittlement
we lift off without aviation we're only divided by distance
it's an honor this is outstanding
an 8 year flight came in for the landing
we spread all over the map
instead of stripping the culture we give love back

[CHORUS]

(Zen)
As I walk through the labyrinth halls past the cell walls
I recall a 200,000 dream of an African Queen passing her genes
to all of our mothers silver spoons to the gutter redeem the structure
we've seen destruction and how we rebuild from nothing
slaves to infiltration of the government
a smoke ring puffed in the air
the soul's microcosmic JAH is forever the spark
behind the artist with the krylon fantip
bombin' panoramics with an eye on Atlantis
cataclysmic Egypt is geometrically linked to Asian and Mayan pyramids
this indigenous mystic knew the movements of the stars
when there were no satellites to probe the darkness
behold the arc it's esoteric eternal and inherited
we are all connected Vision on some next ish

(2Mex)
Travel mother earth don't forget your Aunt-arctica
remember that Uncle Africa's part of ya
Pisces high seas Caribbean
indigenous Indian aquatic amphibian
from the isles of the South Atlantic
my revolutionary styles they mouth gigantic
rhythmic riddles from the Middle East (ha)
Asian hymnals get rid of the beast (ha)
South American Brazilian high lands
through out the area hit million's lives man
roping off Oceana enveloped by the whole sea and a...
improbable provinces the fences in your mind is where the only fence is
2Mex rocks steady over granite (ha)
trotted the globe ready for another planet

(Dannu)
Let's carry our brothers carry our sisters
weight of world is hard to hold we showing blisters
it was always in the cards when GOD dealt it
the lands got shuffled and all the bridges melted
so we sharpened up our tools and got the point across
the Visionarie arc reunites love lost
we higher learning with lower incomes
and in the middle of battlefield for freedom
we take a stand joining hands in a circle man
represent the world just a local band understand
Pangaea see, the only separation is 6 degrees and rough seas</pre>
