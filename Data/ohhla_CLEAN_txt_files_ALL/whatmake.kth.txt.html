[Keith Murray]
Throw ya sets up nigga throw ya sets up
Throw ya sets up nigga throw ya sets up
Throw ya sets up nigga throw ya sets up

[Chorus]
Ayo what make a nigga think dat (dat what?!)
That I wont stab 'em in the gut (stab 'em up!)
You gangstas laying on the ground (lay 'em down!)
Now you know how I get down (get down!)

[Keith Murray]
Ayo its mister Beef Murray niggas know, how I be dealin' it
Homicide style niggas know, how I be killin' it
You playin' games, but when I catch you it'll stop
I ain't no killer, nigga but you heard Tupac (don't push me)
Ayo they love to analyze my clashin' style of fashion
Vocab action indicate raw dog passion
You better just, get dough, stay low, fo sho
'Cause we bringin' to niggaz when E, give us the say so
My squad like the crowd 'cause they hold me up
I get wack rap niggas on rapdaphobia
You wanna gravel, nigga I ain't arguin' with you
When I get that butterfly in my stomach I know
Thats when I'ma hurt you
Niggas wanna pop shit, I got that, cocked it
Hop in the whip, hit the gas, lean wit it rock wit it
Shit, we can take it to the streets you on ho
'Cause I mostly grew up hurtin' niggaz and sellin' dope

[Chorus] 2x

[Illegal]
Introducin' the villain
Ruckin' raw 'til I'm peelins' them niggas see
Blastin on these bitches and niggas who ain't fellin me
Unh! This is Def Squad Clique shit bitch
Villain at it, bounce to this, even smoke an ounce to this
Thickin' and mixin' yo hoes, mobbin' and maxin' yo souls
Its just the way that we ride, case closed
East and west, north and south we about to route there
I bet they shout there, them niggas be out there, no doubt yeah
Be me, E, Red, and Keith
'll shove steel toe in yo grill till you lack teeth
And leave that emcee shit to passionate Khali
So dont be bluffin', I know you heard how we be snuffin'
These jack fakin' jaw jackers, in this world of rap
Be talkin' this and that can't walk half that crap
Check it, in the game for too long playa to watch the best
Hustle and bustle use they muscle to they death
What make you think I won't slump you

[Chorus] 2x

[Keith Murray]
And I'ma outrovert nigga gemini will flip
(I'll bust ya head boy) You get on some bullshit
(What you makin' all that noise for) You ain't really live
(What you smokin' on that dirt for) It don't get you high
Let me remind yo ass, just in case you forget
I know you mother fucker, you soft as yogurt
Everyone of your bars nintendo
My squad'll serve every nigga in the club like a bartender

[Chorus] 2x

[Keith Murray]
Baggy bones in the house</pre>
