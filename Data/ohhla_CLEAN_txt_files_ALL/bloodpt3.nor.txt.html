Yo, New York get the blood money
Dirty cash, smoke hydro green, still mix it wit hash
To all the weed spots, niggas know I'm known to cop
All the good shit, you smell me nigga?
I'm on some hood shit

New York get the blood money
Dirty cash, smoke hydro green, still mix it wit hash
To all the weed spots, niggas know I'm known to cop
All the good shit, you smell me nigga?
I'm on some hood shit

[Noreaga]
Bring it back to the essence when I first rhymed
L.A., L.A. - when y'all niggas first heard me
I was starving on the train just selling my caine
Fast forward to '99, it's still the same
But now I got a car keep my rims, up to par
Only stay in hotels that be five-star
Queens - Akineyle, Mobb Deep, and Escobar
Lost Boyz, Run DMC, Pone and me
No disrespect but Queens got this shit locked D
Yo New York get the bloody money, kid watch me
You know my tempo, I can do it fast or slow
Eat some bubble-gum weed and yell "Geronimo"
All my analog thugs and my digital thugs
For my people that be rowdy wit weed in the clubs
For my knives and four fifths, Bloods and Crips
For my people who smoke Phillies, and knows it splits
And to the niggas on the block that, rock my shit
To the crackhead, waking up the cops and shit
For all the liquor stores, that ain't no good
To all the stocked ones everywhere that be in the hood
For all my people on welfare, don't even care
For all them people gettin money, livin in Bel-Air

[Capone]
Yo, New York get the blood money
Dirty cash, smoke hydro green, still mix it wit hash
To all the weed spots, niggas know I'm known to cop
All the good shit, you smell me nigga?
I'm on some hood shit

New York get the blood money
Dirty cash, smoke hydro green, still mix it wit hash
To all the weed spots, niggas know I'm known to cop
All the good shit, you smell me nigga?
I'm on some hood shit

[Noreaga]
Yo, time zone, got blown, madi gon
My niggas get high and still fall in the zone
Bitches, callin me up and hanging up
I ain't a playa, so why y'all hoes playin games?
I'm a hustla, and I even hustle the same
I got hoes fooled thinkin I love em, when I don't love em
And once I get the ass yo you know I'ma thug em
Tell em lies, hit em in they head, hit em wit bread
I'm a millionaire bitch, I could trick instead
Of you lookin foul and you fuckin wit me
N.O.R.E., thuggish nigga out here B
Bloody Money once again, yo this one part three
Classical song, certified, Desert Storm
For my niggas always there when I perform
And scream "What what," when I scream "What what"
Straight wildin, in Superthug and they all be stuck
Have y'all niggas ready to fight, hoes ready to fuck
