Typed by: www.rakim.net

(1st verse) 
If I lay low and let the day go it'll slow my payroll 
Aye-yo I'm a terrorize charge and slay shows 
Ra slay flows go as far as the Barbados 
On the turntable sound like tornadoes 
My style is performed like tropical storms 
Your not to get on the whole spot will get torn 
I keep the metropolitan hollering and bring the dollars in 
Keep the models following wise as King Solomon 
Come slow through the jungle like an animal 
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal 
From Long Island to Queens light up the New York scenes 
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between 
Left to go bless a show in Mexico 
Next Thing I know it's extra cold I see Eskimo's 
Time to rock get it hot soon as I get in there 
Spit in they ear so flow they froze and I disappear 
  
(Chorus)(2x) 
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me 
It's inherited it runs in the family 
  
(2nd verse) 
They said I was a head of my time or either here before 
To see the idea clear it takes a year or more 
Now times that by the years I reign straight-seven 
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven 
The silence's a set back make em regret that 
One way to get back is violence and wet cats 
But hold your head black or I'll never rap again 
Just when I thought I was out they pulled me back in 
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interfering 
Then I'm a go back to the gat and racketeering 
My sabotage is camaflouge and espionage 
You ain't havin Ra so don't test the god 
I'm takin' all orders I can't afford extorters 
I hit em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters 
So warn a friend tell em it's on again 
If it's a freestyle bust in a park I want in 
  
(Chorus)(2x) 
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me 
It's inherited it runs in the family 
  
(3rd verse) 
I managed to get paid for a decade now add three years on to that 
Perform with a knack yes I was born to rap 
The mic Lebanon Teflon don is back 
I strike with better bombs and armed to attack 
So reload the van go ahead let em in 
Every tours a war and I'm on the road again 
Suprise a town the place it's live and loud 
We vibin' now I go wild and dive in the crowd 
Never hit the ground they catch me and carry me around 
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down 
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-tali 
I'm known as the microphone Muhammad Ali 
I'm worldwide my brothers be biggin' me up 
Keep the girls occupied lovin' diggin' me what 
Ain't around when I come to town they mad glad 
Like Saddaam they even say I'm the bomb in Baghdad 
  
(Chorus)(4x) 
It's a must that I bust any mic that you hand to me 
It's inherited it runs in the family</pre>
