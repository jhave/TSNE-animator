(Queens Most Wanted)
"Yo Black B, what's the deal?
What's popping?"

"Ain't nothing"

"Aight, what's the deal?
We got to get this paper y'all 
This cat had to come through or something"

"I hope his paper's is long"

"Aight, youknowI'msayin?
I got this cat about to come up here though
I'ma tell you about it later, (mumbles) oh shit is real
Aight catch ya"

(*Freaky Tah says "Now" several times*)

(Mr. Cheeks)
I'm in this tight situation
I'm at this chicks crib uptown 
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down 
Now it seems like a set-up 
and niggaz try to wet me from the door 
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour 
Shot through the glass hit the balcony 
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain
There's beef walkers walkin I gotta play it cool 
Even though he's firm with that I walk covered up my jewel
I'm in a tight situation (*Mr. Cheeks raps in the background*)

"Black B the shit went down world wide B"

"Word, what happened?"

"Yo nigga started mouthing off
I don't know if nigga's still breathing
All I know is that I made moues"

"Well yo, 8 moues I'ma need you my fault
I'll meet you there"

"Aight"

(Mr. Cheeks)
...real in this battlefield violence being born 
Get your shit in a year, but prepare for war
Now I peep this grocery store I'm off the train station 
I ain't showin nobody love I'm holdin no conversation
I cop me a (???) a few Dutch's now I'm out 
That's Queens for some ammo, no doubt
I jetted down the staircase purchased me a Togan
I gave the freak a smirk listen jerk I'm not joking
Now listen money, can you tell that me to the E, hey?
I'm going through this bullshit at 3:53 in the morning 
Word to moms I can't believe she tried to hit me 
I knew something was fishy but she said she comin to get me 
Talkin about my work and talkin she bring me back
but on the low I didn't notice she'll be robbing when the jack 
I'm sittin on the train I feel the wind with my brain across some dirt 
I'm in the zone I got my motherfuckin crumpy murdy niggaz lookin at me 
they owe money, they only bluffing besides I got two slides before arch and such fuck them niggaz 
I lit up my bone jumped in the nine niggaz know what I mean
I'm in my Queens State of mind 
Jumped off the rock-away it's just a block away from Planners
The block is rather hot they got surveillance tapes and cameras
I seen none of my peeps up on the streets so I keep movin
He follows with de-cursing em I know that some of my crew been hurt
My mind need a touch I roll a touch up while I'm walkin 
I take a step for step dolo Dutch and my toilets and my cells
Can't put my finger on just what happened 
Me and shorty actin in the ghetto tappin and then they clappin

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
Yo it's real in this battlefield this shit is raw they told us 
Like we did but prepare for war 
Yo in tight situations, life and death decisions 
The nine mill lookin over head at the losers
Yo it's real in this battlefield violence being born
Yo get your life in gear but prepare for war
Yo it's tight situations, life and death decisions
Nine mills with the livin dead 
Yo is that how you handle your businesses 
Yo still in this battlefield violence being born 
But yo shitty year but prepare for war 

(Mr. Cheeks)
It's 12 am the next day, the best day 
Niggaz at the table smokin weed cleanin text-ay
We got this spannable at 10 and really war
Jack Deanal's headline, man it's time to score 
I'm in Terran from the spot where I went out 
Smoke about the situation that re-meant out
Now each man on the corner now he watchin me    
I forgots he poppin anybody tryin to stop the shit 
Perfect, shorties asleep didn't even hear me creep 
Now keep it fellas it gets deep   
Lit up from motherfucker nail, smacked in the real
When she rose I had to cease the deal
Before she could reply threw the gun down her throat 
Threw the bits in the yolk its no joke 
I'm a infamous person then I put five in her 
Then take my cats out to dinner 

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
These tight situations, life and death decisions  
Nine mills are livin dead is head or head collisions
It's real in this battlefield violence being born 
Get your life in gear but prepare for war 
See it's tight situations, life and death decisions
Nine mills with the livin dead is head or head collisions 
Man it's real in this battlefield violence is born
Get your shit in gear but prepare for war
Work hard work hard
