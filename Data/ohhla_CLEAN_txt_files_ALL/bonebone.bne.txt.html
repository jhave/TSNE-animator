Who be the niggas that be sneakin' the pistol up in the party?

(Bone Thugs) Keepin' it realer than real in the field
Niggas that's packin' that steel
Who be the niggas that sold over 30 million strong? (million strong)
(Bone Thugs) Who was dem niggas in black?
Who was dem niggas wit straps?
Who was dem niggas that's bustin' back at the got damn law?
(At the got damn law) (Bone Thugs)
Who was dem niggas that Crept On Ah Come Up &amp; did it Eazy?
Who was dem niggas that didn't get of they thang leadin' Cleveland?
(Bone Thugs) Smokin' the weed or the fever,the reefa
That keep 'em a pot of that sweetest cheeba
Nigga yo y'all know who that is (Bone Thugs)
Dem niggas that sing, dem niggas that rap
They got everybody tryna do that
Fuck recognizing nigga, they better respect, who, who, who?
 (Bone Thugs) I done told these niggas that Bone is the shit
So keep on rollin ya spliff, and smoke a blunt to this shit
 (Bone Thugs)

[Layzie]
Who was the nigga that thugged in the streets? Number one on the charts?
And who was the nigga that's pullin' ya card?
And nigga show that we had nothin' but heart (Bone Thugs)
And who be the nigga that come to my side when it's about murder?
My niggas, my niggas will hurt ya
You better believe it, when we comin' to serve ya (Bone Thugs)
We be dem niggas fo' life, we tighter than tight, doing what we like
And who was the nigga that told ya to get down for your rights? (Bone Thugs)
Now who be the niggas that step in the club makin' everythang pause?
So fresh, so clean, no flaws. Who be the rawest clique you done saw?
(Bone Thugs) Damn right we keep it original out of da door
Hit him up quick wit' the flip flop flow
Then we introduce you to Mo (Bone Thugs)
Dem niggas that reignin' supreme
Hustled to conquer our drea m (dream)
Forever untouchable team
What nigga be out here gettin' this green? (Bone Thugs)
Blowin' green, rollin' the hood, glock cocked on safety
And who be the niggas that knew you was fake?
But sayin away from y'all lately (Bone Thugs)

And you can put this on Stack

[Wish]
Who be the niggas that thug in the back of the club?
Ready to scrap, nigga buck, nigga what
Who be the niggas that check ya, disrespect ya? (Bone Thugs)
Who be the niggas that wanna maintain?
And do them thug thangs?
But if disrespected who gon let it bang? (Bone Thugs)
Who was the niggas we rushed?
Who was dem niggas that talk about us?
Who was the nigga that say that the thugsta mentality?
Better him than us
Bone Thugs finally let loose
Total control who's business is it anyway (Bone Thugs)
Gotta life
Better leave it alone
Been supresssed too long
Now that we out on our own
Ya gotta see the free Bone (Bone Thugs)
Who be the niggas that come in anybody hood and straight kick it?
Who be the niggas that always got the weed, the drink, and dyme bitches?
(Bone Thugs) I'm tired of hearin' "What happened to us?"
"When will we hear a Bone bust?"
Who be the niggas that's bringin' that thuggish ruggish no matter what?
(Bone Thugs)
Believe we nothin' but truth
What would the game do?
Without you know who?
Niggas that say and do
What they want to (Bone Thugs)

[Bizzy]
This rap game terror
Money, murda mo, and all that good shit
Scandalous niggas, respect this (Bone Thugs)
Ask about my....20 inch deep dish rims
Son of a chicken, it ain't no friends
When it come to the end
And i'ma say word to gangstas
Real killas wit money to burn
Sayin' we a lost cause, foster kids-preach the world (Bone Thugs)
Thank god that I had a father
I'm pushed in that cocoa with my sister
When I was 14 
Like cancer victims (Bone Thugs)
Uh huh
Cause haters they get quarantined
Women they comin' with sorcery
I'm livin' wit' curses, smokin' weed (Bone Thugs)
Burn me
Don't bury me
Hurry before my mama come see me
Somebody call Johnny Cochran
Some niggas they wanna be Biggie
Some niggas they wanna be 'Pac
But I just wanna be Bizzy
As soon as they hear me, they spit me
Like Richard Simmi
Don't run away, where's your nuts at
It's the original hydro smokers, somebody bust that
Trust that, what's packin' (Bone Thugs)
