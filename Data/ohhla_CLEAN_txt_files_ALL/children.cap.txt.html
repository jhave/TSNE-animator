[Intro: Cappadonna] 
Whateva, whateva man 
I'm here to represent G-O-D to the fullest 
I got a message man, and the message is straighten up 
Or get eatin up 

[Culture] 
All mighty God is with us (2X) 

[Chorus 2X: Cappadonna ] 
Save the children, these streets is like a villain 
Life is like a chop shop inside of the buildin 
Save the children, these streets is like a villain 
Save the children, let the blood stop spillin 

[Cappadonna] 
Roses are red, violets are blue, this life is about me and you 
Not the red, white and the untrue, together we stand 
Divided we stand tall, final call, God save us all from the gates of Hell 
Where my young family dwell, it was a tall well 
While we still suffer, days are gettin tougher 
Jake on the prowl, treatin people on the street foul 
Some of them mean well, but they all live behind the shell 
Kick my door down, without ringin my bell 
Claim I'm sellin crack, but I ain't doin that 
All I do is rap, I'm a real MC, trynna get my life back 
Devils'll make it difficult, there it glow within the cult 
Can't wait to cut my throat, cuz of how I speak 
Too black for Hot 97, last year they put me on hold 
But I still went gold, where the joy go? 
What happened to the +Black Boy+ video? 
Bring +Run+ back, y'all scared of Cap 
Sleepwalkers can't roll wit the blacks 

[Chorus 1.5X] 

[Culture] 
See the man dem him, he went from nice to true drunko 
Now me speak the truth and a man just a den dead 
Wit the children, when I told you I be on the outside 
I can't trust with him, not pity on the outside 
I'm hung it with him, tell him that I carry 
Tell dem save the children 
You sold your bread, I sold my bread 
So ya meet my new friend, Mr. Up-On-The-Ten 
Then are ready to bust, let me load again 
And the play gon sting, just like stealth bomber 
Refuel the jet, because me loose me venom 
Jewels we do, and refuse not to sin 
And when I come hotter, don't work for Jah 
Hittin though we gettin, well that's the word is dark 
Brother gettin children, some lovin the hard 

[Chorus 2X] 

[Culture] 
A mighty God is with us 

[Cappadonna] 
Intelligent minds, encounters of the third kind 
Trapped behind enemy lines, youth life on the line 
Devils keepin us blind if it wasn't for Divine 
Contracts wouldn't be signed, save the children 
It's like a chop shop inside the buildin 
No second guessin, I'm confessin 
In the club females are undressin 
Little ones with the sexual affection need correction too 
For too many years, shippin us upstate 
Plantin drugs on us, the children ain't safe 
Broke down our families, then they build gates 
Sow holes in our brain like life is an earthquake 
Stole our language so we couldn't meditate 
Even in the schools where the teachers taught hate 
Falsify history, everythin is fake 
Use your third eye when you dealin with snakes 
Let freedom ring, Born Love Allah, see the king 
Save the children is the song I sing 
While I'm layin in the struggle absorbin the sun rays 
Holdin the children in the last days 
We're livin like slaves, modern day style 
Save the children, make em cry for me now 
Save the children, make em cry for me now 

[Outro: Culture] 
Cry for me now, no sight killin 
Yagga yaw, them try kill me now 
Yagga yaw, dem cry for me now 
Save the children, Dem cry for me now 
Ya all pigs, you nah 
You ya, yea yea, God is with us 
Bad man nah know, cry for me now, blaow! 

[Skit Outro: Cappadonna (?)] 
Yo, man, I ain't got nothin to say to ya niggas, man 
Word up, just get the album or get the fuck lost 
(Be like, fuck it I'm done) 
Yeah, (God bless, good night) </pre>
