[Chorus]
Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hold on hoe - AYYY~! {*4X*}

[Intro]
Don't run up on me like you know me player - hold on hoe
I'm smokin kush you on that reggie - hold on hoe
Them diamonds ain't real, tuck your chain in - hold on hoe
Ay, ay back back, I'ma do my thang then - hold on hoe

[Unk]
Ol' bitch-ass nigga make me laugh, can't even bust Welch's grape
My fault they hoes in my face, I pump they mouths just like weights
I blowin kush it tastes great, come 50 deep like the mob
I'm stackin stack after stack, so haters get on your job
I'm callin shot after shot, whether you like it or not
You try to jack what I got, I'll bust yo' ass on the spot
Come try me, I see ye ain't hard without'cha boys huh? (Hold on hoe)
Unlock them toys and bring the noise huh? (Hold on hoe)

[Chorus]

[Baby D]
Ay hold on hoe, hold on hoe, don't be walkin up on on me too fast
Lookin slick, talkin slick, but ain't no sucker for no ass
Look at the J's up on my feet, and the suede up on my seats
Check out the shades up on my face bitch! I ain't cheap
Hold on hoe, hold on hoe, I done told you once befo'
That I don't be rappin fast, these niggaz just listen slow
So hit the blunt twice and, keep it movin steady
We smokin purple kush bitch, this ain't no motherfuckin reggie
I'm in the A! Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hoe
All day! I put on hoe, put on put on hoe
You see the stacks in my pocket, the Oomp Camp gettin bigger
I'm Baby D, or you can call me that nigga

[Chorus]

[Parlae]
Now hold on hoe, who gon' be the next to go?
Who gon' be the next to blow? Give a nigga extra throat
I'm the next to blow, my jewelry got a extra glow
Look at my chain bitch, my diamonds made by eskimos
I got extra dough, I got a cold wrist
Look at my pinky ring, my ears look like froze piss
How much yo' chain? How my much my chain? That's a whole brick
I leave these hoes sick, my right wrist look like froze Crist'
I know this - we the motherfuckin shit~!
Oomp Camp and Franchize in this fuckin bitch
Hold on hoe, hold on hold on hold on hoe
DFB, we got solo solo dough

[Chorus]</pre>
