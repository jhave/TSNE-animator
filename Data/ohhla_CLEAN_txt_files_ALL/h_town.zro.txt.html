(Track)
H-Town, going down, ooooh
Oh yeah (know we talking bout)
Aaaay, ay

[Hook: Track]
I'm oooooooout, H-Toooooown
These niggaz, need to know what I'm talking about
Oooh you know, it's going down tonight
So get ready, you gots to be ready

[E.S.G.]
I'm talking two bedrooms, gated residential-aire
E.S.G. and Boss Hogg, ask the Presidential playa
Roley, mansion, my click expanding fa sho
Swanging on 4's banging Z-Ro, smoking on do' close the 4 do'
Looking so thoed you know me, see them agents can't hold me
E and Slim on the track, we like Shaq and Kobe
Alley-oop out the Coupe, and my troops gon march
From the South to the North, look for the ice in the starch
There we go there we go, see our diamonds gon glow
Houston Texas in the do', pour a pint fuck a fo'
No longer sitting low, changed my 4's to twenty three's
FUBU on my chest, platinum Roley under my sleeve
Riding V fucking 12's, keep the V-6
Me and Rich getting rich, add shocks into my shit
Who the click, playing it raw we wire your jaw
E.S.G., Presidential Playas, we outlaws huh

[Hook: Track]

[Slim Thug]
I'm out that H-Town Tex, where they don't barre plex
Invisible set around my neck, I look good and reflect
The Slim Thugger, on 23's burning rubber
Sometimes I wanna shine, sometimes I roll undercover
I'm from the City of Syrup, where young G's slang birds
Looking good by the herds, full of that endo herb
Nothing less, Down South we puff on the best
When I blow I just say no, to that stress oh yes
See I'ma clown top down, pop trunk and surround
If you love me you gon smile, if you hate me you gon frown
We hold it down, Boss Hogg Outlaws ain't po'
When I'm in town I can be found, checked in the top flo'
Presidential playa, with mo' respect than a mayor
Super thoed flow sayer, and I ain't no sprayer
Slim Thug, E.S.G., putting it down with the car
We Presidential playas, taking over the charts ha

[Track]
See these Presidential playas know it's going down
(going down) they know it's going down (going down) yeeah
See these H-Town playas know it's going down
(going down) going down (going down) yaaay-yaay (going down)

[H20]
See we sitting blow do in the low-low, rolling killing
Bout to break the coffee down, dump it in the swisha
I see them niggaz in the front, talking loud and capping
True bad boys, move in silence make it happen
My niggaz, get smoked out high niggaz
Branded up down to ride, for G.I. niggaz
We ain't gangstas, but demand respect
Ay yo let's cash some checks, while them other niggaz plex
Money, sex and hoes and hoes
People screaming my name, doing sold out shows
Ain't got time for rap wars, we gon shine like stars
People see me at the bar, with E.S.G. in a car
Fuck em all I'ma ball, with my niggaz that stack
And just love to smoke sacks, with they mind on mack
I'm a Presidential playa, nigga you ain't know
G.I.N. branded up, going down fa sho

[Hook: Track]

[Lyrical 187]
I passed that Harm Clark, and Buffalo and Few Quay
Woke up on the North, at Antoine and Golf Back
While I'm out here, I need to go and get that Swisha House tape
With them freestyles, the one that 5000 Watts made
In H-Town we put it down, from the North to the South
Gold grills and platinum pieces, ballas holding down shop
Seems full of chickens, clocking in the parking lots
Be careful with that drank, cause the laws stay hot
MLK to Homestead, playa choose your spot
You know it's warm around this 3rd Coast, so drop your tops
G.I.N. and Presidential, with that boy from Wreckshop
And Mr. Slim Thug, we feel we can't be stopped
It's been a long time coming, the sleeping down had to wait
Now it's too late, them Texas boys got too much weight
So stop hating, you know you know the way we put it down
For the Dirty Dirty South, representing H-Town

[Track]
I wish, got my G's from H-Town, it's going down
I wish, got my G's from H-Town, it's going down

[Hook: Track]

(Track)
See these Presidential playas, they stay ready (ready)
Moving Cheves (Cheves), ooooh-oooh-ooh
See these Presidential playas, they stay ready (ready)
Moving Cheves (Cheves) oh-I oh-I</pre>
