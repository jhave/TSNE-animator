Cruisin' down the
I'm cruisin' down the
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
And I tell em' mane...
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up

Uh, shit
Well it's that drank sipping, paint dripping
Getting charged, nigga I ain't tripping
Play that nigga I'm a play that nigga
She gon pay that nigga, I'm straight pimping
Got ashley, she from south park
Wet pussy, that's know it soft
But a nigga like me don't touch shit
Bitch, gotta keep my budget fit
Diamond chain, black range, double cup, no stains
Lost a lot, no pain
Bought a yacht, no gain
Switch house, [?]
Hold it down for the old gang
New nigga on new shit, but don't you play me for a ho mane
Nigga know that I putting on, she take it off she don't put it on
She leave it in my collection draw, and then she tried to put on my new cologne
That's polo, so low, dolo, jojo, can't see
And my speakers pullin' up - and I'm

I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
And I tell em' mane...
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up

Two tone lac' with the sunroof rack
Parked outside, sitting on 4's
Jump out, boy still hot on my trial
I'm on that oh and it's still on my toes
20 top mop filled up with hoes
Bop was bitter cause they been exposed
Pull yo' feelings up out of your pockets
Get on your grind and stack up your O's
Where there's dough, is where I roam
I drive slow, no school zone but I'm in the zone
Sippin' the 4
Smoking that cone, hell yeah I'm blown
I'm getting that money until I'm gone
They on that hay, but still I'm on
I'm on they cake
I'm on these dimes
They on my nuts, lemme get that dome
They want my bone, I don't love these sluts
Windows up and I'm on my way
Off that bullshit, on my pay
Above these seats is blue over gray
I grind all day, no time for play
Get money is all I do
I got cash to make and hearts to break
And I'm on that, baby and that's true
Knowmtalmbout?
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
I'm cruisin' down the ave and I'm looking good
I got my diamonds up against they wood
And I tell em' mane...
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up
Knowmtalmbout, hold up</pre>
