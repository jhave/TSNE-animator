Mr. Meth, Funk Doc
1 2 1 2
Uh uh 1 2 1 2
DJ Scratch on the track
1 2 1 2
Wa wa 1 2 1 2
Break your motha fuckin back
1 2 1 2
Ah yo yo
My, lyric is 8 ball
Batter up play ball
Fuck y'all analogue
Niggas we be digital, subliminal, come in
From the 5 star general
Attack you from the blind side, invisible
To the naked eye
Where them criminals
Better have your 8 essential vitamins and minerals
The wu is coming through you know the outcome
Critical
Condition in your physical for injurin
The officer and gentleman who stack by the benjamen

[Redman]
Off a beat like this
I keep a night stick
In case any stick up care where heat might miss
I chicken fry rice bitch
In a white trench
Bustin off two macks I'm like "I'm hit"!!!
I'm just playin, I clear the croud out
Like a peppa can sprayin
I throw lightin out the arms raiden
Go guard your pray
Next year I do nothin more than Y2K

{Hook}
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2 we say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
We say
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2
And if you say fuck me [Meth]
I'm a say fuck you [Redman]
Wa wa wa wa 1 2 1 2

[Meth]
From deputant down to stripper
I'm too nonchalaunt
A drink mixed with four kinds of liquors
Catch me at the bar "Fu Bar"
Ladies know who we are and
Dream of fuckin a star
Who da scrub
Shotgun in this man car
Burnin up
Forever gettin thrown out the club
It be us Paul
Shot out and bugged
I smoke bud, sniff a bee's ass to get a buzz
I'm everything you think you don't know

[Redman]
I throw a 5 in the power
Poppa wheely with the front end hittin speed bumps, 40 miles per hour
I'm out at Howard, next to Baltimore
Takin change out the fountains at shoppin malls
Rats can only afford Chuck E Cheese
The blood in my jeans is tough like Buddy Lee
Semi-dart auto off ya, blood coughin
Meth pull the last spark plug with a heart pump

{Hook}

[Redman]
Call me will, enemy I state
When 4 Doc run the scam
New jacks studderin, that the man from the upperhand
Punch, atomic bomb I hit many
From Bricks to South Park you dyin with Kenny
While you bailin I'm trailin
Rockin hard hat helmets clip the satellite servallence
When I walk by you better not be kickin
Or i put two more in that terriyaki chicken

[Meth]
You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps
Stab you in the back
Kung Fu
52 cops can't withstand the 52 blocks
Unless they bust like 52 shots
I'm the has been that have not
Battle kids at Maxwell's house
Know when I'm good to the last drop
Whats my name Meth he's name Doc
Just like urban
See me in the gran transportation splurgin
Drivin with a turban who push a black suburban (come on)
We rollin windows half down through the urban
Network law lay it down like a persian
M to the E to the F, spell curtain

[Redman]
Get out your car sucker
This ain't yours
Robbed you with a gun that filled with paint balls
And brauds got the nerve to act funny
You a champaine ho, with kool aide money
Frown bitch, Doc up in that town quick
You back down a point on NFL blitz
I'm lyin buddah break fool and take two
And put your hole in the earth to escape through

{Hook}

{Talked}
DJ Scratch
Not ready for prime time playas
Mr. Meth, Funk Doc
Def Jam 2000 mutha fuckasssssss!!! (echos out)

Calm me down baby
Nod your head to this
Come on

Ey yo this is WKYA radio
We kickin your motha fuckin ass

Thats right it's goin down
Redman, Method Man blackin the funk out
