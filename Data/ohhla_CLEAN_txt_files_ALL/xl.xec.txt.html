Yeah.. yeah..
  "Ladies and gentlemen"  "..may I present"
Yeah..
  "May I introduce.."
  "Four of New York's finest.."
  "Give it up for the X-Ecutioners!"

[Large Professor]
Yo
I'm like a country wild western, rhyme style murderer
X-Ecutioners, cuttin things you never heard of
Flip new beats, never once flipped a burger
But I flame-broil, and still remain loyal
On the hip-hop throne, and most kings I been doin it
Rock, Rob, Joe, and Big E is one unit
Supreme force, ever since Main Source, my nigga
Shoulda had yo ass drunk like liqour, in a stuper
Got to stay super, with the Cash Flow
Never bashful, here's what you asked fo'
The best DJ's in the world today
Cuttin up "Rock the Bells" LL Cool J
and many more, Robbie Swift and he raw
Roc Raida, number one chop innovator
Total Eclipse, man you know that he flips
and he diminished the, record like my man Joe Sinister
I'ma lay back and watch 'em bless the track
For the hip-hop world, cuz these brothers don't slack
They always comin with the up-to-par
You can call X-Ecutioners the best by far...

Knowhatmsayin? Yeah..
Knowhatmsayin? Word up..
Yeah...

[Large Professor]
Yo, I take you back to the cave man era
Survival and how to live, on ways I get better
I'm too deep to peek, rock niggaz to sleep
I'm like a four star general, out in the street
Keep my business low, represent Cash Flow
Bustin loose like Chuck Brown to get that dough
Most of y'all could tell, I come from the ghetto
Eight blocks from flushin metal where my family settle
Got Chinese, Korean, Asian
Used to link up with Nas, from Corntop Choice, for female persuasion
Bustin off in the park, that was in the dark
I'm real not fake so please don't pretend to part
I'm lettin it start, the glamour the bucks
Gotta get mine, cuz beef got stamina and guts
Plus the phat beat, plus the rhyme plus the cuts

[cutting up "cut" in background]

[Large P talking]
Yeah, X-Ecutioners rockin the track
Comin through with the hefty scratch
Cuts galore..
Boardin back and forth.. all over the world
Tri-state, every five borough
Word up, these brothers been doin this for a minute
man, gettin busy man, just.. cuttin 'em up man
Choppin 'em, slicin 'em
That's the original essence of hip-hop, knowhatmsayin
just niggaz just gettin busy and shit
Two turntables that's how it started
Two turntables and a microphone
X-Ecutioners, keepin the foundation strong...</pre>
