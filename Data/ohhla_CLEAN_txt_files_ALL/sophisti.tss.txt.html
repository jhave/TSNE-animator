[Chorus]
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you...
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I fucks with you, ooooooh

[Too $hort]
You still a freak, but you ain't out swingin' on poles
Choosin' on pimps, and bringin' 'em hoes
It's the same everyday, little dress and a thong
You just doin' yo' thang bein' sexy and grown
Sucker found out, he only wanna be friends
He can't deal with you, you make more money than him
I see you baby, droppin' that top in the Benz
Wasn't bought from the money that you got from him
It's those two degrees and that good ass job
You never act wild in the hood in your car
You so classy... so flashy
I ain't trippin' girl, you could be nasty
Got me a cute ass prosecuter
Too smart to let a nigga prostitute her
Before we fucked, she liked to read my rights
And afterwards give a nigga legal advice
She' so -

[Chorus]
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you...
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I fucks with you, ooooooh

[Too $hort]
Y'all thought Too $hort was just all about pimpin'
Foul-mouth mack that talk bad about women
I guess - you ain't really pay attention
You heard "bitch" and cut it all, you ain't even listen
All I said was if the shoe fits wear it
And if it don't apply act like you didn't hear it
I know all about you went to school and did good
Made somethin' of yourself and you're straight from the hood
You came too far to fuck up and be nothin'
Fine broke ass bitch walkin' round sufferin'
Actin' like her shit don't stank
Ask her what she's doin' and her mind goes blank
Gotta stay on the grind, make your own figures
You wastin' time, waitin' on them niggaz
Cause if you catch me and you're tryin' to impress me
Ain't nothin' more sexy than a -

[Chorus]
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you...
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I fucks with you, ooooooh

[Too $hort]
Call me after work
I see the little cuties, I don't have to flirt
You never have to question all the stuff I do
Cause they don't look, cook, or fuck like you
You's a real one, don't fight the feelin'
Let's do it all night, up by the ceilin'
I just want some lovin', I don't wanna fight
You don't want a husband, I don't want a wife
I spend nights at yo' house, you can stay at mine
Wake up and go home when it's daytime
You ain't all up under me, a pimp always know
With your Benz and your penthouse condo
And your fly ass fits, diamonds and whips
You're damn near leavin' me and I'm in the six
You just like your car, sexy and fast
I'll put the pedal to the metal, I'ma catch yo' ass

[Chorus]
Sophisticated, educated
That's what I get from you
That's what I see in you...
You spoke the latest, fly young lady
Do what you wanna do
That's why I fucks with you, ooooooh</pre>
