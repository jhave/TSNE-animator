[50 Cent]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH
YEAHH~!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Now if I give you all of me
What'chu gon' give me back?
Your body is callin me
Got me feelin like a fiend on crack
Why you gonna make me fall in love?
Now why you wanna go and do that?
Now if I give you all of me
Tell me what'chu gon' give me back?

[50 Cent]
Let's start with the moon and the stars, whatever you into
The money I acquire mama make it all simple
Flashback oh-three, paparazzi flashin flicks
I moved away, hustle hard, now I got a sick stash
Tell me you miss me, baby come here and kiss me
MWAH~! .. It just happened so quickly
Feels like I hopped off a bus and got in a Bentley
It's gangsta my music, even when it's the smooth shit
You can hate me cause I hurt you but I ain't mean to do it
Em predicted it all, I don't know how he knew it
He said women from Hollywood, they LIAR-LIAR-LIARS
You fuck 'em they get you heated, deny you like Mariah
Fast forward to oh-six, I'm still on fire
The world is still turnin, my records are still earnin
Dough come quicker and quicker, flow gets sicker and sicker
Straight up and down baby, I'm a special kind of nigga

[Chorus]

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Ohhh, give it (give it) BABY (BABY)
Give it (give it) OH BABY~!
Give it (give it) baby (baby)
Give it give it baby baby (oh baby)

[50 Cent]
Life is short baby, be a part of my dreams
I own Ferarri horses, my Lamborghini leans
So mean, I have niggaz hatin on me
God gave me a gift, I'm supposed to be rich
I'm supposed to ride through the hood and make niggaz sick
When my homies put in work, they supposed to get hit
With a piece of chain thick and go and buy 'em some bricks
I ain't make that up, this is how it's 'sposed to be kid
You should feel like a life, but then get back that time
When I smile your smile should be as big as mines
Girl to know me's to love me, I'm one of a kind
Even when you hate me you love me, forever you're mine

[Chorus] + [Hook]

[Mary J. Blige]
What you gonna give me back~!
You're gonna make me fall in love {*2X*}
Ohhhhhhhhhhahhhhhhhh, AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEAH YEAHH HAH YEAHHHH
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh, ohhhhhhhhh, OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH~!
Oooooh-whoah-ahhh
What you gon' give me, what you gon' give me, what you gon' give me
{*fades out*}</pre>
