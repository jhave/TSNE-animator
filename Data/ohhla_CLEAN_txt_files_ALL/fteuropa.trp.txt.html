[Promoe]
Once apon a time not long ago
When people were still living in the northern zone
They could, still breath and everybody wasn't dead
Somebody recorded a song
And this is what it said:
After the first and the second world wars
You'd think us europeans couldn't take it no more
But we built up and tore down the Berlin wall
Only to build up a new and improved around our crumblin' Fort (Europa)
This one was a bit tricky, not visible to the naked eye
And if you was lucky
You could slip through the cracks and the crevices tuckin'
Your life under your arm, this way some people snuck in
Only to become second class citizens
Not listed in the system not existin in a sence
Illegal immigrants
The word left a bitter sin
This place is cold and evil, I should have never went to

[Chorus]

[Promoe]
Fort Europa
My so called Eutopia
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer
Right here in Fort Europa (Right here)
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer

[Supreme]
I guess you know about how I dreamt of super power
wanted to roll with the bad boys
But got butt-fucked in the showers
Too scared to hold our own ground
Can't beat'em join'em we're down
Stay with the winning team by any means
but in another realm
And bottoms up while they drowned
Invitations at the door members only no hang around
Inside the fortress of fine ass
We appreciate
The less fortunate smile as long as she looked high class
And as the problem was swallowing for the almighty Euro
But you know, we put our brother inside a business though
Make sure they're not leaving that over loose end hope of a life
Reside a force
Sendin'em back home and so forth
Cause we got
Employment issues, we got kids of our own
Trying to tear down the wall with chrome and black ink flow
Keep them mad at all cost
This ain't the time to go soft
We stand united or this soon will be lost, inside

[Chorus]

[Promoe]
Fort Europa
My so called Eutopia
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer
Right here in Fort Europa (Right here)
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer

[Cos.m.i.c]
Yo we try to live our lives in protected homes
Don't worry 'bout no one and get your own
The weak people are just a stepping stone
On the road to the riches we hitting for
Anybody coming my way I'm gunning my way
Whoever got something to say better be runnin away
But I stay to see through the peep holes
Cause people like that is all we know, and
All of these lies and false promises
That shit will come back with the God nemesis, you
Whoever pick up this, a hundred years from now
Here's the last song before we all go down
The revolution is a moment away
The tensions in the air, that is coming our way, but
Powerful forces do they best
They count they're raps so they'll suite the west
Temperatures rising ain't no turnin back
At this point where this world is at
Hate'em for a cross-road which way to go
Heaven or hell only you can say you know

[Chorus]

[Promoe]

Fort Europa
The so called Eutopia
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer
Right here in Fort Europa (Right here)
Where I can't find no culture
Feel the walls getting closer and closer and closer

[Outro]
Right here on Fort Europa
Nothing but chlaustrophobia
Right here on Fort Europa
Nothing but xenophobia
Right here on Fort Europa
Nothing but chlaustrophobia
Right now</pre>
