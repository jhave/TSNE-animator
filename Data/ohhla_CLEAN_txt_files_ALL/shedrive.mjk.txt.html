She's got the look
She's so fine
And you know damn well
The girl will be mine

She's got the breaks
She's the scene
And you know damn well
She gives it to me

Black jeans and
A turtleneck sweater
I know the girl
Is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better

She's composition
She's statistical fact
She's got it ready
For the willing
Got it kicking in the back

She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Come to the place
Shock to see
And you know damn well
You know what I mean
Hot in the face
One to three

Like a pleasure trip
Like you've never seen
Satin lace
And a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cos she knows she looks hot

She's got position
She's got just what it takes

Got a mojo
In her pocket
Got it ready
Just in case

She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(Aquil Davidson)
Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild
I might not make it
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
Far from a Drusilla(?), your lips are deadly
You're walkin' soft, still I hear the medley
Uh, she bought me timberland boots, cramped my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look

Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild</pre>
