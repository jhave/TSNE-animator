Akon, show out (show out), show out (show out)

I'm sure that the streets are watching me
Rather not run when the cops are stopping me
Pulled over on the road they watching me
As they walk passed all the chicks are jockin me
Ferrari truck on the side of the road
Raspberry paint gloss sitting on 24's
Give me a warning ticket, letting me go
Cause you can tell by the jewels that I ain't an average Joe
Cause I meet fresh dimes daily
You burn me (ouhhh) really
Cause I done seen your type before
You wanna hate out on the chef cause he baking that dough, yo

Don't tempt me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm tryin not to lose my head
Cause you don't really wanna see me show out (show out)
In the club on free spinning G's (show out)
Mocca humma 24's on these (show out)
Yo playa don't make me (show out)
Cause You don't really wanna see me (show out)
Akon got a crew so deep (show out)
From the West Indies to over seas (show out)
Yo mammi don't make me (show out)

It's all good but I'm still in the hood
Like right around the corner cause its all in my brain
A nice crib on the hill of Hollywood but the ghetto mind stayin
Ain't a damn thing changed
It's funny how people switch when they get rich
Spend it all on chicks
Hundred-thousand dollar car for what
These bitches
Ten million dollar crib for what
These bitches
Five thousand dollar suits for what
These bitches
Should of known but they only out for your riches
Some freaks need to be dealt with
Spread 'em and smack 'em backwards
With a stick
I guarantee she'll do what you say
Yeah daddy, no daddy, ok

Don't tempt me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm tryin not to lose my head
Cause you don't really wanna see me show out (show out)
In the club on free spinning G's (show out)
Mocca humma 24's on these (show out)
Yo playa don't make me (show out)
Cause You don't really wanna see me (show out)
Akon got a crew so deep (show out)
From the West Indies to over seas (show out)
It ain't happenin
Yo mammi don't make me (show out)
Its gonna make me (show out)
Ya'll niggaz gonna make me (show out)
Ya'll chickens gonna make me (show out)
Cuz this some real shit
Don't make me pull your card ya'll niggaz gonna make me (show out)
(ya'll niggaz) Ya'll niggaz gonna make me (show out)
(Ya'll chickens) Ya'll chickens gonna make me (show out)
Cuz this some real shit
Don't make me pull your card now (come on now)

Cause you don't really wanna see me (show out)
In the club on free spinning G's (show out)
Mocca humma 24's on these (show out)
Hey yo don't make me (show out)
Cause you don't really wanna see me (show out)
Akon got a crew so deep (show out)
From the West Indies to overseas (show out)
Yo baby don't make me (show out)
Don't make me (no)
Show out (show out)</pre>
