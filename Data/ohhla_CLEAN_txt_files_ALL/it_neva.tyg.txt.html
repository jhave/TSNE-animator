Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California

[Verse 1]
Fresh off the runway, today gon be a good day
Her first time in La, she heard bout Secret Sunday
Party on rove top, convertible drop top
Want the Axel Foley life, talkin Beverly Hills cop
2 shots, we sip a lot, one shot, that's all you got
She just wanna be on the scene, stuntin in parking lots
First time she feel at home, second time did it wrong
Third time's a charm, now she ready for it all
I place my bets high, no time for actin shy
Start about a life on stage, don't close yo eyes
Thinkin rodeo drive, sweets at the lama ties
Oh she fly but it's gon take more and we ain't tired
Hoping that they gon come, she's saving up her ones
Saying she love to hustle, champagne for fun
A New York stripper, said she left her nigga
La won't tip er, she runnin back to that nigga
I told er

[Chorus]
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California
(It neva rains in Southern California)
It neva rains in Southern California

[Verse 2]
Wake up the flies and she know it's me
Swear to God that body perfect like them rosaries
She got me Skyping when I'm overseas
Swiping when I'm overseas, Chanel with the codeces
Berkin make er twerk it, I pop it while she workin
Niggaz poppin in bands when she walk out by them curtains
Make yo rainin honest cause I swear that she deserve it
Nowhere to nothing, nigga money longer than that suburban
Love er but she a stripper, magnum wrapped just like a turban
We just out further here, I'm going deep enough to hurt it
Yea she a squirter, that pussy homicide
And my dick can murder, The Lake Suicide
And I click on purpose, we fuckin Oceanside
Keep er wetted in them surface and whenever she resurface
It's tighter than a virgin, like a melon when it's swell up
Whenever she in Cali no need for the umbrella 'cause

[Chorus]
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains, no
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains here
It neva rains in Southern California
Southern California

[Bridge]
To live and die in LA
Shout out y nigga Game

[Chorus]
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California
It neva rains in Southern California</pre>
