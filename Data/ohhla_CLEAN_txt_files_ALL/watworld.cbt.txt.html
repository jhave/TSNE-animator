[Chorus]
Wrap around the world, all the boys and girls
Raise your hands and sing along tonight
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in His site
Everybody wrap around the world

[Verse 1 - Cowboy Troy]
To the hicks in Russia, zdrasvootya, kak dila, pazhalsta
Be careful 'cause I'm hot to ya, while I'm rockin' ya
And your mouth is hanging open saying, "Shto eta?!"
We've got the cowboy sound all across the seas
Bonjour to the French and the Portuguese
Konnichi wa to the Japanese
I'll even break it down for you in Mandarin Chinese
Yi-ar-san, san-ar-yi, nin hao, wo jiao xiansheng CBT, wo cong meiguo lai
Ji dian liu, wo dong jiankang ra huo che nimen fu yijian yuan jian shi
Cong yirjo so lai, wo dong bian, Beijing, Sichuan, Cian Gang, zai jian
Yi liu ping an!

[Chorus (Cowboy Troy)]
Wrap around the world, all the boys and girls
Raise your hands and sing along tonight (sing along tonight!)
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in His site
Everybody wrap around the world

[Verse 2 - Cowboy Troy]
Guten abent meine damen und herren
Is what you hear in Germany when speakers are blaring
Frankfurt, Berlin, Hamburg, und Koln
Rackin' up minutes callin' home on my cell phone
I can't wait to rock Tokyo, Nihonjin! Domo arigato!
Okinawa, Kyoto, Osaka, sounds like a job for the chief party rocker
I'm a lyrical black belt, so now you know
Some call it Tongue Fu, I call it Tae Kwon Flo!
Laissez les bon ton roulle
As I'm rockin' Paris and the Champs Elysses

[Chorus (Cowboy Troy)]
Wrap around the world, all the boys and girls
Raise your hands and sing along tonight (sing along tonight!)
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in His site
Everybody wrap around the world

[Interlude]

[Chorus (Cowboy Troy)]
Wrap around the world, all the boys and girls
Raise your hands and sing along tonight (sing along tonight!)
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in His site
Everybody wrap around the world (C'mon c'mon!)
Wrap around the world, all the boys and girls
Raise your hands and sing along tonight (sing along y'all, sing along!)
Red and yellow, black and white
They are precious in His site
Everybody wrap around the world
Hey everybody wrap around the world
Hey everybody wrap around the world

[Cowboy Troy]
Shake a hand instead of shakin' a fist</pre>
