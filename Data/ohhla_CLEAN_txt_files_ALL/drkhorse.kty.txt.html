[Juicy J]
Yeah, y'all know what it is!
Katy Perry
Juicy J
Uh huh, let's rave!

[Katy Perry]
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully

'Cause I...
I'm capable of anything
Of anything
And everything

Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy
Your enemy

So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse

Are you ready for
Ready for
A perfect storm
Perfect storm
'Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no goin' back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don't walk away

It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a yes or a no
No maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it up to me
Up to me
Give it up to me

So you wanna play with magic
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse

Are you ready for
Ready for
A perfect storm
Perfect storm
Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine
There's no goin' back

[Juicy J]
She's a beast
I call her Karma
She eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids
'Cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart

She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma

Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She got me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

[Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy you should know what you're fallin' for
(You should know)
Baby do you dare to do this
'Cause I'm comin' at you like a dark horse
(Like a dark horse)

Are you ready for
Ready for (Ready for)
A perfect storm
Perfect storm (A perfect storm)
'Cause once you're mine
Once you're mine (ohhhh)
There's no goin' back</pre>
