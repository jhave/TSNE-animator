Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Chorus 2X: Loko]
I'm comin down the street, beatin on these hoes
Switchin lane to lane Chevy sittin on 24's
Got TV's everywhurr, that purp' is in the urr
Plus I'm ridin dirty so you know that I don't curr

[Unk]
Ay, I'm comin down the street, rollin and smokin 'dro
St. Louis and Mosley Park, big bodies and bike shows
But dey can't fuck with mine, candy coated apple red
Touch a button screens spill there's Paris Hilton givin head
Hey, while I was gettin some head, I like to swerve to the curb
At my back boys in the blue, say they protect and they serve
Watchin me swerve on this purp', I put two shots in the air
Big ol' spray, fresh fruit, no kush nowhere
I got them big boy rims on the big boy whip
I rock them big boy chains stackin big boy chips
Fo'-fifty rocket unlock it, my bass stay punchin like Rocky
Hit hit, hit it then I'm gone, beat'n down yo block you can't stop me

[Chorus]

[Loko]
I'm beat'n down yo' block, comin with tremendous knock
See me I'm fly on 26's systems, bitches keep spinnin when I stop
Yup, I got that drop, but jackers got that glock
Come through when you see Big Oomp cause you know I gotta get that guac'
I'm Simpson Road in a Simpson Road Chevy
Sprayed Simpson Road green just like the street sign do you feel me
Fo'-fifty-fo' motor under the hood so you know I'm runnin
Got the traction when I'm mashin, wheels smokin, rubber burnin
You don't wanna race, my nigga don't you try
Blowin pipes oh so loud but my engine oh so quiet
You know I'm in a big boy kit with that flip-flop chameleon
Diamonds and the sun shinin got my Caddy back glistenin

[Chorus]

[Unk]
