Song:   Free Willy
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

This songs going out to an american hero
And anybody else who has ever been harrassed or arrested for smoking the beautiful plant
Marijuana

[Chorus]
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
He was busted with some shrooms and with some weed
(outlaw deperado)
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
So wont you let old willie be free
(drinking whiskey out the bottle)

He was just average man with the plan of freedom thinking
Good times and good vibes yo was what he was bringing
But still the goverment thought willie was a threat
So they picked on old willie and put him in serious debt
Took his house and his cars but couldnt take his guitar
Tried to push a good man on his face in the yard
But willie stood strong and he can correct
Paid off the taxman with a flag around his head
A true patriot the one to start a formate
And made sure the farmers of today are getting fairly paid
A rebel in his hay still a rebel to this day
A true inspiration for the youth of today
So i say to everybody come and pay your respect
To willie nelson and think where a thritieth check gooess
Cause its going down the drain to fight wars over seas and enemies on scene

[Chorus x2]
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
He was busted with some shrooms and with some weed
(outlaw deperado)
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
So wont you let old willie be free
(drinking whiskey out the bottle) on [x2] (and it could happen to you or me)

Yo willie nelson, hes a legend, hes smokes buds like the bubba cloud ?? you know the
Government, they dont like him, cuz he smoked a joint on the roof of the white house
He puffs clouds, he gets high, hes a rebel for the cause you know he feels the vibes, oh
Willie willie youre a friend of mine, wore the red bandana like the game when he rhymes, he got
The guitar pick, you know he drinks wine, got things in common like boozin in kind, music for
The mind, freedom of speech, blue jeans rocker flannel with the long sleeves, green trees this
And that, the simple things in life like barbequing in the back, yardd being free smoking weed
Writing books only god can judge me

[Chorus]
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
He was busted with some shrooms and with some weed
(outlaw deperado)
Ohhh willie nelsons not a criminal
So wont you let old willie be free
(drinking whiskey out the bottle)

Ohhhh
Oh willie nelson
Oh willie nelson
Busted with shrooms and with weed
Ohhhh
Oh willie nelson
Oh willie nelson
Will you let old willie be free
Ohhhh</pre>
