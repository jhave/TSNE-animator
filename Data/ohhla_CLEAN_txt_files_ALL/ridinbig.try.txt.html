[Intro]
I'm outside 30 minutes trying to figure out which car match my outfit!

The hardest decision I got to make: which car I'm gon' take when I skate (yeah)
I'm ridin' big, ho (big, ho)
I'm ridin' big, ho (big, ho)

[Verse 1]
Cadillac, Escalade
I'm candy red, I'm sittin on blades
And I'm.. I'm ridin big, ho (big, ho)
I'm ridin big, ho (big, ho)
1979, Trans Am
All dem niggaz can say is GOD DAMN

I'm ridin big, ho (big, ho)

Gettin my dick sucked, while I drive!

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Stop!
Hit ya horn! (uh huh)
Blink ya lights! (c'mon)
Swerve...that thang....(uh huh)
To the right,(c'mon)
Make sure...you got big rims
The whip up on the clown...time to peel!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I envisioned my rims...since I was 19 (c'mon!)
Pukang white, interior dark green..(c'mon!)
Know what I mean..
Know how it feel, to come to the crib
And muthafuckin' chill, like THAT!
In my garage...(c'mon!)
I'm kickin' it hard...(c'mon!)
A Charlestown nigga..(c'mon!)
Not charles in charge..yeah
To get to where I'm at you got to do what I done did...
Thats if you wanna ride big!
DSGB we ridin' big (we ridin' big) (well uh huh!)
To my nigga DJ clue (we ridin' big) (well uh huh!)
All my homies on the southside ridin' big (ridin' big) (well uh huh!)
All my homies on the westside ridin' big (ridin' big) (well uh huh!)
All my homies on the eastside ridin' big (ridin' big) (well uh huh!)
All my homies on the northside ridin' big (ridin' big) (well uh huh!)

Cause the only way I ride...
