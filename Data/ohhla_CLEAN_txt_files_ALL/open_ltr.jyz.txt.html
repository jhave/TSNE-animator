[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Ladies and gentlemen! GODDAMNIT!!!!
OH!!!!

[Jay-Z]
Let this shit knock

[Verse One: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
I'd done turned Havana to Atlanta (RIGHT!)
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
E'vry time you think you got me I switch the plan up
Bulletproof this radio scanners 
Ballin 'til they ban us
You gettin too much bread they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance (WOO!)
Sorry y'all I don't agree with y'all appearance (Uh Uh!)
Politicians never did shit for me (Nope!)
Except lie to me distort history (WOO!!!)
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime (WHAT'S UP!!!)
I might buy kilo from Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might, flood these streets (OHHHHH!!!!)
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got a onion from, Universal read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off of you fuckin dweeb!
I still own the buildin I'm still keepin my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit y'all better keep y'all receipt (OH!)
Obama said chill you 'gon get me impeached
You don't need this shit anyway chill with me on the beach (OH!)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (Timbaland)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (	YAH YAH YAH YAH!) Y'all 'gon learn today! (YAH YAH YAH YAH!)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (	YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH!)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (YAH YAH YAH YAH!) Y'all 'gon learn today!

[Verse Two: Jay-Z] (Swizz Beatz)
Uh! Y'all must wanna start a revolution 
You know whenever I'm threatened I start shootin (BONG!!!)
Catch a body head to Houston
I'm in Cuba I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusin
When It's from China the very mic that I'm usin (GODDAMNIT!!!!)
Idiot win the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot baby, you should become a student
Or you 'gon learn today! (Y'all 'gon learn today!)
Where the fuck have you been?! (WOO!)
The world's under new management
The new role model fuck this Zoolander shit! Uh!

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz] (Timbaland)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (	YAH YAH YAH YAH!) Y'all 'gon learn today! (YAH YAH YAH YAH!)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (	YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH!)
Y'all 'gon learn today! (YAH YAH YAH YAH!) Y'all 'gon learn today!
Y'all 'gon learn today! (YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH! YAH YAH YAH YAH!)
