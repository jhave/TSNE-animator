She smelled like flowers, she tastes like toffee 
She kissed me slowly, she held me softly 
Got too close and she backed up off me 
Left me stoned cold sober, just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee 
She told me that she'd always be thinkin' of me 
She said she wanted me to know that she really did love me 
She said she never put no one else above me 
Except her monkey, she's like a junkie, just like a junkie, 
Just like a junkie 

It was April 25th, it's up around 80 
Found a spot out in the park where the grass is shady 
She said her mom's from Jamaica, her father's from Haiti 
She's such a pretty lady, she's such a lady 

Chorus 

She smelled like flowers, she tastes like toffee 
She kissed me slowly, she held me softly 
Got too close and she backed up off me 
Left me stoned cold sober, just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee, just like black coffee 
Just like black coffee </pre>
