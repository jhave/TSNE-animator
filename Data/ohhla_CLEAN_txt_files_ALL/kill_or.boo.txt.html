Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die by the skill
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, choose how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Die by the skill, dawg, these streets are too real
This nigga named Rob, he was hot up on the block
He sold a bunch of rocks, he ran from the cops
A young nigga ridin' clean, at the age of 15
Kicked up out his momma's house, daddy was a fuckin' feind
He was straight, though. He ain't have a bunch of problems
But, if he did, his revolver would solve them
Stayed up in the projects, stayed breakin' bitches necks
Stayed up in the club, fresh to death, in the gucci set
He was tryna get his act straight, so he turned to rap
He was tryna sell his last ounce, then out comes the gat
Man, they tried to rob him, tried to take that niggaz life
But he bust them niggaz back, Rob took the robbers life
Ride, get high, visualize the moment
This is Rob to the robbers, listen closely..
"Man, you hoe ass niggaz got me fucked up
think ya'll can rob a motherfucker like this."     DAMN
"You know who the fuck you fuckin' with?"       Oh man, he hit
"Gimme my shit, lil' bitch."

Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die by the skill
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, choose how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Die by the skill, dawg, these streets are too real

Okay, Rob done get caught up in some crazy stuff
Cuz that petty ass robber tried to test to Rob's nuts
Now, Rob is on the run. The word spreadin' through the hood
Rob shot that nigga 5 times up by the school
And such an ass boy, had a tape, he was snitchin', too
That's how the murder got linked back to Rob, fool
Man, this shit is wild. Yeah, this nigga was a golden child
Tryna come up from rags to riches like he stayed on 8 Mile
Fuckin' with that shady ass white boy up on that dope
He shoulda known that white boy was talkin' to them folks
Rob gone up outta dodge, called his lawyer, told him the biz
Told him he ain't have no control over the shit that he just did
Man, keep a nigga straight if a case get up on me.(Fo sho')
I was comin' clean out the streets to the industry. (End of show)
"Man, that's fucked up, man
A nigga tryna do sumn positive, man, always gotta turn out deadly."
It's serious in the streets... it's watchin'

Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die by the skill
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, choose how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Die by the skill, dawg, these streets are too real
Kill or be killed, in a battle field

Live how you die, nigga, die by the skill
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, choose how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Live how you die, nigga, die how you live
Kill or be killed, in a battle field
Die by the skill, dawg, these streets are too real</pre>
