[G-Quikk]
It took a nigga thirteen muthafuckin' years just to make a rap song.
But I'm on my winnings, in fact now niggas is jealous,
Y'all niggas don't faze me,
Hoes gone...hate me,
Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody,
Your back nutty,
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me,
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round,
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted,
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics,
You're all on my dick hun,
Get one, lick one,
Shit son, talk about me?  Jealous man, you're done,
Fuck it, it's all good,
I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga, I'm not that nigga either, understood?

Chorus [Mystikal &amp; G-Quikk]

You're all on my dick hun

[Mystikal]
Only way to keep my muthafuckin' name
Out your muthafuckin' mouth
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

Second Verse [G-Quikk, Mystikal, &amp; J-Dawg]:

[G-Quikk]
Roll like a tank,
Comin' cold like a shake,
Every move that I make,
Be smooth like a, snake,
I got what it takes to make your eyes burn,
Hooked up in the jazzy fifth, with the pee-wee sideburns,
I dress better than a drug dealer,
Cuz when I jump shop I'm on my job nigga,
20/20 couldn't see me

[Mystikal]
Who you?

[G-Quikk]
Q to the U to the I to the K, K, I be......

[J-Dawg]
Follow me now, open sesame,
You niggas ain't ready for the best of me,
I'm takin' you niggas nuts and givin' you bitches a hysterectomy,
I'm comin' up fast, runnin' in more ass,
Sharp as glass, 
Bitch you might think this nigga be lickin' the pussy cuz my tongue fast,
Hoe, but that's a no-no,
Oh, you mean you don't know?
Mr. Hood Critic told you what?  I'm lickin' pussy on the down-low?
Now if I'd did it, I'd admit it and walk around proud,
But tellin' no fables, on this label, pussy eaters ain't allowed,
Now I be comin' around the mountain like "Oh Susanna"

[Mystikal]
Nigga where the fuck you from?

[J-Dawg]
New Orleans, Louisiana,
Home of the boot camp clicc,
And now it's time for rest of you muthafuckas 
to bow down and respect the South shit,
Get your mouth split,
That's what thing that you can do up with this chemistry,
The Boot Camp Clicc is droppin' bombs on the industry

[G-Quikk]
You all on my dick, hun

[Mystikal]
Mr. Hood Critic, the only way to keep my muthafuckin' name,
From out your muthafuckin' mouth,
Is to keep your muthafuckin' mouth SHUT!

[G-Quikk]
G's oh, G-Quikk's a G so,
Want me to creep these hoes?  I'ma keep these hoes,
On they tippy-tippy toes,
Shovin' that dick all in your daughter,
Called a nigga, fucked a nigga,
Sucked a lil' dick

[Mystikal]
BUT CAN'T GET A QUARTER!!!!!

[G-Quikk]
I'm not your everyday extraordinary busta,
Another soldier out that boot camp,
Bustin' you dick suckers

[Mystikal]
From walkin' round town tryin' to call Michelle,
Hit slow like shit you jump now nigga

[G-Quikk]
Ain't nothin' colder, ain't nothin' cooler...
Ooh!  Don't let the smooth ice fool ya

[Mystikal]
Cuz I ain't that type of nigga to get my...
