Yo, Philly, here to bring trouble
Yo, Life, here to bring trouble
Here to bring trouble, who do you see?

(Si Philly)
I be the interactual, factual verbal supernatural
Thinking be lateral because my mind be immatchable
Never been catchable  I'm causing ---
Lyrical flow spitting purer then Perrier water when I slaughter
Leave you decapitated from the shit that I created
Leaving your battle scene obliterated
Niggas be devastated by my verbal masochism
Attacking them like a laser-guided missile bringing their dismissal
The rhyme cluster like a funker buster blasting up Israel
A twenty point climb up on the richter scale
Smoke joints while I manipulate pressure points
Fracture a rapper and here the crack of bone disjoints
Force more thought techniques when Philly speaks
Fully tweaks when I'm spitting my verbal figure of speech
And I reach, the parts that other rappers couldn't manage
My lyrical lethal weapon be giving your body damage

Yo philly, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo, Life, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo philly, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo, Life, Verbal fight and drop bombs

(Life)
Yo I bounce over beats like jeeps do over gravel stones
Use wack Mcs as stepping stones to get to microphones
Smoke herb in Rizla cones and when I get stoned
My rhymes start spinning like a typhoon, hurricane, cyclone
My style is Fort Knox and got more 'locks than a Rasta
And Hiyahiyahoo I be the rap kung-fu master
I'm British like airways, so step like stairways
Cos I'm busting more skill than Tiger Woods on the fairways
With a queue of rap fools who need to go back to rap school
With their two many rhymes cos I got lyrics by the sackfull
Lyrically smash you and grab you and stab you
Try to take your liberty with me on the mic like a statue
I flex like the funkmaster rock like the raider
My lyrics swears like tounnge strong and cut like the creator
Smooth like CL I aint no gangster I'm a guru
Kool like Keith when I drop the pronouns the verbs and the plurals
Make more grams than Puba ---
Smoke more herb than Canibus trust that's when I'm a Redman
Mos Def and the li Flow in any Company
Heavy like D fat like Joe make you Run like DMC
I be the master like P, of any ceremony
Have a Wu-Tang brother saying Life, U-God not me
Bruck up your Ras like Clarts with more effects than Darts
My style is bigger than Ainsley, Foxy Nature and Nas
Life will astonish ya
Bigger than Daddy Kane and the punisher
More Method than any Man and out to make many grams

Yo philly, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo, Life, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo philly, Verbal fight and drop bombs
Yo, Life, Verbal fight and drop bombs

Your..... Technique......... Is ........... Magnificent... </pre>
