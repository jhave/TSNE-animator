[Intro]
Yeah
Do you feel it?
Don't answer, that was a rhetorical question
Rhetorical (rhetorical)

[Verse 1]
Forever life been never nice, we expedite the process
And every night I get advice, cause life is way too complex
Heaven's lights are hella bright, ironic how that came to be
But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's saying the place is safe for me
I told "wait for me," the make believer normally disguise
Transforms before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Having dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wonders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walking I'm stealing jobs around Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preaching just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah he's a goner, fuck these premadonnas
I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago
I like to toy with the idea that we really know
Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?
In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings

[Chorus]
I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to make it all make sense
As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have and the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes
We all in search for substance, that gives you pain and numbness
Circumstances advancing the second chances, for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this coming
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days
Life, it works in such mysterious ways
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say

[Chorus]
I'm living a blindfold, like where did the time go
I know you hear me out there, can you sign off?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Baby I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Can you wait girl, so I won't be
Hold you closely, so we don't speak
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
So will you follow me wherever my mind goes?

[Outro]
Wherever my mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
I'ma follow you wherever your mind goes
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?
Will you follow me wherever my mind goes?</pre>
