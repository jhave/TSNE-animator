Song:   Battle for Asgard
Typed by: jcruelty1@yahoo.com 

Into the war of the worlds, where cities twirl
L.I.F.E. Long shakin planets for the ?
? lands when I spit out and hurl words
It's a Stronghold writer's guild, Cannibal Ox take over your herd
We planted our flags on your soils
Despoiling opponents with turmoil
? couldn't be aluminum foil
We potent with rounds lit out similar to ?
I was there when it all first sparked
Jersey next to poisonous darts
Camouflaged with the dark, to blend in with the scenery
Snatch your whole team's referee machinery
Before knowin I landmine spot blowing
Throwing heads off tracks, smackin em with an open palm
BITCH SLAP
Make your whole body feel it when I spray
The battle's just begun, it gets deeper as the song plays

Mega with his arms folded
Fists balled up
Toast (?) on the side of my waist
V on the buckle of the belt
Rappin' hell (?)
Cape flowin
Still standin
With two cannons
1 3 2 got me vanished
Ninja in the night with the phantoms
Amped up, set off hoppers (?)
See rays blast from the optics
Livin in fucked up ghetto economics
Spit from the voicebox, nasty with sonics
Animals released out of boxes
Plus we got that Stronghold on the throat
That'll leave you all gone on the float
Split belly cos you off the boat

The battle for Asgard and we fight as gods
Shatter your glass cage into a thousand crystal shards
I stayed in the basement, like the Krupa Kid (?)
Shut the city down like Baghdad Lubavich (?)
Your stupid clique wrestle warlocks
The audience backed you
I drank eight ounces of water
With my time capsule
Wrote rhymes before all the times when mother nature's fabric
A hard rock, I descended from stone tablets
Juggle your bones and poems, about to see foes
Who couldn't bounce from spot to spot like wheat toast (?) (so?)
Allow me to surf on your brain waves with jet skis
Unless you want your wrists to part like the red sea
On the roof of hell, you got stomped by angel's feet
Cause you can't be down, you had gravity deficiency
(We spit thoughts!)
I translate harpoons to sharp death
When the point is made, from my underwater breath
Don't get walls confused with linoleum
And try to cut my square like a scared custodian (know me son!)
Every bite upon, I told you not to get it on 
But you still trip the holes with a broken magic wand
Strong Atoms, whole family dear
To duplicate &amp; recreate could take a light year
Squeeze your head into a sneaker, lace your face
Throw you in a black hole, make you swim through space

We mind-bogglin, spine-tinglin
Got the scroll of Galactus now I'm planet-swallowin
Megala's got the surfboard and he's hollerin
All arch-enemies must die
And I know you not unbreakable son, that's a lie
And you can't have my 3.14, that's my pi... (stupid!)
I'm a diamond in the rough, and you're lucy in the sky with a cubit
Your raps don't do it
I deal with cloud nigga patrol
Plus my real name is closer to Thor's than yours
Where we practice there is no flaw
This is the battle for Asgard (say no more)
Atoms fam &amp; Stronghold, nuclear clamp the mic
And you and your best friend don't even sound tight
I guess something ain't right
We like constellations when they close in
The lost sons of Odin
With a mouthful of parables to get em open
But the psionic imagery'll leave em frozen
I used to outdo cats like you in my lunch period
Then conversate with the burning bush about a period
And bust through your ego like the high line (?) of scrimmage
Right for the goal, your warning comes in 2 minutes</pre>
