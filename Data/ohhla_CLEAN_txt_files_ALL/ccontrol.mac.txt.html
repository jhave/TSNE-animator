Song:   Cruise Control
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Ayo I'm livin the high life!
Fly clothes good liquor good weed
Fine hoes all the things I'm a need
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gonna have em like
La La La La
La La La La La...
Sit back relax and move slow cause we on cruise control

[Wiz Khalifa]
Wizzle man the fans can't keep em off me
always reppin for my city even tho I don't see em often, yea
As a youngin learn it's best to keep from talkin
I only say I'm the best cause that what's the people call me
and I'm a keep shining till the day the reaper call me
alot of shit on my chest so I suggest you keep from round me
tryin slander my name but when u sit think about
it's hard to showoff your aim when niggas yet to see the targert
hes talkin that mess cause hes garbage my trees rolled
beauty cause the weed is forign
and my homie bought a yacht so we on it and drinks are pourin
hoes admire my clothes cause I got louis features on em
LiFE just like a movie plus the special features em
is bad bitches and good weed to keep us coughin
hard as a bed of nails you would be sleepin on
MOTHER FUCKER YEAHHHH!

[Chorus]
Ayo I'm livin the high life!
Fly clothes good liquor good weed
Fine hoes all the things I'm a need
We make these ladies pants wet when we grab the mic
And we gonna have em like
La La La La
La La La La La...
Sit back relax and move slow cause we on cruise control

[Mac Miller]
(Ayo good lookin wiz)
Uhh I got these mother fuckers hatin on the way boy live
the reactin way they ladies always that I'm the shit
people stay up on my dick I ain't worried bout them
I'm to focused on the money I ain't worried bout friends
they say the youngin dream like a king
I'm muhammad ali in the ring
christmas eve in the spring
waitin for the boy but I ain't 21 wizzle cuttin up cause I stay puffin blunts
and when the money come I'm a give it back got a driver who adresses me as mister mac
dealin with theses diva hoes they so demandin
mac a young superstar dakota fanning
and you know I'm plannin for the world to be mine
no blind dates but I'm hittin girls from behind
the type of shine stay turnin em blind
just cruisein smokin purp and recline</pre>
