[Jennifer Lopez]
Now you been holding me down mm
For such a long time now
From back then to now in my story
Straight from the hood
You've always been there for me

And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you that kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So whatever you need I got you yeah

[Fat Joe]
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's skyblue Phantoms and stretch Maybacks
For sweepin them floors in them Bronx apartments
Mira esta que on that red carpet
When Pun died you was the first to call me
I never told you
But you was there for me
Whatever you need, I be there for you
Crack, I got ya back, for real, true story

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
Cuz baby you don't have to change no...

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
Yo, 2005, Rakim and Jody Watley
Watch me paint a picture so perfect
Quite possibly
The realest fresher from BX to Southbeach
I'mma always hold you down, girl
You can count on me

[Jennifer Lopez]
So remember this whenever I call
We go back too far, we been through it all
Even though, we haven't spoke in so long
Ain't nothing change, not a damn thing baby

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
Cuz baby you don't have to change no...

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
Like *something somethin*
This industry
Yeah my father made me this way
Get between me and J-Lo
I simply stay
you better off sweepin leaves on a windy day

[Jennifer Lopez]
So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you
If there's a complication
Cuz everytime you had my back and all
When we were young
And now you're Joey Crack and all

[Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be
With you if you just promise me
That you'll stay real just like you are
Cuz baby you don't have to change because...

[Chorus]

[Jennifer Lopez]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy I'm gon' hold you down

[Fat Joe]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl I'm gon' hold you down

[both]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, I'm gon' hold you down

[both]
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever your down you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, I'm gon' hold you down

[Jennifer Lopez]

Down, down, I'm gonna hold you down</pre>
