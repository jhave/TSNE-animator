[50 Cent]
Look at what they did to me, they burn me, they turn me
into a animal, they flipped son, they burn me
To the first degree, me son, they hurt me
I looked out for them motherfuckers, they burn me
I was good now I'm bad, see they done turned me
into a monster, I can't believe they burned me
I showed 'em love, they showed me hate, they burn me
Now I'm heartless, your pain don't concern me

I got so many enemies, so many memories
So many flashbacks, we used to be friends
Sugar turned to shit, people just change
They keep pushin a nigga 'til the hammer go BANG
You violate I will let that motherfucker rang
Feels like, money came then, more money came
And, niggaz start foamin out the mouth growin fangs
Now, when did I become the savior of the hood?
Look homie you don't know me, I wouldn't save ya if I could
I sacrifice for suckas and they change me, I'm angry
They selfish, all they want is what they want so they blame me (wow)
Like it's all my fault they ain't caked up
You a grown-ass man, damn, when you gon' wake up?
Turn, 7 to 14, 14 to 28
An O to 62, nigga get up your weight
Learn how to duck the jakes, stack your paper then you're straight

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I tried to help a nigga eat, man it's hard out on the street
Cause I'm kind they think I'm weak (they burn me)
They see the way I grind and they like the way I shine
They want paper like mine (they burn me)
Man they be on some shit when they tryin to hit a lick
Man a motherfucker flip (so they burn me)
You think they won't trip cause you helped 'em from the rip
They ain't loyal to SHIT!

[50 Cent]
She called the cops on me, cause I don't love her like I used to
Tried to fix what was wrong; guess it hurts cause I'm gone
My son he love me but she tryin to poison his mind
Actin like, everything they got ain't come from my grind
I say a prayer for her like "God, please change her heart"
All this hatred at one time is tearin me apart
Man I ain't lookin for trouble, I'm lookin for blessings
But ever since the money came, me I been stressin
Got my ass kicked for bein kind, I can't trust nobody
The closer they get to me the more they take from me
Man, I'm givin all I got to give, I'm tryin to live
They look at me they eyes got dollar signs, they want the kid
to give it all up, fall apart, break down
I ain't got much left, what they wan' take now?
My life? I got so much more to offer
I'ma make 'em watch me be #1 'til I'm done, yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent] + (unknown singer)
They bringin me all, the way dowwwwwn
(Everybody's tryin to bring me all the way down)
And betray me just becauuuuse (betray me) I'm down (just because)
I, don't know, what, to do nowwwww (I don't know what to do)
Me? My loyalty's, what I'm 'bout
Ha ha (that just happens to be what I'm about)
They burn me, over and over and over (over and over again)
Like they doin what they supposed ta
They burn me, goddamn look at how they do me (look at how they do me)
Somebody new tryin to sue me
So they burn me (after all I've done)
So they burn me
(Seems like I can't find a friend, every time they burn)</pre>
