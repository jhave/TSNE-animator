[Intro]
DipSet
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
San-tana, AY
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Tick, tock
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Tick, tock
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)

Get on the grind like clockwork
Move that behind like clockwork
Keep it coming on time like clockwork
Get that clockwork (homie) make that clockwork (shorty)

You hear the sounds of the tick (tick)
You hear the sounds of the tock (tock)
You hear the sounds of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock)
Move to the sound of the tick (tick)
Move to the sound of the tock (tock)
Move to the sound of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock) yep yep

[Juelz Santana]
Now lemme see you get that block work rolling
Lemme see you get that clockwork going
Fiends copping by the clockwork flowing
All day and all night
Till them S.W.A.T. cops rolling
Or that clock, stop, going
Tick, tock, tick, tock, AY
Homie, get on the grind like clockwork
Two for five or a dime, that's clockwork
Shorty
You ain't gettin off the hook that easy
Lemme see that clockwork
She said look that's easy
Move it around, and around, and around, and around like a clock chick
To the sound, of the sound, of the sound of the clock's tick
Tick, tock, tick, tock, AY
Shorty, move that behind like clockwork
And spin around to the sound of how the clock work

[Chorus]
You hear the sounds of the tick (tick)
You hear the sounds of the tock (tock)
You hear the sounds of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock)
Move to the sound of the tick (tick)
Move to the sound of the tock (tock)
Move to the sound of the clock (tick)
(And get it right) (tock) yep yep

Get on the grind like clockwork
Move that behind like clockwork
Keep it coming on time like clockwork
Get that clockwork (homie) make that clockwork (shorty)

[Juelz Santana]
The grind on paper chase
The block on day to day
Listen, I'm always ticking
Like the clock on Flava Flav
I could
Give cock, and don't stop giving
So can you
Wink wop, and don't stop whipping
And just
Make that clockwork (tick), get that clockwork (tock)
Shake that clockwork (tick), flip that clockwork (tock), shorty,
AY, do what you gotta do for that clockwork
Nine to five, side moves for that clockwork
If you a soldier, homie, get you a doja (?) homie
Move the homie, tell him get that clockwork (homie)
AY, teach him how to mix that pot work
Right to left, all day, he'll get that clockwork
Listen
Tick, tock, tick, tock (homie) AY
That's what I call clockwork for ya
Holla at me, I got work for ya
AY

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I mean nigga
If you gettin' money
That's clockwork
If you hustlin', that's clockwork
Bitch, if you out there sellin' ass, that's clockwork
If you out there pimpin' homie, that's clockwork
Holla at me
AY
