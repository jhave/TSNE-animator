(intro)
Senoras y Senores
Directamente de Chicago, Illinois
Los Marijuanos
Aplauso, aplauso  (yeah)

(hook)
Its time to get high (its time to get high)
Its time to get high (its time to get high)
Its time to get high (its time to get high)
Its time to get high (yeah)
It's time to get high!

Verse 1:
Roll up the splif
[?I shoot to give?]
(ugh, ugh) like cannabis sativa I uplift
Get to freestylin' when I get to smokin'
If its true skunk, then hommie I'm chokin'
I pass it on (ugh) I pass it on (ugh)
Like Cheech and Chong (yeah)
Now I'll take a hit from tha bong!
Like Cypress Hill
So what's the deal, hommie chill (what)
Los marijuanos come real
So recognize, realize, legalize
And keep your eyes on the prize
So you can keep on smoking them trees
Take a big hit, to drop you on your knees
True g's (what up) recognize the flame from the rag
Roll up the buds with the [?orange?] Zig Zags
I cannot lie, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I guess its time to get high
(hook)

Verse 2:
Or should I say blaze?
I got the true buddah to put you in a daze
I raise my bowl to the air 
You pack it in, I pack it in
Don't stare, hommie share
[?Mota ferosa?] is greedy
Muthafuckin' pack tha true buds to the needy
Yes indeedy, I pack it in a bowl
Roll it in tha paper, and pop in the [?cnb tapa?]
Now lets ride, cruise
You cant lose, who's got the dolla' for the booze
I got 5 on it! Got it good (ugh)
Do what I could (say wat)
So pour the [?hood?]
I got bass, beats, and the rhymes
Educate myself when I read the High Times
Look at my watch 4:20, oh my
Spark up the joint
Its time to get high
(hook)

Verse 3:
Come on, roll it up, roll it up
Get the fuckin light and
Toke it up, toke it up
I get to cuttin up tha blunts
I got that box of swishers so hommies don't front
Hydroponic, bubonic, supersonic
Its ironic how we's up on it
True skills from tha east (ugh)
I pack it like a beast (yeah)
Beatin up suckas like a feast
Bu-yah, Pony Boy comin 2 ya
Bustin' thru' ya', punk I never knew ya
So act like you know (word)
Go ahead and plant the seed
And let it grow, let it grow
Then smoke up a pound (yeah)
Cuz you know The Marijuanos are down
Its time to say goodbye
But with the words of wisdom
Its time to get high

High!  its time to get high!
High!  its time to get high!</pre>
