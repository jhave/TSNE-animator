[Mr. Sancho]
When I walked in all eyes on me
can't help it cause the light's shining off me
cause I'm blinging in the lounge and VIP
all the women in the house want LPG
we doing some damage in the cabbage causing static
grab my automatic and let these putos have it
we these LPG's and we in the club getting high tonight
I already identified plenty of haters in the sky
before enemies can carry on me on my side
fuck it checking a cutie on the dance floor
pushing that ass up back up
all of my homies and these putos act up
my gat's tucked but I'm just here to have a good time
there's to much pussy up in the place to trip on good times
I'm surrounded by C's D's and double D's
some down ass women that freak me down to they knees

[Mr. Sancho]
as we walked up in this club we don't know who to trust
it's these LPG gangsters who just walked in the club
make a toast to the ladies who be shaking it up
and to the fus in the club don't be hating on us
cause we some playas ready to ride
and we some gangstas ready die
why you mad dog if you can't talk all the shit to my face
bitch you better back off  that's all

[silencer]
Califa Thugs are coming through
people they know what to do
pistol be wasting my time
whenever I step in the room
I'm just kicking back with fine ass ladies
drinking Baccardi to the fullest getting fucked up until tomorrow
baby you tell me you wanna do this
Stupid fools always hate on us
mad cause all the bitches love Califa Thugs
don't you be fuckin around with us cause were down to bust
that means you gonna die if you ain't one of us
these thugs from the streets of S.D
won't hesitate to take you off the list with the quickness
pass the Alysie lets get fucked up
and taking a sip of the bottle you tell me
you wanna get freaky tonight so fuck it
it's a show down in every single town
I tell you once again this is how it goes down
with fine bitches that are down with me
that like to kick it with Califa Thugs in the big S.D

[Mr. Sancho]

[lil bandit]
I keep it gangster no matter how I flip the script
whether I'm in the studio or just cruising the strip
I keep a tight grip on my strap on my hip extra clip
you don't wanna fuck with this Low Pro Gangster shit
you better back up suckas that be acting up
haters out to get us so you know we're always capping
never running alone always running with that LP Gang
better believe it's on better believe holmes we down to bang
a lil badido up in the club taking the thongs off
loving the women shaking their booty sippin Smirnoff
where summer's a dream but for me it comes true
plenty of women under my wing when I walk through
stumbling already cause liquor we drank plenty
and when it comes to hynas homeboy we're getting many
fuck 'em all for free and we don't spend a penny
they come to us in high heels and we send 'em home in tennis
