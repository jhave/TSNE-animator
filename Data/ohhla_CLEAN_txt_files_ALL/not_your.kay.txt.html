[Intro: Joe Budden] + (Fat Joe)
Okay Slay, you called in the right niggaz man
Yeah, JUMP OFF! (Yeah uhh, KaySlizzy)
Joey Crack, I see you out there in the B-X baby!
(Cook coke crack)

[Chorus: Joe]
Sweat is our cologne  we grindin
House-landin homes  we ballin
Duece to the game  we payed 'em
Hits for y'all the same  we bring 'em
Oh my, look what we got
Three boss players chillin in one spot
It's Joe and then we got Joe and then we got Joe
and then - it's whoa-ohhhh-ohhhh

[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uhh, yo, uhh
I gotta be "The Flyest" like my homie from Q-B
Niggaz know the Don be the sickest with jewelry
Niggaz seen the TS piece, and got they weight up
Do you see the size of this charm, Mr. Jacob
Nigga get your cake up, wanna get bling'd out
Whether sky-blue or chinchill, I'm minked out
Down in Miami, bitches say they love me
Niggaz gettin mad cause the bitches wanna fuck me
Always lend an ear when they man ain't listenin
Put somethin mean in they ear to glisten
Put 'em in the kitchen, let 'em get they bake on
Love it how your ass fallin out of the apron
We be makin love on the side of the road
in the back of the Maybach, the curtain is closed
You know how it go, we be laid back puffin the dro
Then it's back to the crib down on Coconut Grove
Youuuu know

[Chorus]

[Joe Budden]
Okay, hold up  baby sweetie, lady darling
It's the, way you treat me; wait nah
It's the way I tap that last, she callin me pat that back
Ah dios mios when I smack that ass
It's that, pimped out demeanor
She pimped out with Senior, it's the good limp with the Nina
How I spit the 'caine game like I came from Yale
How the cops can't hold me, my name is bail
She tryna get up now, and zip to white-on-white Uptowns
to that white from Uptown that got her like what now
Got her tryna wine-dine, grind a little what now
Got her with a eye on eye in every club now
How I'm on the street with the steel
How I ain't gotta play the role; I'm bein myself, just keepin it real
Is it cause I'm givin her somethin that she could feel
Or how I get that change or is it just that name - JOEY!

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Me and you..
Yo' momma and you girlfriends too..
We can take this to recharge..
And maybe we can do a menáge - haha
It ain't shit, man my life's a movie
Keep your mom bitches, man I fuck me a groupie
She let a nigga beat it the back of the staircase
All the bitch need is a blunt and a Pelle, if that

[Joe Budden]
Dudes wonder why I'm M.I.A.
It's cause I'm back real quiet on the back of the bike in M-I-A
You can get up out that Hyundai boo
Lookin like she off the runway too
Meet me at the crib you can come straight through
Never shoes or pumps, straight boots like she strip at Sue's Rendezvous
But oops  come cool with it, what you want do with it?
Joe ma, remember the name and get used to it

[Chorus]

[Joe]
Whoa, whoa-ohhhh, whoa..</pre>
