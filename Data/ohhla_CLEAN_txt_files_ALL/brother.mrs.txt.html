This is dedicated to all my little brothers, little homies, yo check it out

[Verse 1]
Man you 21 now and I still can believe it
Been living on your own, just hard to conceive
That you on the right track, out pursuing that knowledge
But a few years back I couldn't see you in college
You was all out cripping, brought a gun in the house
My first thought was to take it, give you one to the mouth
But never that, we been through way to much
I always tried to give you guidance but not say too much
Tried to lead by example, didn't I have some nerve
Telling you stay out the street while I was out slanging herb
But I always preferred you do it smarter then me
You didn't have to prove nothing being harder then me
You helped mom at the cleaners
Stayed away from misdemeanors
I was proud of you then
Please believe I still am
Don't let the world get you down, throw you off your program
Life is hard, even harder on a young black man
If it gets rough blow a blunt and bump some more slow jams
Know every man with a badge is probably a punk
But don't ever risk your freedom, just to throw one punch
Let a coward be a coward, he has to deal with his past
I know these pigs deserve it but give em a pass
I know you wanna keep it gangster, just do it with class
Above all remember this, no matter how big you get
I'm still your big brother and I can always whoop your ass

[Chorus]
They say a wise man knows nothing, so I know a lot less
But I been where you at homie, put to the test
The answer lies deep within, so open your chest
And find God within yourself and he'll show you the rest
I know the world is against you and your going through stress
But long as you still breathing God, and know you been blessed
The only sin is giving up, there's no need to confess
Find a God within yourself and he'll show you the rest

[Verse 2]
Now take that doo-rag off when you get in my ride
Man that shit aint fresh, you're supposed to wear it inside
Not under bandannas or under a cap
I might be getting old but I don't understand that
You want your hoodie on or off, please make up your mind
Trapped in a rap video, losing your mind
Getting lost through someone else helps you find yourself
I guess that's how it works
I seen this kid the other day with murder written on his shirt
And never been to a funeral
Now am I out of touch, if I say it's unusual
This dude will sing a love ballad to his homeboys, before a young lady
Now aint that crazy
If you didn't love that bitch then why you make her keep your baby
Ooh abortions not right
But just the other night
You were a killer pull a trigger before you have a fare fight
But if you value one, then why not value every life
Its obvious you know the difference between wrong and right
Its not about being self, its hard to follow the light
When you're surrounded by darkness, almost drowning in evil
Been searching for some help but still aint found no real people
Here's a shout, know we out here, we struggling too
Some of us do it legal; some will thug our way through
We got to fight to show the world that our youth are intelligent
So keep it gangster in your CD changer, not your residence

[Chorus]

They say a wise man knows nothing, so I know a lot less
But I been where you at homie, put to the test
The answer lies deep within, so open your chest
And find God within yourself and he'll show you the rest
I know the world is against you and your going through stress
But long as you still breathing God, and know you been blessed
The only sin is giving up, there's no need to confess
Find a God within yourself and he'll show you the rest</pre>
